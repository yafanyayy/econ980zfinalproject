Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.

I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also all of my references to revenue and costs will be in local currency unless otherwise noted as this is a much better indicator of business trend. 
For the first quarter, our earnings per share were $0.19. The first quarter came in at the high end of our December guidance, which was $0.15 to $0.19 per share. The $0.02 per share improvement versus the midpoint of our December guidance was driven primarily by $0.04 of favorability in a variety of cost areas, partially offset by higher-than-expected fuel prices which caused an additional $0.02. 
Now let's look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5% for the first quarter with substantially all of the increase coming from our European, Australian and Asian brand or as we call them, our EAA brand. Our EAA brands grew 11% while our North American brands grew 2%. 
Our net revenue yields increased 2% in the first quarter, driven by a net ticket yield increase of 3%. Our EAA brands were up 9% as a result of yield improvements in South America. The South America market has rebounded nicely from last year's challenging season which was impacted by significant increases in industry capacity. 
Our North American brands were down 1% driven by lower yields in the Caribbean due to the higher industry capacity, which we discussed in the last conference call, and is limited to winter deployment. In net onboard and other yields, we experienced a 1% decline. The decrease resulted from favorable items we recognized in the first quarter of last year related to minimum guarantee payments for calendar year 2009 and a litigation settlement. We mentioned these items during the first quarter conference call last year. 
If we normalized the prior year for these items, net onboard and other yields for the first quarter would have been up 3%. On the cost side, net cruise cost excluding fuel for available lower berth day were up 3% versus the prior year. However, if you exclude the gain on the sale of P&O Cruises Artemis, which reduced net cruise cost last year by $44 million, the net cruise cost excluding fuel per ALBD would have been in line with the prior year. 
Fuel prices this quarter were up 9% and that cost us about $0.05 per share. In summary, we were pleased with the first quarter EPS of $0.19, which is up from last year's adjusted EPS of $0.12 before the favorable impact of $0.10 of unusual items. 
Now turning to our 2011 outlook. I will skip the full year outlook. I'll skip the revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year come net cruise cost excluding fuel per ALBD are forecasted to be flat to up 1%. This guidance is about 0.5 percentage point than we forecasted in December. We are seeing some more inflationary pressures than we thought in crew travel, food cost, freight and other areas. Most of these items were simply a function of rising fuel and commodity prices. However, our current guidance for interest expense, taxes and depreciation is lower, which balances out the additional inflationary pressures. 
One final note I wanted to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that current fuel prices and currency can have on our results. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel for the remaining three quarters of 2011 represents a $0.22 per share impact. With respect to FX movement, a 10% change in all currencies relative to the U.S. dollar but also for the remaining three quarters of 2011 would also impact our P&L by $0.22 per share. 
At this point, I will turn the call back to Howard."
258823,128320063,111947,"Carnival Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2011",2011-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Taking a look at the overall booking picture for the remainder of 2011. The fleetwide basis, occupancies are slightly lower than a year ago on a 5% increase in cruise capacity for the next three quarters. Ticket pricing for these booking",1460,"Thank you, David. Taking a look at the overall booking picture for the remainder of 2011. The fleetwide basis, occupancies are slightly lower than a year ago on a 5% increase in cruise capacity for the next three quarters. Ticket pricing for these bookings are nicely higher than last year. 
Looking at this picture by major markets, north American occupancy is slightly behind last year with a nicely higher pricing. Bookings for Europe, Asia, Australia or EAA are also slightly behind last year and higher prices. So that is a snapshot of the fleetwide bookings that as we reconciled in 2011 as it stands today. 
Turning to booking patterns since at the start of the year on a fleetwide basis, bookings have been running higher year-over-year at higher prices. In North America, weighed bookings have paced the increase in North American capacity with solid increases in year-over-year pricing. 
In EAA, bookings have also been higher during this way period at approximately the same year-over-year prices but the booking pace has lagged the 8.6% capacity increase for the period. EAA bookings and pricing during this period have been affected by the recent disruptions in the European brands, the Middle East and North African itineraries for the remainder of the year. The result of political unrest in that area of the world, it was a significant slowdown and demand for these itineraries with related effect on booking volumes and pricing. Over 280 cruises have been to be reset and we estimate the cost of this disruption to our business will be approximately $44 million of lost revenue or about a nickel a share for the year. 
So summarizing the booking pattern during the way season so far, demand for our cruises continues to be strong. At this time, stronger in North America than in the EAA markets. The EAA brand in particular, Costa and Ibero Cruises have felt the effects of the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa and the related disruptions to the itineraries which are related to these countries. 
In terms of our revised guidance for 2011, the effect of the increase in fuel prices has cost us $355 million or $0.45 per share. Currency exchange rates have benefited us by $0.09 per share. Cost of disruptions in the itineraries which call in the Middle East and North Africa is approximately a nickel a share. These factors have cost us to take our earnings guidance down for 2011 to a range of $2.55 to $2.65 a share or midpoint of $2.60. 
Now some color on each of the course. Fleetwide capacity in the second quarter of 2011 will be 5% higher, 2.9% in North America, France and 8.6% for EAA brands. On a fleetwide basis, occupancies are at approximately the same levels as last year and local currency pricing is higher than a year ago. 
At this juncture, we only have a small amount of inventory left to sell in the second quarter. North American brands are 55% in the Caribbean with the balance in various other itineraries. Currently, pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago with occupancies at the same level. Caribbean pricing has shown improvement from the first quarter and is down only slightly from last year's second quarter Caribbean prices. Pricing for the various other North American brand itineraries, including shoulder Alaska and Europe seasons and most other itineraries is higher than a year ago. 
For EAA brands, they are 54%. In European itineraries, up slightly from a year ago with the balance in various other itineraries. Local currency ticket pricing for EAA brand cruises in Europe is slightly higher than a year ago. Pricing for EAA brands varies other itineraries taken together is also slightly higher than last year. 
From an overall standpoint to summarize the second quarter, we are forecasting the fleetwide local currency revenue yields will be higher for both North America and EAA brands, booking momentum and pricing particularly for EAA brands slowed somewhat during the way season as a result of the political unrest as I have previously discussed, notwithstanding the voyage disruption resulted from the political unrest. We are forecasting European brand yields to be higher than a year ago but not as high as we originally expected. 
Second quarter guidance is affected as following: Fleetwide revenue yields on a local currency basis for the second quarter are now expected to be 1.5% to 2.5% higher than a year ago, this is slightly lower than our early expectations as the result of the itinerary disruptions I previously referred to. Fuel price increases are expected to result in $140 million or $0.18 per share of higher fuel cost compared to the second quarter of 2010.  Costs other than fuel are forecasted to be higher in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter due to a variety of factors, some of which David previously discussed and described in the first quarter. Taken all these factors together, the second quarter 2011 earnings guidance will be in a range of $0.24, down from $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2010. 
Now turning to the third quarter. Capacity on third quarter is expected to increase by 4.8% to 3.4% in North America and 7.2% for EAA brands. Third quarter booking patterns are progressing quite well with fleetwide pricing well ahead of last year at lower occupancies. North American brand capacity for the third quarter was 36% in the Caribbean, down slightly from 41% last year. 25% in Europe, an increase from 17% last year, which is almost an 50% increase or about 50%. And 24% in Alaska, which is about the same as last year. Pricing for all North American brand itineraries in the third quarter is well ahead of last year with particularly higher occupancy and pricing in this year's Alaska season. Pricing for North American brands in Europe is also ahead of last year and lower occupancies, which is not surprising given the approximate increase in European capacity for our North American brands in the summer. 
Caribbean pricing for the third quarter is higher than a year ago, also on lower occupancies. This is a refreshing change for our Caribbean program given the challenge ahead during the first and second quarter. 
For EAA, brand capacity is 88% in European itineraries. The EAA pricing is nicely ahead of last year and slightly lower occupancies notwithstanding the challenges resulting from the political unrest in the Middle East and Western Africa. As mentioned earlier, the EAA bookings in the last five to six weeks have been challenging as some booking momentum lost as a result of the itinerary issues in this region of the world. Now that itineraries for these cruises have been reestablished and are in the marketplace, we believe the booking momentum will start to pick up again. 
On overall basis, we are forecasting fleetwide pricing for the third quarter to be up nicely for both North America and EAA business segments. For the fourth quarter, on a fleetwide basis, capacity is up 5.9%, 3.3% for North America brands and 10.1% for EAA brands. Pricing on a fleetwide basis is nicely higher year-over-year with a similar pattern to the third quarter occupancies are lower than last year, which is also consistent with the pattern that we are experiencing in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter booking picture is encouraging but it's early in the booking cycle, so I caution not to read too much into the fourth quarter booking picture at this time. North American brands are 42% and the Caribbean down from 50% last year. 14% in Europe 9% up from 9% last year. And 10% in Orient and Pacific cruises, which is about the same as last year. 
Pricing across North American brand itineraries is running higher than last year and slightly higher occupancies across the fleet. EAA brands of 72% in Europe up from 65% last year with the balance in various other itineraries. Pricing for European cruises is nicely higher year-over-year with pricing for the various other itineraries taken together also higher on a year-over-year basis. 
Occupancies are lower for European itineraries, which is not surprising given the 20% increase in European brand employment for the fourth quarter. It's still early to have a more precise picture for fleetwide fourth quarter pricing on. A fleetwide basis we are currently forecasting local currency revenue yields will be nicely higher in the fourth quarter. 
And so that kind of summarizes what the yield outlook for the remainder of the year look like at the current time. And with that, I'll turn it back to Kyle, I'll turn call back to you for questions for the people of the call then."

It's something that I think is not an issue in the U.S. the way it used to be and has been dealt out with in the U.S. in different ways. So I think you have to look at the U.K. as a unique market where the brands felt that they have to get a good control of their pricing and took this kind of action. I think in the long run, they believe and I think the major retail travel agents that they've negotiated and talked to believe, that this will be in the best interest of everybody. But we shouldn't look beyond the U.K., it's not a model that we will be looking at anywhere else"

Is it just a strategic move given the pent-up demand for travel amongst consumers that you're better off holding these prices here and then filling them in as you get closer to booking?"

As far as rising for the summer, yes. I think because we've been able to achieve higher prices, we have been holding out for those higher prices and that's what you are seeing a little bit lower occupancies to compensate for those higher prices, but that's versus last year. We obviously fell last year and the feeling is that we can hold out for the pricing hopefully for this year."

As far as of interest expense is concerned, again, we saw favorability in the first quarter and we flow that into more through the year. For things like we went back to a few banks, we ask them to lower the interest rate on some of our loans because quite honestly, margins have come in over the last year or so. We're using the CP margin more aggressively, which is cheaper than our revolver and so we took that in. And we also reevaluated our income taxes. We had a pretty substantial increase in our income tax expense from 2010 to 2011 in our December guidance. And now, that we got a little bit more experienced during the first quarter and have a better picture in the year, we just evaluated that. We took it down but we still are up versus the prior year in terms of income taxes. So all of that as I said before kind of offset some of the inflationary pressures in cruise cost."

Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release.

I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also all of my references to revenue and costs will be in local currency unless otherwise noted, as this is a much better indicator of business trend. 
For the first quarter, our earnings per share were $0.19. The first quarter came in at the high end of our December guidance, which was $0.15 to $0.19 per share. The $0.02 per share improvement versus the midpoint of our December guidance was driven primarily by $0.04 of favorability in a variety of cost areas, partially offset by higher-than-expected fuel prices which caused an additional $0.02. 
Now let's look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5% for the first quarter, with substantially all of the increase coming from our European, Australian and Asian brands, or as we call them, our EAA brand. Our EAA brands grew 11% while our North American brands grew 2%. 
Our net revenue yields increased 2% in the first quarter, driven by a net ticket yield increase of 3%. Our EAA brands were up 9% as a result of yield improvements in South America. The South American market has rebounded nicely from last year's challenging season, which was impacted by significant increases in industry capacity. 
Our North American brands were down 1%, driven by lower yields in the Caribbean due to higher industry capacity, which we discussed on the last conference call, and is limited to winter deployment. In net onboard and other yields, we experienced a 1% decline. The decrease resulted from favorable items we recognized in the first quarter of last year related to minimum guarantee payments for calendar year 2009 and a litigation settlement. We mentioned these items during the first quarter conference call last year. If we normalize the prior year for these items, net onboard and other yields for the first quarter would have been up 3%. 
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, per available lower berth day were up 3% versus the prior year. However, if you exclude the gain on the sale of P&O Cruises' Artemis, which reduced net cruise costs last year by $44 million, the net cruise costs, excluding fuel, per ALBD would have been in line with the prior year. Fuel prices this quarter were up 9%, and that cost us about $0.05 per share. 
In summary, we were pleased with the first quarter EPS of $0.19, which is up from last year's adjusted EPS of $0.12 before the favorable impact of $0.10 of unusual items. 
Now turning to our 2011 outlook. I will skip the full year outlook. I'll skip the net revenue yields, as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, per ALBD are forecasted to be flat to up 1%. This guidance is about 0.5 percentage point higher than we forecasted in December. We're seeing some more inflationary pressures than we thought in crew travel, food cost, freight and other areas. Most of these items are simply a function of rising fuel and commodity prices. However, our current guidance for interest expense, taxes and depreciation is lower, which balances out the additional inflationary pressures. 
One final note. I wanted to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that current fuel prices and currency can have on our results. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel for the remaining three quarters of 2011 represents a $0.22 per share impact. With respect to FX movement, a 10% change in all currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, also for the remaining three quarters of 2011, would also impact our P&L by $0.22 per share. 
At this point, I will turn the call back to Howard."
258823,128320063,112018,"Carnival Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2011",2011-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, David.

On a fleetwide basis, occupancies are slightly lower than a year ago on a 5% increase in cruise capacity for the next three quarters. Ticket pricing for these bookin",1464,"Thank you, David. Taking a look at the overall booking picture for the remainder of 2011. On a fleetwide basis, occupancies are slightly lower than a year ago on a 5% increase in cruise capacity for the next three quarters. Ticket pricing for these bookings are nicely higher than last year. 
Looking at this picture by major markets, North American occupancy is slightly behind last year, with nicely higher pricing. Bookings for Europe, Asia or Australia, or EAA, are also slightly behind last year at higher prices. So that is the snapshot of the fleetwide bookings status for 2011 as it stands today. 
Turning to booking patterns since the start of the year. On a fleetwide basis, bookings have been running higher year-over-year at higher prices. In North America, wave bookings have paced the increase North America capacity with solid increases in year-over-year pricing. 
In EAA, bookings have also been higher during this wave period at approximately the same year-over-year prices, but the booking pace has lagged the 8.6% capacity increase for the period. EAA bookings and pricing during this period have been affected by the recent disruptions in the European brands, the Middle East and North African itineraries for the remainder of the year. As a result of political unrest in that area of the world, there was significant slowdown in demand for these itineraries with the related effect on booking volumes and pricing. Over 280 cruises had to be reset, and we estimate the cost of this disruption to our business will be approximately $44 million of lost revenue, or about $0.05 a share for the year. 
So summarizing the booking pattern during the wave season so far, demand for our cruises continues to be strong. At this time, stronger in North America than in the EAA markets. The EAA brands, in particular Costa and Ibero Cruises, have felt the effects of the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa and the related disruptions to their itineraries which visit these countries. 
In terms of our revised guidance for 2011, the effect of the increase in fuel prices has cost us $355 million, or $0.45 per share. Currency exchange rates have benefited us by $0.09 per share, and the cost of disruption in the itineraries which call on the Middle East and North Africa is approximately $0.05 a share. These factors have caused us to take our earnings guidance down for 2011 to a range of $2.55 to $2.65 a share, or a midpoint of $2.60. 
Now some color on each of the quarters. Fleetwide capacity in the second quarter of 2011 will be 5% higher, 2.9% in North America, France and 8.6% for EAA brands. On a fleetwide basis, occupancies are at approximately the same levels as last year, and local currency pricing is higher than a year ago. At this juncture, we have only a small amount of inventory left to sell in the second quarter. 
North American brands are 55% in the Caribbean, with the balance in various other itineraries. Currently, pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago, with occupancies at the same levels. Caribbean pricing has shown improvement from the first quarter and is down only slightly from last year's second quarter Caribbean prices. Pricing for the various other North American brand itineraries, including shoulder Alaska and Europe seasons, and most other itineraries, is higher than a year ago. 
For EAA brands, they are 54% in European itineraries, up slightly from a year ago, with the balance in various other itineraries. Local currency ticket pricing for EAA-brand cruises in Europe is slightly higher than a year ago. Pricing for EAA brands varies. Other itineraries taken together is also slightly higher than last year. 
From an overall standpoint, to summarize the second quarter, we are forecasting that fleetwide local currency revenue yields will be higher for both North America and EAA brands. Booking momentum and pricing, particularly for EAA brands, slowed somewhat during the wave season as a result of the political unrest that I've previously discussed, notwithstanding the voyage disruption resulting from the political unrest. We are forecasting European brand yields to be higher than a year ago, but not as high as we originally expected. 
Second quarter guidance is affected, as following. Fleetwide revenue yields on a local currency basis for the second quarter are now expected to be 1.5% to 2.5% higher than a year ago. This is slightly lower than our early expectations, largely as a result of the itinerary disruptions I previously referred to. Fuel price increases are expected to result in $140 million, or $0.18 per share, of higher fuel cost compared to the second quarter of 2010. Costs other than fuel are forecasted to be higher in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter due to a variety of factors, some of which David previously discussed and described in the first quarter. 
Taking all of these factors together, second quarter 2011 earnings guidance will be in the range of $0.20 to $0.24, down from $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2010. 
Now turning to the third quarter. Capacity in the third quarter is expected to increase by 4.8%, 3.4% in North America and 7.2% for EAA brands. Third quarter booking patterns are progressing quite well, with fleetwide pricing well ahead of last year at lower occupancies. The North American brand capacity for the third quarter was 36% in the Caribbean, down slightly from 41% last year. 25% in Europe, an increase from 17% last year, which is almost a 50% increase, or about a 50% increase. And 23% in Alaska, which is about the same as last year. 
Pricing for all North American brand itineraries in the third quarter is well ahead of last year, with particularly higher occupancy than pricing in this year's Alaska season. Pricing for North American brands in Europe is also ahead of last year at lower occupancy, which is not surprising, given the approximate 50% increase in European capacity for our North American brands in the summer. 
Caribbean pricing for the third quarter is higher than a year ago, also on lower occupancies. This is a refreshing change for our Caribbean program, given the challenge we've had during the first and second quarter. 
For EAA, brand capacity is 88% in European itineraries. The EAA pricing is nicely ahead of last year at slightly lower occupancies, notwithstanding the challenges resulting from the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. As mentioned earlier, the EAA bookings in the last five to six weeks have been challenging, with some booking momentum lost as a result of the itinerary issues in this region of the world. Now that itineraries for these cruises have been reestablished and are already in the marketplace, we believe the booking momentum will start to pick up again. 
On overall basis, we are forecasting fleetwide pricing for the third quarter to be up nicely for both North America and EAA business segments. 
For the fourth quarter, on a fleetwide basis, capacity is up 5.9%, 3.3% for North America brands and 10.1% for EAA brands. Pricing on a fleetwide basis is nicely higher year-over-year, with a similar pattern to the third quarter. Occupancies are lower than last year, which is also consistent with the pattern that we are experiencing in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter booking picture is encouraging, but it's early in the booking cycle, so I caution not to read too much into the fourth quarter booking picture at this time. North American brands are 42%, and the Caribbean, down from 50% last year; 14% in Europe, up from 9% last year; and 10% in Orient and Pacific cruises, which is about the same as last year. 
Pricing across North American brand itineraries is running higher than last year at slightly higher occupancies across the fleet. EAA brands at 72% in Europe, up from 65% last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Pricing for European cruises is nicely higher year-over-year, with pricing for the various other itineraries taken together also higher on a year-over-year basis. 
Occupancies are lower for European itineraries, which is not surprising, given the 20% increase in European brand employment for the fourth quarter. While it's still early to have a more precise picture for fleetwide fourth quarter pricing, on a fleetwide basis, we are currently forecasting that local currency revenue yields will be nicely higher in the fourth quarter. 
And so that kind of summarizes what the yield outlook for the remainder of the year looks like at the current time. And with that, I'll turn it back to -- Kyle, I'll turn it back to you for questions from the people that have called in."

It's something that, I think, is not an issue in the U.S. the way it used to be, and has been dealt with in the U.S. in different ways. So I think you have to look at the U.K. as a unique market where the brands felt that they have to get control of their pricing and took this kind of action. I think in the long run, they believe, and I think the major retail travel agents that they've negotiated and talked to believe, that this will be in the best interest of everybody. But you shouldn't look beyond the U.K. It's not a model that we'll be looking at anywhere else"

But we're hopeful that once -- now that all the itineraries are out there and people understand it, that, that will settle down and we'll go back to a normal booking pattern. As far as pricing for the summer, yes. I think because we've been able to achieve higher prices, we have been holding out for those higher prices, and that's why you're seeing a little bit lower occupancies to compensate for those higher prices. But that's versus last year. We obviously filled last year, and the feeling is that we can hold out for the prices and still fill this year."

So this is, again, versus our December guidance and -- for instance, in D&A, some of the brands were a little bit aggressive about when they would put some of those maintenance CapEx items into service. And so we saw some favorability in the first quarter, and we reevaluated that and we flowed that through for the year. It's just the timing of when things go into service. As far as the interest expense is concerned, again, we saw favorability in the first quarter, and we flowed that and some more through the year. For things like -- we went back to a few banks, we asked them to lower the interest rate on some of our loans because, quite honestly, margins have come in over the last year or so. We're using the CP market more aggressively, which is cheaper than our revolver. And so we took that in. And we also reevaluated our income taxes. We had a pretty substantial increase in our income tax expense from 2010 to 2011 in our December guidance. And now that we've got a little bit more experience during the first quarter and have a better picture of the year, we just evaluated that. We took it down, but we still are up versus the prior year in terms of income taxes. So all of that, as I said before, kind of offset some of the inflationary pressures in cruise cost."

And if they have chosen to take a cruise to the Holy Land and have now canceled because of these issues, we believe that eventually, that will get rebooked on Costa and Iberocruceros if they're from places like Italy, France and Spain.

Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also all of my references to revenue and cost will be in local",658,"Thank you, Howard. Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also all of my references to revenue and cost will be in local currency unless otherwise noted, as this is a much better indicator of business trend. 
For the first quarter, our earnings per share were $0.19. The first quarter came in at the high end of our December guidance, which was $0.15 to $0.19 per share. The $0.02 per share improvement versus the midpoint of our December guidance was driven primarily by $0.04 of favorability in a variety of cost areas, partially offset by higher-than-expected fuel prices which cost an additional $0.02. 
Now let's look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5% for the first quarter, with substantially all of the increase coming from our European, Australian and Asian brands, or as we call them, our EAA brands. Our EAA brands grew 11% while our North American brands grew 2%. 
Our net revenue yields increased 2% in the first quarter, driven by a net ticket yield increase of 3%. Our EAA brands were up 9% as a result of yield improvements in South America. The South American market has rebounded nicely from last year's challenging season, which was impacted by significant increases in industry capacity. 
Our North American brands were down 1%, driven by lower yields in the Caribbean due to higher industry capacity, which we discussed on the last conference call, and is limited to winter deployment. In net onboard and other yields, we experienced a 1% decline. The decrease resulted from favorable items we recognized in the first quarter of last year related to minimum guarantee payments for calendar year 2009 and a litigation settlement. We mentioned these items during the first quarter conference call last year. If we normalize the prior year for these items, net onboard and other yields for the first quarter would have been up 3%. 
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, per available lower berth day were up 3% versus the prior year. However, if you exclude the gain on the sale of P&O Cruises' Artemis, which reduced net cruise costs last year by $44 million, the net cruise costs, excluding fuel, per ALBD would have been in line with the prior year. Fuel prices this quarter were up 9%, and that cost us about $0.05 per share. 
In summary, we were pleased with the first quarter EPS of $0.19, which is up from last year's adjusted EPS of $0.12 before the favorable impact of $0.10 of unusual items. 
Now turning to our 2011 outlook. I will skip -- the full year outlook. I'll skip the net revenue yields, as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, per ALBD are forecasted to be flat to up 1%. This guidance is about 0.5 percentage point higher than we forecasted in December. We're seeing some more inflationary pressures than we thought in crew travel, food cost, freight and other areas. Most of these items are simply a function of rising fuel and commodity prices. However, our current guidance for interest expense, taxes and depreciation is lower, which balances out the additional inflationary pressures. 
One final note. I wanted to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that current fuel prices and currency can have on our results. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel for the remaining three quarters of 2011 represents a $0.22 per share impact. With respect to FX movement, a 10% change in all currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, also for the remaining three quarters of 2011, would also impact our P&L by $0.22 per share. 
At this point, I will turn the call back to Howard."

Bookings for Europe, Asia or Australia, or EAA, are also slightly behind last year at higher prices. So that is the snapshot of the fleet-wide bookings status for 2011 as it stands today. 
Turning to booking patterns since the start of the year. On a fleet-wide basis, bookings have been running higher year-over-year at higher prices. In North America, wave bookings have paced the increased North America capacity with solid increases in year-over-year pricing. 
In EAA, bookings have also been higher during this wave period at approximately the same year-over-year prices, but the booking pace has lagged the 8.6% capacity increase for the period. EAA bookings and pricing during this period have been affected by the recent disruptions in the European brands, the Middle East and North African itineraries for the remainder of the year. As a result of political unrest in that area of the world, there was significant slowdown in demand for these itineraries with the related effect on booking volumes and pricing. Over 280 cruises had to be reset, and we estimate the cost of this disruption to our business will be approximately $44 million of lost revenue or about $0.05 a share for the year. 
So summarizing the booking pattern during the wave season so far, demand for our cruises continues to be strong. At this time, stronger in North America than in the EAA markets. The EAA brands, in particular Costa and Ibero Cruises, have felt the effects of the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa and the related disruptions to their itineraries which visit these countries. 
In terms of our revised guidance for 2011, the effect of the increase in fuel prices has cost us $355 million or $0.45 per share. Currency exchange rates have benefited us by $0.09 per share, and the cost of disruption in the itineraries which call on the Middle East and North Africa is approximately $0.05 a share. These factors have caused us to take our earnings guidance down for 2011 to a range of $2.55 to $2.65 a share or a midpoint of $2.60. 
Now some color on each of the quarters. Fleet-wide capacity in the second quarter of 2011 will be 5% higher, 2.9% in North America, France and 8.6% for EAA brands. On a fleet-wide basis, occupancies are at approximately the same levels as last year, and local currency pricing is higher than a year ago. At this juncture, we have only a small amount of inventories left to sell in the second quarter. 
North American brands are 55% in the Caribbean, with the balance in various other itineraries. Currently, pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago, with occupancies at the same levels. Caribbean pricing has shown improvement from the first quarter and is down only slightly from last year's second quarter Caribbean prices. Pricing for the various other North American brand itineraries, including shoulder Alaska and Europe seasons and most other itineraries, is higher than a year ago. 
For EAA brands, they are 54% in European itineraries, up slightly from a year ago, with the balance in various other itineraries. Local currency ticket pricing for EAA-brand cruises in Europe is slightly higher than a year ago. Pricing for EAA brands vary. Its other itineraries taken together is also slightly higher than last year. 
From an overall standpoint, to summarize the second quarter, we are forecasting that fleet-wide local currency revenue yields will be higher for both North America and EAA brands. Booking momentum and pricing, particularly for EAA brands, slowed somewhat during the wave season as a result of the political unrest that I previously discussed, notwithstanding the voyage disruptions resulting from the political unrest. We are forecasting European brand yields to be higher than a year ago, but not as high as we originally expected. 
Second quarter guidance is affected, as following. Fleet-wide revenue yields on a local currency basis for the second quarter are now expected to be 1.5% to 2.5% higher than a year ago. This is slightly lower than our early expectations, largely as a result of the itinerary disruptions I previously referred to. Fuel price increases are expected to result in $140 million, or $0.18 per share, of higher fuel cost compared to the second quarter of 2010. Costs other than fuel are forecasted to be higher in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter due to a variety of factors, some of which David previously discussed and described in the first quarter. 
Taking all of these factors together, second quarter 2011 earnings guidance will be in the range of $0.20 to $0.24, down from $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2010. 
Now turning to the third quarter. Capacity in the third quarter is expected to increase by 4.8%, 3.4% in North America and 7.2% for EAA brands. Third quarter booking patterns are progressing quite well, with fleet-wide pricing well ahead of last year at lower occupancies. The North American brand capacity for the third quarter was 36% in the Caribbean, down slightly from 41% last year. 25% in Europe, an increase from 17% last year, which is almost a 50% increase, or about a 50% increase. And 23% in Alaska, which is about the same as last year. 
Pricing for all North American brand itineraries in the third quarter is well ahead of last year, with particularly higher occupancy than pricing in this year's Alaska season. Pricing for North American brands in Europe is also ahead of last year at lower occupancy, which was not surprising, given the approximate 50% increase in European capacity for our North American brands in the summer. 
Caribbean pricing for the third quarter is higher than a year ago, also on lower occupancies. This is a refreshing change for our Caribbean programs, given the challenges we've had during the first and second quarter. 
For EAA, brand capacity is 88% in European itineraries. The EAA pricing is nicely ahead of last year at slightly lower occupancies, notwithstanding the challenges resulting from the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. As mentioned earlier, the EAA bookings in the last five to six weeks have been challenging, with some booking momentum lost as a result of the itinerary issues in this region of the world. Now that itineraries for these cruises have been reestablished and are in the marketplace, we believe the booking momentum will start to pick up again. 
On overall basis, we are forecasting fleet-wide pricing for the third quarter to be up nicely for both North America and EAA business segments. 
For the fourth quarter, on a fleet-wide basis, capacity is up 5.9%, 3.3% for North America brands and 10.1% for EAA brands. Pricing on a fleet-wide basis is nicely higher year-over-year, with a similar pattern to the third quarter. Occupancies are lower than last year, which is also consistent with the pattern that we are experiencing in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter booking picture is encouraging, but it's early in the booking cycle, so I caution not to read too much into the fourth quarter booking picture at this time. North American brands are 42%, and the Caribbean, down from 50% last year; 14% in Europe, up from 9% last year; and 10% in Orient and Pacific cruises, which is about the same as last year. 
Pricing across North American brand itineraries is running higher than last year at slightly lower occupancies across the fleet. EAA brands at 72% in Europe, up from 65% last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Pricing for European cruises is nicely higher year-over-year, with pricing for the various other itineraries taken together also higher on a year-over-year basis. 
Occupancies are lower for European itineraries, which is not surprising, given the 20% increase in European brand deployment for the fourth quarter. While it's still early to have a more precise picture for fleet-wide fourth quarter pricing, on a fleet-wide basis, we are currently forecasting that local currency revenue yields will be nicely higher in the fourth quarter. 
And so that kind of summarizes what the yield outlook for the remainder of the year looks like at the current time. And with that, I'll turn it back to -- Kyle, I'll turn it back to you for questions from the people that have called in."

I think Alaska, based on the agreements we reached with the governor last year, lower head taxes and much higher marketing spend by the state of Alaska has really helped.

So it creates a difficult -- until it settles down, it's difficult to gauge what's going on. I can say this much is, historically, we’ve found that Europeans believe their vacations are very important to them. And if they have chosen to take a cruise to the Holy Land and have now canceled because of these issues, we believe that eventually, they’ll get rebooked on Costa and Iberocruceros if they're from places like Italy, France and Spain because these people will take their vacation.

Before I begin, please note, as some of our remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking, I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release.

Before I begin, please note, as some of our remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking, I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and costs will be in local currency unless otherwise noted, as this is a much better indicator of business trends. 
For the second quarter, our earnings per share was $0.26. The second quarter came in $0.04 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The $0.04 per share improvement was driven by $0.02 from cruise operations as net revenue yields and net cruise costs were generally in line with expectations. We also picked up $0.02 from a few miscellaneous nonoperating items. 
Now let's look at our second quarter results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5% for the second quarter of 2011, with the majority of the increase coming from our European, Australian and Asian brands, or as we call them, our EAA brands. Our EAA brands grew 9%, while our North American brands grew only 3%. Our net revenue yields increased 2% in the second quarter, with similar increases in both net ticket and net onboard and other revenue yield. 
Net ticket yields increased 2%. The North American brand, however, were up 3%. Let me give you some color by itinerary for the North American brand. The Caribbean itineraries were flat for the second quarter, which was consistent with our expectation. However, this does represent some sequential improvement. As we talked in the first quarter, the Caribbean itineraries were down. We did expect that the Caribbean pricing pressure would ease as the year progressed, and so far, we are on track. All other itineraries for the North American brands were up except Europe, which was impacted by the conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, commonly referred to as MENA. 
Our EAA brands were up 1% for the quarter. Their itineraries outside of Europe were up, particularly the Caribbean and other exotics. However, as previously announced, the European itineraries were down as they felt the impact of MENA. 
Net onboard and other yields also increased 2%. The increase here was also driven by our North American brands as our EAA brands were also impacted by MENA itinerary changes in the form of lower shore excursion revenue. 
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per available lower berth day, were up 3% versus the prior year. We saw inflationary pressures in food costs, crew travel and other hotel costs that were anticipated and discussed on our last conference call. 
In summary, the second quarter EPS was $0.26 per share versus the $0.32 we reported last year. However, fuel prices were up 35%, costing us an additional $0.19 per share. Therefore, excluding fuel prices, our EPS for the second quarter would have been up $0.13 versus the prior year. 
Turning to our 2011 outlook. I'll skip the net revenue yield outlook as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year net cruise costs, excluding fuel per available lower berth day, are forecasted to be flat to up 1%, which is the same as our March guidance. 
One final note. I'll share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact of fuel prices and currency on our results for the remainder of the year. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel for the remaining half of 2011 represents a $0.14 per share impact. And with respect to FX, a 10% change in all currencies relative to the U.S. dollar for the remaining half of 2011 would impact our P&L by $0.16 per share. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Howard."

So now, I'll go into a little bit of history, but talk more about how the history is going to affect our outlook for the second half of the year. As we've previously announced, second quarter business trends were more challenging than we",2019,"Thank you, David. So now, I'll go into a little bit of history, but talk more about how the history is going to affect our outlook for the second half of the year. As we've previously announced, second quarter business trends were more challenging than we expected, especially for our European brand companies. At the time of our March guidance, we clearly underestimated the impact of the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa would have on our business for the remainder of the year. While we got the estimates right for the second quarter, which was close in, we significantly missed our estimates for the impact of the MENA events for the second half of the year. And to a lesser extent, our revenues were also affected by the unfortunate events in Japan, which had just occurred at the time of our March earnings call and was too early to know how and to what extent these events would affect our business in that part of the world. 
Looking at the picture for the entire company, the fleet-wide reduction in forecasted revenue for the second half of this year cost us approximately $0.20 a share. In broad terms of this amount, approximately $0.17 per share was related to MENA and other European brand softness. Approximately $0.02 was North American brand reduced pricing for European sailings and $0.01 per share for Japan. 
At Costa Cruise Lines, the establishing of new itineraries for 280 sailings in order to avoid calling at MENA ports was far more disruptive to their business than originally thought. Costa was of significant commitment to MENA ports of call in 2011, was by far the most affected of our companies. Other brands were also affected by MENA but to a much lesser degree. 
We had expected that once the new itineraries were announced, we would experience a period of cancellations and rebookings for the newly redesigned cruises, and that over time, pricing would stabilize. Reselling of these cruises was far more challenging than expected, and we were eventually forced to reduce pricing for the summer and fall season to stimulate demand. 
Although difficult to quantify, bookings for the non-MENA-affected European cruises were also affected by the lower prices offered for the redesigned MENA cruises. European brand bookings unrelated to MENA itineraries also appear to have been affected by the weak economies in France, Italy and Spain, the main markets in which they sell into. This, coupled with a significant increase in Mediterranean capacity this year by European and U.S. cruise companies, could also have been a factor in the deterioration of European pricing. 
However, the redesigning of the MENA cruises and offering them at greatly reduced prices was clearly the greatest contributor to reduce European revenue yields. Regarding the U.K. market, both P&O Cruises and Cunard experienced a slowdown in bookings during the winter and early spring. The U.K. government's austerity measures introduced during the period caused a major decline in consumer confidence. And we felt this in our U.K. bookings for several months over the winter and early spring, a critical time in our booking period. In order to stimulate demand, prices were reduced, as were the revenue forecast for the U.K. However, I'm pleased to say that more recently, consumer confidence has rebounded in the U.K., and our booking patterns in May and June have stabilized. 
For the North American brands in the second half of the year, we did experience some impact from MENA sailings, and to a lesser degree, sailings around Japan, especially for our premium-priced cruise lines, which have had a number of sailings in those parts of the world. Most of the reduced North American revenue forecast relates to MENA and Japan, with the balance attributable to lower-than-expected pricing for Mediterranean cruises. This was partially offset by better-than-expected pricing in Alaska and other cruise lines. 
Now turning to the current booking status and recent booking trends. Presently, fleet-wide local currency pricing for the second half bookings is nicely higher, year-over-year, more significantly so for North American brands and slightly higher for EAA brands. Occupancies for the second half of the year are lower, slightly lower for North American brands and lower for EAA brands. 
Looking at the booking window over the last 6 weeks, however, the picture is showing solid improvement on a fleet-wide basis, with booking volume significantly higher year-over-year for North America and EAA, and with stronger pricing for the North America brands and lower pricing for EAA brands. This is consistent with my previous comments and our current forecast for EAA brand revenue. 
We view the MENA disruptions in 2011 as a significant and unusual event in our business. While our business is global, with our fleets sailing around the world, we, of course, recognize that our business is subject to the risk of political unrest in those countries to which we sail, and we provide a factor for that in setting our revenue forecast and earnings guidance. However, the magnitude of the MENA events in 2011 on our business was unprecedented and could not have been anticipated. 
With regard to the European markets, the European consumer has been quite resilient in the past, and we believe Europe continues to represent an excellent growth market for our business. Perhaps the silver lining in all this is our North American brands, which have continued to perform well despite the less-than-robust U.S. economy. We are greatly encouraged with the recent strength of our North American brand performances here, but it's from a booking standpoint, which bodes well for our 2012 business outlook. 
Now turning to our full year earnings guidance for 2011. As we indicated in our press release, we are now guiding earnings to $2.40 to $2.50 a share or a midpoint of $2.45. This represents a $0.15 lower earnings guidance than that provided in our first quarter earnings guidance in March. The principal reasons for the change as we've previously indicated are reduced revenues in the second half of the year of approximately $0.20 per share, primarily from the impact of MENA. Some of the reduced revenue is offset by cost savings, as well as certain nonoperating items of approximately $0.05 a share. 
Given the recent reductions in fuel prices, we are now estimating that fuel cost, net of currency exchange benefit, is unchanged for the rest of the year. So the net of all this amounts to $0.15 a share reduction on our guidance to the midpoint of $2.45 from $2.60 previously. 
Now let me take you through some of the color for each of the next 3 quarters. Turning to the third quarter, capacity in the third quarter is expected to increase by 4.8%, 3.3% of that is in North America, 7.2% for EAA brands. On a fleet-wide basis, third quarter occupancies are running slightly behind last year, with fleet-wide local currency pricing nicely ahead year-over-year despite the challenges in Europe. That's the current picture. 
For North American brand, capacity in the third quarter was 36% in the Caribbean, which is down from 41% last year. 25% in Europe, an increase from 17% last year, and 23% in Alaska, which is about the same as last year. Pricing for North American brand business in the third quarter is well ahead of last year on the same year-over-year occupancies. And booking volumes for the last 6 weeks have been strong, with very little inventory left to sell. More specifically, pricing for Alaska itineraries is running significantly higher than last year. Pricing for Caribbean itineraries is slightly better than a year ago, which is a nice improvement from the first half of the year. And pricing for North American brand European itineraries is lower than a year ago for the reasons I've previously discussed. Taking this all together, we are forecasting that North American brand pricing for the third quarter will be nicely higher than a year ago. 
Moving over to the EAA brand, capacity is 83%. EAA brand capacity is 83% in European itineraries. At the present time, EAA local currency pricing is slightly ahead of last year on local -- on lower occupancies. EAA brand bookings over the last 6 weeks have been strong, with pricing running lower than a year ago. Despite all the challenges in Europe, we are currently forecasting that EAA revenues will come in only slightly lower than last year by the time the third quarter closes. 
Looking at this on a fleet-wide basis, we are forecasting third quarter local currency yields to be higher in the 1% to 2% range, driven by the stronger North American brand yields. 
Turning now to the fourth quarter. On a fleet-wide basis, capacity is up 5.8%, 3.2% in North America, 10% for EAA brands. Local currency pricing on a fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter is nicely higher year-over-year, a similar pattern to the third quarter. Occupancies are lower than last year, slightly lower for North American brands and lower for EAA brands. 
North American brands are 42% in the Caribbean and down from 50% last year. 14% in Europe versus 9% last year, and 10% in Orient Pacific, which is about the same as last year, the balance of the itineraries and various other places. Pricing for North American brand itineraries in the fourth quarter is nicely higher than a year ago, and the booking volume for North American brands in the fourth quarter continues to be strong. By the time the fourth quarter closes, we expect North American brand pricing to be nicely higher. EAA brands is 71% in Europe versus 64% last year, with the balance in other itineraries. 
Fourth quarter local currency pricing for EAA brands at the current time is higher than a year ago, but given the current lower occupancy versus last year, we expect EAA pricing on a local currency basis for the fourth quarter to continue to decline. While booking momentum has picked up, it has been at the lower price points. So by the time the quarter closes, we expect EAA local currency pricing to be lower than a year ago. On an overall fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter, similar to the third quarter, we are forecasting higher local currency revenue yield, driven by the stronger pricings from the North American brands. 
Now turning to the first quarter 2012. For the first quarter of 2012, capacity is 5.5% higher than last year, 4.5% in North America, 7.2% in EAA brands. At the present time, on a fleet-wide basis, local currency pricing is nicely higher, with occupancies running slightly behind last year. 
While the first quarter booking picture is encouraging, it is still early in the bookings cycle, so I caution not to read too much into the first quarter booking picture at this time. For North American brands, we are 65% in the Caribbean, which is about where we were last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on slightly lower occupancies. Pricing for all other itineraries is also higher than a year ago, also at slightly lower occupancies. 
EAA brands are 22% in the Caribbean, but same as last year, 20% in Europe, down from 23% last year. 18% in South America, up slightly from 16% last year and 40% of a variety of other itineraries around the world. For all EAA itineraries taken together, local currency pricing is slightly higher than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies. 
From an overall fleet-wide standpoint, booking volumes and pricings in the last 6 weeks for the first quarter of 2012 have been strong, and at this time, it appears that Q1 is off to a good start. However, please keep in mind, it's still early in the booking process, and we have a long way to go before the first quarter of 2012 is closed. 
So that sort of summarizes the booking status and the booking picture as we go through this period of time. And with that, Tina, I will turn it back over to you, and we'll take some questions."

She's got the industry data. I'm not sure we have it by markets yet. Look, I think in Q1, I think that cost repositioned Q1 of 2012, and I know you want to go beyond Q1. But for Q1, they repositioned a number of cruises away from the Med. They repositioned an additional ship down to South America for this winter end of first quarter, another ship into the Caribbean, all sorts from the European market by the way. And they made a few other itineraries -- and those ships came out -- the knock-on effect is those ships came out of the Middle East or North Africa, so there is less dependence in the first quarter on those itineraries. Going into the second and third quarters, it's still early. I had a conversation with the Costa people this morning about it. They're still watching it. Those itineraries are still tending to be a little bit soft so further out, they may have to do some other things. But right now, they feel pretty confident that if things don't get any worse in that area of the world, that they will stay with the current plan. If they see booking momentum falling off, they will have to consider making some changes. But the benefit -- what happened this year, as I think a lot of the changes that were made were made during wave season, or towards the end of -- mid and end of wave season, which was strong booking periods for us. And as you get into the weaker booking periods of April, May and June, it became more difficult for them to catch up. I think if they have -- they have the ability now to make these decisions and be a little bit more agile knowing what they're up against, and so it's possible they may make some other changes. But I think it will be -- give them sufficient time, once they make those changes, to get those itineraries out. So I think they feel much more comfortable in terms of at least having a better sense as to what their revenue yield picture is going to look like from those programs in 2012. But it's still very, very early for a second quarter and summer. We don't -- I don't have any picture of the summer at all right now, to be honest with you. So I don't even see that."

It is very complicated, and it's not -- there's no easy answer to that other than they look to optimize their revenue by going into those itineraries and those trades. That will give them the best possible revenue yield. I should also say this though, that often, the decision on revenue yield, it's not just solely a revenue yield decision, it's an operating income decision for that particular program so that they look at fuel costs as well in terms of coming down to an operating margin that makes the most sense. So they tend to look at the operating margin first and then revenue yield as a function of that more. So that's what's more focused on."

Before I begin, please note, as some of our remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking, I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release.

Before I begin, please note, as some of our remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking, I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and costs will be in local currency unless otherwise noted, as this is a much better indicator of business trends. 
For the second quarter, our earnings per share was $0.26. The second quarter came in $0.04 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The $0.04 per share improvement was driven by $0.02 from cruise operations as net revenue yields and net cruise costs were generally in line with expectations. We also picked up $0.02 from a few miscellaneous nonoperating items. 
Now let's look at our second quarter results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5% for the second quarter of 2011, with the majority of the increase coming from our European, Australian and Asian brands, or as we call them, our EAA brands. Our EAA brands grew 9%, while our North American brands grew only 3%. Our net revenue yields increased 2% in the second quarter, with similar increases in both net ticket and net onboard and other revenue yield. 
Net ticket yields increased 2%. The North American brands, however, were up 3%. Let me give you some color by itinerary for the North American brand. The Caribbean itineraries were flat for the second quarter, which was consistent with our expectation. However, this does represent some sequential improvement. As we talked in the first quarter, the Caribbean itineraries were down. We did expect that the Caribbean pricing pressure would ease as the year progressed, and so far, we are on track. All other itineraries for the North American brands were up except Europe, which was impacted by the conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, commonly referred to as MENA. 
Our EAA brands were up 1% for the quarter. Their itineraries outside of Europe were up, particularly the Caribbean and other exotics. However, as previously announced, the European itineraries were down as they felt the impact of MENA. 
Net onboard and other yields also increased 2%. The increase here was also driven by our North American brands as our EAA brands were also impacted by MENA itinerary changes in the form of lower shore excursion revenue. 
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per available lower berth day, were up 3% versus the prior year. We saw inflationary pressures in food costs, crew travel and other hotel costs that were anticipated and discussed on our last conference call. 
In summary, the second quarter EPS was $0.26 per share versus the $0.32 we reported last year. However, fuel prices were up 35%, costing us an additional $0.19 per share. Therefore, excluding fuel prices, our EPS for the second quarter would have been up $0.13 versus the prior year. 
Turning to our 2011 outlook. I'll skip the net revenue yield outlook as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per available lower berth day, are forecasted to be flat to up 1%, which is the same as our March guidance. 
One final note. I'll share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact of fuel prices and currency on our results for the remainder of the year. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel for the remaining half of 2011 represents a $0.14 per share impact. And with respect to FX, a 10% change in all currencies relative to the U.S. dollar for the remaining half of 2011 would impact our P&L by $0.16 per share. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Howard."
258823,134196260,138126,"Carnival Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2011",2011-06-21,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, David. So now, I'll go into a little bit of history, but talk more about how the history is going to affect our outlook for the second half of the year. As we've previously announced, second quarter business trends were more challenging than we",2020,"Thank you, David. So now, I'll go into a little bit of history, but talk more about how the history is going to affect our outlook for the second half of the year. As we've previously announced, second quarter business trends were more challenging than we expected, especially for our European brand companies. At the time of our March guidance, we clearly underestimated the impact that the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa would have on our business for the remainder of the year. While we got the estimates right for the second quarter, which was close in, we significantly missed our estimates for the impact of the MENA events for the second half of the year. And to a lesser extent, our revenues were also affected by the unfortunate events in Japan, which had just occurred at the time of our March earnings call and it was too early to know how and to what extent these events would affect our business in that part of the world. 
Looking at the picture for the entire company, the fleet-wide reduction in forecasted revenue for the second half of this year cost us approximately $0.20 a share. In broad terms, of this amount, approximately $0.17 per share was related to MENA and other European brand softness. Approximately $0.02 was North American brand reduced pricing for European sailings and $0.01 per share for Japan. 
At Costa Cruise Lines, the establishing of new itineraries for 280 sailings in order to avoid calling at MENA ports was far more disruptive to their business than originally thought. Costa was a significant commitment to MENA ports of call in 2011, was by far the most affected of our companies. Other brands were also affected by MENA but to a much lesser degree. 
We had expected that once the new itineraries were announced, we would experience a period of cancellations and rebookings for the newly redesigned cruises, and that over time, pricing would stabilize. Reselling of these cruises was far more challenging than expected, and we were eventually forced to reduce pricing for the summer and fall season to stimulate demand. 
Although difficult to quantify, bookings for the non-MENA-affected European cruises were also affected by the lower prices offered for the redesigned MENA cruises. European brand bookings unrelated to MENA itineraries also appear to have been affected by the weak economies in France, Italy and Spain, the main markets in which they sell into. This, coupled with a significant increase in Mediterranean capacity this year by European and U.S. cruise companies, could also have been a factor in the deterioration of European pricing. 
However, the redesigning of the MENA cruises and offering them at greatly reduced prices was clearly the greatest contributor to reduced European revenue yields. Regarding the U.K. market, both P&O Cruises and Cunard experienced a slowdown in bookings during the winter and early spring. The U.K. government's austerity measures introduced during the period caused a major decline in consumer confidence. And we felt this in our U.K. bookings for several months over the winter and early spring, a critical time in our booking period. In order to stimulate demand, prices were reduced, as was the revenue forecast for the U.K. However, I'm pleased to say that more recently, consumer confidence has rebounded in the U.K., and our booking patterns in May and June have stabilized. 
For the North American brands in the second half of the year, we did experience some impact from MENA sailings, and to a lesser degree, sailings around Japan, especially for our premium-priced cruise lines, which have had a number of sailings in those parts of the world. Most of the reduced North American revenue forecast relates to MENA and Japan, with the balance attributable to lower-than-expected pricing for Mediterranean cruises. This was partially offset by better-than-expected pricing in Alaska and other cruise lines. 
Now turning to the current booking status and recent booking trends. Presently, fleet-wide local currency pricing for the second half bookings is nicely higher, year-over-year, more significantly so for North American brands and slightly higher for EAA brands. Occupancies for the second half of the year are lower, slightly lower for North American brands and lower for EAA brands. 
Looking at the booking window over the last 6 weeks, however, the picture is showing solid improvement on a fleet-wide basis, with booking volume significantly higher year-over-year for North America and EAA, and with stronger pricing for the North America brands and lower pricing for EAA brands. This is consistent with my previous comments and our current forecast for EAA brand revenue. 
We view the MENA disruptions in 2011 as a significant and unusual event in our business. While our business is global, with our fleets sailing around the world, we, of course, recognize that our business is subject to the risk of political unrest in those countries to which we sail, and we provide a factor for that in setting our revenue forecast and earnings guidance. However, the magnitude of the MENA events in 2011 on our business was unprecedented and could not have been anticipated. 
With regard to the European market, the European consumer has been quite resilient in the past, and we believe Europe continues to represent an excellent growth market for our business. Perhaps the silver lining in all this is our North American brands, which have continued to perform well despite the less-than-robust U.S. economy. We are greatly encouraged with the recent strength of our North American brand performances here, that is from a booking standpoint, which bodes well for our 2012 business outlook. 
Now turning to our full year earnings guidance for 2011. As we indicated in our press release, we are now guiding earnings to $2.40 to $2.50 a share or a midpoint of $2.45. This represents a $0.15 lower earnings guidance than that provided in our first quarter earnings guidance in March. The principal reasons for the change as we've previously indicated are reduced revenues in the second half of the year of approximately $0.20 per share, primarily from the impact of MENA. Some of the reduced revenue is offset by cost savings, as well as certain nonoperating items of approximately $0.05 a share. 
Given the recent reductions in fuel prices, we are now estimating that fuel cost, net of currency exchange benefit, is unchanged for the rest of the year. So the net of all this amounts to $0.15 a share reduction on our guidance to the midpoint of $2.45 from $2.60 previously. 
Now let me take you through some of the color for each of the next 3 quarters. Turning to the third quarter, capacity in the third quarter is expected to increase by 4.8%, 3.3% of that is in North America, 7.2% for EAA brands. On a fleet-wide basis, third quarter occupancies are running slightly behind last year, with fleet-wide local currency pricing nicely ahead year-over-year despite the challenges in Europe. That's the current picture. 
For North American brand, capacity in the third quarter was 36% in the Caribbean, which is down from 41% last year. 25% in Europe, an increase from 17% last year, and 23% in Alaska, which is about the same as last year. Pricing for North American brand business in the third quarter is well ahead of last year on the same year-over-year occupancies. And booking volumes for the last 6 weeks have been strong, with very little inventory left to sell. More specifically, pricing for Alaska itineraries is running significantly higher than last year. Pricing for Caribbean itineraries is slightly better than a year ago, which is a nice improvement from the first half of the year. And pricing for North American brand European itineraries is lower than a year ago for the reasons I've previously discussed. Taking this all together, we are forecasting that North American brand pricing for the third quarter will be nicely higher than a year ago. 
Moving over to the EAA brand, capacity is 83%. EAA brand capacity is 83% in European itineraries. At the present time, EAA local currency pricing is slightly ahead of last year on local -- on lower occupancies. EAA brand bookings over the last 6 weeks have been strong, with pricing running lower than a year ago. Despite all the challenges in Europe, we are currently forecasting that EAA revenues will come in only slightly lower than last year by the time the third quarter closes. 
Looking at this on a fleet-wide basis, we are forecasting third quarter local currency yields to be higher in the 1% to 2% range, driven by the stronger North American brand yields. 
Turning now to the fourth quarter. On a fleet-wide basis, capacity is up 5.8%, 3.2% in North America, 10% for EAA brands. Local currency pricing on a fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter is nicely higher year-over-year, a similar pattern to the third quarter. Occupancies are lower than last year, slightly lower for North American brands and lower for EAA brands. 
North American brands are 42% in the Caribbean and down from 50% last year. 14% in Europe versus 9% last year, and 10% in Orient Pacific, which is about the same as last year, the balance of the itineraries in various other places. Pricing for North American brand itineraries in the fourth quarter is nicely higher than a year ago, and the booking volume for North American brands in the fourth quarter continues to be strong. By the time the fourth quarter closes, we expect North American brand pricing to be nicely higher. EAA brands is 71% in Europe versus 64% last year, with the balance in other itineraries. 
Fourth quarter local currency pricing for EAA brands at the current time is higher than a year ago, but given the current lower occupancy versus last year, we expect EAA pricing on a local currency basis for the fourth quarter to continue to decline. While booking momentum has picked up, it has been at the lower price points. So by the time the quarter closes, we expect EAA local currency pricing to be lower than a year ago. On an overall fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter, similar to the third quarter, we are forecasting higher local currency revenue yield, driven by the stronger pricings from the North American brands. 
Now turning to the first quarter 2012. For the first quarter of 2012, capacity is 5.5% higher than last year, 4.5% in North America, 7.2% in EAA brands. At the present time, on a fleet-wide basis, local currency pricing is nicely higher, with occupancies running slightly behind last year. 
While the first quarter booking picture is encouraging, it is still early in the booking cycle, so I caution not to read too much into the first quarter booking picture at this time. For North American brands, we are 65% in the Caribbean, which is about where we were last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on slightly lower occupancies. Pricing for all other itineraries is also higher than a year ago, also at slightly lower occupancies. 
EAA brands are 22% in the Caribbean, but same as last year; 20% in Europe, down from 23% last year; 18% in South America, up slightly from 16% last year; and 40% in a variety of other itineraries around the world. For all EAA itineraries taken together, local currency pricing is slightly higher than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies. 
From an overall fleet-wide standpoint, booking volumes and pricings in the last 6 weeks for the first quarter of 2012 have been strong, and at this time, it appears that Q1 is off to a good start. However, please keep in mind, it's still early in the booking process, and we have a long way to go before the first quarter of 2012 is closed. 
So that sort of summarizes the booking status and the booking picture as we go through this period of time. And with that, Tina, I will turn it back over to you, and we'll take some questions."

I'm wondering -- I know it's early, but I'm also -- I've been really wondering what the current turmoil in the MENA region and throughout is doing to your forward Med and European bookings for next year. I know that's beyond what you can see for the first quarter, but I was wondering if you could give some color on that. And just wondering, you talked a little bit about what your capacity changes were, at least in the first quarter. But I was wondering, industry-wide, do you have an idea of what the capacity is increasing in Europe and in the Med for next year?"

She's got the industry data. I'm not sure we have it by markets yet. Look, I think in Q1, I think that cost repositioned Q1 of 2012, and I know you want to go beyond Q1. But for Q1, they repositioned a number of cruises away from the Med. They repositioned an additional ship down to South America for this winter in the first quarter, another ship into the Caribbean, all sorts from the European market by the way. And they made a few other itineraries -- and those ships came out -- the knock-on effect is those ships came out of the Middle East or North Africa, so there is less dependence in the first quarter on those itineraries. Going into the second and third quarters, it's still early. I had a conversation with the Costa people this morning about it. They're still watching it. Those itineraries are still tending to be a little bit soft so that further out, they may have to do some other things. But right now, they feel pretty confident that if things don't get any worse in that area of the world, that they will stay with the current plan. If they see booking momentum falling off, they will have to consider making some changes. But the benefit -- what happened this year, as I think a lot of the changes that were made were made during wave season, or towards the end of -- mid and end of wave season, which was strong booking periods for us. And as you get into the weaker booking periods of April, May and June, it became more difficult for them to catch up. I think if they have -- they have the ability now to make these decisions and be a little bit more agile knowing what they're up against, and so it's possible they may make some other changes. But I think it will be -- give them sufficient time, once they make those changes, to get those itineraries out. So I think they feel much more comfortable in terms of at least having a better sense as to what their revenue yield picture is going to look like from those programs in 2012. But it's still very, very early for second quarter and summer. We don't -- I don't have any picture of the summer at all right now, to be honest with you. So I don't even see that."

They make those decisions whether they go to North Europe, whether they go to the Caribbean, whether they go Eastern Med, whether they go Western Med, whether they go to South America. It is very complicated, and it's not -- there's no easy answer to that other than they look to optimize their revenue by going into those itineraries and those trades that will give them the best possible revenue yield. I should also say this though, that often, the decision on revenue yield, it's not just solely a revenue yield decision, it's an operating income decision for that particular program so that they look at fuel costs as well in terms of coming down to an operating margin that makes the most sense. So they tend to look at the operating margin first and then revenue yield as a function of that more. So that's what's more focused on."

Before I begin, please note that as some of our remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking, I will refer to you the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currency unless otherwise noted, as this is a much better indicator of business trends. 
Our EPS for the third quarter was $1.69. The third quarter came in $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The $0.07 per share improvement was driven by both net revenue yield and cost as each were $0.05 better than expected. The total operational improvement of $0.10 was partially offset by a $0.02 charge related to the sale of Costa Marina, which leaves the fleet in November 2011 and $0.01 from fuel prices and currency exchange rates combined. 
The $0.05 net revenue yield improvement resulted from better-than-expected last-minute pricing. In our June guidance, we slightly overestimated the negative impact from the conflict in the Middle East and North Africa, commonly referred to as MENA, on our strong summer season. However, we believe we slightly underestimated the impact of MENA on the seasonally weaker fourth quarter. So only $0.02 of the $0.05 improvement in net revenue yields for the third quarter flows through to the full year September guidance. In total, for the back half of the year, yields are expected to be slightly better than our June guidance. 
On the cost side, a portion of the $0.05 improvement from June guidance was due to timing so only $0.03 of the $0.05 improvement in costs for the third quarter flows through to the full year September guidance. 
Now let's take a look at our third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5%, with the majority of the increase coming from our European, Australian and Asian brands, or as we call them, our EAA brands. Our EAA brands grew 7% while our North American brands grew 3%. 
Our net revenue yields increased almost 3% in the third quarter, with similar increases in both net ticket and net onboard and other yields. With respect to net ticket yield, the North American brands were up almost 6% despite the negative impact from MENA on European itineraries. The improvement was driven by higher yield in Alaska, Caribbean and Mexico Riviera itineraries. 
Our EAA brands, which are primarily cruising in Europe during the third quarter, were down 2%. The yield decline was primarily driven by the impact of MENA on these itineraries. 
In net onboard and other yields, we experienced over a 2% increase. The increase was also driven by our North American brands as our EAA brands were impacted from MENA itinerary changes that resulted in lower short excursion revenues and slightly lower spending in other areas. 
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding the Costa Marina charge and fuel per available lower berth day were up 2% versus the prior year. We continue to see inflationary pressures in food costs, freight, crew travel and other hotel costs that were anticipated and discussed on the last 2 conference calls. As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per available lower berth day declined 4% this quarter, continuing a multiyear savings trend. In total, this represents a 13% savings from 2007. 
Fuel prices this quarter were 45% higher than last year, which cost us $0.23 per share. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel price was the weaker dollar which had a favorable impact of $0.10 per share. In summary, the third quarter EPS improved over 4% to $1.69 per share.
Before turning to our 2011 outlook, I want to update you on our current stock repurchase program. As we previously indicated, stock buybacks could be used opportunistically to efficiently return cash to shareholders. In mid-August, we restarted our stock buyback program. Since then, we repurchased 14.5 million shares at an average price of $31 for a total of $445 million. At the present time, we have $343 million remaining on the existing general stock repurchase authorization program.  It should be noted that on a combined basis, the recent share repurchases and our 2011 full year paid dividend represents 135% of forecasted free cash flow for the year. 
Now turning to the 2011 outlook for the full year. I'll skip net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs excluding fuel, are forecasted to be up 1%, which is the same as our June guidance excluding the charge related to the Costa Marina. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Howard."
258823,140468290,168659,"Carnival Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Sep 20, 2011",2011-09-20,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, David. My comments this morning will focus on our revenue yield outlook for the first half of 2012 since the fourth quarter of 2011 revenue picture is largely baked right now.

My comments this morning will focus on our revenue yield outlook for the first half of 2012 since the fourth quarter of 2011 revenue picture is largely baked right now. Later in my report, I will separately comment on fourth quarter revenue yields. 
For the first half of 2012, fleet-wide capacity will increase approximately 4.6%. Pricing per bookings taken to date for the first and second quarter are nicely higher than a year ago, with occupancy flat in the first quarter and lower in the second quarter versus the same quarters in 2011. 
For the first half of 2012, North American brand pricing increased or stronger than EAA pricing but both markets show nicely higher pricing at this time. On a fleet-wide basis, our bookings taken during the last 13 weeks for the first half of 2012 are higher year-over-year at higher pricing. Booking volumes and pricing are higher for both North America and EAA brands. While pricing during the earlier part of the 13-week period had been strong in more recent weeks, we have seen a modest falloff in bookings and pricing. This began in August largely as a result of the debt ceiling political circus in Washington and the related meltdown in the U.S. equity markets during the month. 
In Europe, the sovereign debt issues and the related concerns about the strength of the European banks contributed to the slowdown in EAA book brand bookings. These issues together which related declines in consumer confidence in the various markets in which we operate seem to have contributed to the softened booking activity during this August and early September period. 
Although fleet-wide bookings during the last 6-week period covering the next 3 quarters were not as strong as earlier in the quarter, on an absolute basis, volumes for the 6-week period were higher year-over-year with pricing on these bookings slightly lower than a year ago. So even during this difficult August and September period, bookings have held up quite well, which is a testament to the resiliency of our Cruise business and that even in a weak economic environment, the consumer will continue to book their vacations especially the value-based cruise vacations. 
Given the high percentage of business already booked in quarter one of 2012, it does appear that first quarter 2012 yields will be higher than a year ago. I will provide more specific information on our book business by quarter later in my comments. 
For the full year, we are now guiding earnings to a range of $2.40 to $2.44 a share or a midpoint of $2.42. This is a slight change from previous guidance and results from currency and fuel working against us by approximately $0.06 a share, a loss on the sales of ship by $0.02 a share that David referred to. This $0.08 combining the $0.06 and the $0.02 to get to $0.08 earnings per share negative impact is offset by improved revenue pricing of a couple of pennies a share and reduced costs of $0.03 a share. 
2012, we have 3 ships scheduled for delivery: the Costa Fascinosa in April; the AIDAmar in May and the Carnival Breeze in May. Fleet-wide capacity is expected to increase by 4.5% in 2012, 3.5% for North America brands and 6% for EAA brands. By quarter, Q1 2012 capacity is up 4.9%; second quarter 2012 is up 4.2%; third and fourth quarter of 2012 are up each by 4.4%. 
Now some color on each of the next 3 quarters. Turning to this fourth quarter that we're in right now the fourth quarter of 2011, on a fleet-wide basis, capacity is up 5.8%; 3.2% for our North America brands and 10.10% for EAA brands. Local currency pricing on a fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter is higher year-over-year, with occupancies at a slightly lower level than last year. 
Our North American brands, we have very limited to sell at this point but for EAA brands, we still have some amount of inventory left to sell. This is primarily related to Mediterranean Cruise itineraries, which -- many of which have to be changed over the summer as a result of the problems in the Middle East and North Africa, as we've told you in the past. 
North American brands are 42% in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter, down from 50% last year, 14% in Europe versus 9% last year and 10% in the Orient Pacific area, about the same as last year. The balance is in various other itineraries. North American brand occupancies in the fourth quarter are at approximately the same levels as last year. North American brand pricing is nicely higher than a year ago, and booking volumes for North America brands in the fourth quarter continues to be solid at higher year-over-year prices. By the time the fourth quarter closes, we expect North American brand pricing to be nicely higher. 
EAA brands are 71% in Europe versus 64% last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. EAA occupancies are lower than a year ago, primarily attributable to the changed itineraries for our Med Cruises. Although occupancies for Med Cruises have caught up significantly, they are still behind last year. 
Pricing for EAA brands itineraries are behind last year, primarily attributable to the late booking of the Med Cruises. By the time the quarter ends, we expect local currency EAA pricing to be lower than a year ago. 
On a fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter, we are forecasting higher local-currency revenue yields in the 1% to 2% range, driven by the stronger pricing for the North American brands, offset by the lower pricing for the EAA brands. 
Now turning to first quarter of 2012. As I indicated, capacity is 4.9% higher than last year, 4.5% for North America brands, 5.7% for EAA brands. At the present time, first quarter occupancies on a fleet-wide basis are approximately flat with pricing nicely higher. North American brands in the first quarter are 66% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. 
The Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on approximately the same occupancies as last year. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together in the first quarter is also higher than a year ago, also on approximately the same occupancies. 
EAA brands are 22% in the Caribbean versus 20% a year ago, 19% in Europe, down from 33% last year, 18% in South America, up slightly from 16% last year, with the balance in other itineraries. For all EAA itineraries taken together, local currency pricing is higher than a year ago at approximately the same year-over-year occupancies. 
With a good percentage of our bookings for the first quarter done as I previously mentioned, we are forecasting that revenue yield for the quarter will be higher than a year ago. 
Now turning to the second quarter of 2012. Fleet-wide capacity is up 4.2%, 2.9% for North America brands and 6.3% for EAA brands. At the present time, on a fleet-wide basis, local currency pricing is nicely higher than a year ago, with occupancies running behind last year. While the second quarter booking picture is encouraging from a pricing standpoint, it's still early in the booking cycle so I caution not to read too much into the second quarter booking picture at this time. 
North American brands are 56% in the Caribbean, approximately the same levels as last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies. All other itineraries taken together are also nicely higher than a year ago, also at lower occupancies. 
EAA brands are 53% in Europe, down from 55% last year, with the balance in various other markets. EAA brand pricing for European cruises is higher than last year on slightly lower occupancies. Pricing for all other EAA brand itineraries taken together is also higher than a year ago at lower occupancies. 
Although occupancies in the second quarter are lower than a year ago, they are not significantly behind. And talking to our brand executives, there is a general view that because of the continuing stream of negative economic news and the related decline and more recently related decline in consumer confidence, consumer they're delaying their decisions to take their cruise vacations, with the result of the booking curve for 2012 has come closer in. 
So that's sort of the status of the second quarter where we're seeing the closer in, the bookings are taking effect. And with that, Pam, I will turn it back over to you, and we'll start to take some questions. Thank you."

It's -- I don't think we want to venture right now. But we are nicely ahead by now from a pricing standpoint so even with a little bit of a downdraft, we should be just fine in the first quarter. I think less so confidence in the second quarter simply because we just -- we don't have as large a percentage of our business booked in the second quarter as we have in the first quarter naturally. And we have seen, starting to see some evidence of the booking curve coming in. I think consumers are delaying their vacation decisions.

On the free cash flow story, it looks to me like you're going to generate about $2 billion in free cash flow next year. You've kept supply in check. So could you talk about how the board is thinking about a dividend increase? And the reason why I think it's important at this point is that it would signal both that you're returning cash and shareholders in a very efficient way besides the share buyback, and that you're going to keep your supply growth in check. And then second, Howard, can you just define for me, just because I haven't heard it in a while what nicely really means? Has that definition changed over time, so is now nicely up 1% to 2% versus a few years ago, where it was up 3% to 4%? If you could just give us a general sense of what nicely means, that might be helpful."

Before I begin, please note that as some of our remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking, I will refer to you the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currency unless otherwise noted, as this is a much better indicator of business trends.
Our EPS for the third quarter was $1.69. The third quarter came in $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The $0.07 per share improvement was driven by both net revenue yield and cost, as each were $0.05 better than expected. The total operational improvement of $0.10 was partially offset by a $0.02 charge related to the sale of Costa Marina, which leaves the fleet in November 2011, and $0.01 from fuel prices and currency exchange rates combined.
The $0.05 net revenue yield improvement resulted from better-than-expected last-minute pricing. In our June guidance, we slightly overestimated the negative impact from the conflict in the Middle East and North Africa, commonly referred to as MENA, on our strong summer booking season. However, we believe we slightly underestimated the impact of MENA on the seasonally weaker fourth quarter. So only $0.02 of the $0.05 improvement in net revenue yields for the third quarter flows through to the full year September guidance. In total, for the back half of the year, yields are expected to be slightly better than our June guidance.
On the cost side, a portion of the $0.05 improvement from June guidance was due to timing. So only $0.03 of the $0.05 improvement in costs for the third quarter flows through to the full year September guidance.
Now let's take a look at our third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5%, with the majority of the increase coming from our European, Australian and Asian brands, or as we call them, our EAA brands. Our EAA brands grew 7%, while our North American brands grew 3%.
Our net revenue yields increased almost 3% in the third quarter, with similar increases in both net ticket and net onboard and other yields. With respect to net ticket yield, the North American brands were up almost 6% despite the negative impact from MENA on European itineraries. The improvement was driven by higher yield in Alaska, Caribbean and Mexican Riviera itineraries.
Our EAA brands, which are primarily cruising in Europe during the third quarter, were down 2%. The yield decline was primarily driven by the impact of MENA on these itineraries.
In net onboard and other yields, we experienced over a 2% increase. The increase was also driven by our North American brands as our EAA brands were impacted from MENA itinerary changes that resulted in lower short excursion revenues and slightly lower spending in other areas.
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding the Costa Marina charge and fuel per available lower berth day, were up 2% versus the prior year. We continue to see inflationary pressures in food cost, freight, crew travel and other hotel costs that were anticipated and discussed on the last 2 conference calls. As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per available lower berth day declined 4% this quarter, continuing our multiyear savings trend. In total, this represents a 13% savings from 2007.
Fuel prices this quarter were 45% higher than last year, which cost us $0.23 per share. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel price was the weaker dollar, which had a favorable impact of $0.10 per share. In summary, the third quarter EPS improved over 4% to $1.69 per share.
Before turning to our 2011 outlook, I want to update you on our current stock repurchase program. As we previously indicated, stock buybacks could be used opportunistically to efficiently return cash to shareholders. In mid-August, we restarted our stock buyback program. Since then, we repurchased 14.5 million shares at an average price of $31 for a total of $445 million. At the present time, we have $343 million remaining on the existing general stock repurchase authorization program.  It should be noted that on a combined basis, the recent share repurchases and our 2011 full year paid dividend represents 135% of forecasted free cash flow for the year.
Now turning to the 2011 outlook for the full year. I'll skip net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs excluding fuel, are forecasted to be up 1%, which is the same as our June guidance, excluding the charge relating to the Costa Marina. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Howard."

My comments this morning will focus on our revenue yield outlook for the first half of 2012, since the fourth quarter of 2011 revenue picture is largely baked right now. Later in my report, I will separately comment on fourth quarter rev",1449,"Thank you, David. My comments this morning will focus on our revenue yield outlook for the first half of 2012, since the fourth quarter of 2011 revenue picture is largely baked right now. Later in my report, I will separately comment on fourth quarter revenue yields.
For the first half of 2012, fleet-wide capacity will increase approximately 4.6%. Pricing per bookings taken to date for the first and second quarter are nicely higher than a year ago, with occupancy flat in the first quarter and lower in the second quarter versus the same quarters in 2011.
For the first half of 2012, North American brand pricing increase are stronger than EAA pricing, but both markets show nicely higher pricing at this time. On a fleet-wide basis, our bookings taken during the last 13 weeks for the first half of 2012 are higher year-over-year at higher pricing. Booking volumes and pricing are higher for both North America and EAA brands. While pricing during the earlier part of the 13-week period had been strong in more recent weeks, we have seen a modest falloff in bookings and pricing. This began in August largely as a result of the debt ceiling political circus in Washington and the related meltdown in the U.S. equity markets during the month.
In Europe, the sovereign debt issues and the related concerns about the strength of the European banks contributed to the slowdown in EAA brand bookings. These issues together with related declines in consumer confidence in the various markets in which we operate seem to have contributed to the softened booking activity during this August and early September period.
Although fleet-wide bookings during the last 6-week period covering the next 3 quarters were not as strong as earlier in the quarter, on absolute basis, volumes for the 6-week period were higher year-over-year with pricing on these bookings slightly lower than a year ago. So even during this difficult August and September period, bookings have held up quite well, which is a testament to the resiliency of our cruise business. In that even in a weak economic environment, the consumer will continue to book their vacations, especially the value-based cruise vacations.
Given the high percentage of business already booked in quarter one of 2012, it does appear that first quarter 2012 yields will be higher than a year ago. I will provide more specific information on our booked business by quarter later in my comments.
For the full year, we are now guiding earnings to a range of $2.40 to $2.44 a share, or a midpoint of $2.42. This is a slight change from previous guidance and results from currency and fuel working against us by approximately $0.06 a share, a loss on the sale of a ship, about $0.02 a share that David referred to. This $0.08 combining the $0.06 and the $0.02 to get the $0.08 earnings per share negative impact is offset by improved revenue pricing of a couple of pennies a share and reduced cost of $0.03 a share.
2012, we have 3 ships scheduled for delivery: the Costa Fascinosa in April; the AIDAmar in May and the Carnival Breeze in May. Fleet-wide capacity is expected to increase by 4.5% in 2012. 3.5% for North America brands and 6% for EAA brands. By quarter, Q1 2012 capacity is up 4.9%; second quarter 2012 is up 4.2%; third and fourth quarter of 2012 are up each by 4.4%.
Now some color on each of the next 3 quarters. Turning to this fourth quarter that we're in right now, the fourth quarter of 2011, on a fleet-wide basis, capacity is up 5.8%; 3.2% for our North America brands and 10.10% for EAA brands. Local currency pricing on a fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter is higher year-over-year, with occupancies at a slightly lower level than last year.
The North America brands, we have very little inventory left to sell at this point, but for EAA brands, we still have some amount of inventory left to sell. This is primarily related to Mediterranean cruise itineraries, which -- many of which had to be changed over this summer as a result of the problems in the Middle East and North Africa, as we've told you in the past.
North American brands are 42% in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter, down from 50% last year; 14% in Europe versus 9% last year; and 10% in the Orient Pacific area, about the same as last year. The balance is in various other itineraries. North American brand occupancies in the fourth quarter are at approximately the same levels as last year. North American brand pricing is nicely higher than a year ago, and booking volumes for North America brands in the fourth quarter continues to be solid at higher year-over-year prices. By the time the fourth quarter closes, we expect North American brand pricing to be nicely higher.
EAA brands are 71% in Europe versus 64% last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. EAA occupancies are lower than a year ago, primarily attributable to the changed itineraries for our Med cruises. Although occupancies for Med cruises have caught up significantly, they are still behind last year.
Pricing for EAA brands itineraries is behind last year, primarily attributable to the late booking of the Med cruises. By the time the quarter ends, we expect local currency EAA pricing to be lower than a year ago.
Fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter, we are forecasting higher local currency revenue yields in the 1% to 2% range, driven by the stronger pricing for the North American brands, offset by the lower pricing for the EAA brands.
Now turning to first quarter of 2012. As I indicated, capacity is 4.9% higher than last year, 4.5% for North America brands, 5.7% for EAA brands. At the present time, first quarter occupancies on a fleet-wide basis are approximately flat year-over-year, with pricing nicely higher. North American brands in the first quarter are 66% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year, with the balance in various other itineraries.
The Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on approximately the same occupancies as last year. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together in the first quarter is also higher than a year ago, also on approximately the same occupancies.
EAA brands are 22% in the Caribbean versus 20% a year ago, 19% in Europe, down from 33% last year, 18% in South America, up slightly from 16% last year, with the balance in other itineraries. For all EAA itineraries taken together, local currency pricing is higher than a year ago at approximately the same year-over-year occupancies.
With a good percentage of our bookings for the first quarter done, as I previously mentioned, we are forecasting that revenue yield for the quarter will be higher than a year ago.
Now turning to the second quarter of 2012. Fleet-wide capacity is up 4.2%, 2.9% for North America brands, and 6.3% for EAA brands. At the present time, on a fleet-wide basis, local currency pricing is nicely higher than a year ago, with occupancies running behind last year. While the second quarter booking picture is encouraging from a pricing standpoint, it's still early in the booking cycle, so I caution not to read too much into the second quarter booking picture at this time.
North American brands are 56% in the Caribbean, approximately the same levels as last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago, at slightly lower occupancies. All other itineraries taken together are also nicely higher than a year ago, also at lower occupancies.
EAA brands are 53% in Europe, down from 55% last year, with the balance in various other markets. EAA brand pricing for European cruises is higher than last year on slightly lower occupancies. Pricing for all other EAA brand itineraries taken together is also higher than a year ago at lower occupancies.
Although occupancies in the second quarter are lower than a year ago, they are not significantly behind. And talking to our brand executives, there is a general view that because of the continuing stream of negative economic news and the related decline -- and more recently the related decline in consumer confidence, consumers are delaying their decisions to take their cruise vacations, with the result that the booking curve for 2012 has come closer in.
So that's sort of the status of the second quarter, where we're seeing the closer in, the booking curve taking effect. And with that, Pam, I will turn it back to you, and we'll start to take some questions. Thank you."

It's -- I don't think we want to venture right now. But we are nicely ahead right now from a pricing standpoint. So even with a little bit of a downdraft, we should be just fine in the first quarter. I think less so of confidence in the second quarter simply because we just -- we don't have as large a percentage of our business booked in the second quarter as we have in the first quarter naturally. And we have seen, started to see some evidence of the booking curve coming in. I think consumers are delaying their vacation decisions. It seems clear, any major spend decisions because of lower consumer confidence, seems to be -- meaning people are pulling back on it, but at the end of the day and talking to our brand managers, they seem to be pretty confident that the business will be there at the end of the day, and so I think they're more confidence in holding price."

So on these sales to have it turn out to be that way, we felt very comfortable with our book value overall. As far as the cost impact of selling these older ships, I think the last time I looked, those 7 ships represented about 3% of our overall capacity because remember, the older ships tend to be smaller, so even if we sold all 7 of them, I doubt you would see a dramatic change in our net cruise cost because it's just 3% to the total."

Before I begin, please note that as some of our remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking, I will refer to you the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currency unless otherwise noted, as this is a much better indicator of business trends.
Our EPS for the third quarter was $1.69. The third quarter came in $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The $0.07-per-share improvement was driven by both net revenue yield and cost, as each were $0.05 better than expected. The total operational improvement of $0.10 was partially offset by a $0.02 charge related to the sale of Costa Marina, which leaves the fleet in November 2011, and $0.01 from fuel prices and currency exchange rates combined.
The $0.05 net revenue yield improvement resulted from better-than-expected last-minute pricing. In our June guidance, we slightly overestimated the negative impact from the conflict in the Middle East and North Africa, commonly referred to as MENA, on our strong summer booking season. However, we believe we slightly underestimated the impact of MENA on the seasonally weaker fourth quarter. So only $0.02 of the $0.05 improvement in net revenue yields for the third quarter flows through to the full year September guidance. In total, for the back half of the year, yields are expected to be slightly better than our June guidance.
On the cost side, a portion of the $0.05 improvement from June guidance was due to timing, so only $0.03 of the $0.05 improvement in costs for the third quarter flows through to the full year September guidance.
Now let's take a look at our third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5%, with the majority of the increase coming from our European, Australian and Asian brands, or as we call them, our EAA brands. Our EAA brands grew 7%, while our North American brands grew 3%.
Our net revenue yields increased almost 3% in the third quarter, with similar increases in both net ticket and net onboard and other yields. With respect to net ticket yield, the North American brands were up almost 6% despite the negative impact from MENA on European itineraries. The improvement was driven by higher yield in Alaska, Caribbean and Mexican Riviera itineraries. Our EAA brands, which are primarily cruising in Europe during the third quarter, were down 2%. The yield decline was primarily driven by the impact of MENA on these itineraries.
In net onboard and other yields, we experienced over a 2% increase. The increase was also driven by our North American brands, as our EAA brands were impacted from MENA itinerary changes that resulted in lower shore excursion revenues and slightly lower spending in other areas.
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding the Costa Marina charge and fuel per available lower berth day, were up 2% versus the prior year. We continue to see inflationary pressures in food cost, freight, crew travel and other hotel costs that were anticipated and discussed on the last 2 conference calls. As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per available lower berth day declined 4% this quarter, continuing our multiyear savings trend. In total, this represents a 13% savings from 2007.
Fuel prices this quarter were 45% higher than last year, which cost us $0.23 per share. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel price was the weaker dollar, which had a favorable impact of $0.10 per share. In summary, the third quarter EPS improved over 4% to $1.69 per share.
Before turning to our 2011 outlook, I want to update you on our current stock repurchase program. As we previously indicated, stock buybacks could be used opportunistically to efficiently return cash to shareholders. In mid-August, we restarted our stock buyback program. Since then, we repurchased 14.5 million shares at an average price of $31 for a total of $445 million. At the present time, we have $343 million remaining on the existing general stock repurchase authorization program.  It should be noted that on a combined basis, the recent share repurchases and our 2011 full year paid dividend represents 135% of forecasted free cash flow for the year.
Now turning to the 2011 outlook for the full year. I'll skip net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are forecasted to be up 1%, which is the same as our June guidance, excluding the charge relating to the Costa Marina. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Howard."
258823,140468290,168803,"Carnival Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Sep 20, 2011",2011-09-20,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, David. My comments this morning will focus on our revenue yield outlook for the first half of 2012, since the fourth quarter of 2011 revenue picture is largely baked right now. Later in my report, I will separately comment on fourth quarter rev",1457,"Thank you, David. My comments this morning will focus on our revenue yield outlook for the first half of 2012, since the fourth quarter of 2011 revenue picture is largely baked right now. Later in my report, I will separately comment on fourth quarter revenue yields.
For the first half of 2012, fleet-wide capacity will increase approximately 4.6%. Pricing per bookings taken to date for the first and second quarter are nicely higher than a year ago, with occupancy flat in the first quarter and lower in the second quarter versus the same quarters in 2011.
For the first half of 2012, North American brand pricing increases were stronger than EAA pricing, but both markets show nicely higher pricing at this time. On a fleet-wide basis, our bookings taken during the last 13 weeks for the first half of 2012 are higher year-over-year at higher pricing. Booking volumes and pricing are higher for both North America and EAA brands. While pricing during the earlier part of the 13-week period had been strong, in more recent weeks we have seen a modest falloff in bookings and pricing. This began in August, largely as a result of the debt ceiling political circus in Washington and the related meltdown in the U.S. equity markets during the month.
In Europe, the sovereign debt issues and the related concerns about the strength of the European banks contributed to the slowdown in EAA brand bookings. These issues, together with related declines in consumer confidence in the various markets in which we operate, seem to have contributed to the softened booking activity during this August and early September period.
Although fleet-wide bookings during the last 6-week period covering the next 3 quarters were not as strong as earlier in the quarter, on an absolute basis, volumes for the 6-week period were higher year-over-year with pricing on these bookings slightly lower than a year ago. So even during this difficult August and September period, bookings have held up quite well, which is a testament to the resiliency of our cruise business, in that even in a weak economic environment, the consumer will continue to book their vacations, especially the value-based cruise vacations.
Given the high percentage of business already booked in quarter one of 2012, it does appear that first quarter 2012 yields will be higher than a year ago. I will provide more specific information on our booked business by quarter later in my comments.
For the full year, we are now guiding earnings to a range of $2.40 to $2.44 a share, or a midpoint of $2.42. This is a slight change from previous guidance and results from currency and fuel working against us by approximately $0.06 a share, a loss on the sale of a ship, about $0.02 a share that David referred to. This $0.08, combining the $0.06 and the $0.02 to get the $0.08 earnings per share negative impact, is offset by improved revenue pricing of a couple of pennies a share and reduced costs of $0.03 a share.
2012, we have 3 ships scheduled for delivery: the Costa Fascinosa in April; the AIDAmar in May and the Carnival Breeze in May. Fleet-wide capacity is expected to increase by 4.5% in 2012, 3.5% for North America brands and 6% for EAA brands. By quarter, Q1 2012 capacity is up 4.9%; second quarter of 2012 is up 4.2%; third and fourth quarter of 2012 are up each by 4.4%.
Now some color on each of the next 3 quarters. Turning to this fourth quarter that we're in right now, the fourth quarter of 2011, on a fleet-wide basis capacity is up 5.8%, 3.2% for our North America brands and 10.10% for EAA brands. Local currency pricing on a fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter is higher year-over-year, with occupancies at a slightly lower level than last year.
The North America brands, we have very little inventory left to sell at this point, but for EAA brands, we still have some amount of inventory left to sell. This is primarily related to Mediterranean cruise itineraries, which -- many of which had to be changed over the summer as a result of the problems in the Middle East and North Africa, as we've told you in the past.
North American brands are 42% in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter, down from 50% last year; 14% in Europe versus 9% last year; and 10% in the Orient Pacific area, about the same as last year. The balance is in various other itineraries. North American brand occupancies in the fourth quarter are at approximately the same levels as last year. North American brand pricing is nicely higher than a year ago, and booking volumes for North America brands in the fourth quarter continues to be solid at higher year-over-year prices. By the time the fourth quarter closes, we expect North American brand pricing to be nicely higher.
EAA brands are 71% in Europe versus 64% last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. EAA occupancies are lower than a year ago, primarily attributable to the changed itineraries for our Med cruises. Although occupancies for Med cruises have caught up significantly, they are still behind last year. Pricing for EAA brands itineraries is behind last year, primarily attributable to the late booking of the Med cruises. By the time the quarter ends, we expect local currency EAA pricing to be lower than a year ago.
On a fleet-wide basis for the fourth quarter, we are forecasting higher local currency revenue yields in the 1% to 2% range, driven by the stronger pricing for the North American brands, offset by the lower pricing for the EAA brands.
Now turning to first quarter of 2012. As I indicated, capacity is 4.9% higher than last year, 4.5% for North America brands, 5.7% for EAA brands. At the present time, fourth -- first quarter occupancies on a fleet-wide basis are approximately flat year-over-year, with pricing nicely higher. North American brands in the first quarter are 66% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year, with the balance in various other itineraries.
The Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on approximately the same occupancies as last year. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together in the first quarter is also higher than a year ago, also on approximately the same occupancies.
EAA brands are 22% in the Caribbean versus 20% a year ago; 19% in Europe, down from 33% last year; 18% in South America, up slightly from 16% last year; with the balance in other itineraries. For all EAA itineraries taken together, local currency pricing is higher than a year ago at approximately the same year-over-year occupancies.
With a good percentage of our bookings for the first quarter done, as I previously mentioned, we are forecasting that revenue yield for the quarter will be higher than a year ago.
Now turning to the second quarter of 2012. Fleet-wide capacity is up 4.2%, 2.9% for North America brands and 6.3% for EAA brands. At the present time, on a fleet-wide basis, local currency pricing is nicely higher than a year ago, with occupancies running behind last year. While the second quarter booking picture is encouraging from a pricing standpoint, it's still early in the booking cycle, so I caution not to read too much into the second quarter booking picture at this time.
North American brands are 56% in the Caribbean, approximately the same levels as last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies. All other itineraries taken together are also nicely higher than a year ago, also at lower occupancies.
EAA brands are 53% in Europe, down from 55% last year, with the balance in various other markets. EAA brand pricing for European cruises is higher than last year on slightly lower occupancies. Pricing for all other EAA brand itineraries taken together is also higher than a year ago at lower occupancies.
Although occupancies in the second quarter are lower than a year ago, they are not significantly behind. And talking to our brand executives, there is a general view that because of the continuing stream of negative economic news and the related decline -- and more recently the related decline in consumer confidence, consumers are delaying their decisions to take their cruise vacations, with the result that the booking curve for 2012 has come closer in.
So that's sort of the status of the second quarter, where we're seeing the closer in booking curve taking effect. And with that, I will -- Pam, I will turn it back to you, and we'll start to take some questions. Thank you."

So even with a little bit of a downdraft, we should be just fine in the first quarter. I think less so confidence in the second quarter simply because we just -- we don't have as large a percentage of our business booked in the second quarter as we have in the first quarter, naturally. And we have seen, started to see some evidence of the booking curve coming in. I think consumers are delaying their vacation decisions. It seems clear, any major spend decisions, because of lower consumer confidence, seems to be people are pulling back on it.

On China, I think that it was a rough -- this certainly was a rough year for China, given the problems in Japan and also the dislocation of itineraries and moving things around and cancellations and rebookings and so on. So it was a tough year. But we do think that 2012 will be better. It's getting off to a better start but still very, very early for the China booking season. But we certainly are hopeful that we'll show some nice improvement in China in 2012."

Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.

I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currencies unless otherwise noted as this is a more useful measure of business trends. 
Our earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.28. The fourth quarter came in right at the midpoint of our September guidance. Now let's take a look at the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 6%, with 2/3 of the increase coming from our Europe, Australia and Asian brands or as we call them, our EAA brands. Our EAA brands grew 10% while our North American brands grew 3%. 
Our net ticket -- our net revenue yields increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter, with similar increases in both net ticket and net onboard and other revenue yields. With respect to net ticket revenue yields, our North American brands were up almost 8% despite the negative impact from MENA on European itineraries. The improvement was driven by higher yields in the Caribbean, Alaska, Canada, New England and transatlantic itineraries. 
Our EAA brands, which are principally cruising in Europe during the fourth quarter, were down over 6%. The yield decline was primarily driven by the impact on MENA itineraries. 
In net onboard and other revenue yields, we experienced a 1.4% increase. This increase was also driven by our North American brands as our EAA brands were impacted from MENA itinerary changes that resulted in lower occupancies, lower shore excursion revenues and slightly lower spending in other areas. 
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per available lower berth day, were down 2% versus the prior year. The decline was driven by ship incident repair costs in the prior year. As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per ALBD declined 4% this quarter, continuing our multiyear savings trend. In total, this represents a 15% savings since 2005. However, fuel prices this quarter were 39% higher than last year which cost us $0.21 per share. 
In summary, the fourth quarter EPS was $0.28 lower than the 2010 earnings of $0.31 per share, as increased yields and lower net cruise costs excluding fuel mostly offset higher fuel prices. 
Looking at the full year 2011. Our EPS was $2.42, which was slightly lower than the prior year's $2.47 as increased net revenue yields, a 5% capacity increase and a favorable benefit from currency were more than offset by a 32% increase in the price of fuel. For 2011, our net revenue yields increased 2%. This was driven by an almost 4% improvement in our North American brands while our EAA brands were in line with the prior year despite all of their challenges. 
Our 2011 EPS was $0.58 lower than the midpoint of the original guidance that we gave one year ago of $2.90 to $3.10 per share. I think it's fair to say that 2011 was a year of unexpected challenges. 
The geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the natural disaster in Japan, resulted in over 300 itinerary changes, which we estimate cost us $0.27. Fuel prices increased 23% above our original guidance, and while we benefited from currency, the net effect of fuel and currency cost us an additional $0.41. Absent these items, we would have been at the high end of our original guidance range from a year ago. 
In the end, our operating companies performed very well, mitigating the impact of MENA, the European debt crisis, recessionary fears and stock market volatility. This is a testament to the quality of our management team, the power of our brands and the value proposition of the Cruise business. 
Turning to cash flow. As Micky indicated in the press release, our cash from operations reached $3.8 billion, which was more than enough to fund the ship expansion and refurbishment programs that required a capital investment of $2.7 billion, leaving us with free cash flow of $1.1 billion. 
Earlier in 2011, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. Also, during the year, we opportunistically repurchased 14.8 million shares at an average price of $31 for a total of $455 million. The majority of these shares were repurchased during the third quarter. Only 300,000 shares were repurchased since our last conference call. It should be noted that in 2011, the dividend paid and the share repurchases totaled $1.1 billion, which represented all of our 2011 free cash flow. 
Before turning to the 2012 outlook, I would like to update you on our recently implemented fuel derivative program. The program was intended to mitigate a portion of our economic risk attributable to potentially significant fuel price increases. As part of this program, we will evaluate various derivative products and strategies. To date, we have bought 0 cost for approximately 10% of our estimated fuel consumption for the second half of fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2015, with ceilings ranging from $125 to $135 and floors ranging from $71 to $75. 
We designed the fuel derivative program to maximize operational flexibility by utilizing derivative markets with significant trading liquidity. These derivatives act as effective economic hedges. However, hedge accounting was not applied. Accordingly, the impact of realized gains and losses on the fuel derivatives that mature each period, as well as changes in unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on our outstanding fuel derivatives are recorded as a nonoperating item in our P&L. 
We believe it's more meaningful to evaluate our earnings performance by excluding the impact of the unrealized gains and losses until the gains and losses are realized, and we've added a line to our P&L to reflect this exclusion labeled Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share. 
Going forward, we will not include in our earnings guidance any year-to-date impact or any future estimates of the unrealized gains and losses on the fuel derivatives. Accordingly, our earnings guidance will be on a non-GAAP basis. However, we will forecast realized gains and losses on fuel derivatives by applying the current Brent oil prices to the derivative settle in the forecast period. Based on this approach and the current prices, we are not forecasting any realized gains or losses for 2012 under our current fuel derivative portfolio. 
Now turning to our 2012 outlook. I will skip net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs per available lower berth day are forecasted to be flat versus the prior year, which is at the low end of our longer-term guidance of flat to half of inflation. 
As fuel and currency are assumptions that impact our results, it should be noted that the current spot price for fuel used in our guidance is essentially in line with 2011's average price. However, based on the current FX rates, currency is expected to have a negative impact on our earnings next year of $0.17. 
On a final note, I wanted to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact of fuel and currency on our results. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel represents a $225 million or $0.29 per share impact for the full year. In addition, note that the 10% change obviously moves along with the price of fuel. 
With respect to FX movement, the 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.25 a share for the full year. 
At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard."
258823,144510989,202871,"Carnival Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2011",2011-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Let me frame for you, if you will, the 2012 outlook for our business. We have 3 new ships scheduled for delivery in 2012: the Costa Fascinosa, which gets delivered in late April; the AIDAmar in May; and the Carnival Breeze in late May so",1801,"Thank you, David. Let me frame for you, if you will, the 2012 outlook for our business. We have 3 new ships scheduled for delivery in 2012: the Costa Fascinosa, which gets delivered in late April; the AIDAmar in May; and the Carnival Breeze in late May so we have 3 spring deliveries. This will drive a fleet-wide capacity increase of 4.8%, 3.6% for the North America fleet and 6.6% for the EAA fleet. 
Earnings guidance for 2012 has been established with a range of $2.55 to $2.85, which gives us a midpoint of $2.70 per share. Using the midpoint, we estimate that operating cash flow for 2012 will approach $4 billion. With CapEx estimated at $2.6 billion, free cash flow for the year should be approximately $1.4 billion. 
The 2 ships currently scheduled for delivery in each of 2013, '14 and '15, we are expecting that free cash flow will continue to increase in each of these subsequent years. 
Turning back to our 2012 earnings guidance, we have established this wider range of guidance this year, given the uncertain global economic outlook and the even greater uncertainty in European markets because of the sovereign debt crisis. The $0.30 per share range for 2012 compares to the $0.20 share range we have used in recent years. 
Needless to say, our crystal ball for 2012 is somewhat hazier than in past years and thus a little more caution to our values. However, notwithstanding the global economic uncertainty, we are confident we can grow our earnings in 2012. The amount of earnings growth will depend on the revenue yield improvement we can achieve during the year. 
And turning now to our booking trends, our more recent booking trends. There has been an ebb and flow to booking patterns over the last 13 weeks. Lower consumer confidence around the world and worries about the European sovereign debt crisis and its effect on European consumer pocketbooks have caused some delay in consumer vacation decisions and resulted in a closer end booking window. Although fleet-wide booking volumes during the last 13-week period have been running nicely higher year-over-year, we have achieved this volume by reducing prices for our cruises. But the good news is that consumers have responded to these lower prices and the booking volumes have increased. 
North America brand booking volumes for the 13 weeks have been running higher than a year ago at lower prices. EAA brand bookings are slightly higher at lower prices. More recent bookings over the last 6 weeks have seen even an even stronger pickup in booking volumes for both North America and Europe brands, which is an encouraging sign. The booking patterns during the upcoming wave season, which starts in early January, will give us a better indicator as to what revenue yield picture will look like for the remainder of the year. 
In terms of our current booking status at the present time, based on bookings taken to date, constant dollar ticket prices for both North America and EAA brands are slightly higher than a year ago on slightly lower year occupancies. This is a combination of stronger booking patterns during the last spring and summer and the weaker prices for bookings experienced during the 13 -- this last 13-week period. 
We are currently guiding to yield improvement of a range of 1% to 2% for the year or a midpoint of 1.5%. To some degree, this yield improvement results from the significant hit we took on pricing and occupancy for our European Mediterranean itineraries in 2011, which arose from the political upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa. We expect to improve our year-over-year occupancy for these cruises, which will be a major contributor to the forecasted revenue yield improvement in 2012. 
Given the bookings already taken for 2012 and our forecasted pricing for the remainder of the year, which has factored in the economic headwinds in our various markets, we are comfortable with the 1% to 2% revenue yield range improvement for the year. 
In terms of our earnings guidance for 2012, broadly speaking, our forecasted earnings improvement for 2012 comes from a higher yield of approximately 1.5%, a fleet-wide capacity increase of 4.8% and it's offset by the negative effect of the changes in currency, which David mentioned before on a year-over-year basis. 
Our fuel pricing forecast is relatively unchanged year-over-year although it does have a significant impact on the first quarter of 2012, which I will comment on later. As we indicated in the press release, earnings for the first quarter of 2012 will be lower than a year ago, principally because of the higher fuel costs and the higher number of dry dock days.  However, we expect to get back to positive earnings growth from the second quarter onward as yield comparisons become more favorable. 
For the present time, we plan to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, which represents approximately 37% of our earnings and is in line with our stated guidance of paying a dividend of 30% to 40% of earnings. 
Now turning to the first quarter. Fleet-wide capacity for the first quarter is expected to be 4.9% higher than last year, 4.5% for North America brands and 5.6% for EAA brands. At the present time, first quarter occupancies on a fleet-wide basis was slightly higher year-over-year, with constant dollar pricing also higher. There's very little inventory left to sell at this point for the first quarter. 
North America brands in the first quarter are 65% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is higher than a year ago at slightly higher occupancies as compared to last year. Pricing for all other itineraries is also slightly higher than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies. 
For EAA brands, they are 22% in the Caribbean in the first quarter versus 20% last year, 19% in Europe and down from 22% last year and 18% in South America versus 16% last year so a bit of a shift from Europe to South America, with the balance in all other itineraries. EAA constant dollar pricing in the Caribbean is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. EAA pricing in Europe is lower year-over-year but with higher occupancies, and EAA South America pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on higher occupancies. 
With respect to the first quarter outlook, with a good percentage of our bookings for the first quarter completed, we are forecasting that constant dollar revenue yields for the quarter will increase in the 1.5% to 2.5% range compared to last year. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to increase in 3.5% to 4.5% range in constant dollars, largely due to the higher year-over-year dry docking days scheduled in the first quarter of 2012. 
Fuel costs are significantly higher in the first quarter this year versus last year and are expected to increase by approximately $93 million or $0.12 a share. Incremental costs for the increased number of dry dock days versus the first quarter of 2011 is approximately $0.06 a share. This is a timing difference that these dry dock days that will reverse during the remainder of the year as the dry dock days for the full year 2012 is approximately the same as 2011. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, including the higher fuel prices, the company is guiding first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.10 per share. For an apples-to-apples comparison, if we add back the $0.18 per share for the fuel price increases in dry dock days, the earning per share would've been $0.24 to $0.28 versus the $0.19 per share in 2011. 
Turning to the second quarter now, fleet-wide capacity for the second quarter is up 4.7%, 2.9% for North America brands and 7.6% for EAA brands. At the present time on a fleet-wide basis, constant dollar pricing is slightly higher than a year ago, with occupancies lower than last year. For North American brands, they are 56% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on approximately the same occupancy levels as last year. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. For EAA brands, they are 53% in Europe, down from 55% last year, with the balance in various other markets. 
EAA brand constant dollar European cruise pricing is slightly higher than a year ago on slightly lower occupancies. EAA brand pricing on all other itineraries taken together is slightly lower than last year, also at lower occupancies. On an overall basis, our estimate is that constant dollar revenue yields will be flattish for the second quarter by the time it closes. 
Turning now to the third quarter of 2012. Capacity in that third quarter is expected to increase 4.7%, 3.3% in North America and 7% in EAA. Third quarter booking patterns are still in early development so I caution you not to read too much into this data. On a fleet-wide basis, third quarter constant dollar pricing is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. 
For North America brands, capacity in the third quarter is 39% in the Caribbean versus 36% last year, 24% in Alaska, slightly higher than a year ago and 25% in Europe, which is about the same as last year. Pricing for Caribbean, Alaska and Europe itineraries are all higher than a year ago. Occupancies for the Caribbean and Alaska cruises are running at about the same level as last year, with occupancy for Europe cruises lower than last year. 
EAA brand capacity is 88% in Europe and the itineraries in line with last year. EAA brand constant dollar pricing for European and all other itineraries is nicely higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. 
While the pricing picture for the third quarter is quite good right now, there is a considerable amount of third quarter inventory remaining to be sold. Much of the third quarter revenue picture will depend on the strength for 2012 wave season. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect that revenue yields for the last 3 quarters of 2012 will benefit from the easier comparisons to the 2011 year. We took a hit as a result of the itinerary disruptions from MENA. All things being equal, that should have produce higher yield improvement in 2012. However, 2012 is proving more challenging than originally thought because of the European sovereign debt crisis and lower consumer confidence in Europe. 
So that's our thoughts about how 2012 is currently shaping up. And with that, Tommy, I'll turn it back to you for -- we're ready for questions."

That's been more of a challenge for us. We have taken a number of pricing actions in those markets, and as I mentioned, where we're seeing the softer pricing, and we're also looking at options for how to move inventory and moving from one market to another and that sort of thing in Europe, which we think will be -- which will have some benefit. But clearly, if you look at southern European markets, it's more of a challenge, less so in we've seen in U.K. and Germany. And broadly speaking, U.S., more or less, seems to be holding up well except I think we're seeing more of a challenge on our European programs this coming summer for our North American brands, and that could be a combination of factors including higher air costs and just some -- all the noise that Americans are hearing about what's going on in Europe, although you wouldn't think it affect their vacation decisions, I think the psychology of the consumer today is that there is a greater concern. And the patterns come closer in and but we're holding it. We're holding as much pricing as we can. We think that if we have a decent wave season, we should be just fine."

It just so happens that the current spot price for 2012 happens to be very much in line with 2011. That's more of a coincidence. It's not that we used the 2011. As far as Brent and bunker, they're really -- there was a big dislocation in the market that seemed to occur about a year ago, where Brent and bunker seemed to move in different directions. I think they got as wide as about $25 or $30 a barrel of difference. There's a lot of issues with WTI and Brent and the correlation between the 2. But if you look at over time, I think what you'll find is that Brent and bunker or our fuel prices had a much better correlation. The correlation used to be in the 70s, in the mid-70s. It did move up into the 90s. It's recently come back to the high 80s, and it has stayed in the high 80s, low 90s for a period of time now so there's been a pretty good correlation. One of the reasons why we chose to use Brent as part of our a fuel alternative program. The long-term movement between the 70s and the high 80s has a lot to do with refining capacity and all types of things that we talked about historically in the conference call so not expecting that the crack spreads or the -- will come down when you compare our fuel price to Brent. As far as your last question, the correlation between the euro and bunker, I mean, we've said historically that there is a -- that these are move in opposite directions. That has worked most of the time but they're not a complete offset to each other. There's many other economic factors affecting these 2 items. I'm sure that all of the dislocation and all of the debt crisis and everything else going in Europe today is causing the euro to move. And that's much more so than the overall price of bunker. So while they have been a nice natural hedge, it doesn't always work perfectly for us, and they don't move in opposite directions all the time."

On a year-to-year basis, '11 to '12, the total number of dry dock days were pretty much in line. They went up slightly with capacity overall. So on a year-over-year basis, it's really no issue. It's just the timing. Remember, the brands individually choose to do dry docks in what appears to be the most convenient time for them, usually the lowest profit season. And this year, we just happened to have more dry docks scheduled for the first quarter and less dry docks scheduled for the second and fourth quarter so it's just the timing within the year and not an issue on an overall basis for the year.

So it's really a combination of all those things, including the U.S. market, which seems to be relatively good right now. I mean, all 3 of our 4 U.S. brands seem to be forming well, with the possible exception, as I mentioned earlier, about summer Europe, which is okay from a pricing standpoint at this point but has fallen behind from an occupancy. But we're sustaining it right now, and that could be a function of how the U.S. consumer sees Europe right now with all the noise over there and so on.

But before that, let me comment on the booking window for 2012. We do believe that while the booking window has come in, it's not a huge mount but it has come in, which always makes it more of a challenge when you're sitting in a revenue management seat in terms of how to price your cruises and how firm you want to be on your pricing, knowing the business does come in late. But at the end of the day, we fill up. We'll fill up with the same kind of occupancy levels than last year. Actually, this year, we're going to probably be up at least a point or more from an occupancy standpoint. What we need to manage through that process, given the closer end booking window, in each of the revenue management teams in different brands do it slightly different. They don't use the same revenue management approach. And so it will depend on how they see the world. But as long as bookings are sustainable at the levels that we're talking about today, we should be just fine. Because as I said, bookings for the last 13 weeks, actually, there's been some ebb and flows but they've been okay. I mean, we've been able to move pricing slightly downward and the bookings have picked up. And in the last 6 weeks, it's even been stronger. Don't ask me why, by the way. You never really know but bookings have been stronger and if that sustains itself, the booking window will extend out. That's what we look to try to do, and then we can revenue management pricing a little bit better."

We could always move the booking window further out but there's a cost to that and pricing so we'd rather be patient, and it seems to be working well for us over the last couple of years. In terms of 2008, 2008, if you go back, that was the year that was really an aberration. If you -- we had looked back from '03 through 2011, and the one year that really stuck out was 2008.

We have seen that well. So that has held up nicely for us.

Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.

I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currencies unless otherwise noted as this is a more useful measure of business trends. 
Our earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.28. The fourth quarter came in right at the midpoint of our September guidance. 
Now let's take a look at the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 6%, with 2/3 of the increase coming from our Europe, Australia and Asian brands, or as we call them, our EAA brands. Our EAA brands grew 10%, while our North American brands grew 3%. 
Our net ticket -- our net revenue yields increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter, with similar increases in both net ticket and net onboard and other revenue yields. With respect to net ticket revenue yields, our North American brands were up almost 8% despite the negative impact from MENA on European itineraries. The improvement was driven by higher yields in the Caribbean, Alaska, Canada, New England and transatlantic itineraries. 
Our EAA brands, which are principally cruising in Europe during the fourth quarter, were down over 6%. The yield decline was primarily driven by the impact on MENA itineraries. 
In net onboard and other revenue yields, we experienced a 1.4% increase. This increase was also driven by our North American brands as our EAA brands were impacted from MENA itinerary changes that resulted in lower occupancies, lower shore excursion revenues and slightly lower spending in other areas. 
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per available lower berth day, were down 2% versus the prior year. The decline was driven by ship incident repair costs in the prior year. As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per ALBD declined 4% this quarter, continuing our multiyear savings trend. In total, this represents a 15% savings since 2005. However, fuel prices this quarter were 39% higher than last year, which cost us $0.21 per share. 
In summary, the fourth quarter EPS was $0.28, lower than the 2010 earnings of $0.31 per share, as increased yields and lower net cruise costs excluding fuel mostly offset higher fuel prices. 
Looking at the full year 2011. Our EPS was $2.42, which was slightly lower than the prior year's $2.47 as increased net revenue yields, a 5% capacity increase and a favorable benefit from currency were more than offset by a 32% increase in the price of fuel. For 2011, our net revenue yields increased 2%. This was driven by an almost 4% improvement in our North American brands, while our EAA brands were in line with the prior year despite all of their challenges. 
Our 2011 EPS was $0.58 lower than the midpoint of the original guidance that we gave one year ago of $2.90 to $3.10 per share. I think it's fair to say that 2011 was a year of unexpected challenges. 
The geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the natural disaster in Japan, resulted in over 300 itinerary changes, which we estimate cost us $0.27. Fuel prices increased 23% above our original guidance, and while we benefited from currency, the net effect of fuel and currency cost us an additional $0.41. Absent these items, we would have been at the high end of our original guidance range from a year ago. 
In the end, our operating companies performed very well, mitigating the impact of MENA, the European debt crisis, recessionary fears and stock market volatility. This is a testament to the quality of our management team, the power of our brands and the value proposition of the cruise business. 
Turning to cash flow. As Micky indicated in the press release, our cash from operations reached $3.8 billion, which was more than enough to fund the ship expansion and refurbishment programs that required a capital investment of $2.7 billion, leaving us with free cash flow of $1.1 billion. 
Earlier in 2011, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. Also, during the year, we opportunistically repurchased 14.8 million shares at an average price of $31 for a total of $455 million. The majority of these shares were repurchased during the third quarter. Only 300,000 shares were repurchased since our last conference call. It should be noted that in 2011, the dividend paid and the share repurchases totaled $1.1 billion, which represented all of our 2011 free cash flow. 
Before turning to the 2012 outlook, I would like to update you on our recently implemented fuel derivative program. The program was intended to mitigate a portion of our economic risk attributable to potentially significant fuel price increases. As part of this program, we will evaluate various derivative products and strategies. To date, we have bought 0 cost collars for approximately 10% of our estimated fuel consumption for the second half of fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2015, with ceilings ranging from $125 to $135 and floors ranging from $71 to $75. 
We designed the fuel derivative program to maximize operational flexibility by utilizing derivative markets with significant trading liquidity. These derivatives act as effective economic hedges. However, hedge accounting was not applied. Accordingly, the impact of realized gains and losses on the fuel derivatives that mature each period, as well as changes in unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on our outstanding fuel derivatives, are recorded as a nonoperating item in our P&L. 
We believe it's more meaningful to evaluate our earnings performance by excluding the impact of the unrealized gains and losses until the gains and losses are realized, and we've added a line to our P&L to reflect this exclusion, labeled Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share. 
Going forward, we will not include in our earnings guidance any year-to-date impact or any future estimates of the unrealized gains and losses on the fuel derivatives. Accordingly, our earnings guidance will be on a non-GAAP basis. However, we will forecast realized gains and losses on fuel derivatives by applying the current Brent oil prices to the derivatives settle in the forecast period. Based on this approach and the current prices, we are not forecasting any realized gains or losses for 2012 under our current fuel derivative portfolio. 
Now turning to our 2012 outlook. I will skip net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs per available lower berth day are forecasted to be flat versus the prior year, which is at the low end of our longer-term guidance of flat to half of inflation. 
As fuel and currency are assumptions that impact our results, it should be noted that the current spot price for fuel used in our guidance is essentially in line with 2011's average price. However, based on the current FX rates, currency is expected to have a negative impact on our earnings next year of $0.17. 
On a final note, I wanted to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact of fuel and currency on our results. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel represents a $225 million or $0.29 per share impact for the full year. In addition, note that the 10% change obviously moves along with the price of fuel. 
With respect to FX movement, the 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.25 a share for the full year. 
At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard."

Using the midpoint, we estimate that operating cash flow for 2012 will approach $4 billion. With CapEx estimated at $2.6 billion, free cash flow for the year should be approximately $1.4 billion. 
With 2 ships currently scheduled for delivery in each of 2013, '14 and '15, we are expecting that free cash flow will continue to increase in each of these subsequent years. 
Turning back to our 2012 earnings guidance, we have established this wider range of guidance this year, given the uncertain global economic outlook and the even greater uncertainty in European markets because of the sovereign debt crisis. The $0.30 per share range for 2012 compares to the $0.20 share range we have used in recent years. 
Needless to say, our crystal ball for 2012 is somewhat hazier than in past years and thus a little more caution to our guidance. However, notwithstanding the global economic uncertainty, we are confident we can grow our earnings in 2012. The amount of earnings growth will depend on the revenue yield improvement we can achieve during the year. 
And turning now to our booking trends, our more recent booking trends. There has been an ebb and flow to booking patterns over the last 13 weeks. Lower consumer confidence around the world and worries about the European sovereign debt crisis and its effect on European consumer pocketbooks have caused some delay in consumer vacation decisions and resulted in a closer end booking window. Although fleet-wide booking volumes during the last 13-week period have been running nicely higher year-over-year, we have achieved this volume by reducing prices for our cruises. But the good news is that consumers have responded to these lower prices and the booking volumes have increased. 
North America brand booking volumes for the 13 weeks have been running higher than a year ago at lower prices. EAA brand bookings are slightly higher at lower prices. More recent bookings over the last 6 weeks have seen an even stronger pickup in booking volumes for both North America and Europe brands, which is an encouraging sign. The booking patterns during the upcoming wave season, which starts in early January, will give us a better indicator as to what the revenue yield picture will look like for the remainder of the year. 
In terms of our current booking status at the present time, based on bookings taken to date, constant dollar ticket prices for both North America and EAA brands are slightly higher than a year ago on slightly lower year occupancies. This is a combination of stronger booking patterns during the last spring and summer and the weaker prices for bookings experienced during the 13 -- this last 13-week period. 
We are currently guiding to yield improvement of a range of 1% to 2% for the year or a midpoint of 1.5%. To some degree, this yield improvement results from the significant hit we took on pricing and occupancy for our European and Mediterranean itineraries in 2011, which arose from the political upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa. We expect to improve our year-over-year occupancy for these cruises, which will be a major contributor to the forecasted revenue yield improvement in 2012. 
Given the bookings already taken for 2012 and our forecasted pricing for the remainder of the year, which has factored in the economic headwinds in our various markets, we are comfortable with the 1% to 2% revenue yield range improvement for the year. 
In terms of our earnings guidance for 2012, broadly speaking, our forecasted earnings improvement for 2012 comes from a higher yield of approximately 1.5%, a fleet-wide capacity increase of 4.8%, and it's offset by the negative effect of the changes in currency, which David mentioned before, on a year-over-year basis. 
Our fuel pricing forecast is relatively unchanged year-over-year, although it does have a significant impact on the first quarter of 2012, which I will comment on later. As we indicated in the press release, earnings for the first quarter of 2012 will be lower than a year ago, principally because of the higher fuel costs and the higher number of dry-dock days. However, we expect to get back to positive earnings growth from the second quarter onward as yield comparisons become more favorable. 
For the present time, we plan to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, which represents approximately 37% of our earnings and is in line with our stated guidance of paying a dividend from 30% to 40% of earnings. 
Now turning to the first quarter. Fleet-wide capacity for the first quarter is expected to be 4.9% higher than last year, 4.5% for North America brands and 5.6% for EAA brands. At the present time, first quarter occupancies on a fleet-wide basis was slightly higher year-over-year, with constant dollar pricing also higher. There's very little inventory left to sell at this point for the first quarter. 
North America brands in the first quarter are 65% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is higher than a year ago at slightly higher occupancies as compared to last year. Pricing for all other itineraries is also slightly higher than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies. 
For EAA brands, they are 22% in the Caribbean in the first quarter versus 20% last year, 19% in Europe and down from 22% last year and 18% in South America versus 16% last year, so a bit of a shift from Europe to South America, with the balance in all other itineraries. EAA constant dollar pricing in the Caribbean is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. EAA pricing in Europe is lower year-over-year but with higher occupancies, and EAA South America pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on higher occupancies. 
With respect to the first quarter outlook, with a good percentage of our bookings for the first quarter completed, we are forecasting that constant dollar revenue yields for the quarter will increase in 1.5% to 2.5% range compared to last year. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to increase in the 3.5% to 4.5% range in constant dollars, largely due to the higher year-over-year dry-docking days scheduled in the first quarter of 2012. 
Fuel costs are significantly higher in the first quarter this year versus last year and are expected to increase by approximately $93 million or $0.12 a share. Incremental costs for the increased number of dry-dock days versus the first quarter of 2011 is approximately $0.06 a share. This is a timing difference in these dry-dock days that will reverse during the remainder of the year as the dry-dock days for the full year 2012 is approximately the same as 2011. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, including the higher fuel prices, the company is guiding first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.10 per share. For an apples-to-apples comparison, if we add back the $0.18 per share for the fuel price increases in dry-dock day, the earning per share would have been $0.24 to $0.28 versus the $0.19 per share in 2011. 
Turning to the second quarter now, fleet-wide capacity for the second quarter is up 4.7%, 2.9% for North America brands and 7.6% for EAA brands. At the present time on a fleet-wide basis, constant dollar pricing is slightly higher than a year ago, with occupancies lower than last year. For North American brands, they are 56% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on approximately the same occupancy levels as last year. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. For EAA brands, they are 53% in Europe, down from 55% last year, with the balance in various other markets. 
EAA brand constant dollar European cruise pricing is slightly higher than a year ago on slightly lower occupancies. EAA brand pricing on all other itineraries taken together is slightly lower than last year, also at lower occupancies. On an overall basis, our estimate is that constant dollar revenue yields will be flattish for the second quarter by the time it closes. 
Turning now to the third quarter of 2012. Capacity in that third quarter is expected to increase 4.7%, 3.3% in North America and 7% in EAA. Third quarter booking patterns are still in early development, so I caution you not to read too much into this data. On a fleet-wide basis, third quarter constant dollar pricing is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. 
For North America brands, capacity in the third quarter is 39% in the Caribbean versus 36% last year; 24% in Alaska, slightly higher than a year ago; and 25% in Europe, which is about the same as last year. Pricing for Caribbean, Alaska and Europe itineraries are all higher than a year ago. Occupancies for the Caribbean and Alaska cruises are running at about the same level as last year, with occupancies for Europe cruises lower than last year. 
EAA brand capacity is 88% in European itineraries, in line with last year. EAA brand constant dollar pricing for European and all other itineraries is nicely higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. 
While the pricing picture for the third quarter is quite good right now, there is a considerable amount of third quarter inventory remaining to be sold. Much of the third quarter revenue picture will depend on the strength for 2012 wave season. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect that revenue yields for the last 3 quarters of 2012 will benefit from the easier comparisons to the 2011 year. We took a hit as a result of the itinerary disruptions from MENA. All things being equal, that should have produced higher yield improvement in 2012. However, 2012 is proving more challenging than originally thought because of the European sovereign debt crisis and lower consumer confidence in Europe. 
So that's our thoughts about how 2012 is currently shaping up. And with that, Tommy, I'll turn it back to you for -- we're ready for questions."

In fact, in some of the markets, we're doing just fine on pricing. In other markets, we're feeling more -- we're seeing less demand, particularly, I think more so in Europe than in North America, broadly speaking. That's been more of a challenge for us. We have taken a number of pricing actions in those markets, and as I mentioned, where we're seeing the softer pricing. And we're also looking at options for how to move inventory and moving from one market to another and that sort of thing in Europe, which we think will be -- which will have some benefit. But clearly, if you look at southern European markets, it's more of a challenge, less so as we see in the U.K. and Germany. And broadly speaking, U.S., more or less, seems to be holding up well, except I think we're seeing more of a challenge on our European programs this coming summer for our North American brands. And that could be a combination of factors including higher air costs and just some -- all the noise that Americans are hearing about what's going on in Europe. Although you wouldn't think it would affect their vacation decisions, I think the psychology of the consumer today is that there is a greater concern. And the patterns come closer in, but we're holding it. We're holding as much pricing as we can. We think that if we have a decent wave season, we should be just fine."

It just so happens that the current spot price for 2012 happens to be very much in line with 2011. That's more of a coincidence. It's not that we used the 2011. As far as Brent and bunker, they're really -- there was a big dislocation in the market that seemed to occur about a year ago, where Brent and bunker seemed to move in different directions. I think they got as wide as about $25 or $30 a barrel of difference. There's a lot of issues with WTI and Brent and the correlation between the 2. But if you look at over time, I think what you'll find is that Brent and bunker or our fuel prices had a much better correlation. The correlation used to be in the 70s, in the mid-70s. It did move up into the 90s. It's recently come back to the high 80s, and it has stayed in the high 80s, low 90s for a period of time now so there's been a pretty good correlation. One of the reasons why we chose to use Brent as part of our a fuel alternative program, the long-term movement between the 70s and the high 80s has a lot to do with refining capacity and all types of things that we've talked about historically in the conference call, so not expecting that the crack spreads or the -- will come down when you compare our fuel price to Brent. As far as your last question, the correlation between the euro and bunker, I mean, we've said historically that there is a -- that these move in opposite directions. That has worked most of the time but they're not a complete offset to each other. There's many other economic factors affecting these 2 items. I'm sure that all of the dislocation and all of the debt crisis and everything else going in Europe today is causing the euro to move, and that's much more so than the overall price of bunker. So while they have been a nice natural hedge, it doesn't always work perfectly for us, and they don't move in opposite directions all the time."

So there's a regular schedule for dry docks, and we're always going to have dry docks. On a year-over-year basis, '11 to '12, the total number of dry-dock days were pretty much in line. They went up slightly with capacity overall. So on a year-over-year basis, it's really no issue. It's just the timing. Remember, the brands individually choose to do dry docks in what appears to be the most convenient time for them, usually the lowest profit season. And this year, we just happened to have more dry docks scheduled for the first quarter and less dry docks scheduled for the second and fourth quarter, so it's just the timing within the year and not an issue on an overall basis for the year. And our cruise costs are flat. The dry docks aren't affecting cruise costs for the full year, only the seasonalization of cruise costs between the quarter. As far as the cash flow is concerned, I think the story really hasn't changed from what we've been saying for the last couple of years. We've been talking about the fact that we do expect to have free cash flow. It's our goal to return the free cash flow to shareholders. We've indicated, I think Howard mentioned in his comments, the 30% to 40% payout ratio for regular quarterly dividend. In addition to that, we've constantly been saying we will look at opportunistic share repurchases. And if need be, we can look at an additional annual dividend on top of that. We managed through the quarterly dividend and the opportunistic share repurchases to return all our free cash flow in 2011. And in 2012, we'll take a look at the opportunities as they arise."

So it's really a combination of all those things, including the U.S. market, which seems to be relatively good right now. I mean, all 3 of our 4 U.S. brands seem to be performing well, with the possible exception, as I mentioned earlier, about summer Europe, which is okay from a pricing standpoint at this point but has fallen behind from an occupancy. But we're sustaining it right now, and that could be a function of how the U.S. consumer sees Europe right now with all the noise over there and so on.

But before that, let me comment on the booking window for 2012. We do believe that while the booking window has come in, it's not a huge mount but it has come in, which always makes it more of a challenge when you're sitting in a revenue management seat in terms of how to price your cruises and how firm you want to be on your pricing, knowing the business does come in late. But at the end of the day, we fill up. We'll fill up with the same kind of occupancy levels as last year. Actually, this year, we're going to probably be up at least a point or more from an occupancy standpoint. What we need to manage through that process, given the closer end booking window, in each of the revenue management there are teams [ph] in different brands do it slightly different. They don't use the same revenue management approach. And so it will depend on how they see the world. But as long as bookings are sustainable at the levels that we're talking about today, we should be just fine. Because as I said, bookings for the last 13 weeks, actually, there's been some ebb and flows, but they've been okay. I mean, we've been able to move pricing slightly downward, and the bookings have picked up. And in the last 6 weeks, it's even been stronger. Don't ask me why, by the way. You never really know, but bookings have been stronger. And if that sustains itself, the booking window will extend out.

In terms of 2008, 2008, if you go back, that was the year that was really an aberration. If you -- we had looked back from '03 through 2011, and the one year that really stuck out was 2008.

As we look at the business in certain parts -- certain of our markets, I think part of the reasons we're holding price and bookings have been strong in certain markets is because some of the premium products here in the U.S. and to some degree in Europe and our market segment, which is towards the retired people or wealthier people, is holding up fine. We have seen that well. So that has held up nicely for us. And I think that's -- so even in the U.K. where there's a huge -- a number of austerity programs being implemented, it seems to affect less the consumer who is retired and they feel more comfortable with their holdings and their retirement plans and somewhat. So we're getting good business out of the U.K. And in terms of our U.S. premium brands, they're doing quite nicely, yes.

Now let's take a look at the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 6%, with 2/3 of the increase coming from our Europe, Australia and Asian brands, or as we call them, our EAA brands. Our EAA brands grew 10%, while our North American brands grew 3%. 
Our net ticket -- our net revenue yields increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter, with similar increases in both net ticket and net onboard and other revenue yields. With respect to net ticket revenue yields, our North American brands were up almost 8% despite the negative impact from MENA on European itineraries. The improvement was driven by higher yields in the Caribbean, Alaska, Canada, New England and transatlantic itineraries. 
Our EAA brands, which are principally cruising in Europe during the fourth quarter, were down over 6%. The yield decline was primarily driven by the impact on MENA itineraries. 
In net onboard and other revenue yields, we experienced a 1.4% increase. This increase was also driven by our North American brands as our EAA brands were impacted from MENA itinerary changes that resulted in lower occupancies, lower shore excursion revenues and slightly lower spending in other areas. 
On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per available lower berth day, were down 2% versus the prior year. The decline was driven by ship incident repair costs in the prior year. As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per ALBD declined 4% this quarter, continuing our multiyear savings trend. In total, this represents a 15% savings since 2005. However, fuel prices this quarter were 39% higher than last year, which cost us $0.21 per share. 
In summary, the fourth quarter EPS was $0.28, lower than the 2010 earnings of $0.31 per share, as increased yields and lower net cruise costs excluding fuel mostly offset higher fuel prices. 
Looking at the full year 2011. Our EPS was $2.42, which was slightly lower than the prior year's $2.47 as increased net revenue yields, a 5% capacity increase and a favorable benefit from currency were more than offset by a 32% increase in the price of fuel. For 2011, our net revenue yields increased 2%. This was driven by an almost 4% improvement in our North American brands, while our EAA brands were in line with the prior year despite all of their challenges. 
Our 2011 EPS was $0.58 lower than the midpoint of the original guidance that we gave one year ago of $2.90 to $3.10 per share. I think it's fair to say that 2011 was a year of unexpected challenges. 
The geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the natural disaster in Japan, resulted in over 300 itinerary changes, which we estimate cost us $0.27. Fuel prices increased 23% above our original guidance, and while we benefited from currency, the net effect of fuel and currency cost us an additional $0.41. Absent these items, we would have been at the high end of our original guidance range from a year ago. 
In the end, our operating companies performed very well, mitigating the impact of MENA, the European debt crisis, recessionary fears and stock market volatility. This is a testament to the quality of our management team, the power of our brands and the value proposition of the cruise business. 
Turning to cash flow. As Micky indicated in the press release, our cash from operations reached $3.8 billion, which was more than enough to fund the ship expansion and refurbishment programs that required a capital investment of $2.7 billion, leaving us with free cash flow of $1.1 billion. 
Earlier in 2011, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. Also, during the year, we opportunistically repurchased 14.8 million shares at an average price of $31 for a total of $455 million. The majority of these shares were repurchased during the third quarter. Only 300,000 shares were repurchased since our last conference call. It should be noted that in 2011, the dividends paid and the share repurchases totaled $1.1 billion, which represented all of our 2011 free cash flow. 
Before turning to the 2012 outlook, I would like to update you on our recently implemented fuel derivative program. The program was intended to mitigate a portion of our economic risk attributable to potentially significant fuel price increases. As part of this program, we will evaluate various derivative products and strategies. To date, we have bought 0 cost collars for approximately 10% of our estimated fuel consumption for the second half of fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2015, with ceilings ranging from $125 to $135 and floors ranging from $71 to $75. 
We designed the fuel derivative program to maximize operational flexibility by utilizing derivative markets with significant trading liquidity. These derivatives act as effective economic hedges. However, hedge accounting was not applied. Accordingly, the impact of realized gains and losses on the fuel derivatives that mature each period, as well as changes in unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on our outstanding fuel derivatives, are recorded as a nonoperating item in our P&L. 
We believe it's more meaningful to evaluate our earnings performance by excluding the impact of the unrealized gains and losses until the gains and losses are realized, and we've added a line to our P&L to reflect this exclusion, labeled Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share. 
Going forward, we will not include in our earnings guidance any year-to-date impact or any future estimates of the unrealized gains and losses on the fuel derivatives. Accordingly, our earnings guidance will be on a non-GAAP basis. However, we will forecast realized gains and losses on fuel derivatives by applying the current Brent oil prices to the derivatives that settle in the forecast period. Based on this approach and the current prices, we are not forecasting any realized gains or losses for 2012 under our current fuel derivative portfolio. 
Now turning to our 2012 outlook. I will skip net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs per available lower berth day are forecasted to be flat versus the prior year, which is at the low end of our longer-term guidance of flat to half of inflation. 
As fuel and currency are assumptions that impact our results, it should be noted that the current spot price for fuel used in our guidance is essentially in line with 2011's average price. However, based on the current FX rates, currency is expected to have a negative impact on our earnings next year of $0.17. 
On a final note, I wanted to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact of fuel and currency on our results. To start with, a 10% change in the price of fuel represents a $225 million or $0.29 per share impact for the full year. In addition, note that the 10% change obviously moves along with the price of fuel. 
With respect to FX movement, the 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.25 a share for the full year. 
At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard."
258823,144510989,203011,"Carnival Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2011",2011-12-20,"Earnings Calls","Carnival Corporation & plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Let me frame for you, if you will, the 2012 outlook for our business. We have 3 new ships scheduled for delivery in 2012: the Costa Fascinosa, which gets delivered in late April; the AIDAmar in May; and the Carnival Breeze in late May. S",1796,"Thank you, David. Let me frame for you, if you will, the 2012 outlook for our business. We have 3 new ships scheduled for delivery in 2012: the Costa Fascinosa, which gets delivered in late April; the AIDAmar in May; and the Carnival Breeze in late May. So we have 3 spring deliveries. This will drive a fleet-wide capacity increase of 4.8%, 3.6% for the North America fleet and 6.6% for the EAA fleet. 
Earnings guidance for 2012 has been established with a range of $2.55 to $2.85, which gives us a midpoint of $2.70 a share. Using the midpoint, we estimate that operating cash flow for 2012 will approach $4 billion. With CapEx estimated at $2.6 billion, free cash flow for the year should be approximately $1.4 billion. 
With 2 ships currently scheduled for delivery in each of 2013, '14 and '15, we are expecting that free cash flow will continue to increase in each of these subsequent years. 
Turning back to our 2012 earnings guidance, we have established this wider range of guidance this year, given the uncertain global economic outlook and the even greater uncertainty in European markets because of the sovereign debt crisis. The $0.30 per share range for 2012 compares to the $0.20 share range we have used in recent years. 
Needless to say, our crystal ball for 2012 is somewhat hazier than in past years and thus a little more caution to our guidance. However, notwithstanding the global economic uncertainty, we are confident we can grow our earnings in 2012. The amount of earnings growth will depend on the revenue yield improvement we can achieve during the year. 
And turning now to our booking trends, our more recent booking trends. There has been an ebb and flow to booking patterns over the last 13 weeks. Lower consumer confidence around the world and worries about the European sovereign debt crisis and its effect on European consumer pocketbooks have caused some delay in consumer vacation decisions and resulted in a closer end booking window. Although fleet-wide booking volumes during the last 13-week period have been running nicely higher year-over-year, we have achieved this volume by reducing prices for our cruises. But the good news is that consumers have responded to these lower prices and the booking volumes have increased. 
North America brand booking volumes for the 13 weeks have been running higher than a year ago at lower prices. EAA brand bookings are slightly higher at lower prices. More recent bookings over the last 6 weeks have seen an even stronger pickup in booking volumes for both North America and Europe brands, which is an encouraging sign. The booking patterns during the upcoming wave season, which starts in early January, will give us a better indicator as to what the revenue yield picture will look like for the remainder of the year. 
In terms of our current booking status at the present time, based on bookings taken to date, constant dollar ticket prices for both North America and EAA brands are slightly higher than a year ago on slightly lower year occupancies. This is a combination of stronger booking patterns during the last spring and summer and the weaker prices for bookings experienced during the 13 -- this last 13-week period. 
We are currently guiding to yield improvement of a range of 1% to 2% for the year or a midpoint of 1.5%. To some degree, this yield improvement results from the significant hit we took on pricing and occupancy for our European and Mediterranean itineraries in 2011, which arose from the political upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa. We expect to improve our year-over-year occupancy for these cruises, which will be a major contributor to the forecasted revenue yield improvement in 2012. 
Given the bookings already taken for 2012 and our forecasted pricing for the remainder of the year, which has factored in the economic headwinds in our various markets, we are comfortable with the 1% to 2% revenue yield range improvement for the year. 
In terms of our earnings guidance for 2012, broadly speaking, our forecasted earnings improvement for 2012 comes from a higher yield of approximately 1.5%, a fleet-wide capacity increase of 4.8%, and it's offset by the negative effect of the changes in currency, which David mentioned before, on a year-over-year basis. 
Our fuel pricing forecast is relatively unchanged year-over-year, although it does have a significant impact on the first quarter of 2012, which I will comment on later. As we indicated in the press release, earnings for the first quarter of 2012 will be lower than a year ago, principally because of the higher fuel costs and the higher number of dry-dock days. However, we expect to get back to positive earnings growth from the second quarter onward as yield comparisons become more favorable. 
For the present time, we plan to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, which represents approximately 37% of our earnings and is in line with our stated guidance of paying a dividend from 30% to 40% of earnings. 
Now turning to the first quarter. Fleet-wide capacity for the first quarter is expected to be 4.9% higher than last year, 4.5% for North America brands and 5.6% for EAA brands. At the present time, first quarter occupancies on a fleet-wide basis was slightly higher year-over-year, with constant dollar pricing also higher. There's very little inventory left to sell at this point for the first quarter. 
North America brands in the first quarter are 65% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is higher than a year ago at slightly higher occupancies as compared to last year. Pricing for all other itineraries is also slightly higher than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies. 
For EAA brands, they are 22% in the Caribbean in the first quarter versus 20% last year, 19% in Europe and down from 22% last year and 18% in South America versus 16% last year, so a bit of a shift from Europe to South America, with the balance in all other itineraries. EAA constant dollar pricing in the Caribbean is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. EAA pricing in Europe is lower year-over-year but with higher occupancies, and EAA South America pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on higher occupancies. 
With respect to the first quarter outlook, with a good percentage of our bookings for the first quarter completed, we are forecasting that constant dollar revenue yields for the quarter will increase in 1.5% to 2.5% range compared to last year. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to increase in the 3.5% to 4.5% range in constant dollars, largely due to the higher year-over-year dry-docking days scheduled in the first quarter of 2012. 
Fuel costs are significantly higher in the first quarter this year versus last year and are expected to increase by approximately $93 million or $0.12 a share. Incremental costs for the increased number of dry-dock days versus the first quarter of 2011 is approximately $0.06 a share. This is a timing difference in these dry-dock days that will reverse during the remainder of the year as the dry-dock days for the full year 2012 is approximately the same as 2011. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, including the higher fuel prices, the company is guiding first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.10 per share. For an apples-to-apples comparison, if we add back the $0.18 per share for the fuel price increases in dry-dock day, the earning per share would have been $0.24 to $0.28 versus the $0.19 per share in 2011. 
Turning to the second quarter now, fleet-wide capacity for the second quarter is up 4.7%, 2.9% for North America brands and 7.6% for EAA brands. At the present time on a fleet-wide basis, constant dollar pricing is slightly higher than a year ago, with occupancies lower than last year. For North American brands, they are 56% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago on approximately the same occupancy levels as last year. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. For EAA brands, they are 53% in Europe, down from 55% last year, with the balance in various other markets. 
EAA brand constant dollar European cruise pricing is slightly higher than a year ago on slightly lower occupancies. EAA brand pricing on all other itineraries taken together is slightly lower than last year, also at lower occupancies. On an overall basis, our estimate is that constant dollar revenue yields will be flattish for the second quarter by the time it closes. 
Turning now to the third quarter of 2012. Capacity in that third quarter is expected to increase 4.7%, 3.3% in North America and 7% in EAA. Third quarter booking patterns are still in early development, so I caution you not to read too much into this data. On a fleet-wide basis, third quarter constant dollar pricing is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. 
For North America brands, capacity in the third quarter is 39% in the Caribbean versus 36% last year; 24% in Alaska, slightly higher than a year ago; and 25% in Europe, which is about the same as last year. Pricing for Caribbean, Alaska and Europe itineraries are all higher than a year ago. Occupancies for the Caribbean and Alaska cruises are running at about the same level as last year, with occupancies for Europe cruises lower than last year. 
EAA brand capacity is 88% in European itineraries, in line with last year. EAA brand constant dollar pricing for European and all other itineraries is nicely higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. 
While the pricing picture for the third quarter is quite good right now, there is a considerable amount of third quarter inventory remaining to be sold. Much of the third quarter revenue picture will depend on the strength of the 2012 wave season. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect that revenue yields for the last 3 quarters of 2012 will benefit from the easier comparisons to the 2011 year. We took a hit as a result of the itinerary disruptions from MENA. All things being equal, that should have produced higher yield improvement in 2012. However, 2012 is proving more challenging than originally thought because of the European sovereign debt crisis and lower consumer confidence in Europe. 
So that's our thoughts about how 2012 is currently shaping up. And with that, Tommy, I'll turn it back to you for -- we're ready for questions."

In fact, in some of the markets, we're doing just fine on pricing. In other markets, we're feeling more -- we're seeing less demand, particularly, I think more so in Europe than in North America, broadly speaking. That's been more of a challenge for us. We have taken a number of pricing actions in those markets, and as I mentioned, where we're seeing the softer pricing. And we're also looking at options for how to move inventory and moving from one market to another and that sort of thing in Europe, which we think will be -- which will have some benefit. But clearly, if you look at southern European markets, it's more of a challenge, less so as we see in the U.K. and Germany. And broadly speaking, U.S., more or less, seems to be holding up well, except I think we're seeing more of a challenge on our European programs this coming summer for our North American brands. And that could be a combination of factors including higher air costs and just some -- all the noise that Americans are hearing about what's going on in Europe. Although you wouldn't think it would affect their vacation decisions, I think the psychology of the consumer today is that there is a greater concern. And the patterns come closer in, but we're holding it. We're holding as much pricing as we can. We think that if we have a decent wave season, we should be just fine."

It just so happens that the current spot price for 2012 happens to be very much in line with 2011. That's more of a coincidence. It's not that we used the 2011. As far as Brent and bunker, they're really -- there was a big dislocation in the market that seemed to occur about a year ago, where Brent and bunker seemed to move in different directions. I think they got as wide as about $25 or $30 a barrel difference. There's a lot of issues with WTI and Brent and the correlation between the 2. But if you look at over time, I think what you'll find is that Brent and bunker or our fuel prices had a much better correlation. The correlation used to be in the 70s, in the mid-70s. It did move up into the 90s. It's recently come back to the high 80s, and it has stayed in the high 80s, low 90s for a period of time now, so there's been a pretty good correlation. One of the reasons why we chose to use Brent as part of our a fuel derivative program, the long-term movement between the 70s and the high 80s has a lot to do with refining capacity and all types of things that we've talked about historically in the conference call, so not expecting that the crack spreads or the -- will come down when you compare our fuel price to Brent. As far as your last question, the correlation between the euro and bunker, I mean, we've said historically that there is a -- that these move in opposite directions. That has worked most of the time, but they're not a complete offset to each other. There's many other economic factors affecting these 2 items.

So there's a regular schedule for dry docks, and we're always going to have dry docks. On a year-over-year basis, '11 to '12, the total number of dry-dock days were pretty much in line. They went up slightly with capacity overall. So on a year-over-year basis, it's really no issue. It's just the timing. Remember, the brands individually choose to do dry docks in what appears to be the most convenient time for them, usually the lowest profit season. And this year, we just happened to have more dry docks scheduled for the first quarter and less dry docks scheduled for the second and fourth quarter, so it's just the timing within the year and not an issue on an overall basis for the year. And our cruise costs are flat. The dry docks aren't affecting cruise costs for the full year, only the seasonalization of cruise costs between the quarter. As far as the cash flow is concerned, I think the story really hasn't changed from what we've been saying for the last couple of years. We've been talking about the fact that we do expect to have free cash flow. It's our goal to return the free cash flow to shareholders. We've indicated, I think Howard mentioned in his comments, the 30% to 40% payout ratio for regular quarterly dividend. In addition to that, we've constantly been saying we will look at opportunistic share repurchases. And if need be, we can look at an additional annual dividend on top of that. We managed through the quarterly dividend and the opportunistic share repurchases to return all our free cash flow in 2011. And in 2012, we'll take a look at the opportunities as they arise."

We do believe that while the booking window has come in, it's not a huge amount but it has come in, which always makes it more of a challenge when you're sitting in a revenue management seat in terms of how to price your cruises and how firm you want to be on your pricing, knowing the business does come in late. But at the end of the day, we fill up. We'll fill up with the same kind of occupancy levels as last year. Actually, this year, we're going to probably be up at least a point or more from an occupancy standpoint. What we need to manage through that process, given the closer end booking window, and each of the revenue management teams in different brands do it slightly different. They don't use the same revenue management approach. And so it will depend on how they see the world. But as long as bookings are sustainable at the levels that we're talking about today, we should be just fine. Because as I said, bookings for the last 13 weeks, actually, there's been some ebb and flows, but they've been okay.

But apart from that, I think it's unlikely to happen. I think the intent is ultimately to save the euro, really."

There is clearly a negative repercussion in cost to it because you wind up losing a lot of the people you have booked and you have to rebook them, and that tends to force you to lower prices. So that's a last resort when the situation is really dire, so it's not something we want -- we would want to do at the last minute. It's something that we clearly can do year-over-year at adjusting to booking patterns and customer taste, and that's what Costa did and a number of our brands did. We tweaked the itineraries, increased capacity a little bit in Alaska, increased capacity a little bit in northern Europe, held capacity in the Mediterranean. So we tweak this from year-to-year, but close in, only in a dramatic situation would we move like that."
