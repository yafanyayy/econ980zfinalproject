Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel, and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2009 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $136 million, or $1.68 per share, a per share increase of 14% from a year ago. Net income was $155 million, or $1.91 per share, a 40% increase from $1.36 a year ago.
For the year, net operating income was $526 million, or $6.41 a share, a per share increase of 7% over 2009. Net income per share for the year grew 29% to $6.30.
Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 13.8% and our book value per share was $49.03, an 11% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 22% for the year to $49.86 per share.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 4% to $415 million and life-underwriting margin increased 5% to $115 million. Life net sales declined 5% in the quarter to 77 million, but finished the year up 1% at $330 million.
Life first-year collected premiums were up 1% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $144 million and life-underwriting margin was up 12% to $48 million.
Net life sales declined 7% for the quarter to 33 million, but grew 8% for the full year. On the last call, I mentioned several actions being taken to renew our growth in producing agents and sales at American Income.
These initiatives are progressing and we should begin to see a turnaround in the first quarter. We have, however, reduced our growth expectations for new sales to the mid-single-digit range for 2011 at American Income.
In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $138 million while life underwriting margin was down 4% to $34 million. Net life sales were up 1% for the quarter to $31 million and grew 4% for the full year.
With the difficult economic conditions, I’m pleased with the 4% sales growth in 2010 at Globe Life. Barring another significant turndown in the economy, we now expect improved sales growth in 2011 in the 8% to 10% range.
Life premiums at Liberty National declined 1% to $73 million and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $17 million. Net life sales declined 11% to $10.8 million for the quarter and were down 19% for the full year to $45 million.
Much effort was given during 2010 to improve the underwriting margins at Liberty National. In addition to improving our persistency, significant rate increases were implemented during the fourth quarter on the life insurance portfolio. We also closed or consolidated a number of unprofitable offices during the year. While these changes were necessary, they did adversely affect our new sales. The negative impact of these changes are mostly behind us and we fully expect to see double-digit growth in our life sales at Liberty National in 2011.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 6% to $188 million, while health underwriting margin grew 3% to $35 million. Health net sales declined 49% for the quarter to $20 million and were down 33% for the full year.
Most of the decline in health sales was in our Group Medicare Supplement business, which had an extremely strong fourth quarter of 2009. Also, the new business generated from Medicare Advantage disenrollees was disappointing, as 86% of those people dis-enrolled chose to re-enroll in another Medicare Advantage plan. After several years of decline, we now believe our health sales have hit bottom, and we expect to see single-digit growth in new health sales for 2011.
Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $51 million for the quarter, a 15% increase. And the underwriting margin was $8.5 million, up 48%. For the full year, revenues were up 14% to $209 million, and underwriting margin increased 15% to $24 million.
Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, an 11% increase, but rose 3.5% for the full year to $156 million. For 2011, we expect administrative expenses to increase in the 1% to 2% range.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments.

As previously disclosed, Liberty National closed the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary United Investors to Protective Life on December 31st, 2010. Prior to the closing, United Investors distributed approximately $305 million of assets to L",842,"Thanks, Mark. As previously disclosed, Liberty National closed the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary United Investors to Protective Life on December 31st, 2010. Prior to the closing, United Investors distributed approximately $305 million of assets to Liberty in the form of dividends.
In addition, the proceeds from the sale are approximately $364 million, resulting in a statutory gain of $183 million pre-tax, or $119 million after-tax. Now, although the sale generated a statutory gain, we recognized a GAAP loss of approximately $35 million after-tax due primarily to DAC, goodwill, and the difference in the GAAP and stat benefit reserves.
Now I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital, and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31st, 2010.
As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.1 billion, including $10.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $9.6 billion are investment grade, with an average rating of A-minus. Below-investment grade bonds are $863 million, 8.3% of fixed maturities, compared to $824 million a year ago. Although the percentage of below-investment grade bonds at 8.3% is high relative to our peers, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 22%, which is likely less than our peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB-plus, same as a year ago.
During the quarter, we recognized $18 million of after-tax realized gains. For the year, we had net realized capital gains of $24 million after tax. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $108 million, compared to net unrealized gains of $572 million at September 30th, and net unrealized losses of $455 million a year ago. The decrease in unrealized gains in the fourth quarter is due primarily to higher interest rates, with Treasury yields increasing more than credit spreads declined during the quarter.
As far as investment yield, in the fourth quarter, we invested $314 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.8%, an average rating of A-minus and an average life of 27 to 29 years. For the year, we invested $1.7 billion at an average yield of 5.9%.
For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.65%, compared to 6.68% yield in the previous quarter and 6.85% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of December 31st, yield on the portfolio is 6.63%.
Now turning to excess investment income. Excess investment income is our net investment income less the interest costs on the net policy liabilities, and the financing costs of our debt. In the fourth quarter it was $76 million, up $11 million, or 17% from a year ago.
On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was $0.94, up 21% over the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in excess investment income is due primarily to investment income being up $17 million over a year ago. This represents a 10% increase in investment income, compared to an 8% increase in average invested assets.
Despite the lower yields in the bond portfolio, the investment income increased at a higher rate than the-related assets because we held significantly more cash and short-term securities in the fourth quarter 2009 than we did in 2010.
Regarding RBC, we plan to maintain our RBC ratio at or around the 325% plus level. This ratio was lower than some of the peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
Although, we haven’t finalized our 2010 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/10 will be in the range of 400% to 410%, higher than normal due to the impact of the sale of United Investors.
Finally, regarding share repurchases, in the fourth quarter we used $62 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares. For the year, we spent $204 million to acquire 3.8 million shares.
At December 31st, the parent company had liquid assets of $204 million. In addition, in the fourth quarter, Torchmark renewed its $600 million revolving credit facility through January 2015.
In addition to the $204 million of liquid assets, we estimate that 2011 free cash flow at the parent company will be approximately $655 million. This consists of approximately $350 million of free cash from normal operations along with $305 million resulting from the sale of United Investors. To-date in 2011, we have used $74 million of this cash to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares.
As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.

As I’ve mentioned before, part of the issue is growing our middle management. In order to recruit more agents, we need more middle managers who are kind of the frontline in recruiting and training of these people.
We did see some growth there, I think we added four SGAs in the fourth quarter and 11 middle managers. That’s not enough growth, but we’ve started to at least turn the corner there and growing the middle managers. In some cases - in a few places it’s a lead issue, generating more leads to supply additional agents and in the first quarter so far, our lead generation efforts have been pretty successful.
There is one other thing, actually as far as the Internet recruiting sites, overall the total number of new resumes that were out on the three major sites actually declined last year, which doesn’t - we have plenty of resumes out there to recruit from, but again, that’s something that we’ve got to look at; if that trend continues what other sources out of recruiting can we look at. So, it’s really a combination of a number of things, Randy. We’re moving forward, we are trying to centralize more of the recruiting effort to make it more efficient and to expand it, and I feel pretty good about where we’re at. It’s just not something that turns around in a very short period of time. It’s something that will be more of a gradual turnaround as the year progresses.

Good morning everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the first quarter was a $129 million or $1.62 per share, a per share increase of 7% from a year ago. Excluding the $6 million of United Investors earnings from the year ago quarter, net operating income per share from continuing operations increased 12%. Net income was $106 million or $1.33 per share, down 13% from a year ago, primarily as a result of a $15.5 million dollar realized investment loss on the sale of our holdings in MBIA.
Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 13.2% and our book value per share was $49.45 a 9% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 15% to $50.70 per share.
In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue, excluding the United Investors grew 4% to $431 million and life-underwriting margins increased 7% to $119 million. Life net sales declined 5% in the quarter to $81 million, while life first-year collected premiums were down less than 1% to $61 million.
I feel good about our potential for growth in our life premiums and underwriting margins. While we currently expect relatively flat life sales in the second quarter, we believe we will see high single-digit growth in life sales in the third quarter followed by double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. I am also very pleased with our initial efforts conserve our existing life customers.
In 2010, we produced $330 million in net life sales, but we lapse $252 million at in force premium. As we are able to fully implement our conservation efforts over the next few months, we believe we can reduce our lapses in the 10% to 20% range. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to a $146 million and life-underwriting margin was also up 8% at $48 million.
Net life sales declined 5% for the quarter to $33 million. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 4,039 down 4% from a year ago, but up 3% from year end. It is also up 8% from its low of 37, 24 at the end of January. I am very encouraged by the progress that we made at American Income.
In addition to the growth and agents, the number of new agents achieving our top bonus level for the first time grew by 38% in February and March, which will have a positive impact on our new agent retention. Our mid level sales management ranks also increased 4% during the quarter.
In our direct response operations at Globe Life, life premiums were up 5% to a $152 million, while life underwriting margins were unchanged at $38 million. Net life sales were down 2% to $36 million.
The outlook for direct response is also very positive. For the past few months, we have been testing and analyzing an enhancement to our underwriting, utilizing applicants’ prescription drug records and the initial results are encouraging.
For our insert media adult business, which represents 40% of our total Direct Response life sales, we estimate this change will reduce our mortality cost by roughly 17%, resulting in additional underwriting margin of 4% of 5% of premium on this block of business. This additional margin will in turn allow us to expand our distribution. This change will also impact our direct mail sales, but further analysis is necessary before we can quantify the effect. We currently expect mid single-digit growth in life sales in the second quarter with improving double-digit growth in life sales in the second half of this year.
Life premiums at Liberty National declined 2% to $73 million and life underwriting margin was up 20% to $17 million. Net life sales declined 12% to $9.4 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at the end of the first quarter was 1,844, down 17% from a year ago.
As I’ve mentioned previously, the turnaround at Liberty National is not a quick and easy fix, but we are making progress. The underwriting margins have improved significantly. Through our conservation efforts, we should stop the decline in life premiums.
On the marketing side, the number of new agents achieving the maximum bonus level for the first time was up 34% in the first quarter, which again will have a positive impact on our agent retention. We have, however, reduced our life sales estimates at Liberty National for 2011. We now expect to see a continued decline in the second quarter followed by roughly flat sales in the third and single-digit growth in the fourth quarter of this year.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding part D declined 5% to $192 million. Our health underwriting margin grew 4% to $37 million. Health net sales declined 16% to $14 million. As a percentage of premium, we expect to help margins to hold at that 19% level for the balance of 2011. Premium revenue for Medicare part D was $49 million for the quarter down 5% and the underwriting margin was $5 million down 2%. Administrative expenses were $38 million up 2% from a year ago and inline with our expectations.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.

308916,129707684,126208,"Torchmark Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website we are prescheduled to provide summary information regarding our portf",984,"Thanks Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website we are prescheduled to provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of March 31st, 2011.
As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.2 billion, including $10.5 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. As of the fixed maturities $9.8 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below investment grade bonds are $758 million down from $863 million at December 2010 and $891 million a year ago.
The decline in the first quarter was due to a $82 million of dispositions and also $24 million of net upgrades of bonds to the investment grade. The percentage of below-investment great bonds to fix maturities at 7.2% is the lowest that it has been since the second quarter 2008. That percentage may still be higher relative to our peers, however, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity excluding OCI is 19.6% which is likely worse than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB-plus, same as a year ago.
During the quarter, we recognized realized losses of $23 million pre tax or $15 million after tax. These losses resulted from the sales of the company’s entire holdings as NBIA bonds which had a presale book value of $63 million. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $156 million, compared to gains of $108 million at year end 2010 and net unrealized losses of $185 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the first quarter is due primarily to the previously mentioned sale of NBIA bond.
Regarding investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $265 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invest at an average annual effective yield of 6%, an average rating of A-minus and an average life of 27 years.
For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 6.62%, compared to 6.65% in the previous quarter and 6.78% in the first quarter of 2010. The decline in the yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of March 31st, the yield on the portfolio is 6.61%.
Now, turning to excess investment income, excess investment income is our net investment income less the interest costs on the net policy liabilities, and the financing costs of our debt. In the first quarter, it was $74 million, up $2 million or 3% from a year ago.
On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was $0.93, up [17%] over the first quarter of 2010. As a component, net investment income was up $8 million or 5% in line with the 5% increase in average invested assets.
Despite the lower yields in the bond portfolio, investment income increased at the same rate as the related assets because we held significantly more cash and short-term securities during the first three months of 2010 than we have in 2011. The interest costs on the net policy liabilities increased $6 million or 7% in line with the 7% increase in the average liabilities.
Now regarding RBC, as we mentioned before, we plan to maintain our RBC ratio at or around the 325% level. This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but it is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
At December 31st 2010, consolidated RBC was 421% and adjusted capital was approximately $385 million in excess of that required for the target 325% ratio. The ratio and excess capital were higher than normal due to the impact of the sale of United Investors on December 31, 2010.
Finally, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the first quarter we spent $187 million to buy 2.9 million Torchmark shares. So far in April, we used $30 million to buy another 450,000 shares. For the full year, through today, we had spent $217 million of parent company cash to acquire 3.4 million shares.
The available liquid assets of the parent consists of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations, free cash flow results from the derivatives received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the dividends pay to Torchmark shareholders and the interest paid on the debt. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $205 million. We expect to generate approximately $655 million of free cash for the entire year. Thus the total free cash available for all of 2011 will be around $860 million, the same amount that we projected in our previous call.
In the first quarter, we generated about $391 million of our free cash flow and that included the $305 million resulting from the sale of United Investors. As mentioned, the parent used a $187 million in the first quarter for Torchmark share repurchases.
As a result, the parent ended the quarter with $409 million of available liquid assets. And that’s comprised with a $205 million ending asset plus a $391 million of free cash during the quarter less 187 million of share repurchases. Now along with the $409 million as on hand at the end of the first quarter, we should generate approximately $264 million of free cash flow over the next three quarters of the year.
As of today, after deducting the $30 million of April share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $643 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible and if market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.

To get to the 20%, that’s going to take a little more time that things are need to test or people we need to hire and train as far as people who take phone calls and do some telemarketing. But I think over the next 12 months, I think something towards the high end of that 20% range is achievable.

So again achieving, if we can conserve 10% of that $26 million, 20% is a little over $50 million. So, this is really a big deal. It was probably one of the bigger things we’ve done in quite a number of years. If you look our total life in force premium last year in the last 12 months, I think we grew $58 million. So, if we are able to conserve $50 million of lapses, it will take our life premium growths to significantly higher level. And I will point out that the business we’re conserving, because we’ve already made the big upfront investment.
We’ll have a significantly higher margin than the new business we’re writing. The $330 million that we wrote last year and we spent roughly $500 million to put that business on the books. To conserve this business if we are able to conserve $50 million, and I don’t think we’ll spend $5 million conserve that business.

Well first half American income, I guess one of the big differences this year versus last year Jimmy as again and looking at the percentage of those new agents that are achieving that maximum bonus level for the first time. Even though our recruiting was up last year and we’re reporting on more agents that numbers of that agents hitting that bonus level was declining and it did result and higher turnover so even though we saw some growth in the first quarter, we couldn’t sustain and then it continue to decline throughout last year, which is where we are at today.
Now with the renewed emphasis on spending more time with that agent better training and getting them to that bonus level, we are seeing a reversal of that trend. So again the last two months the number of new agents hitting that bonus level is up over 30% that’s the main thing give me encouragement that we are back on the right track. We did hit a low of 37 I think 37, 24 at the end of January. They have 8% growth in last two months is very encouraging to me. Liberty national a little bit same way there is Liberty National was different that because of the way its incorporated and state of those business and it is been able to use temporary agents licenses, so we are a number if it well throughout its history. And almost become like a better word addicted to the temporary licenses.
And the turnover at Liberty National has been so poor even compared to American income they only retain about half number of agents at American income does, I think a lot of that is the fact that a lot of these people never pass their exam, so they can write business for 90 days but then they are gone, and that’s not productive. It’s not productive use of management’s time. So, I look into the first quarter, the number of agents who achieve, the new agents who got a permanent license who passed their exam, and now permanent is up 34% as well as the number of - it’s not coincidence, the number of new agents hitting their maximum bonus level is up 34%.
We’re seeing a significant reduction as a result of changes in our incentive compensation and the number of temporary licenses has dropped almost in half the first quarter. So, I think we’re making the right choices as far as getting long-term growth, but it - by not having all those agents with temporary licenses, where it is having some short-term impact on our sales but I’m okay with that because we’re trying to make changes that will generate longer-term growth.

Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the second quarter was $129 million, or $14 per share; a per share increase of 8% from a year ago. Net operating income per share from continuing operations increased 14%. Net income was $149 million, or $1.32 per share, up 29% from a year ago. Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 13.5% and our book value per share was $33.61; an 8% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 10% to $35.40 per share.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue, excluding United Investors, grew 4% to $434 million, and life underwriting margins increased 10% to $125 million. Life net sales declined 4% in the quarter to $85.5 million, while life insurance first year collected premiums were down to 2% to $62 million. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $151 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $51 million. Net life sales declined 2% for the quarter to $36 million. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 4,332 up 3% from a year ago and up 7% from the last quarter.
I am pleased with the continued progress being made in American income. The agent count is now at an all-time high and growing at a strong pace. The number of new agents who achieved our top bonus level for the first time increased 27% during the quarter. Our mid-level sales management ranks also increased 11% during the second-quarter.
In our Direct Response operation global life, life premiums were up 5% to $151 million and life underwriting margin was up 1% to $38 million. Net life sales were down 2% to $37 million. While second-quarter sales were somewhat let less than expected, I remain optimistic that we will see significant growth during the second half of 2011.
While the previously discussed change in our direct response underwriting which utilizes its prescription drug data has improved on margin, it had a negative impact on our second-quarter sales as we rejected additional uninsurable applicants.
We had made a significant improvement in the design of our Insert media packaging which resulted in a 16% improvement in our initial response rates during the second quarter. As a result of the improvements made in our packaging and the additional margins from the change in underwriting we have increased our third quarter Insert media distribution in excess of 20%. While there is a 60 day to 90 day lag before these increases reflected in our net sales, I am confident that we will see significant growth in our direct response life sales during the second half of this year life premiums at Liberty National declined 2% of $73 million. Life underwriting margins was up 29% to 418 million. Net life sales declined to 18% to $10 million. The producing agent counter at Liberty National at the end of the second quarter was 1792, decline of 3% during the quarter and down 20% from a year ago. On a bright note, health sales at the Liberty National increased 10% from a year ago and 40% from the first quarter level as a result of the introduction of new cancer policy.
We’ve made good progress during the quarter in our efforts to conserve or enforce life insurance. During the second quarter, out new incentives conserved $2.2 million life premium. We currently project that number to grow to $15 million to $16 million during the second half of this year and $40 million to $45 million in 2012.
On the health side, premium revenue excluding part D declined 7% to $185 million while health underwriting margin was down 11% to $34 million. Health net sales were $13 million for the quarter, 15% less than a year ago. Premium revenue for Medicare part D was $49 million, which is down 8% and the underwriting margin was $5.4 million, which was up 6%.
Administrative expenses were $40 million, which were up 2% from a year ago and in line with our expectation.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital and share repurchases.First, the investment portfolio. On our website, our three schedules that provide summary information regarding our",960,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital and share repurchases.
First, the investment portfolio. On our website, our three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of June 30, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.2 billion, including $10.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $10 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below-investment grade bonds are $721 million, down from $863 million at December 2010. The $142 million decline this year is due primarily to dispositions, a $119 million of sales, $12 million of cost, and $10 million of maturities.
The percentage of below-investment grade bonds to fixed maturities, at 6.7%, the lowest that it has been since the fourth quarter of 2008. That percentage may still be a little higher relative to our peers, however, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 20%, which is likely less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago.
During the quarter, we recognized - realized gains of $31 million pre-tax and $21 million after tax. These gains resulted primarily for dispositions above investment grade bonds that had been impaired in previous years. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $306 million compared to gains of $156 million at the end of the first quarter and $178 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the second quarter is due primarily to treasury yields declining more in credit as far as increased.
Regarding the investment yield, in the second quarter we invested $432 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.75%, an average rating of A-minus at an average life of 28 years. For the six months, we’ve invested $697 million at an average yield of 5.84%.
For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 6.56%, compared to 6.62% yield in the previous quarter and a 6.74% in the second quarter of 2010. The decline in yield is due to lower new money yields. As of June 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.55%.
Now turning to excess investment income, excess investment income is net investment income less the interest cost and the net policy liabilities and the financing cost of our debt. In the second quarter, it was $74 million, down $492,000 from a year ago. However on a per share base, reflecting the impact to our share repurchase program, excess investment income was $0.65 per share, up 8% over the second quarter of 2010.
As the components, net investment income was up $6 million or 4%, slightly lower than the 5% increase in the average invested assets. Despite the lower yields in the bond portfolio, investment income increased at around the same rate as the related assets because we had significantly more cash in short-term securities during the second quarter of 2010 than we have in 2011.
The interest cost on net policy liabilities increased to $6 million or 8%, in line with a 7% increase in the average liabilities. Now turning to capital, regarding RBC, we planned to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years, that level has been around an NASC RBC ratio of 325%.
This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and the level of our ratings. Finally, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the first six months, we spent $602 million to buy 14 million Torchmark shares. So far in July, we’ve used $15 million to buy another 350,000 shares.
For the full year through today, we have used $617 million of parent company cash to acquire 14.3 million shares or 12% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. The available liquid assets at the parent company consist of our assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results from the dividends received up to the parent from the subsidiaries, less the dividends paid to the Torchmark shareholders and the interest paid on the debt.
The parent began the year with liquid assets of $205 million, and we expect to generate approximately $665 million of free cash flow for the entire year. Thus, the total free cash available for all the 2011 will be around $870 million. Now in the first six months, we generated about $485 million of free cash flow, and that included $305 million resulting from the sale of United Investors. As mentioned, the parent used $602 million in the first six months for Torchmark share repurchases.
As a result, , the parent ended quarter with $87 million of available liquid assets and that’s comprised with the $205 million of beginning assets, plus $485 million are free cash flow, less $602 million of share repurchases.
Going forward along with $87 million of cash on hand at the second quarter, we should generate approximately $4,180 million of free cash flow in the next two quarters. As of today, after deducting the $15 million of July share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $252 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are available, we expected share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Those are my comments, I will turn the call back to Mark.

We did take a look at that in terms of how to redeem it if we felt the use of cash - if we’re going to use cash, we felt that using the cash or share repurchases provided a greater return.

That concern there is the refinancing risk, five to 10 years, what interest rates will be and may be much higher.
So, our current thinking is that we’ll, kind of, stay where we are and not redeem them, but that’s something we’ll continue to look at as conditions change.

I know sales were still down 2%, but if you look - if you look at the numbers, we were down 4% going into the quarter and rising accounts and were up 3% at the end of the quarter.
We grew by almost 300 agents during the quarter. If we can continue close to that pace, if we can continue and grow 250 agents a quarter the next two, by year end our agent count be up 25% from a year ago and sales will follow that trend. There is not a lot new going on, there is more just a refocus. As I mentioned, we have grown our middle management ranks in a very concerted effort to promote more people into middle management.
We grew that by 11% during the quarter. The other problem we had last year even though recruiting was up, we - because we did not have more middle managers and because we lost focus on the training of those new agents, our turnover went up and that’s why that number as far as new bonus earners hitting the top level bonus, those are the people we retain and for that number to be up 27% from a year ago, it is being reflected in higher agent retention.
So all of the things that we’ve talked about last really six to nine months are coming - are panning out. We are refocused, we are hiring more agents, but we are also retaining more agents. So I feel very good about where American Income is and their sales will come back very strongly in the second half.

So, your conclusion there is accurate. Liberty National, as I have mentioned before, it really is there are so many differences between Liberty and American Income. And again, I’ve equated it in the past to franchise versus a company-owned store and American Income, it’s a straight commission situation whereas the Liberty National, the agents and managers are employees, those are our offices.
We have a lot of fixed expenses and the production pervasion is sustainably less. It was about half of what it is at American Income. It’s - we’ve been, really over the last two or three years, trying to move Liberty more to an American Income and we will continue to do so, but it’s just not a quick fix there. The things that work at American Income, we have tried to implement similar-type programs at Liberty National, but they - up to this point, they have not been successful.

So that’s why I say there is a 60 day to 90 days lag from the time we get that initial inquiry and before we start reporting the sales, that’s why again the second quarter sales numbers did not grow even though the number of new inquiries coming in grew at a very nice clip about - that will be reflected in higher sales for several quarters down the road.

Good morning, everyone. And for those of you on the East Coast, good afternoon. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the third quarter was $129 million, or $1.22 per share; and a per share increase of 13% from a year ago. Net income was $137 million or $1.30 per share, a 38% increase on a per share basis. Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 14.3% for the quarter, and our book value per share was $35.20, a 10% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 16% to $40.92 per share.
In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue, excluding United Investors, grew 3% to $430 million, and Life underwriting margins increased 5% to $121 million. Life net sales declined 1% in the quarter to $78 million.
At American Income, Life Premiums were up 9% to $154 million, while Life underwriting margins were up 8% to $51 million. Life net sales increased 8% for the quarter to $36 million. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 4,448, which was up 9% from a year ago and up 3% during the quarter.
I believe that American Income is back on track. New agent recruiting was up 11% from a year ago. The number of new agents who achieved our top bonus level for the first time increased 40% from a year ago. And our mid-level sales management ranks have grown 23% from a year ago. American Income, I believe, is now in position to see renewed double-digit growth in sales during the fourth quarter and throughout 2012.
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, Life premiums were up 3% to $145 million and Life underwriting margin was also up 3% to $37 million. Net Life sales were down 4% to $31 million. As a result of the changes in our underwriting which we previously discussed and improvements in our package design, we increased our insert media circulation by 22% in the third quarter. The responses received from these inserts increased 43% during the quarter.
There is a significant lag from the time those responses are received until a net sale is recognized. However, we are confident that the increased responses will result in net sales growth in the fourth quarter as well as subsequent quarters. For the fourth quarter, we intend to increase our insert media circulation by 38% over last year. However, due to the uncertainty in the economy, our guidance projects only mid single-digit growth in Direct Response sales for the fourth quarter and full-year 2012.
Life Premiums at Liberty National declined 2% to $72 million and Life underwriting margin was up 5% to $16 million. Net Life sales declined 23% to $9 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at the end of the third quarter was 1,578, which was down 27% from a year ago. Health sales at Liberty National jumped 47% as a result of some new product offerings in our worksite payroll deduction market.
Effective January 1 of 2012, all sales office and lead expenses at Liberty National will become the responsibility of our branch managers as we continue to move Liberty National to a model similar to American Income. Also as of November 1 of this year, all new agents will be hired on an independent contractor basis versus employee, again following the American Income model. While these changes may have some short-term effect on our sales, we believe they are necessary to preserve our profit margins and to put Liberty National in a position to achieve long-term growth.
We continue to make excellent progress in our efforts to reduce our lapses in our Life Insurance businesses. As I mentioned on the last call during the second quarter, we were able to conserve $2.2 million of annualized premium through our new conservation initiatives. For the third quarter, we were able to conserve $5.8 million of annualized premium. These numbers will continue to grow as we expand our conservation efforts. For 2012, our guidance assumes $30 million to $35 million of annualized premium will be conserved next year.
On the Health side, premium revenue, excluding part D, declined 6% to $177 million while Health underwriting margin was down 8% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 26% to $16 million. In addition to the previously mentioned growth at Liberty National, the United American Independent Agency sales grew 46% to $7.6 million for the quarter, reflecting improvement in the Medicare supplement marketplace in both individual and group. For 2012, we currently project 10% to 15% growth in our net Health sales.
Premium revenue from Medicare part D declined 5% to $50 million while underwriting margin improved 18% to $7 million. For 2012, we have developed a new lower cost part D plan which will allow us to pick up 76,000 low income subsidized auto enrollees as well as grow our individual sales. This new product is priced with the same underwriting margin as our existing products. We do expect, however, for part D revenues to increase by 40% to 50% next year.
Administrative expenses were $40 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. They were roughly $800,000 over our projection, primarily as a result of additional salary expenses associated with our conservation efforts. For 2012, we anticipate a 1% to 2% increase in administrative expenses.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases.First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 3",1425,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases.
First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 30, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.2 billion, including $10.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $10 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below-investment grade bonds were $734 million, down from the $863 million at December 2010. The $129 million decline this year is due primarily to $142 million of dispositions, offset partially by $12 million of downgrades.
The percentage of below-investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.8% compared to 8.3% at the end of 2010. That percentage may still be a little high relative to our peers. However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 20%, which is likely less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-minus compared to BBB-plus a year ago.
We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $942 million compared to gains of $306 million at the end of the second quarter and $572 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the third quarter is due primarily to treasury yields declining more than the credit spreads increased.
Now regarding our investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $134 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.53%, an average rating of BBB-plus and an average Life of 29 years. For the nine months, we’ve invested $831 million at an average yield of 5.79% and an average rating of A-minus.
For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.54% compared to 6.56% in the previous quarter and 6.68% in the third quarter of 2010. The continual decline in the yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of September 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.53%.
Regarding RBC, we’ve planned to maintain our capital level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years, that level has been around an NASC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient, for our companies in light of the consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and the level of our ratings.
Regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the first nine months, we’ve spent $720 million to buy 17 million Torchmark shares. So far in October, we’ve used $14 million to buy another 400,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have used $734 million of parent company cash to acquire 17.6 million shares or 15% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year.
At September 30, the parent company had $166 million on hand and should generate approximately $6 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. As of today, after deducting the $14 million of October share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $158 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. And if market conditions are favorable, we’d expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now before I turn the call back to Mark, we would like to discuss the impact of two issues, the new accounting rules for DAC and the current interest rate environment. Regarding DAC, on January 1, 2012, the company will adopt ASU 2010-26, which changes the rules regarding deferred acquisition cost. This standard will change the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred currently will not be deferred under the new rules. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows or statutory earnings. We will elect to adopt the new rules retroactively, which means that DAC will be written down to the level as if the new standard had been in place in prior periods.
Going forward, the earnings impact will the combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write down. We currently estimate that the retroactive write down will be between 15% to 25% of the current DAC asset, which will result in a 9% to 15% reduction in GAAP equity, excluding OCI. In addition, we expect that 2012 earnings will be 1% to 2% or $0.06 to $0.10 per share lower than they would have been under the old accounting rules. And we also project that our ROE will rise from the current 14% level to somewhere between 15% and 17%. These estimates were included in our guidance for 2012. We will give more definitive guidance in the fourth quarter analyst call.
Finally, I’d like to discuss the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower for longer rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rates involves the impact on earnings but not the balance sheet. In response to lower interest rates, we plan to raise the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income’s Life products, and the Direct Response (inaudible) products by 5%.
These increases will provide additional margin to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies without having a detrimental impact of sales. However, in an extended low interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline as we invest new money at lower rates and thus, will pressure excess investment income. However, the decline will be slower than might be expected since on average, only 2% to 3% of the fixed maturities will run off each year over the next five years.
To help quantify the impact of extended lower rates on excess investment income, we conducted a stress test assuming a new money yield of 4.75% for the next five years along with a GAAP reserve discount rate of 4.75% graded to 6.5% on policies issued during that time period. Under that scenario, our portfolio yield would drop to somewhere between 5.95% and 6.10% after five years, and the average GAAP discount rate for the entire in-force block would be around 5.6%. As such, we would earn a spread of 35 to 50 basis points over the net policy liabilities while earning the full 595 to 610 basis points on our equity. As you can see, we would still generate substantial excess investment income along with our high underwriting margins.
Now, let’s switch to the balance sheet. Due to the nature of the products we sell in our higher underwriting margins, our DAC and benefit reserve balances will not be significantly impacted by an extended low interest rate environment. Unlike many of our peers, most of our in-force business consists of straightforward protection line policies that are not interest sensitive and they were accounted for in accordance to FAS 60. Under FAS 60, we will not increase amortization of DAC or put up additional benefit reserves due to interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition situation occurs.
We have conducted loss recognition testing using our September 30 financial data. In order to have a loss recognition situation in all the Life business, we would have to believe that our overall portfolio yield would drop to 4% and remain there permanently. We don’t believe there’s a reasonable set of circumstance that this scenario would occur. As such, we’re not concerned about the low interest rate environment affecting our balance sheet through adjustments to DAC reserves or goodwill.
The only block of business where extended low interest rates might affect the balance sheet is our fixed annuities, which were accounted for under FAS 97. However, due to the size of our annuity block, any impact would be insignificant.
With regards to statutory financials, we performed the New York 7 cash flow testing scenarios at each year in accordance with the regulatory requirements. We updated this testing at the end of the third quarter to incorporate the lower treasury rates and determine that we still generate adequate surplus in each of those seven scenarios. Therefore, no additional statutory benefit reserves are required. Finally, a low interest environment can affect towards more RBC related to the fixed annuities. However, any impact there would not be significant.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.

First one for Mark, if you could talk about your sales expectations at Liberty National. In the past when you’ve tried to make changes over adjust commission; there’s been generally more disruption than initially expected. So, I realized Liberty is smaller than it used to be, but it’s still about 10% of your Life sales. So I was wondering if the momentum at American Income and Direct Response next year would be offset by this weakness that Liberty National overall.
And then secondly for Gary, you mentioned $158 million of cash at the parent company. How much do you think you’ll need to maintain in this type of an environment as a cushion and assuming that whatever that cushion is, anything above that would be used for buyback?

On the other hand, we have announced these changes a couple of weeks ago. And they were well received. I will point out, a year-ago we had 165 offices at Liberty National. And today, we’re down to 75. We have closed or consolidated most of the underperforming offices there and I felt like these changes were very well received. I really believe that the branch managers that we have now have the desire to grow, the ability to grow, as well as the tools to grow. So I remain optimistic that we will see a turnaround at Liberty National next year although again, in our guidance, we have assumed a small continued decline in our Life sales.

But also, again, as I’ve mentioned before, the insert medias, the one aspect of our business that the response rates do tend to follow the consumer confidence index. And so again, we tempered a little bit because even though the inquiries are up, we could still see - if you say what could go wrong, we could still see those response rates for the fulfillment packages could go down or the percentage of the people who end up paying beyond the dollar introductory offer could go down as a result of economic conditions.

But again, I can’t - I believe that by the first of the year, we will be at our low point at Liberty National. But only - we’re really going to have to wait and see what that is.
We’re still expecting a small decline, again, in our Life sales although we do expect our Health sales to pick up. But I think the next three or four months will definitely, we’ll have a better answer to that. As far as dividend goes and buyback, we definitely discussed that. We had been slowly raising our dividend each year for the last several years. But it still comes down to - at the current PE that we’re trading at, we still believe buyback is a very good use of the money.
But it is something particularly if we get in a very low interest rate environment, we obviously could pay a much higher dividend. But at this point, there’s no definite plans to change our dividend policy. That might change if the PE comes up some. As far as M&A, I don’t - particularly right now, until we see some positive results at Liberty National, I would be, in fact, I would just say I would not be interested in buying another home service company.
Even though the pricing maybe attractive on it. You’d almost have to look at it as a close block of business because particularly, the changes in bank accounting, it’s very difficult to show a GAAP profit in a home service business. So I don’t see anything on the short-term horizon there.

So it does - when people wonder why we’re not more impacted by the change of the DAC accounting, the change at Liberty National is a big piece of that, that we have moved the bulk, not only the office expenses but the lead expenses we were picking up. We have eliminated those and moved them to the branch manager.

Good morning, everyone. And for those of you on the East Coast, good afternoon. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.
Net operating income for the third quarter was $129 million or $1.22 per share, a per share increase of 13% from a year ago. Net income was $137 million or $1.30 per share, a 38% increase on a per share basis. Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 14.3% for the quarter, and our book value per share was $35.20, a 10% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 16% to $40.92 per share.
In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue, excluding United Investors, grew 3% to $430 million, and Life underwriting margins increased 5% to $121 million. Life net sales declined 1% in the quarter to $78 million.
At American Income, Life premiums were up 9% to $154 million, while Life underwriting margins were up 8% to $51 million. Life net sales increased 8% for the quarter to $36 million. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 4,448, which was up 9% from a year ago and up 3% during the quarter. I believe that American Income is back on track. New agent recruiting was up 11% from a year ago. The number of new agents who achieved our top bonus level for the first time increased 40% from a year ago. And our mid-level sales management ranks have grown 23% from a year ago. American Income, I believe, is now in position to see renewed double-digit growth in sales during the fourth quarter and throughout 2012.
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, Life premiums were up 3% to $145 million and Life underwriting margin was also up 3% to $37 million. Net Life sales were down 4% to $31 million. As a result of the changes in our underwriting which we previously discussed and improvements in our package design, we increased our insert media circulation by 22% in the third quarter. The responses received from these inserts increased 43% during the quarter. There is a significant lag from the time those responses are received until a net sale is recognized. However, we are confident that the increased responses will result in net sales growth in the fourth quarter as well as subsequent quarters. For the fourth quarter, we intend to increase our insert media circulation by 38% over last year. However, due to the uncertainty in the economy, our guidance projects only mid single-digit growth in Direct Response sales for the fourth quarter and full-year 2012.
Life premiums at Liberty National declined 2% to $72 million and Life underwriting margin was up 5% to $16 million. Net Life sales declined 23% to $9 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at the end of the third quarter was 1,578, which was down 27% from a year ago. Health sales at Liberty National jumped 47% as a result of some new product offerings in our worksite payroll deduction market. Effective January 1 of 2012, all sales office and lead expenses at Liberty National will become the responsibility of our branch managers as we continue to move Liberty National to a model similar to American Income. Also as of November 1 of this year, all new agents will be hired on an independent contractor basis versus employee, again following the American Income model. While these changes may have some short-term effect on our sales, we believe they are necessary to preserve our profit margins and to put Liberty National into position to achieve long-term growth.
We continue to make excellent progress in our efforts to reduce our lapses in our Life Insurance businesses. As I mentioned on the last call during the second quarter, we were able to conserve $2.2 million of annualized premium through our new conservation initiatives. For the third quarter, we were able to conserve $5.8 million of annualized premium. These numbers will continue to grow as we expand our conservation efforts. For 2012, our guidance assumes $30 million to $35 million of annualized premium will be conserved next year.
On the Health side, premium revenue, excluding part D, declined 6% to $177 million while Health underwriting margin was down 8% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 26% to $16 million. In addition to the previously mentioned growth at Liberty National, the United American Independent Agency sales grew 46% to $7.6 million for the quarter, reflecting improvement in the Medicare supplement marketplace in both individual and group. For 2012, we currently project a 10% to 15% growth in our net Health sales.
Premium revenue from Medicare part D declined 5% to $50 million while underwriting margin improved 18% to $7 million. For 2012, we have developed a new lower cost part D plan, which will allow us to pick up 76,000 low-income subsidized auto enrollees, as well as grow our individual sales. This new product is priced with the same underwriting margin as our existing products. We do expect, however, for part D revenues to increase by 40% to 50% next year.
Administrative expenses were $40 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. They were roughly $800,000 over our projection, primarily as a result of additional salary expenses associated with our conservation efforts. For 2012, we anticipate a 1% to 2% increase in administrative expenses.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments."
308916,141575316,208800,"Torchmark Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 30,",1425,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. 
First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 30, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.2 billion, including $10.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $10 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below-investment grade bonds were $734 million, down from the $863 million at December 2010. The $129 million decline this year is due primarily to $142 million of dispositions, offset partially by $12 million of downgrades.
The percentage of below-investment grade bonds at fixed maturities is 6.8% compared to 8.3% at the end of 2010. That percentage may still be a little high relative to our peers. However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 20%, which is likely less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago.
We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $942 million compared to gains of $306 million at the end of the second quarter and $572 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the third quarter is due primarily to Treasury yields declining more than the credit spreads increased.
Now regarding our investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $134 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.53%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 29 years. For the 9 months, we’ve invested $831 million at an average yield of 5.79% and an average rating of A-. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.54% compared to 6.56% in the previous quarter and 6.68% in the third quarter of 2010. The continual decline in the yield is due to the lower new-money yields. As of September 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.53%.
Regarding RBC, we’ve planned to maintain our capital level necessary to retain our current ratings. And for the last 2 years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies, in light of the consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and the level of our ratings.
Regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the first 9 months, we’ve spent $720 million to buy 17 million Torchmark shares. So far in October, we’ve used $14 million to buy another 400,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have used $734 million of parent company cash to acquire 17.6 million shares or 15% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year.
At September 30, the parent company had $166 million on hand and should generate approximately $6 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. As of today, after deducting the $14 million of October share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $158 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. And if market conditions are favorable, we’d expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now before I turn the call back to Mark, we would like to discuss the impact of 2 issues, the new accounting rules for DAC and the current interest rate environment. Regarding DAC, on January 1, 2012, the company will adopt ASU 2010-26, which changes the rules regarding the deferral of acquisition costs. This standard will change the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred currently will not be deferred under the new rules. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows or statutory earnings. We will elect to adopt the new rules retroactively, which means that DAC will be written down to the level as if the new standard had been in place in prior periods.
Going forward, the earnings impact will be the combination of the reduction in expenses in deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down. We currently estimate that the retroactive write-down will be between 15% to 25% of the current DAC asset, which will result in a 9% to 15% reduction in GAAP equity, excluding OCI. In addition, we expect that 2012 earnings will be 1% to 2% or $0.06 to $0.10 per share lower than they would have been under the old accounting rules. And we also project that our ROE will rise from the current 14% level to somewhere between 15% and 17%. These estimates were included in our guidance for 2012. We will give more definitive guidance in the fourth quarter analyst call.
Finally, I’d like to discuss the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower for longer rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rates involves the impact on earnings but not the balance sheet. In response to lower interest rates, we plan to raise the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income’s Life products, and the Direct Response juvenile products by 5%.
These increases will provide additional margin to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies without having a detrimental impact on sales. However, in an extended low interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline as we invest new money at lower rates and thus will pressure excess investment income. However, the decline will be slower than might be expected since, on average, only 2% to 3% of the fixed maturities will run off each year over the next 5 years.
To help quantify the impact of extended low rates on excess investment income, we conducted a stress test assuming a new money yield of 4.75% for the next 5 years, along with a GAAP reserve discount rate of 4.75% graded to 6.5% on policies issued during that time period. Under that scenario, our portfolio yield would drop to somewhere between 5.95% and 6.10% after 5 years, and the average GAAP discount rate for the entire in-force block would be around 5.6%. As such, we would earn a spread of 35 to 50 basis points on the net policy liabilities while earning the full 595 to 610 basis points on our equity. As you can see, we would still generate substantial excess investment income along with our high underwriting margins.
Now let’s switch to the balance sheet. Due to the nature of the products we sell and our high underwriting margins, our DAC and benefit reserve balances will not be significantly impacted by an extended low interest rate environment. Unlike many of our peers, most of our in-force business consists of straightforward protection life policies that are not interest-sensitive, and they were accounted for in accordance to FAS 60. Under FAS 60, we will not increase amortization of DAC or put up additional benefit reserves due to interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition situation occurs.
We have conducted loss recognition testing using our September 30 financial data. In order to have a loss recognition situation in our Life business, we would have to believe that our overall portfolio yield would drop to 4% and remain there permanently. We don’t believe there’s a reasonable set of circumstance that this scenario would occur. As such, we’re not concerned about the low interest rate environment affecting our balance sheet through adjustments to DAC, reserves or goodwill. The only block of business where extended low interest rates might affect the balance sheet is our fixed annuities, which were accounted for under FAS 97. However, due to the size of our annuity block, any impact would be insignificant.
With regards to statutory financials, we perform the New York 7 cash flow testing scenarios at each year end, in accordance with the regulatory requirements. We updated this testing at the end of the third quarter to incorporate the lower Treasury rates and determined that we still generate adequate surplus in each of the 7 scenarios. Therefore, no additional statutory benefit reserves are required. 
Finally, a low interest environment can affect Torchmark’s RBC related to the fixed annuities. However, any impact there would not be significant.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark."

First one for Mark, if you could talk about your sales expectations at Liberty National. In the past, when you’ve tried to make changes over -- adjust commission, there’s been generally more disruption than initially expected. So I realize Liberty is smaller than it used to be, but it’s still about 10% of your Life sales. So I was wondering if the momentum at American Income and Direct Response next year would be offset by this weakness at Liberty National overall. And then secondly, for Gary, you mentioned $158 million of cash at the parent company. How much do you think you’ll need to maintain in this type of an environment as a cushion, and assuming that whatever that cushion is, anything above that would be used for buyback?"

And today, we’re down to 75. We have closed or consolidated most of the underperforming offices there, and I felt like these changes were very well received. I really believe that the branch managers that we have now have the desire to grow, the ability to grow, as well as the tools to grow. So I remain optimistic that we will see a turnaround at Liberty National next year, although again, in our guidance, we have assumed a small continued decline in our Life sales."

So the least, the margins on the business that we write at Liberty National will be predictable going forward. But again, I can’t -- I believe that by the first of the year, we will be at a low point at Liberty National. But only -- we’re really going to have to wait and see what that is. We’re still expecting a small decline, again, in our Life sales although we do expect our Health sales to pick up. But I think the next 3 or 4 months will definitely -- we’ll have a better answer to that. As far as dividends and buyback, we definitely discuss that. We had been slowly raising our dividend each year for the last several years. But it still comes down to -- at the current PE that we’re trading at, we still believe buyback is a very good use of the money. But it is something, particularly if we get in a very low interest rate environment, we obviously could pay a much higher dividend. But at this point, there’s no definite plans to change our dividend policy. That might change if the PE comes up some. As far as M&A, I don’t -- particularly right now, until we see some positive results at Liberty National, I would be -- in fact, I would just say I would not be interested in buying another home service company.

At American Income, Life premiums were up 9% to $154 million, while Life underwriting margins were up 8% to $51 million. Life net sales increased 8% for the quarter to $36 million. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 4,448, which was up 9% from a year ago and up 3% during the quarter. I believe that American Income is back on track. New agent recruiting was up 11% from a year ago. The number of new agents who achieved our top bonus level for the first time increased 40% from a year ago. And our mid-level sales management ranks have grown 23% from a year ago. American Income, I believe, is now in position to see renewed double-digit growth in sales during the fourth quarter and throughout 2012.
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, Life premiums were up 3% to $145 million and Life underwriting margin was also up 3% to $37 million. Net Life sales were down 4% to $31 million. As a result of the changes in our underwriting which we previously discussed and improvements in our package design, we increased our insert media circulation by 22% in the third quarter. The responses received from these inserts increased 43% during the quarter. There is a significant lag from the time those responses are received until a net sale is recognized. However, we are confident that the increased responses will result in net sales growth in the fourth quarter as well as subsequent quarters. For the fourth quarter, we intend to increase our insert media circulation by 38% over last year. However, due to the uncertainty in the economy, our guidance projects only mid single-digit growth in Direct Response sales for the fourth quarter and full-year 2012.
Life premiums at Liberty National declined 2% to $72 million and Life underwriting margin was up 5% to $16 million. Net Life sales declined 23% to $9 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at the end of the third quarter was 1,578, which was down 27% from a year ago. Health sales at Liberty National jumped 47% as a result of some new product offerings in our worksite payroll deduction market. Effective January 1 of 2012, all sales office and lead expenses at Liberty National will become the responsibility of our branch managers as we continue to move Liberty National to a model similar to American Income. Also as of November 1 of this year, all new agents will be hired on an independent contractor basis versus employee, again following the American Income model. While these changes may have some short-term effect on our sales, we believe they are necessary to preserve our profit margins and to put Liberty National into position to achieve long-term growth.
We continue to make excellent progress in our efforts to reduce our lapses in our Life Insurance businesses. As I mentioned on the last call during the second quarter, we were able to conserve $2.2 million of annualized premium through our new conservation initiatives. For the third quarter, we were able to conserve $5.8 million of annualized premium. These numbers will continue to grow as we expand our conservation efforts. For 2012, our guidance assumes $30 million to $35 million of annualized premium will be conserved next year.
On the Health side, premium revenue, excluding part D, declined 6% to $177 million while Health underwriting margin was down 8% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 26% to $16 million. In addition to the previously mentioned growth at Liberty National, the United American Independent Agency sales grew 46% to $7.6 million for the quarter, reflecting improvement in the Medicare supplement marketplace in both individual and group. For 2012, we currently project a 10% to 15% growth in our net Health sales.
Premium revenue from Medicare part D declined 5% to $50 million while underwriting margin improved 18% to $7 million. For 2012, we have developed a new lower cost part D plan, which will allow us to pick up 76,000 low-income subsidized auto enrollees, as well as grow our individual sales. This new product is priced with the same underwriting margin as our existing products. We do expect, however, for part D revenues to increase by 40% to 50% next year.
Administrative expenses were $40 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. They were roughly $800,000 over our projection, primarily as a result of additional salary expenses associated with our conservation efforts. For 2012, we anticipate a 1% to 2% increase in administrative expenses.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments."

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 30,",1425,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. 
First, the investment portfolio. On our website are 3 schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 30, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.2 billion, including $10.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $10 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below-investment grade bonds were $734 million, down from the $863 million at December 2010. The $129 million decline this year is due primarily to $142 million of dispositions, offset partially by $12 million of downgrades.
The percentage of below-investment grade bonds at fixed maturities is 6.8% compared to 8.3% at the end of 2010. That percentage may still be a little high relative to our peers. However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 20%, which is likely less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago.
We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $942 million compared to gains of $306 million at the end of the second quarter and $572 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the third quarter is due primarily to Treasury yields declining more than the credit spreads increased.
Now regarding our investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $134 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.53%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 29 years. For the 9 months, we’ve invested $831 million at an average yield of 5.79% and an average rating of A-. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.54% compared to 6.56% in the previous quarter and 6.68% in the third quarter of 2010. The continual decline in the yield is due to the lower new-money yields. As of September 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.53%.
Regarding RBC, we’ve planned to maintain our capital level necessary to retain our current ratings. And for the last 2 years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies, in light of the consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and the level of our ratings.
Regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the first 9 months, we’ve spent $720 million to buy 17 million Torchmark shares. So far in October, we’ve used $14 million to buy another 400,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have used $734 million of parent company cash to acquire 17.6 million shares or 15% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year.
At September 30, the parent company had $166 million on hand and should generate approximately $6 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. As of today, after deducting the $14 million of October share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $158 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. And if market conditions are favorable, we’d expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now before I turn the call back to Mark, we would like to discuss the impact of 2 issues, the new accounting rules for DAC and the current interest rate environment. Regarding DAC, on January 1, 2012, the company will adopt ASU 2010-26, which changes the rules regarding the deferral of acquisition costs. This standard will change the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred currently will not be deferred under the new rules. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows or statutory earnings. We will elect to adopt the new rules retroactively, which means that DAC will be written down to the level as if the new standard had been in place in prior periods.
Going forward, the earnings impact will be the combination of the reduction in expenses in deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down. We currently estimate that the retroactive write-down will be between 15% to 25% of the current DAC asset, which will result in a 9% to 15% reduction in GAAP equity, excluding OCI. In addition, we expect that 2012 earnings will be 1% to 2% or $0.06 to $0.10 per share lower than they would have been under the old accounting rules. And we also project that our ROE will rise from the current 14% level to somewhere between 15% and 17%. These estimates were included in our guidance for 2012. We will give more definitive guidance in the fourth quarter analyst call.
Finally, I’d like to discuss the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower for longer rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rates involves the impact on earnings but not the balance sheet. In response to lower interest rates, we plan to raise the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income’s Life products, and the Direct Response juvenile products by 5%.
These increases will provide additional margin to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies without having a detrimental impact on sales. However, in an extended low interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline as we invest new money at lower rates and thus will pressure excess investment income. However, the decline will be slower than might be expected since, on average, only 2% to 3% of the fixed maturities will run off each year over the next 5 years.
To help quantify the impact of extended low rates on excess investment income, we conducted a stress test assuming a new money yield of 4.75% for the next 5 years, along with a GAAP reserve discount rate of 4.75% graded to 6.5% on policies issued during that time period. Under that scenario, our portfolio yield would drop to somewhere between 5.95% and 6.10% after 5 years, and the average GAAP discount rate for the entire in-force block would be around 5.6%. As such, we would earn a spread of 35 to 50 basis points on the net policy liabilities while earning the full 595 to 610 basis points on our equity. As you can see, we would still generate substantial excess investment income along with our high underwriting margins.
Now let’s switch to the balance sheet. Due to the nature of the products we sell and our high underwriting margins, our DAC and benefit reserve balances will not be significantly impacted by an extended low interest rate environment. Unlike many of our peers, most of our in-force business consists of straightforward protection life policies that are not interest-sensitive, and they were accounted for in accordance to FAS 60. Under FAS 60, we will not increase amortization of DAC or put up additional benefit reserves due to interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition situation occurs.
We have conducted loss recognition testing using our September 30 financial data. In order to have a loss recognition situation in our Life business, we would have to believe that our overall portfolio yield would drop to 4% and remain there permanently. We don’t believe there’s a reasonable set of circumstance that this scenario would occur. As such, we’re not concerned about the low interest rate environment affecting our balance sheet through adjustments to DAC, reserves or goodwill. The only block of business where extended low interest rates might affect the balance sheet is our fixed annuities, which were accounted for under FAS 97. However, due to the size of our annuity block, any impact would be insignificant.
With regards to statutory financials, we perform the New York 7 cash flow testing scenarios at each year end, in accordance with the regulatory requirements. We updated this testing at the end of the third quarter to incorporate the lower Treasury rates and determined that we still generate adequate surplus in each of the 7 scenarios. Therefore, no additional statutory benefit reserves are required. 
Finally, a low interest environment can affect Torchmark’s RBC related to the fixed annuities. However, any impact there would not be significant.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark."

In the past, when you’ve tried to make changes over -- adjust commission, there’s been generally more disruption than initially expected. So I realize Liberty is smaller than it used to be, but it’s still about 10% of your Life sales. So I was wondering if the momentum at American Income and Direct Response next year would be offset by this weakness at Liberty National overall. And then secondly, for Gary, you mentioned $158 million of cash at the parent company. How much do you think you’ll need to maintain in this type of an environment as a cushion, and assuming that whatever that cushion is, anything above that would be used for buyback?"

And today, we’re down to 75. We have closed or consolidated most of the underperforming offices there, and I felt like these changes were very well received. I really believe that the branch managers that we have now have the desire to grow, the ability to grow, as well as the tools to grow. So I remain optimistic that we will see a turnaround at Liberty National next year, although again, in our guidance, we have assumed a small continued decline in our Life sales."

The one big thing, Colin, that you need to remember, regardless of the level of sales going forward, we have moved most of the fixed expenses at Liberty into variable expenses. So the least, the margins on the business that we write at Liberty National will be predictable going forward. But again, I can’t -- I believe that by the first of the year, we will be at a low point at Liberty National. But only -- we’re really going to have to wait and see what that is. We’re still expecting a small decline, again, in our Life sales although we do expect our Health sales to pick up. But I think the next 3 or 4 months will definitely -- we’ll have a better answer to that. As far as dividends and buyback, we definitely discuss that. We had been slowly raising our dividend each year for the last several years. But it still comes down to -- at the current PE that we’re trading at, we still believe buyback is a very good use of the money. But it is something, particularly if we get in a very low interest rate environment, we obviously could pay a much higher dividend. But at this point, there’s no definite plans to change our dividend policy. That might change if the PE comes up some. As far as M&A, I don’t -- particularly right now, until we see some positive results at Liberty National, I would be -- in fact, I would just say I would not be interested in buying another home service company. Even though the pricing maybe attractive on it, you’d almost have to look at it as a closed block of business because -- particularly with the changes in DAC accounting, it’s going to be very difficult to show a GAAP profit in a home service business.
