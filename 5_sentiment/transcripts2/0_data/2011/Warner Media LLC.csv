Impressive results we posted today reflect the continuation of a multiyear plan we put in place a few years ago. In 2008, we shifted our focus to become a pure content company and moved to permanently reduce our cost base.",1908,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning. Impressive results we posted today reflect the continuation of a multiyear plan we put in place a few years ago. In 2008, we shifted our focus to become a pure content company and moved to permanently reduce our cost base. In 2009, we successfully navigated the economic downturn. And in that year, we further improve the company's operating efficiency, strengthened our balance sheet and grew adjusted earnings per share almost 30%. This last year, 2010, we significantly accelerated our pace in three important areas: growth, investment and returns. We posted our highest revenue growth in years, and we grew adjusted operating income well ahead of plan. We increased adjusted EPS by over 30%, putting us up 70% over the past two years.
We invested substantially to strengthen the long-term competitive position and growth profile of our businesses, and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. That's more than 100% of our free cash flow.
In 2011, we'll continue this course, grow, invest and return. We're even more confident, so we're going to take even more aggressive steps. This year, we intend to, again, deliver strong financial results. As you saw in our outlook release this morning, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the low teens in 2011.
Assuming we achieve that, it means we'll have almost doubled our earnings in three years. At the same time, we'll ramp up our investment in programming, production and marketing even more than we did last year. And this morning as you saw, we announced that we are raising our dividend 11%, and we're increasing our repurchase authorization to $5 billion. That paves the way for us to return even more capital to our shareholders this year.
We'll achieve these goals by focusing on the four strategic objectives that we've discussed with you before: first, invest aggressively to use our competitive advantages in making great content; second, develop and accelerate new business models that harness technology to improve both the consumer experience and our economics; third, expand internationally in key territories; and fourth, improve both our operating and capital efficiency. For example, while we plan to invest more in our businesses this year, we'll fund that by keeping a lid on our other costs.
So what does that mean in practice at each of our four businesses? At Turner, we'll keep acquiring and developing the high-quality programming that drives audiences, bolsters our brands and attracts advertisers. This year, that means sports programming like the NCAA men's basketball tournament, it means the top original programming on Cable including returning hits like Rizzoli & Isles and new shows like Falling Skies from Steven Spielberg. It means acquiring blockbusters like The Big Bang Theory and our new late-night powerhouse, CONAN, which is the number one late-night talk show during the fourth quarter.
This emphasis on high-quality programming increases the value we deliver to both advertisers and to our affiliates. As advertisers shift dollars away from broadcast to seek more efficient, they're increasingly looking to Turner. That was evident this quarter when Turner's domestic entertainment Networks grew ad revenue in the high teens organically. And it was evident in the upfront last year when Turner's CPM growth exceeded all the broadcast Networks, and that's tangible evidence that the CPM gap is narrowing. 
With healthy Advertising climate, our strong programming lineups, the strength of our brands and the appeal of the environments we offer, we're confident that we'll post strong Advertising growth, again, this year. Our affiliates are also increasingly recognizing the value of the must-have programming that we air. As you know, affiliate fees are one of the most important growth drivers for our company. Lately, we've become even more confident that we will continue to post high single-digit affiliate fee growth over the next several years, and that is before all of the benefits of some of our recent investments like the NCAA kick in. 
Just last month, we completed a multiyear deal with one of our largest distributors, covering some of our biggest Networks, and I can't be specific about the terms but importantly, in that deal, we're increasing our rates of affiliate fee growth even faster than the prior agreement. 
At HBO, we'll continue to invest aggressively in our content too. In 2011, we'll air 12 original shows, up from 10 last year. We'll bring back True Blood, Boardwalk Empire and Entourage, which ranked among the highest rated original shows on Cable. Among other new shows this year in the spring we'll debut Game of Thrones, based on the popular fantasy novels, which we expect will be another big hit. At the same time, this year, we'll continue making progress in rolling out TV Everywhere at both Turner and HBO. Turner entered 2010 with TV Everywhere versions of our Networks available to over 45 million households. And by the middle of 2011, we expect to have agreements covering 70 million homes. HBO GO is now available to over 40% of its subscriber base and is on track to be available to the overwhelming majority of its subscribers in the next few months.
We'll also keep expanding internationally at our Networks businesses. At Turner, our international operations grew to 18% of revenue in 2010. That's up from 15% in 2009, powered by strong growth in Latin America and in Asia. You may recall that on our Investor Day in May, we set a goal that international would reached 20% of revenue at Turner over the next few years. We now expect to exceed that target.
At HBO, we continue to experience strong growth internationally as well. International subscribers grew over 10% in 2010 to 43 million and in 2011, HBO will increase local production internationally and continue to roll out new features like high-definition, on demand and go.
When including our majority on joint ventures at HBO, our combined international network businesses generated nearly $2.5 billion of revenue and around $500 million of adjusted operating income in 2010. Based on current trends, over the next four years, we expect to double operating profits from our international Networks to $1 billion. 
Okay, let me turn to Warner Bros, where we're also stepping up our levels of investment. We are excited about our theatricals slate in 2011, which includes event films like the finale of the Harry Potter franchise, Green Lantern, Happy Feet 2, The Hangover 2 and the next Sherlock Holmes. As you know, we're focusing even more of our resources on event films. Warner produces more of these films each year than any studio, and it distributes them better than any studio. Importantly, event films also tend to be more consistently profitable for us than smaller movies.
We are also increasing our investment in TV production in 2011, both domestically and internationally. We see very strong secular dynamics for TV production in the U.S. Broadcast Networks are funneling retrans payments back into programming investments. There's growing demand for original cable series, and we've seen our record prices for the top shows coming off broadcast in the syndication. This year, we'll ramp up the development of new shows for broadcast, particularly comedies and we'll increase production to meet the demand for original Cable series. We're expanding our local production capabilities internationally. There is rising demand for local production globally, and building this infrastructure will also enable us to export successful shows and successful formats around the world, including back into the U.S.
Last year, we acquired Shed Media, one of the largest independent production companies in the U.K., and we'll keep looking for ways to expand our capabilities. At the same time, Warner Bros. will be at the forefront of accelerating the digital transition in film. It's arguably the area of our business that's going through the most change right now. There are risks associated with that, but also a lot of opportunity. As you know, we've been pushing the creative windows that advantage our most profitable channels and to increase the appeal for consumers to buy and to rent movies digitally.
This year, we plan to launch a premium view deal offering that will enable consumers to watch movies in their homes 60 days after its theatrical release. We'll begin offering it in the second quarter and expect it to be available through all major distributors by year end.
Another important initiative for us this year is ultraviolet or UV for short. As a reminder, UV will allow consumers to buy movies or TV shows either download or in physical media and then watch them through a broad array of apps and devices wherever and whenever they want. 
At CBS last month, we announced that in the second half of this year, all theatrical new releases from Warner will be UV-enabled to along with those from Fox, Sony and Universal. If the industry executes it right, UV should dramatically boost the appeal of owning movies.
As we push to accelerate the digital transition, we'll also look at the economics of the entire home video category. We're rethinking how much we extract from some of these new distribution channels. For instance, this year, we'll determine whether the lengthen the window for Netflix and Redbox and how much the increase what we charge them for our DVDs. 
Turning to Time Inc. Although the environment is still challenging for print magazines, we intend to grow profits again in 2011. Our first priority is to drive top line growth. That will require strong execution in traditional areas like circulation and ad sales, but will also come from new areas of focus like marketing services and e-commerce. At the same time, we'll remain focused on our operating efficiency. We'll also keep investing to develop new tablet versions of our magazine brands. We're quite proud of what we have out there so far. As we have discussed with you before, we're very optimistic about the tablet opportunity. It's a great experience for our readers and a rich environment for our advertisers.
Digital magazines could take off, we need to offer consumers the flexibility of purchasing single copy digital issues, having digital-only descriptions and having a Content Everywhere approach that allows us to offer dual prints and digital subscriptions. And it's critical to the long-term health of our business that we can do that, while also retaining customer relationships and the data of what they are using and what they like. 
We've had constructive discussions with a number of tablet manufacturers, and we're confident we'll be able to offer consumers the flexibility they want across a wide variety of tablets this year. 
I'll wrap up before I hand it off to John. When I became CEO three years ago, my goals were to refocus Time Warner into a premier global content company and to improve shareholder returns. We've made a lot of progress towards those goals over the last few years, and I'm excited about our momentum heading into 2011. But in many respects I think we're still in the early part of this process, and there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us. This is a time of significant change in the media industry, but I'm confident more than ever that we are well positioned to benefit as shifts in technology increase the demand for our content, both in the United States and around the world. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John."
24689,118170557,98087,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. And as Jeff just said, last year, we accelerated the pace of growth, investment and returns and this year, our plan is to",2587,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. And as Jeff just said, last year, we accelerated the pace of growth, investment and returns and this year, our plan is to make even more progress and be even more aggressive in pursuing those goals. Financially, that means in 2010, we delivered 17% growth in adjusted operating income and more than 30% growth in adjusted EPS. This growth rate beat our most recent outlook and was well ahead of our initial outlook at the beginning of 2010 of mid-teens growth.
To put this in perspective, we've grown adjusted EPS, as Jeff said, 70% in just the last two years. And at the same time, we've been fully investing in our businesses. Last year, we increased our investment in programming, production and marketing in the high single digits, and we reallocated resources away from less productive areas like G&A. That investment will drive long-term growth for the company.
And we did that while continuing to maintain very high levels of returns on invested capital. As we discussed throughout our Investor Day in May, we consider returns on invested capital or ROIC to be an important yardstick of our performance and an important tool in making capital allocation decisions. The way we look at it which excludes certain purchase price adjustments, our ROIC increased to 20% in 2010, and that's very good.
And reflecting our commitments to improve shareholder returns, we've also stepped up our returns of capital, increasing both our dividend and our share repurchases. Taken together, we returned to more than 100% of our free cash flow last year. This year, our outlook calls for low-teens growth in adjusted EPS. And as Jeff mentioned, that means that if we achieve this year's outlook, we will have almost have doubled our adjusted EPS over a three-year period. This outlook reflects our plan to increase investment in programming, production and marketing but to restrain overall expense growth we're going to continue to keep a lid on other costs. Also reflecting our commitment to returns, our board recently authorized both an increase in our annual dividend to $0.94 per share and an increase in our share repurchase authorization of $5 billion.
Turning to the next slide, which shows consolidated fourth quarter and full year financial results. For the full year, revenues grew $1.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. That's our highest growth rate since 2004. Revenues were up nicely at most of our divisions with increases across Subscription, Advertising and Content. The largest portion of that increase was in Subscription revenues, driven by an 8% increase at our Networks segment, and that was due to higher affiliate fees at both HBO and Turner. Advertising revenues grew even faster, up 10% for the year, and the vast majority of that growth came from our Networks as Turner saw a big rebound in Advertising growth for both its domestic and its international Networks. Publishing Advertising also increased for the full year as the print Advertising environment stabilized.
And Content revenues were up nicely as well as in 2010, and that was primarily due to stronger television product at Warner Bros. and HBO as we benefited from our increased investments in high-quality programming there. Continuing down the income statement, overall operating expenses grew only in the low single digits, and that reflected significantly higher spending on programming, including originals and sports, TV and film production and marketing as I mentioned. But we funded that by lowering the rest of our expenses. So as a result, we were able to grow adjusted operating income nearly 3x as fast as our revenue growth, with margins expanding close to 200 basis points. 
Looking very quickly at the quarter, we had a strong fourth quarter. Revenue growth accelerated to 8%. That was our highest growth rate in the last three years. Advertising revenues were particularly strong, up 13% in the fourth quarter, and that was our highest growth rate of the year. Adjusted operating income grew 14% as expenses, again, rose more slowly than revenue. And adjusted EPS grew 22% year-over-year on the quarter, and that growth rate was helped by having fewer shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchases. 
Turning next to our divisional results, and let me start with our Networks group where 2010 was another terrific year. We grew revenue double digits and along with ongoing expense control, that led to growth and adjusted operating income of 18%. And both HBO and Turner recorded their highest annual revenues and profits ever. The fourth quarter was particularly strong, with revenue growth accelerating sequentially across HBO and Turner. 
I'll remind you that this year, we had some transactions that benefited growth and those included international transactions, as well as Turner assuming management of Time's digital sports properties. If you were to look through those, organic Advertising growth accelerated to 12% in the fourth quarter. 
Domestic entertainment Networks, together with kids and young adults grew Advertising strong double digits in the quarter, and that was offset by mid single digit declines at domestic news. At our international Networks, organic ad revenue growth was in the high single digits in the quarter and for the year, organic international Advertising revenue was up high teens. And adjusted OI margins expanded by 400 basis points. 
Looking to the first quarter, domestic scatter pricing remains very strong, up solid double digits over the upfront. And cancellations have remained extremely low, which is yet another positive sign as we enter the new year. Also recall that this is the first year of our coverage of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. So in the first quarter, we expect to see a significant boost in ad revenue. Advertising trends were also very positive at our international Networks. 
Looking over at Subscription revenues, they continue to show nice growth in the fourth quarter increasing 9%, and there was about 200 basis points of that growth coming from the consolidation of HBO Central Europe. Over at HBO, as we expected, we ended the year with our domestic subscriber count lower by about 1.6 million and as I outlined in detail on our last earnings call, these declines were primarily tied to two distributors and were mostly non-revenue-generating subscribers, so they had little to no financial impact, and HBO still grew domestic subscriber revenue in the mid-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. 
Moving on, our programming lineup at HBO drove content revenues higher for both the quarter and the year. And in the quarter, that related primarily to the home video release of The Pacific and the international licensing revenue for Boardwalk Empire. Adjusted operating income at the Networks group increased 20% in the quarter as margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year. As planned, our programming expenses were up 9%, and that was mostly due to increased originals and sports programming. But for the full year, programming expenses were up only 5%.
For 2011, our investments in the NCAA men's basketball tournament is a clear example of how we're investing to drive growth, and we're actually more enthusiastic about the deal now than when we signed it. Both the partnership with CBS and our initial ad sales have exceeded our expectations. As you know, the basketball contract will be a modest drag on Network profitability in 2011 that will mostly hit in the first quarter of the year and given its impact, Networks adjusted operating income is likely to be up only modestly in the March quarter. But we expect it to be very profitable for us in the coming years, and we fully expect it to be a key growth driver over the long term. Even when you consider the NCAA impact, however, we expect 2011 will be a great year for our Networks group, and we see continued growth in our Subscription fees. We're optimistic about our Advertising environment, and we expect strong growth from our international businesses, so we anticipate very, very attractive profit growth for the full year.
Moving over to Film. Warner Bros had a terrific year in 2010, with its profits falling just short of the record levels achieved in 2009. And this year, as Jeff said, we have a terrific film slate ahead of us. And Warner Bros should benefit from the leasing the last two films in the Harry Potter franchise on home video later this year. 2011 will also be a big year for Warner Bros. TV production, which has maintained its position as the leading supplier of network television content, and we'll benefit from a Syndication pipeline that includes the off network availability of The Big Bang Theory. 
The performance of our Games business should also improve in 2011 versus 2010. The release slate this year includes Batman Arkin City, LEGO Star Wars 3 and Mortal Kombat 9. Taking all this into consideration, we expect Warner Bros. will have its highest profit year ever in 2011. 
As you think about this year's quarters, however, keep in mind that film profitability will likely be weighted toward the second half of the year and why is that the case that's due to tough comparisons in the first quarter where in last year's first quarter we had a huge growth rates year-over-year, and it's also due to the just the timing of our theatrical and home video releases this year. 
Moving on to Time Inc., which is on the next slide. Despite the still challenging operating environment, Publishing posted great profit growth in the quarter and for the year in 2010. Advertising revenues were up 3% for the year. As anticipated, they declined slightly in the quarter and that was due to the impact of transferring management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner in the fourth quarter. If it were not for this transfer during the quarter, ad revenues would have been up slightly year-over-year. And as we look at the first quarter for the moment of this year, overall Advertising trends are relatively consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Subscription revenues were down 7% in the fourth quarter, and that was due largely to softer trends at newsstands. However, we expect Subscription revenue fundamentals to stabilize this year and improve as the year progresses. Adjusted operating income was up 63% in the fourth quarter and margins expanded 700 basis points. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc., and note that this included the impact of about $40 million in restructuring costs, and that compares throughout $90 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
For the year, operating expenses declined by about $300 million. And they are now down nearly $900 million over the last two years. We anticipate overall cost this year at Time Inc. to be relatively flat as compared with what they were last year. 
Moving on now to the next slide, which has our 2011 outlook. We expect revenue growth this year to remain very strong, and that's due to current trends in the Advertising environment, an expanding programming lineup, healthy and consistent Subscription revenue trends and higher content revenues led by TV licensing and games. We also anticipate significant growth from our international operations. 
As I previously mentioned, we're going to continue to invest fully in key growth areas across our businesses, while keeping a lid on overhead expenses. From a P&L standpoint, what does that mean? It means that in 2011, we expect expense growth in areas such as programming, production and marketing to be up in the high single digits, and that includes the impact of the NCAA. But we expect all other operating expenses to grow at a much, much lower rate. 
This is all reflected in today's outlook. As you saw in the release, we expect full year adjusted EPS to increase in the low teens, and that's off a base of $2.41 from a year ago. Last quarter, we mentioned that due to proactive tax planning and a larger share of our earnings coming from international operations, we expect that our effective tax rate to be around 37%. I'd add to that now by saying that due to the recent tax legislation that occurred in December, we now expect it to be a little bit lower than that, possibly around 36% in 2011. 
Turning to the next slide, which looks at free cash flow. Our businesses continue to convert at high percentage of profits into free cash. For the year, we generated approximately $2.7 billion of free cash flow, and that was burdened by a significant increase in working capital, which included $250 million in payments related to the resolution of litigation, as well as a $70 million prepayment to the NCAA. As we move forward, we don't see any change in the capital needs of our businesses and therefore, we anticipate that we'll continue to convert a significant amount of adjusted income. Our conversion could be down somewhat in 2011, however, and that would be due to timing of our investment spending in programming and production as Jeff described, as well as higher year-over-year cash taxes. We anticipate that conversions will trend higher over the next several years as our near-term investments in content pay off.
And moving on to the last slide, which is our final slide, and that looks at our net debt. We ended the year with about $12.9 billion in net debt, and that was up about $1.4 billion compared to the end of 2009 and up slightly compared to the third quarter.
During the past two years, we've invested in our businesses while improving our balance sheet strength and preserving overall flexibility. To put this in some perspective, in 2009, we used the dividend from Time Warner Cable to pay down $6.6 billion of debt. And in 2010, we took additional advantage of the low interest rate environment to extend the maturities of approximately $5 billion of our debt and reduced future interest expense. At the same time, we deployed excess capital to reduce our cash balances and improve our balance sheet efficiency. 
The significant majority of the excess capital we have deployed has been used to provide direct returns to shareholders. In 2010, we returned about $3 billion of capital directly through increased dividends and share repurchases. And we also spent a little more than $900 million in M&A activity in 2010, most of that was invested in international Cable Networks and video game companies, both of which are areas of strategic importance for the company. 
Our continued commitment to provide returns to shareholders is evident in our board's decision to raise the annual dividend and to increase the amount available under our share repurchase program. This year, our philosophy towards managing the balance sheet will not change, but our approach rather continues to evolve. In an effort to improve shareholder returns, this year, we will likely move leverage up somewhat closer to our target of 2.5x and that's up from around 2x today. Right now, we would expect to do that through increased returns to shareholders, and if they arise, targeted M&A opportunities. At the same time, we're going to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides significant flexibility and a solid credit rating. 
So with that all being said, now let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll be ready to start the Q&A portion of the call."

And the short answer to your question is we don't separately price or bill for TV Everywhere. We think this is part of the overall definition of any TV network, and basically along with high definition, VOD and now TV Everywhere. It's part of the pricing that goes across the Networks, across the sub basis, across devices, across platforms. So we're very pleased with the deal we struck. We think Comcast is also. And it really does support our expectation that both John and I said very clearly, that we're going to continue to have very attractive affiliate fee growth in the future, and this deal supports that. Now in terms of the second question, which is what are we thinking about and why are we re-evaluating the Netflix Redbox. Think of it as Subscription service or the economy Subscription Service business and how it relates to all of our different windows. We're very happy that the window that we've got on DVD. It's currently 28 days if not current. We think it's better to have the window than not have the window in terms of supporting higher-priced DVD sales, electronic sell-through and rental and VOD. But it's getting kind of clear that the acceleration in consumer usage of these kinds of services, including Netflix, makes it a good time for us to re-evaluating terms and in our view, the current pricing and window are not really commensurate with the value that those kinds of availability to our films are extracting. So we can't really be more specific at this time.

We tended to focus and we've said this on our Investor Day on Lin America right up through Mexico, Central and Eastern Europe and India as places that we think have attractive growth dynamic, hospitality to international investors and Networks media companies and a commitment to the rule of law that allows media to function well. That's essentially how we'd been looking at the world. The numbers we gave today will increase dramatically, and we think double our earnings over a period of just a few years. That's for our existing Networks and investments. And I wouldn't want to re-emphasize whether it's the Turner, HBO, Warner channel group across Latin America, which is the number one group for that entire region, whether it's HBO's Networks in Central Europe, Latin America or Asia, all of which are number one in their markets, whether it's our investment in CME, which we think will increase its competitive position across Eastern Europe, places where we already are pretty strong. And we see opportunity, and we'll be fairly disciplined about those for us to get in market-leading positions further in those markets, Networks, local production including TV formats that can be used across the world.

And then maybe more of a strategic question for Jeff. A lot of the distributors have started to roll out these low-end TV essentials digital economy packages and whether it's Netflix or the economy multi-channel subs aren't really growing anymore. So there's probably an argument to be made at least in the short-term that a low-end package makes sense. How do you as a programmer and as a company that generate significant earnings from fully distributed Networks think about those low-end packages and how you sort of make your content available to those?"

I'll probably take the first is as a quick answer to your question, without putting words in my mouth, it's yes. If you look at the map that it would require in order to lift the leverage ratio from around 2x to 2.5x, we have excess capacity that would be in the $1 billion [ph] and would indicate that utilization of that capacity would be higher this year versus last. And as I said in my proactive remarks that would be some combination of direct returns and if opportunities arise and we're applying the same discipline and filters that we have over the last few years as it relates to M&A but if opportunities arise, we reduce target and M&A as well. But absent those opportunities arising, you would expect the pace of our repurchases to go up. Second question is on free cash flow. Again, what I would basically say is that we would expect in 2011 that our conversion percentages going to dip a little bit versus 2010. There's nothing systemic or structural in that. It's the timing of payments related to investments that we're going to be making and that we would expect the conversion to go right back up beyond '11.

I think I'll speak for our company rather than others. Whether it's us on the selling side at Warner or us on the buying side at Turner, it's becoming pretty clear that the big value in TV licensing, both the value to the consumer, the network you want to bid for and offer it on your channel, that would be Turner or the value that comes from that with pretty high or actually increasing Syndication prices that go to licensors like Warner it makes no sense to take those rights that are sitting, let's say, a big show like The Mentalist coming on to TNT and have it in another place where the sprockets rounding off of it. So what happened of course, is that our Networks aren't licensing anything because remember when a show now even a show off network, a syndicated show, if it goes on TNT or TSB or truTV, it's going to be available to our viewers four or five episodes on free on-demand basis. If you've got the Networks, you've got that show and you can keep up with the show on any device. You can watch it on your iPad, you can watch it wherever you want and you don't have to pay extra for it. As every network in the country moves to that model, people are not going to want to pay extra for some Subscription service when they've already got all these shows and by the same token, really powerful Networks like TNT themselves to ours. They're not going to pay big money for those shows if the shows are somewhere else being sold at a bargain basement rate. So I think it's pretty clear that value of Syndication rights are going up because TV Everywhere is making things more valuable and more useful to consumers. And the window going to have to be clearer as to when these things go into, let's call it, end-of-life unlimited sprockets running off kinds of exhibitions."

So all of that is there for HBO subscribers. It's really one service. It's programming environment. And as a viewer, you know that you may want to watch the show on HBO and not that show. So we're not going to breakout the network either as a service from show to show. We're not going to turn it into a -- it's not Advertising supported, so it doesn't look for kind of mass audience. So what we really have now is first is that HBO GO is through its subscriber base and it's just becoming as it has in VOD ever more valuable, ever more useful, every more easy for you as an HBO sub to get and watch your favorite show whenever you want them, whatever device that you have. If you go to the specific question that you asked about whether we'll make a direct consumer product separate from the package it's currently in, we do have the ability to do that. It's not something we're about to do today. We have a very good relationship with our distributors. There's significant benefits in that for our distributors marketing it doing customer service, providing the infrastructure both at VOD streaming along to your set-top and your big TV and the Internet infrastructure that supports broadband delivered to your house. These are not small items, and I think everyone has to think carefully about what is needed to maintain the capability of the broadband infrastructure to deliver video because what we're talking about here with TV Everywhere and HBO GO is a massive increase in the amount of video that American consumers are going to be able to have at no extra charge.

I think the organic returns in the Networks business you're absolutely right, it's the best business we have. It's we believe arguably one of the best business models in the entire media industry. And notwithstanding the fact that we've been ramping up programming investments, the returns are staying at very, very high rates because the revenues are growing at very fast rates too. So in the past couple of years, few years, we've been investing to grow our scale positions internationally and we're going to continue to look as Jeff said earlier at more and more opportunities to do that within targeted parameters. I think more broadly, we do think there are opportunities or there may be opportunities over time to gain scale domestically horizontally by adding to our footprint with domestic cable Networks. But that really comes down to the what is the available asset and then what is the price paid. You can drive your returns into a ditch pretty fast if you overpay. So I think there it would have to be opportunistic and a prudent allocation of capital. And then on the film side, I think our Film group probably has at or near the highest returns in the industry is our guess and given their position every year, year in and year out profitability would seem to support that. And yes, we've been investing in the Film business, and we would certainly entertain incremental investments wherever they make sense."

First of all, '08 is hard to even look at free cash flow because we had Cable and AOL. I think '09, we had very, very strong, frankly, even higher than we anticipated free cash flow conversion. And I think was very, very high based on historical standards. And in '10 versus '09, bear in mind that we had a $250 million payment that we made to settle litigation, and we had a $70 million prepayment related to the NCAA. So those are notable working capital adjustments coupled along with higher cash taxes that if you just look at the working capital, those two items, year-over-year we would have been up versus down free cash flow. And I mean, frankly, this is not to say that we don't pay attention to free cash because, obviously, we do. It's just harder to look at any one year-over-year growth comparison because I think the nature of the working capital adjustments are going to bounce it around. But when you look at the characteristics that underlie our businesses, if we can continue to grow revenue and earnings, the free cash is going to be there, and we feel very strongly about that. Our capital intensity of business are not changing. We have very low CapEx. That's not going to change, and so I'm not that worried about it.

It really is the fastest deployment in Pay TV history, far faster than VOD or DVR.

The impressive results we posted today reflect the continuation of a multiyear plan we put in place a few years ago. In 2008, we shifted our focus to become a pure content company and moved to permanently reduce our cost base. 
In 2009, we successfully navigated the economic downturn. And in that year, we further improved the company's operating efficiency, strengthened our balance sheet and grew adjusted earnings per share almost 30%. This last year, 2010, we significantly accelerated our pace in three important areas: Growth, investment and returns. We posted our highest revenue growth in years, and we grew adjusted operating income well ahead of plan. 
We increased adjusted EPS by over 30%, putting us up 70% over the past two years. We invested substantially to strengthen the long-term competitive position and growth profile of our businesses, and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. That's more than 100% of our free cash flow.
In 2011, we'll continue this course, grow, invest and return. We're even more confident, so we're going to take even more aggressive steps. This year, we intend to again deliver strong financial results. As you saw in our outlook release this morning, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the low-teens in 2011.
Assuming we achieve that, it means we'll have almost doubled our earnings in three years. At the same time, we'll ramp up our investment in programming, production and marketing even more than we did last year. And this morning, as you saw, we announced that we are raising our dividend 11%, and we're increasing our repurchase authorization to $5 billion. That paves the way for us to return even more capital to our shareholders this year.
We'll achieve these goals by focusing on the four strategic objectives that we've discussed with you before: First, invest aggressively to use our competitive advantages in making great content; second, develop and accelerate new business models that harness technology to improve both the consumer experience and our economics; third, expand internationally in key territories; and fourth, improve both our operating and capital efficiency. For example, while we plan to invest more in our businesses this year, we'll fund that by keeping a lid on our other costs.
So what does that mean in practice at each of our four businesses? At Turner, we'll keep acquiring and developing the high-quality programming that drives audiences, bolsters our brands and attracts advertisers. This year, that means sports programming like the NCAA men's basketball tournament. It means the top original programming on cable including returning hits like Rizzoli & Isles and new shows like Falling Skies from Steven Spielberg. It means acquiring blockbusters like The Big Bang Theory and our new late-night powerhouse, Conan, which is the number one late-night talk show during the fourth quarter.
This emphasis on high-quality programming increases the value we deliver to both advertisers and to our affiliates. As advertisers shift dollars away from broadcast to seek more efficient products, they're increasingly looking to Turner. That was evident this quarter when Turner's domestic entertainment networks grew ad revenue in the high-teens organically. And it was evident in the upfront last year when Turner's CPM growth exceeded all the broadcast networks, and that's tangible evidence that the CPM gap is narrowing. 
With healthy advertising climate, our strong programming lineups, the strength of our brands and the appeal of the environments we offer, we're confident that we'll post strong advertising growth again this year. Our affiliates are also increasingly recognizing the value of the must-have programming that we air. As you know, affiliate fees are one of the most important growth drivers for our company. 
Lately, we've become even more confident that we will continue to post high single-digit affiliate fee growth over the next several years, and that is before all of the benefits of some of our recent investments like the NCAA kick-in. Just last month, we completed a multiyear deal with one of our largest distributors, covering some of our biggest networks, and I can't be specific about the terms, but importantly, in that deal, we're increasing our rates of affiliate fee growth even faster than the prior agreement. 
At HBO, we'll continue to invest aggressively in our content too. In 2011, we'll air 12 original shows, up from 10 last year. We'll bring back True Blood, Boardwalk Empire and Entourage, which ranked among the highest rated original shows on cable. Among other new shows this year, in the spring we'll debut Game of Thrones, based on the popular fantasy novels, which we expect will be another big hit. At the same time, this year, we'll continue making progress in rolling out TV Everywhere at both Turner and HBO. 
Turner ended 2010 with TV Everywhere versions of our networks available to over 45 million households. And by the middle of 2011, we expect to have agreements covering 70 million homes. HBO GO is now available to over 40% of its subscriber base and is on track to be available to the overwhelming majority of its subscribers in the next few months.
We'll also keep expanding internationally at our Networks businesses. At Turner, our international operations grew to 18% of revenue in 2010. That's up from 15% in 2009, powered by strong growth in Latin America and in Asia. You may recall that on our Investor Day in May, we set a goal that international would reach 20% of revenue at Turner over the next few years. We now expect to exceed that target.
At HBO, we continue to experience strong growth internationally as well. International subscribers grew over 10% in 2010 to 43 million, and in 2011, HBO will increase local production internationally and continue to roll out new features like high-definition, On Demand and GO.
When including our majority on joint ventures at HBO, our combined international network businesses generated nearly $2.5 billion of revenue and around $500 million of adjusted operating income in 2010. Based on current trends, over the next four years, we expect to double operating profits from our international networks to $1 billion. 
Okay, let me turn to Warner Bros., where we're also stepping up our levels of investment. We are excited about our theatrical slate in 2011, which includes event films like the finale of the Harry Potter franchise, Green Lantern, Happy Feet 2, The Hangover 2 and the next Sherlock Holmes. As you know, we're focusing even more of our resources on event films. Warner produces more of these films each year than any studio, and it distributes them better than any studio. Importantly, event films also tend to be more consistently profitable for us than smaller movies.
We are also increasing our investment in TV production in 2011, both domestically and internationally. We see very strong secular dynamics for TV production in the U.S. Broadcast networks are funneling retrans payments back into programming investments. There's growing demand for original cable series, and we've seen record prices for the top shows coming off broadcast in the syndication. This year, we'll ramp up the development of new shows for broadcast, particularly comedies, and we'll increase production to meet the demand for original cable series. We're expanding our local production capabilities internationally. There is rising demand for local production globally, and building this infrastructure will also enable us to export successful shows and successful formats around the world, including back into the U.S.
Last year, we acquired Shed Media, one of the largest independent production companies in the U.K., and we'll keep looking for ways to expand our capabilities. At the same time, Warner Bros. will be at the forefront of accelerating the digital transition in film. It's arguably the area of our business that's going through the most change right now. There are risks associated with that, but also a lot of opportunity. As you know, we've been pushing to create windows that advantage our most profitable channels and to increase the appeal for consumers to buy and to rent movies digitally.
This year, we plan to launch a premium VOD offering that will enable consumers to watch movies in their homes 60 days after its theatrical release. We'll begin offering it in the second quarter and expect it to be available through all major distributors by year end. Another important initiative for us this year is UltraViolet or UV for short. As a reminder, UV will allow consumers to buy movies or TV shows either download or in physical media and then watch them through a broad array of apps and devices wherever and whenever they want. 
At CBS last month, we announced that in the second half of this year, all theatrical new releases from Warner will be UV-enabled along with those from Fox, Sony and Universal. If the industry executes it right, UV should dramatically boost the appeal of owning movies.
As we push to accelerate the digital transition, we'll also look at the economics of the entire home video category. We're rethinking how much we extract from some of these new distribution channels. For instance, this year, we'll determine whether to lengthen the window for Netflix and Redbox, and how much the increase what we charge them for our DVDs. 
Turning to Time Inc. Although the environment is still challenging for print magazines, we intend to grow profits again in 2011. Our first priority is to drive top line growth. That will require strong execution in traditional areas like circulation and ad sales, but will also come from new areas of focus like marketing services and e-commerce. At the same time, we'll remain focused on our operating efficiency. We'll also keep investing to develop new tablet versions of our magazine brands. We're quite proud of what we have out there so far. As we have discussed with you before, we're very optimistic about the tablet opportunity. It's a great experience for our readers and a rich environment for our advertisers.
For digital magazines to take off, we need to offer consumers the flexibility of purchasing single-copy digital issues, having digital-only descriptions and having a content everywhere approach that allows us to offer dual print and digital subscriptions. And it's critical to the long-term health of our business that we can do that while also retaining customer relationship and the data of what they are using and what they like. We've had constructive discussions with a number of tablet manufacturers, and we're confident we'll be able to offer consumers the flexibility they want across a wide variety of tablets this year. 
I'll wrap up before I hand it off to John. When I became CEO three years ago, my goals were to refocus Time Warner into the premier global content company and to improve shareholder returns. We've made a lot of progress towards those goals over the last few years, and I'm excited about our momentum heading into 2011. But in many respects, I think we're still in the early part of this process, and there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us. This is a time of significant change in the media industry, but I'm confident more than ever that we are well positioned to benefit as shifts in technology increase the demand for our content, both in the United States and around the world. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John."
24689,118170557,98161,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. And as Jeff just said, last year, we accelerated the pace of growth, investment and returns. And this year, our plan is to",2582,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. And as Jeff just said, last year, we accelerated the pace of growth, investment and returns. And this year, our plan is to make even more progress and be even more aggressive in pursuing those goals. 
Financially, that means in 2010, we delivered 17% growth in adjusted operating income and more than 30% growth in adjusted EPS. This growth rate beat our most recent outlook and was well ahead of our initial outlook at the beginning of 2010 of mid-teens growth. To put this in perspective, we've grown adjusted EPS, as Jeff said, 70% in just the last two years. And at the same time, we've been fully investing in our businesses. 
Last year, we increased our investments in programming, production and marketing in the high single digits, and we reallocated resources away from less productive areas like G&A. That investment will drive long-term growth for the company, and we did that while continuing to maintain very high levels of returns on invested capital. 
As we discussed with you on our Investor Day in May, we consider returns on invested capital or ROIC to be an important yardstick of our performance and an important tool in making capital allocation decisions. The way we look at it, which excludes certain purchase price adjustments, our ROIC increased to 20% in 2010, and that's very good. And reflecting our commitments to improve shareholder returns, we've also stepped up our returns of capital, increasing both our dividend and our share repurchases. When taken together, we returned more than 100% of our free cash flow last year. 
This year, our outlook calls for low-teens growth in adjusted EPS. And as Jeff mentioned, that means that if we achieve this year's outlook, we will have almost have doubled our adjusted EPS over a three-year period. This outlook reflects our plan to increase investments in programming, production and marketing, but to restrain overall expense growth, we're going to continue to keep a lid on other costs. Also reflecting our commitment to returns, our board recently authorized both an increase in our annual dividend to $0.94 per share and an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion.
Turning to the next slide, which shows consolidated fourth quarter and full year financial results. For the full year, revenues grew $1.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. That's our highest growth rate since 2004. Revenues were up nicely at most of our divisions, with increases across subscription, advertising and content. The largest portion of that increase was in subscription revenues, driven by an 8% increase at our Networks segment, and that was due to a higher affiliate fees at both HBO and Turner. 
Advertising revenues grew even faster, up 10% for the year, and the vast majority of that growth came from our networks as Turner saw a big rebound in advertising growth for both its domestic and its international networks. Publishing advertising also increased for the full year as the print advertising environment stabilized. And content revenues were up nicely as well as in 2010, and that was primarily due to stronger television product at Warner Bros. and HBO, as we benefited from our increased investments in high-quality programming there. 
Continuing down the income statement. Overall operating expenses grew only in the low single digits, and that reflected significantly higher spending on programming, including originals and sports, TV and film production and marketing as I mentioned. But we funded that by lowering the rest of our expenses. So as a result, we were able to grow adjusted operating income nearly 3x as fast as our revenue growth, with margins expanding close to 200 basis points. 
Looking very quickly at the quarter, we had a strong fourth quarter. Revenue growth accelerated to 8%. That was our highest growth rate in the last three years. Advertising revenues were particularly strong, up 13% in the fourth quarter, and that was our highest growth rate of the year. Adjusted operating income grew 14% as expenses, again, rose more slowly than revenue. And adjusted EPS grew 22% year-over-year in the quarter, and that growth rate was helped by having fewer shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchases. 
Turning next to our divisional results, and let me start with our Networks group, where 2010 was another terrific year. We grew revenue double digits, and along with ongoing expense control, that led to growth in adjusted operating income of 18%. And both HBO and Turner recorded their highest annual revenues and profits ever. The fourth quarter was particularly strong, with revenue growth accelerating sequentially across HBO and Turner. 
I'll remind you that this year, we had some transactions that benefited growth, and those included international transactions, as well as Turner assuming management of Time's digital sports properties. If you were to look through those, organic advertising growth accelerated to 12% in the fourth quarter. 
Domestic entertainment networks, together with kids and young adults, grew advertising strong double digits in the quarter, and that was offset by mid-single-digit declines at domestic news. At our international networks, organic ad revenue growth was in the high single digits in the quarter. And for the year, organic international advertising revenue was up high-teens, and adjusted OI margins expanded by 400 basis points. 
Looking to the first quarter, domestic scatter pricing remains very strong, up solid double digits over the upfront; and cancellations have remained extremely low, which is yet another positive sign as we enter the new year. Also recall that this is the first year of our coverage of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. So in the first quarter, we expect to see a significant boost in ad revenue. Advertising trends were also very positive at our international networks. 
Looking over at subscription revenues, they continue to show nice growth in the fourth quarter, increasing 9%, and there was about 200 basis points of that growth coming from the consolidation of HBO Central Europe. Over at HBO, as we expected, we ended the year with our domestic subscriber count lower by about 1.6 million. And as I outlined in detail on our last earnings call, these declines were primarily tied to two distributors and were mostly non-revenue-generating subscribers, so they had little to no financial impact, and HBO still grew domestic subscriber revenue in the mid-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. 
Moving on, our programming lineup at HBO drove content revenues higher for both the quarter and the year. And in the quarter, that related primarily to the home video release of The Pacific and the international licensing revenue for Boardwalk Empire. Adjusted operating income at the Networks group increased 20% in the quarter, as margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year. As planned, our programming expenses were up 9%, and that was mostly due to increased originals and sports programming. But for the full year, programming expenses were up only 5%.
For 2011, our investments in the NCAA men's basketball tournament is a clear example of how we're investing to drive growth, and we're actually more enthusiastic about the deal now than when we signed it. Both the partnership with CBS and our initial ad sales have exceeded our expectations. As you know, the basketball contract will be a modest drag on network profitability in 2011 that will mostly hit in the first quarter of the year. And given its impact, networks' adjusted operating income is likely to be up only modestly in the March quarter, but we expect it to be very profitable for us in the coming years, and we fully expect it to be a key growth driver over the long term. Even when you consider the NCAA impact, however, we expect 2011 will be a great year for our Networks group, and we see continued growth in our subscription fees. We're optimistic about our advertising environment, and we expect strong growth from our international businesses, so we anticipate very, very attractive profit growth for the full year.
Moving over to film. Warner Bros. had a terrific year in 2010, with its profits falling just short of the record levels achieved in 2009. And this year, as Jeff said, we have a terrific film slate ahead of us, and Warner Bros. should benefit from releasing the last two films in the Harry Potter franchise on home video later this year. 2011 will also be a big year for Warner Bros. TV production, which has maintained its position as the leading supplier of network television content, and we'll benefit from a syndication pipeline that includes the off-network availability of The Big Bang Theory. 
The performance of our Games business should also improve in 2011 versus 2010. The release slate this year includes Batman: Arkham City, LEGO Star Wars 3 and Mortal Kombat 9. Taking all this into consideration, we expect Warner Bros. will have its highest profit year ever in 2011. 
As you think about this year's quarters, however, keep in mind that film profitability will likely be weighted towards the second half of the year, and why is that the case? That's due to tough comparisons in the first quarter wherein last year's first quarter, we had a huge growth rates year-over-year, and it's also due to just the timing of our theatrical and home video releases this year. 
Moving on to Time Inc., which is on the next slide. Despite a still challenging operating environment, publishing posted great profit growth in the quarter and for the year in 2010. Advertising revenues were up 3% for the year. As anticipated, they declined slightly in the quarter, and that was due to the impact of transferring management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner in the fourth quarter. If it were not for this transfer, during the quarter, ad revenues would have been up slightly year-over-year. And as we look at the first quarter, for the moment, of this year, overall advertising trends are relatively consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Subscription revenues were down 7% in the fourth quarter, and that was due largely to softer trends at newsstands. However, we expect subscription revenue fundamentals to stabilize this year and improve as the year progresses. Adjusted operating income was up 63% in the fourth quarter, and margins expanded 700 basis points. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc., and note that this included the impact of about $40 million in restructuring costs, and that compares throughout $90 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
For the year, operating expenses declined by about $300 million, and they are now down nearly $900 million over the last two years. We anticipate overall cost this year at Time Inc. to be relatively flat as compared with what they were last year. 
Moving on now to the next slide, which has our 2011 outlook. We expect revenue growth this year to remain very strong, and that's due to current trends in the advertising environment, an expanding programming lineup, healthy and consistent subscription revenue trends, and higher content revenues led by TV licensing and games. We also anticipate significant growth from our international operations. 
As I previously mentioned, we're going to continue to invest fully in key growth areas across our businesses, while keeping a lid on overhead expenses. From a P&L standpoint, what does that mean? It means that in 2011, we expect expense growth in areas such as programming, production and marketing to be up in the high single digits, and that includes the impact of the NCAA. But we expect all other operating expenses to grow at a much, much lower rate. 
This is all reflected in today's outlook. As you saw in the release, we expect full year adjusted EPS to increase in the low-teens, and that's off a base of $2.41 from a year ago. Last quarter, we mentioned that due to proactive tax planning and a larger share of our earnings coming from international operations, we expect that our effective tax rate to be around 37%. I'd add to that now by saying that due to the recent tax legislation that occurred in December, we now expect it to be a little bit lower than that, possibly around 36% in 2011. 
Turning to the next slide, which looks at free cash flow. Our businesses continue to convert at high percentage of profits into free cash. For the year, we generated approximately $2.7 billion of free cash flow, and that was burdened by a significant increase in working capital, which included $250 million in payments related to the resolution of litigation, as well as a $70 million prepayment to the NCAA. As we move forward, we don't see any change in the capital needs of our businesses; and therefore, we anticipate that we'll continue to convert a significant amount of adjusted income. Our conversion could be down somewhat in 2011, however, and that would be due to timing of our investment spending in programming and production, as Jeff described, as well as higher year-over-year cash taxes. We anticipate that conversions will trend higher over the next several years, as our near-term investments in content pay off.
And moving on to the last slide, which is our final slide, and it looks at our net debt. We ended the year with about $12.9 billion in net debt, and that was up about $1.4 billion compared to the end of 2009 and up slightly compared to the third quarter.
During the past two years, we've invested in our businesses while improving our balance sheet strength and preserving overall flexibility. To put this in some perspective, in 2009, we used the dividend from Time Warner Cable to pay down $6.6 billion of debt. And in 2010, we took additional advantage of the low interest rate environment to extend the maturities of approximately $5 billion of our debt and reduce future interest expense. At the same time, we deployed excess capital to reduce our cash balances and improve our balance sheet efficiency. 
The significant majority of the excess capital we have deployed has been used to provide direct returns to shareholders. In 2010, we returned about $3 billion of capital directly through increased dividends and share repurchases, and we also spent a little more than $900 million in M&A activity in 2010, most of that was invested in international cable networks and video game companies, both of which are areas of strategic importance for the company. 
Our continued commitment to provide returns to shareholders is evident in our board's decision to raise the annual dividend and to increase the amount available under our share repurchase program. This year, our philosophy towards managing the balance sheet will not change, but our approach rather continues to evolve. In an effort to improve shareholder returns, this year, we will likely move leverage up somewhat closer to our target of 2.5x, and that's up from around 2x today. Right now, we would expect to do that through increased returns to shareholders, and if they arise, targeted M&A opportunities. At the same time, we're going to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides significant flexibility and a solid credit rating. 
So with that all being said, now let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll be ready to start the Q&A portion of the call."

And the short answer to your question is we don't separately price or bill for TV Everywhere. We think this is part of the overall definition of any TV network, and basically along with multiplex, high-definition, VOD and now TV Everywhere. It's part of the pricing that goes across the networks, across the sub basis, across devices, across platforms. So we're very pleased with the deal we struck. We think Comcast is also. And it really does support our expectation that both John and I said very clearly that we're going to continue to have very attractive affiliate fee growth in the future, and this deal supports that. Now in terms of the second question, which is what are we thinking about and why are we re-evaluating the Netflix, Redbox. Think of it as subscription service or the economy subscription service business and how it relates to all of our different windows. We're very happy that the window that we've got on DVD, it's currently 28 days if not current. We think it's better to have the window than not have the window in terms of supporting higher-priced DVD sales, electronic sell-through and rental and VOD. But it's getting kind of clear that the acceleration in consumer usage of these kinds of services, including Netflix, makes it a good time for us to re-evaluate the terms. And in our view, the current pricing and window are not really commensurate with the value that those kinds of availability of our films are extracting. So we can't really be more specific at this time. We just think that the value that film companies or our company should get for that period of exhibition is considerably higher than what's there now."

A lot of the distributors have started to roll out these low-end TV essential digital economy packages, and whether it's Netflix cord cutting or the economy, million of multi-channel subs aren't really growing anymore. So there's probably an argument to be made at least in the short term that a low-end package makes sense. How do you as a programmer and as a company that generate significant earnings from fully distributed networks think about those low-end packages, and how you sort of make your content available to those?"

The first is as a quick answer to your question, without putting words in my mouth, it's yes. If you look at the math that it would require in order to lift the leverage ratio from around 2x to 2.5x, we have excess capacity that would be in the billions of dollars and would indicate that utilization of that capacity would be higher this year versus last. And as I said in my proactive remarks, that would be some combination of direct returns, and if opportunities arise and we're applying the same discipline and filters that we have over the last few years as it relates to M&A, but if opportunities arise, we'll reduce the target and M&A as well. But absent those opportunities arising, you would expect the pace of our repurchases to go up. Second question is on free cash flow. Again, what I would basically say is that we would expect in 2011 though our conversion percentage is going to dip a little bit versus 2010, there's nothing systemic or structural in that. It's the timing of payments related to investments that we're going to be making, and then we would expect the conversion to go right back up beyond '11. The materiality of the conversion decline also is not expected to be all that much, but we just wanted to at least give you a sense of the direction."

And similar packages like this, which are a good thing for the industry to offer in case consumers, probably small groups of consumers want to avail themselves, it just haven't received traction in the past. And so without getting into too many specifics about it, our distribution contracts have terms and conditions that would limit the potential penetration of this kind of a package. So it's not a concern for us, and as the distributors do this for certain consumer groups, we basically have to be carried on the most wide distributors here. So we don't anticipate any particular effects, certainly not a negative effect from them."

So what happened of course is that our networks aren't licensing anything, because remember, when a show now, even a show off network, a syndicated show, if it goes on TNT or CBS or truTV, it's going to be available to our viewers four or five episodes on a free On Demand basis. If you've got the networks, you've got that show, and you can keep up with the show on any device. You can watch it on your iPad, you can watch it wherever you want and you don't have to pay extra for it. As every network in the country moves to that model, people are not going to want to pay extra for some subscription service when they've already got all these shows. And by the same token, really powerful networks like TNT buying themselves to ours. They're not going to pay big money for those shows if the shows are somewhere else being sold at a bargain basement rate. So I think it's pretty clear that value of syndication rights are going up because TV Everywhere is making things more valuable and more useful to consumers. And the window are going to have to be clearer as to when these things go into, let's call it, end-of-life unlimited sprockets running off kinds of exhibition."

It's really one service. It's a programming environment. And as a viewer, you know that you may want to watch this show on HBO and not that show. So we're not going to breakup the network, either as a service from show to show. We're not going to turn it into a -- it's not advertising supported, so it doesn't look for kind of mass audience. So what we really have now is first is that HBO GO is through its subscriber base and it's just becoming, as it has in VOD, ever more valuable, ever more useful, ever more easy for you as an HBO sub to get and watch your favorite show whenever you want them, whatever device that you have. If you go to the specific question that you asked about whether we'll make a direct to consumer product separate from the package it's currently in, we do have the ability to do that. It's not something we're about to do today. We have a very good relationship with our distributors. There's significant benefits in that for our distributors marketing it, doing customer service, providing the infrastructure both at VOD streaming along to your set-top and your big TV and the internet infrastructure that supports broadband delivered to your house. These are not small items, and I think everyone has to think carefully about what is needed to maintain the capability of the broadband infrastructure to deliver video because what we're talking about here with TV Everywhere and HBO GO is a massive increase in the amount of video that American consumers are going to be able to have at no extra charge. That needs a strong plan in the cable, telco, satellite companies to support that capability."

I think the organic returns in the Networks business, you're absolutely right, it's the best business we have. It's we believe arguably one of the best business models in the entire media industry. And notwithstanding the fact that we've been ramping up programming investments, the returns are staying at very, very high rates because the revenues are growing at very fast rates too. So in the past couple of years, few years, we've been investing to grow our scale positions internationally, and we're going to continue to look, as Jeff said earlier, at more and more opportunities to do that within targeted parameters. I think more broadly, we do think there are opportunities or there may be opportunities over time to gain scale domestically horizontally by adding to our footprint with domestic cable networks. But that really comes down to the what is the available asset and then what is the price paid. You can drive your returns into a ditch pretty fast if you overpay. So I think there, it would have to be opportunistic and a prudent allocation of capital. And then on the film side, I think our film group probably has at or near the highest returns in the industry is our guess, and given their lead position every year, year in and year out, their profitability would seem to support that.

And in '10 versus '09, bear in mind that we had a $250 million payment that we made to settle litigation, and we had a $70 million prepayment related to the NCAA. So those are notable working capital adjustments, coupled along with higher cash taxes, that if you just look at the working capital, those two items, year-over-year we would have been up versus down free cash flow. And I mean, frankly, this is not to say that we don't pay attention to free cash because obviously we do. It's just harder to look at any one year-over-year growth comparison because I think the nature of the working capital adjustments are going to bounce it around.

We believe that we will do that, and we think both Warner and Turner agree that TV Everywhere kinds of rights think of it as a four, five or six current episodes rolling will be available for everything. So I would just make a point as this thing is rolling out, HBO is probably in the lead and Turner is probably second. It really is the fastest deployment in pay TV history, far faster than VOD or DVR.

The impressive results we posted today reflect the continuation of a multiyear plan we put in place a few years ago. In 2008, we shifted our focus to become a pure content company and moved to permanently reduce our cost base. 
In 2009, we successfully navigated the economic downturn. And in that year, we further improved the company's operating efficiency, strengthened our balance sheet and grew adjusted earnings per share almost 30%. This last year, 2010, we significantly accelerated our pace in three important areas: Growth, investment and returns. We posted our highest revenue growth in years, and we grew adjusted operating income well ahead of plan. 
We increased adjusted EPS by over 30%, putting us up 70% over the past two years. We invested substantially to strengthen the long-term competitive position and growth profile of our businesses, and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. That's more than 100% of our free cash flow.
In 2011, we'll continue this course, grow, invest and return. We're even more confident, so we're going to take even more aggressive steps. This year, we intend to again deliver strong financial results. As you saw in our outlook release this morning, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the low-teens in 2011.
Assuming we achieve that, it means we'll have almost doubled our earnings in three years. At the same time, we'll ramp up our investment in programming, production and marketing even more than we did last year. And this morning, as you saw, we announced that we are raising our dividend 11%, and we're increasing our repurchase authorization to $5 billion. That paves the way for us to return even more capital to our shareholders this year.
We'll achieve these goals by focusing on the four strategic objectives that we've discussed with you before: First, invest aggressively to use our competitive advantages in making great content; second, develop and accelerate new business models that harness technology to improve both the consumer experience and our economics; third, expand internationally in key territories; and fourth, improve both our operating and capital efficiency. For example, while we plan to invest more in our businesses this year, we'll fund that by keeping a lid on our other costs.
So what does that mean in practice at each of our four businesses? At Turner, we'll keep acquiring and developing the high-quality programming that drives audiences, bolsters our brands and attracts advertisers. This year, that means sports programming like the NCAA men's basketball tournament. It means the top original programming on cable including returning hits like Rizzoli & Isles and new shows like Falling Skies from Steven Spielberg. It means acquiring blockbusters like The Big Bang Theory and our new late-night powerhouse, Conan, which is the number one late-night talk show during the fourth quarter.
This emphasis on high-quality programming increases the value we deliver to both advertisers and to our affiliates. As advertisers shift dollars away from broadcast to seek more efficient products, they're increasingly looking to Turner. That was evident this quarter when Turner's domestic entertainment networks grew ad revenue in the high-teens organically. And it was evident in the upfront last year when Turner's CPM growth exceeded all the broadcast networks, and that's tangible evidence that the CPM gap is narrowing. 
With healthy advertising climate, our strong programming lineups, the strength of our brands and the appeal of the environments we offer, we're confident that we'll post strong advertising growth again this year. Our affiliates are also increasingly recognizing the value of the must-have programming that we air. As you know, affiliate fees are one of the most important growth drivers for our company. 
Lately, we've become even more confident that we will continue to post high single-digit affiliate fee growth over the next several years, and that is before all of the benefits of some of our recent investments like the NCAA kick-in. Just last month, we completed a multiyear deal with one of our largest distributors, covering some of our biggest networks, and I can't be specific about the terms, but importantly, in that deal, we're increasing our rates of affiliate fee growth even faster than the prior agreement. 
At HBO, we'll continue to invest aggressively in our content too. In 2011, we'll air 12 original shows, up from 10 last year. We'll bring back True Blood, Boardwalk Empire and Entourage, which ranked among the highest rated original shows on cable. Among other new shows this year, in the spring we'll debut Game of Thrones, based on the popular fantasy novels, which we expect will be another big hit. At the same time, this year, we'll continue making progress in rolling out TV Everywhere at both Turner and HBO. 
Turner ended 2010 with TV Everywhere versions of our networks available to over 45 million households. And by the middle of 2011, we expect to have agreements covering 70 million homes. HBO GO is now available to over 40% of its subscriber base and is on track to be available to the overwhelming majority of its subscribers in the next few months.
We'll also keep expanding internationally at our Networks businesses. At Turner, our international operations grew to 18% of revenue in 2010. That's up from 15% in 2009, powered by strong growth in Latin America and in Asia. You may recall that on our Investor Day in May, we set a goal that international would reach 20% of revenue at Turner over the next few years. We now expect to exceed that target.
At HBO, we continue to experience strong growth internationally as well. International subscribers grew over 10% in 2010 to 43 million, and in 2011, HBO will increase local production internationally and continue to roll out new features like high-definition, On Demand and GO.
When including our majority on joint ventures at HBO, our combined international network businesses generated nearly $2.5 billion of revenue and around $500 million of adjusted operating income in 2010. Based on current trends, over the next four years, we expect to double operating profits from our international networks to $1 billion. 
Okay, let me turn to Warner Bros., where we're also stepping up our levels of investment. We are excited about our theatrical slate in 2011, which includes event films like the finale of the Harry Potter franchise, Green Lantern, Happy Feet 2, The Hangover 2 and the next Sherlock Holmes. As you know, we're focusing even more of our resources on event films. Warner produces more of these films each year than any studio, and it distributes them better than any studio. Importantly, event films also tend to be more consistently profitable for us than smaller movies.
We are also increasing our investment in TV production in 2011, both domestically and internationally. We see very strong secular dynamics for TV production in the U.S. Broadcast networks are funneling retrans payments back into programming investments. There's growing demand for original cable series, and we've seen record prices for the top shows coming off broadcast in the syndication. This year, we'll ramp up the development of new shows for broadcast, particularly comedies, and we'll increase production to meet the demand for original cable series. We're expanding our local production capabilities internationally. There is rising demand for local production globally, and building this infrastructure will also enable us to export successful shows and successful formats around the world, including back into the U.S.
Last year, we acquired Shed Media, one of the largest independent production companies in the U.K., and we'll keep looking for ways to expand our capabilities. At the same time, Warner Bros. will be at the forefront of accelerating the digital transition in film. It's arguably the area of our business that's going through the most change right now. There are risks associated with that, but also a lot of opportunity. As you know, we've been pushing to create windows that advantage our most profitable channels and to increase the appeal for consumers to buy and to rent movies digitally.
This year, we plan to launch a premium VOD offering that will enable consumers to watch movies in their homes 60 days after theatrical release. We'll begin offering it in the second quarter and expect it to be available through all major distributors by year end. Another important initiative for us this year is UltraViolet or UV for short. As a reminder, UV will allow consumers to buy movies or TV shows via download or in physical media and then watch them through a broad array of apps and devices wherever and whenever they want. 
At CBS last month, we announced that in the second half of this year, all theatrical new releases from Warner will be UV-enabled along with those from Fox, Sony and Universal. If the industry executes it right, UV should dramatically boost the appeal of owning movies.
As we push to accelerate the digital transition, we'll also look at the economics of the entire home video category. We're rethinking how much we extract from some of these new distribution channels. For instance, this year, we'll determine whether to lengthen the window for Netflix and Redbox, and how much the increase what we charge them for our DVDs. 
Turning to Time Inc. Although the environment is still challenging for print magazines, we intend to grow profits again in 2011. Our first priority is to drive top line growth. That will require strong execution in traditional areas like circulation and ad sales, but will also come from new areas of focus like marketing services and e-commerce. At the same time, we'll remain focused on our operating efficiency. We'll also keep investing to develop new tablet versions of our magazine brands. We're quite proud of what we have out there so far. As we have discussed with you before, we're very optimistic about the tablet opportunity. It's a great experience for our readers and a rich environment for our advertisers.
For digital magazines to take off, we need to offer consumers the flexibility of purchasing single-copy digital issues, having digital-only subscriptions and having a content everywhere approach that allows us to offer dual print and digital subscriptions. And it's critical to the long-term health of our business that we can do that while also retaining the customer relationship and the data of what they are using and what they like. We've had constructive discussions with a number of tablet manufacturers, and we're confident we'll be able to offer consumers the flexibility they want across a wide variety of tablets this year. 
I'll wrap up before I hand it off to John. When I became CEO three years ago, my goals were to refocus Time Warner into the premier global content company and to improve shareholder returns. We've made a lot of progress towards those goals over the last few years, and I'm excited about our momentum heading into 2011. But in many respects, I think we're still in the early part of this process, and there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us. This is a time of significant change in the media industry, but I'm confident more than ever that we are well positioned to benefit as shifts in technology increase the demand for our content, both in the United States and around the world. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John."
24689,118170557,98327,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. And as Jeff just said, last year, we accelerated the pace of growth, investment and returns. And this year, our plan is to",2582,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. And as Jeff just said, last year, we accelerated the pace of growth, investment and returns. And this year, our plan is to make even more progress and be even more aggressive in pursuing those goals. 
Financially, that means in 2010, we delivered 17% growth in adjusted operating income and more than 30% growth in adjusted EPS. This growth rate beat our most recent outlook and was well ahead of our initial outlook at the beginning of 2010 of mid-teens growth. To put this in perspective, we've grown adjusted EPS, as Jeff said, 70% in just the last two years. And at the same time, we've been fully investing in our businesses. 
Last year, we increased our investments in programming, production and marketing in the high single digits, and we reallocated resources away from less productive areas like G&A. That investment will drive long-term growth for the company, and we did that while continuing to maintain very high levels of returns on invested capital. 
As we discussed with you on our Investor Day in May, we consider returns on invested capital or ROIC to be an important yardstick of our performance and an important tool in making capital allocation decisions. The way we look at it, which excludes certain purchase price adjustments, our ROIC increased to 20% in 2010, and that's very good. And reflecting our commitments to improve shareholder returns, we've also stepped up our returns of capital, increasing both our dividend and our share repurchases. When taken together, we returned more than 100% of our free cash flow last year. 
This year, our outlook calls for low-teens growth in adjusted EPS. And as Jeff mentioned, that means that if we achieve this year's outlook, we will almost doubled our adjusted EPS over a three-year period. This outlook reflects our plan to increase investments in programming, production and marketing, but to restrain overall expense growth, we're going to continue to keep a lid on other costs. Also reflecting our commitment to returns, our board recently authorized both an increase in our annual dividend to $0.94 per share and an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion.
Turning to the next slide, which shows consolidated fourth quarter and full year financial results. For the full year, revenues grew $1.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. That's our highest growth rate since 2004. Revenues were up nicely at most of our divisions, with increases across subscription, advertising and content. The largest portion of that increase was in subscription revenues, driven by an 8% increase at our Networks segment, and that was due to a higher affiliate fees at both HBO and Turner. 
Advertising revenues grew even faster, up 10% for the year, and the vast majority of that growth came from our networks as Turner saw a big rebound in advertising growth for both its domestic and its international networks. Publishing advertising also increased for the full year as the print advertising environment stabilized. And content revenues were up nicely as well as in 2010, and that was primarily due to stronger television product at both Warner Bros. and HBO, as we benefited from our increased investments in high-quality programming there. 
Continuing down the income statement. Overall operating expenses grew only in the low single digits, and that reflected significantly higher spending on programming, including originals and sports, TV and film production and marketing as I mentioned. But we funded that by lowering the rest of our expenses. So as a result, we were able to grow adjusted operating income nearly 3x as fast as our revenue growth, with margins expanding close to 200 basis points. 
Looking very quickly at the quarter, we had a strong fourth quarter. Revenue growth accelerated to 8%. That was our highest growth rate in the last three years. Advertising revenues were particularly strong, up 13% in the fourth quarter, and that was our highest growth rate of the year. Adjusted operating income grew 14% as expenses, again, rose more slowly than revenue. And adjusted EPS grew 22% year-over-year in the quarter, and that growth rate was helped by having fewer shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchases. 
Turning next to our divisional results, and let me start with our Networks group, where 2010 was another terrific year. We grew revenue double digits, and along with ongoing expense control, that led to growth in adjusted operating income of 18%. And both HBO and Turner recorded their highest annual revenues and profits ever. The fourth quarter was particularly strong, with revenue growth accelerating sequentially across HBO and Turner. 
I'll remind you that this year, we had some transactions that benefited growth, and those included international transactions, as well as Turner assuming management of Time's digital sports properties. If you were to look through those, organic advertising growth accelerated to 12% in the fourth quarter. 
Domestic entertainment networks, together with kids and young adults, grew advertising strong double digits in the quarter, and that was offset by mid-single-digit declines at domestic news. At our international networks, organic ad revenue growth was in the high single digits in the quarter. And for the year, organic international advertising revenue was up high-teens, and adjusted OI margins expanded by 400 basis points. 
Looking to the first quarter, domestic scatter pricing remains very strong, up solid double digits over the upfront; and cancellations have remained extremely low, which is yet another positive sign as we enter the new year. Also recall that this is the first year of our coverage of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. So in the first quarter, we expect to see a significant boost in ad revenue. Advertising trends were also very positive at our international networks. 
Looking over at subscription revenues, they continue to show nice growth in the fourth quarter, increasing 9%, and there was about 200 basis points of that growth coming from the consolidation of HBO Central Europe. Over at HBO, as we expected, we ended the year with our domestic subscriber count lower by about 1.6 million. And as I outlined in detail on our last earnings call, these declines were primarily tied to two distributors and were mostly non-revenue-generating subscribers, so they had little to no financial impact, and HBO still grew domestic subscriber revenue in the mid-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. 
Moving on, our programming lineup at HBO drove content revenues higher for both the quarter and the year. And in the quarter, that related primarily to the home video release of The Pacific and the international licensing revenue for Boardwalk Empire. Adjusted operating income at the Networks group increased 20% in the quarter, as margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year. As planned, our programming expenses were up 9%, and that was mostly due to increased originals and sports programming. But for the full year, programming expenses were up only 5%.
For 2011, our investments in the NCAA men's basketball tournament is a clear example of how we're investing to drive growth, and we're actually more enthusiastic about the deal now than when we signed it. Both the partnership with CBS and our initial ad sales have exceeded our expectations. As you know, the basketball contract will be a modest drag on network profitability in 2011 that will mostly hit in the first quarter of the year. And given its impact, networks' adjusted operating income is likely to be up only modestly in the March quarter, but we expect it to be very profitable for us in the coming years, and we fully expect it to be a key growth driver over the long term. Even when you consider the NCAA impact, however, we expect 2011 will be a great year for our Networks group, and we see continued growth in our subscription fees. We're optimistic about our advertising environment, and we expect strong growth from our international businesses, so we anticipate very, very attractive profit growth for the full year.
Moving over to film. Warner Bros. had a terrific year in 2010, with its profits falling just short of the record levels achieved in 2009. And this year, as Jeff said, we have a terrific film slate ahead of us, and Warner Bros. should benefit from releasing the last two films in the Harry Potter franchise on home video later this year. 2011 will also be a big year for Warner Bros. TV production, which has maintained its position as the leading supplier of network television content, and we'll benefit from a syndication pipeline that includes the off-network availability of The Big Bang Theory. 
The performance of our Games business should also improve in 2011 versus 2010. The release slate this year includes Batman: Arkham City, LEGO Star Wars 3 and Mortal Kombat 9. Taking all this into consideration, we expect Warner Bros. will have its highest profit year ever in 2011. 
As you think about this year's quarters, however, keep in mind that film profitability will likely be weighted towards the second half of the year, and why is that the case? That's due to tough comparisons in the first quarter wherein last year's first quarter, we had a huge growth rates year-over-year, and it's also due to just the timing of our theatrical and home video releases this year. 
Moving on to Time Inc., which is on the next slide. Despite a still challenging operating environment, publishing posted great profit growth in the quarter and for the year in 2010. Advertising revenues were up 3% for the year. As anticipated, they declined slightly in the quarter, and that was due to the impact of transferring management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner in the fourth quarter. If it were not for this transfer, during the quarter, ad revenues would have been up slightly year-over-year. And as we look at the first quarter, for the moment, of this year, overall advertising trends are relatively consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Subscription revenues were down 7% in the fourth quarter, and that was due largely to softer trends at newsstands. However, we expect subscription revenue fundamentals to stabilize this year and improve as the year progresses. Adjusted operating income was up 63% in the fourth quarter, and margins expanded 700 basis points. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc., and note that this included the impact of about $40 million in restructuring costs, and that compares throughout $90 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
For the year, operating expenses declined by about $300 million, and they are now down nearly $900 million over the last two years. We anticipate overall cost this year at Time Inc. to be relatively flat as compared with what they were last year. 
Moving on now to the next slide, which has our 2011 outlook. We expect revenue growth this year to remain very strong, and that's due to current trends in the advertising environment, an expanding programming lineup, healthy and consistent subscription revenue trends, and a higher content revenues led by TV licensing and games. We also anticipate significant growth from our international operations. 
As I previously mentioned, we're going to continue to invest fully in key growth areas across our businesses, while keeping a lid on overhead expenses. From a P&L standpoint, what does that mean? It means that in 2011, we expect expense growth in areas such as programming, production and marketing to be up in the high single digits, and that includes the impact of the NCAA. But we expect all other operating expenses to grow at a much, much lower rate. 
This is all reflected in today's outlook. As you saw in the release, we expect full year adjusted EPS to increase in the low-teens, and that's off a base of $2.41 from a year ago. Last quarter, we mentioned that due to proactive tax planning and a larger share of our earnings coming from international operations, we expect that our effective tax rate to be around 37%. I'd add to that now by saying that due to the recent tax legislation that occurred in December, we now expect it to be a little bit lower than that, possibly around 36% in 2011. 
Turning to the next slide, which looks at free cash flow. Our businesses continue to convert at high percentage of profits into free cash. For the year, we generated approximately $2.7 billion of free cash flow, and that was burdened by a significant increase in working capital, which included $250 million in payments related to the resolution of litigation, as well as a $70 million prepayment to the NCAA. As we move forward, we don't see any change in the capital needs of our businesses; and therefore, we anticipate that we'll continue to convert a significant amount of adjusted income. Our conversion could be down somewhat in 2011, however, and that would be due to timing of our investment spending in programming and production, as Jeff described, as well as higher year-over-year cash taxes. We anticipate that conversions will trend higher over the next several years, as our near-term investments in content pay off.
And moving on to the last slide, which is our final slide, and it looks at our net debt. We ended the year with about $12.9 billion in net debt, and that was up about $1.4 billion compared to the end of 2009 and up slightly compared to the third quarter.
During the past two years, we've invested in our businesses while improving our balance sheet strength and preserving overall flexibility. To put this in some perspective, in 2009, we used the dividend from Time Warner Cable to pay down $6.6 billion of debt. And in 2010, we took additional advantage of the low interest rate environment to extend the maturities of approximately $5 billion of our debt and reduce future interest expense. At the same time, we deployed excess capital to reduce our cash balances and improve our balance sheet efficiency. 
The significant majority of the excess capital we have deployed has been used to provide direct returns to shareholders. In 2010, we returned about $3 billion of capital directly through increased dividends and share repurchases, and we also spent a little more than $900 million in M&A activity in 2010, most of that was invested in international cable networks and video game companies, both of which are areas of strategic importance for the company. 
Our continued commitment to provide returns to shareholders is evident in our board's decision to raise the annual dividend and to increase the amount available under our share repurchase program. This year, our philosophy towards managing the balance sheet will not change, but our approach rather continues to evolve. In an effort to improve shareholder returns, this year, we will likely move leverage up somewhat closer to our target of 2.5x, and that's up from around 2x today. Right now, we would expect to do that through increased returns to shareholders, and if they arise, targeted M&A opportunities. At the same time, we're going to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides significant flexibility and a solid credit rating. 
So with that all being said, now let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll be ready to start the Q&A portion of the call."

And the short answer to your question is we don't separately price or bill for TV Everywhere. We think this is part of the overall definition of any TV network, and basically along with multiplex, high-definition, VOD and now TV Everywhere. It's part of the pricing that goes across the networks, across the sub basis, across devices, across platforms. So we're very pleased with the deal we struck. We think Comcast is also. And it really does support our expectation that both John and I said very clearly that we're going to continue to have very attractive affiliate fee growth in the future, and this deal supports that. Now in terms of the second question, which is what are we thinking about and why are we re-evaluating the Netflix, Redbox. Think of it as a subscription service or the economy subscription service business and how it relates to all of our different windows. We're very happy that the window that we've got on DVD, it's currently 28 days, if not current. We think it's better to have the window than not have the window in terms of supporting higher-priced DVD sales, electronic sell-through and rental and VOD. But it's getting kind of clear that the acceleration in consumer usage of these kinds of services, including Netflix, makes it a good time for us to re-evaluate the terms. And in our view, the current pricing and window are not really commensurate with the value that those kinds of availability of our films are extracting. So we can't really be more specific at this time. We just think that the value that film companies or our company should get for that period of exhibition is considerably higher than what's there now."

We have to consider the growth in certain sectors like cable networks even in Western Europe are actually still going pretty strongly, so are games. And in the developing market, there's basically growth across the media sector almost in every part of the sector. We tended to focus, and we've said this on our Investor Day, on Latin America right up through Mexico, Central and Eastern Europe and India as places that we think have attractive growth dynamic, hospitality to international investors and networks and media companies, and a commitment to the rule of law that allows media to function well. That's essentially how we've been looking at the world. The numbers we gave today where we’re going to increase dramatically, and we think double our earnings over a period of just a few years. That's for our existing networks and investments. And I wouldn't want to re-emphasize whether it's the Turner, HBO, Warner channel group across Latin America, which is the number one group for that entire region. Whether it's HBO's networks in Central Europe, Latin America or Asia, all of which are number one in their markets. Whether it's our investment in CME, which we think will increase its competitive position across Eastern Europe, the places where we already are are pretty strong.

It was a big use in '10. Do you expect '11 to be another sort of $1 billion year plus use on that line item? And then maybe more of a strategic question for Jeff. A lot of the distributors have started to roll out these low-end TV essential digital economy packages, and whether it's Netflix cord cutting or the economy, million of multi-channel subs aren't really growing anymore. So there's probably an argument to be made at least in the short term that a low-end package makes sense. How do you as a programmer and as a company that generate significant earnings from fully distributed networks think about those low-end packages, and how you sort of make your content available to those?"

The first is as a quick answer to your question, without putting words in my mouth, it's yes. If you look at the math that it would require in order to lift the leverage ratio from around 2x to 2.5x, we have excess capacity that would be in the billions of dollars and would indicate that utilization of that capacity would be higher this year versus last. And as I said in my proactive remarks, that would be some combination of direct returns, and if opportunities arise and we're applying the same discipline and filters that we have over the last few years as it relates to M&A, but if opportunities arise, we'll reduce the target and M&A as well. But absent those opportunities arising, you would expect the pace of our repurchases to go up. Second question is on free cash flow. Again, what I would basically say is that we would expect in 2011 though our conversion percentage is going to dip a little bit versus 2010, there's nothing systemic or structural in that. It's the timing of payments related to investments that we're going to be making, and then we would expect the conversion to go right back up beyond '11. The materiality of the conversion decline also is not expected to be all that much, but we just wanted to at least give you a sense of the direction."

So it's not a concern for us, and as the distributors do this for certain consumer groups, we basically have to be carried on the most wide distributors here.

So what happened of course is that our networks aren't licensing anything, because remember, when a show now, even a show off network, a syndicated show, if it goes on TNT or CBS or truTV, it's going to be available to our viewers four or five episodes on a free On Demand basis. If you've got the networks, you've got that show, and you can keep up with the show on any device. You can watch it on your iPad, you can watch it wherever you want and you don't have to pay extra for it. As every network in the country moves to that model, people are not going to want to pay extra for some subscription service when they've already got all these shows. And by the same token, really powerful networks like TNT buying themselves to ours. They're not going to pay big money for those shows if the shows are somewhere else being sold at a bargain basement rate. So I think it's pretty clear that value of syndication rights are going up because TV Everywhere is making things more valuable and more useful to consumers. And the windows are going to have to be clearer as to when these things go into, let's call it, end-of-life unlimited sprockets running off kinds of exhibition."

It's available with 10 or 15 multiplex channels, it's high-def, it's going to be 3D, it's now going to be On Demand, on broadband on every device. So all of that is there for HBO subscribers. It's really one service. It's a programming environment. And as a viewer, you know that you may want to watch this show on HBO and not that show. So we're not going to breakup the network, either as a service from show to show. We're not going to turn it into a -- it's not advertising supported, so it doesn't look for kind of mass audience. So what we really have now is first is that HBO GO is through its subscriber base and it's just becoming, as it has in VOD, ever more valuable, ever more useful, ever more easy for you as an HBO sub to get and watch your favorite show whenever you want them, whatever device that you have. If you go to the specific question that you asked about whether we'll make a direct to consumer product separate from the package it's currently in, we do have the ability to do that. It's not something we're about to do today. We have a very good relationship with our distributors. There's significant benefits in that for our distributors marketing it, doing customer service, providing the infrastructure both the VOD streaming along to your set-top and your big TV and the internet infrastructure that supports broadband delivered to your house. These are not small items, and I think everyone has to think carefully about what is needed to maintain the capability of the broadband infrastructure to deliver video because what we're talking about here with TV Everywhere and HBO GO is a massive increase in the amount of video that American consumers are going to be able to have at no extra charge. That needs a strong plan in the cable, telco, satellite companies to support that capability."

I think the organic returns in the Networks business, you're absolutely right, it's the best business we have. It's we believe arguably one of the best business models in the entire media industry. And notwithstanding the fact that we've been ramping up programming investments, the returns are staying at very, very high rates because the revenues are growing at very fast rates too. So in the past couple of years, few years, we've been investing to grow our scale positions internationally, and we're going to continue to look, as Jeff said earlier, at more and more opportunities to do that within targeted parameters. I think more broadly, we do think there are opportunities or there may be opportunities over time to gain scale domestically horizontally by adding to our footprint with domestic cable networks. But that really comes down to what is the available asset and then what is the price paid. You can drive your returns into a ditch pretty fast if you overpay. So I think there, it would have to be opportunistic and a prudent allocation of capital. And then on the film side, I think our film group probably has at or near the highest returns in the industry is our guess, and given their lead position every year, year in and year out, their profitability would seem to support that. And, yes, we've been investing in the film business, and we would certainly entertain incremental investments wherever they make sense."

So the question is, at what point do you expect some kind of convergence in the operating income and free cash, which I think some of your peers actually are looking at double-digit free cash flow growth, and I realize that some of that had to do with working capital trends that you mentioned.

First of all, '08 is hard to even look at our free cash flow numbers because we had Cable and AOL. I think '09, we had very, very strong, frankly, even higher than we anticipated free cash flow conversion. And I think it was very, very high based on historical standards. And in '10 versus '09, bear in mind that we had a $250 million payment that we made to settle litigation, and we had a $70 million prepayment related to the NCAA. So those are notable working capital adjustments, coupled along with higher cash taxes, that if you just look at the working capital of those two items, year-over-year we would have been up versus down free cash flow. And I mean, frankly, this is not to say that we don't pay attention to free cash because obviously we do. It's just harder to look at any one year-over-year growth comparison because I think the nature of the working capital adjustments are going to bounce it around. But when you look at the characteristics that underlie our businesses, if we can continue to grow revenue and earnings, the free cash is going to be there, and we feel very strongly about that. Our capital intensity in the businesses are not changing. We have very low CapEx. That's not going to change, and so I'm not that worried about it.

So I would just make a point as this thing is rolling out, HBO is probably in the lead and Turner is probably second. It really is the fastest deployment in pay TV history, far faster than VOD or DVR.

We posted strong metrics this quarter including almost 20% revenue growth at our Networks segment. And while we knew coming in that we faced tough profit comparisons this quarter, our results came in right where we expected, putting us firmly on track to achieve our outlook for the full year. 
We're also making a lot of progress toward our longer-term strategic objectives. In particular, our efforts to allow consumers to buy our content once and then access it on whatever device they want, wherever and whenever they want, a set of initiatives that we call Content Everywhere, continue to gather momentum.
John will talk about our financial results in detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to highlight some of the key operational and strategic milestones that we have achieved over the past few months. And I'll start with Turner, where our investment in must-see sports is really paying off.
Of course, the big story this quarter was our NCAA coverage. It was a huge success commercially and creatively and a big boost for the TBS, TNT and truTV brands. Our collaboration with CBS worked even better than we'd anticipated in every way: ratings, financial performance, quality of the coverage and integration of our sales efforts. It was the most watched tournament since 2005, and traffic for March Madness On Demand was up over 60%. We also surpassed our expectations for ad sales, which powered Turner to over 30% ad revenue growth in the quarter.
Our investment in sports is also paying off with the NBA. The 2010-2011 regular season was the most watched in Turner's 27 years of airing the NBA, and it was up more than 40% over last year. That momentum has continued into the playoffs, making TNT the #1 network on basic cable in April and, on some nights, making TNT the #1 network on all of television.
CNN's performance this quarter was a testament to the critical role it plays in America and throughout the world. In the midst of the catastrophe in Japan and unrest in the Middle East, prime time ratings were up more than 30% during the quarter while both of its cable news competitors saw declines. This shows that when news breaks, viewers seek out the breadth of coverage, the exceptional journalism and the trusted brand that only CNN offers. It also shows why CNN is always indispensable to its affiliates even if ratings sometimes fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
You're probably curious to get our view on the upcoming upfront. I won't be too specific. But with the current premiums in the scatter market, very low levels of cancellations and supply constraints at most of the broadcast networks, all the indicators are very positive. The combination of our strong brands, high-quality programming and talented sales force makes us confident that our pricing will again be near the top end of the industry range across broadcast and Cable.  At HBO, our investments in high-quality content are also paying off. Last month, we debuted Game of Thrones to tremendous critical acclaim, and the premier has already attracted 8 million viewers. When added to our roster of other tentpole shows like True Blood and Boardwalk Empire, HBO now has the strongest slate of programming in its history. Just as this week, we also launched HBO GO on mobile devices including the iPad, iPhone and Android smartphones. Our iPad app is getting rave reviews from the consumers who are using it, and it was the most downloaded free iPad app in iTunes this weekend.
HBO GO is the first fully realized example of what TV Everywhere can be. And to those of you who've seen it, you know that it represents a quantum leap in the consumer value of subscribing to HBO. Besides all the benefits it provides to HBO and to HBO subscribers, we think it could also substantially increase consumer awareness of the TV Everywhere concept and accelerate momentum for the initiative across the industry.
Over the course of the year, we intend to steadily introduce new features including some that HBO can uniquely provide and expand availability to additional tablets and connected devices. HBO GO is now available through almost all of our major distributors, reaching about 80% of our subscriber base.
Time Warner Cable and Cablevision are the main exceptions. We're optimistic that these distributors will also realize the benefits of providing their highest revenue subscribers all this additional value at no extra cost.
Turning to our film and TV production businesses. Warner Bros. had a relatively light release late this quarter, but we're optimistic about the schedule for the rest of the year, which includes The Hangover Part I, Green Lantern, the eagerly anticipated finale of the Harry Potter franchise, Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2. 
We're also extremely well positioned at Warner Bros TV. As you know, we have a great syndication pipeline this year, most notably headlined by The Big Bang Theory. And although it's often overlooked, keep in mind that the strong advertising environment benefits Warner Bros. too. For many of our first on-and-off net syndicated shows, Warner makes up a big portion of our revenue. So while it's too early to talk about our pickups this year, we're feeling optimistic as we head into the broadcast upfronts in the next couple of weeks, both in terms of our powerful lineup of returning shows and in terms of new pilots.
With our strong film slate, the momentum in our TV business and several promising games, we continue to expect Warner will post record profits this year. 
I also want to talk for a moment about the important progress we've made toward our key home video digital initiatives over the last few months. As home video transactions continue to transition to digital, we have 2 main goals. First, we want to advantage our most profitable distribution channels; and second, we're working hard to make digital ownership more compelling for consumers. Toward these ends, we became the first studio to make it possible to rent movies through Facebook. And last week, we launched our test of premium VOD called Home Premier by offering the movie, Hall Pass through DirecTV. 
Similar to what we've done with other new windows, over the next few months, we'll expand the test to other titles and other distributors and then evaluate the impact. 
This week, we also agreed to acquire Flixster, a social network for movie fans. We'll use the Flixster brand and platform to launch several initiatives that aim to dramatically improve the consumer proposition of owning digital movies, and we'll do that in a studio-agnostic way that should benefit the whole industry. We will share more details in time. But in short order, we plan to expand the functionality of Flixster to allow consumers to organize and access their digital movie collections on whatever device they like as well as buy and rent movies.
Finally at Time Inc., during the quarter, we remain focused on outperforming the industry and maintaining the right cost structure. Like our other businesses, we also focused on giving consumers access to our content on more devices. We launched as SI All Access, which enables Sports Illustrated readers to pay one price to get the print edition, as well as a digital edition and to have it accessible online or on Android tablets and smartphones. And we just reached agreement with Apple to enable our print subscribers to access the iPad versions of Time, Sports Illustrated and FORTUNE at no extra cost. 
Before I hand it off to John, one final note. As you probably noticed, this quarter, we bought back about $1 billion of our stock. That's double the quarterly pace of last year, and it represents about 2.5% of our equity base in just one quarter. This step reflects our commitment to continue to enhance stockholder returns and our confidence in the value of our stock, our competitive position and our growth prospects. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to John."
24689,129364150,122090,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks I'll be referring to a presentation that is now available on our website. So let me begin with the first slide, which shows the highlights for the quarter. Last quarter, I talked about our plans to be ev",2054,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks I'll be referring to a presentation that is now available on our website. 
So let me begin with the first slide, which shows the highlights for the quarter. Last quarter, I talked about our plans to be even more aggressive this year, pursuing our goals of investment, growth and returns, and I think we're off to a great start this year. 
Heading into the year, we knew as Jeff said, that the first quarter would be our most challenged from a profit growth perspective. This was due to the timing of programming investments, particularly in the NCAA Tournament and the timing of our film slate, which is heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. Nevertheless, we are very pleased with our strong revenue growth in the quarter, and that was helped by the great performance of the NCAA, which surpassed our expectations and was a major driver of advertising growth.
And while adjusted operating income was down year-over-year, it came in pretty much as we expected, and we firmly remain on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. And this morning, we reaffirmed our outlook for low teens growth in adjusted EPS in 2011. We aim to do that while investing even more in our businesses and returning even more capital to our shareholders. 
During the quarter, as Jeff said, we repurchased about $1 billion of our shares, and we paid $260 million in dividends. That marks a significant acceleration from our previous patient direct returns and underscores our confidence in the fundamentals of our businesses and their cash generation capabilities.
Moving over to the next slide, which shows consolidated first quarter financial highlights. Revenues were up 6% or more than $350 million year-over-year, and that was led by robust growth in both Subscription and Advertising revenues. Content revenues were down year-over-year, and that was due primarily to the tough comps at the studio. 
Overall operating expenses grew over 10%, causing adjusted operating income to decline by 10% year-over-year. This quarter, the programming production and marketing expenses were up a lot, and much of that was due to the costs of the NCAA Tournament. Over the remainder of the year, we expect that these expenses should grow in the midsingle digits. So margin trends should improve as the year progresses.
In general, we're continuing our efforts to fund investment in high-quality content and other revenue-generating areas by reallocating capital away from overhead. That was evident again this quarter. Beyond programming production and marketing as well as acquisitions, our expenses grew only in the low-single digits year-over-year. 
Continuing to move down the P&L. Adjusted EPS declined 5% in the quarter. That was a smaller decline as compared to adjusted operating income, and that's because of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to our segment highlights, and let's begin at the Networks division, where we had very strong revenue growth at both Turner and HBO. Advertising revenues were up 31%. This was driven largely by both the NCAA coverage on our networks and the generally strong domestic pricing environment. Our domestic entertainment networks, which includes kids and young adults, grew advertising over 30% in the quarter. Domestic news was up in the high single digits, and that was helped by the improved audience delivery at CNN.
International Advertising revenue grew over 50% in the quarter, and growth here was helped by some transactions we've done in the past year. And if you look through those, Advertising revenues were up single digits. 
Growth was much stronger than that in our European and Latin American entertainment businesses, which were both up strong double digits on an organic basis. But Asia and international news were negatively impacted by the events in the Middle East and Japan. And as a result of that, they were both down in the quarter.
So far in the second quarter, domestic scatter pricing remains robust, up 20% to 30% over the upfront, and cancellations remain low. We obviously won't get the same magnitude of lift in the second quarter from the NCAA Tournament. But we still expect very, very healthy year-over-year growth. And as Jeff mentioned, we feel extremely well positioned heading into the upfront.
Subscription revenue growth remained really terrific in the first quarter, up 9%. That reflects consistent strong growth trends domestically as well as continued expansion in growth internationally. Moving on, content revenues were up almost 50%, and that was led by the strong demand for HBO's original programming, including The Pacific, Sex and the City and Boardwalk Empire. 
Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter as the Networks grew. There were 2 reasons why year-over-year growth was so modest in the quarter. The first obviously is the NCAA Tournament, where we recognized the significant majority of the costs for the year during the first quarter when the tournament was aired. Most of the remaining costs will be recognized in the second quarter; and beyond that, non-NCAA-related programming expenses also grew at a higher rate in the first quarter as compared to what we expect for the full year, but that was really just due to timing. 
So before I move on here, let me just quickly pause and give you an update on HBO subscriber counts. We said coming into the year that we expected the U.S. subscriber count to stabilize this year, and I'm happy to report that that's exactly what we've seen so far this year. So we feel pretty good about that.
Let me turn now to film on the next slide, and as Jeff said this is a very light quarter for us. And again, we knew coming into the quarter that both revenue and adjusted operating income would be down significantly year-over-year. This was due to the tough comparisons in both theatrical and home video and a 2011 release slate that is more weighted towards later quarters. 
Last year's first quarter, for example, benefited from the strong theatrical performances of Sherlock Holmes and The Blind Side, and we just didn't have any comparable titles this year. The Blind Side was also particularly strong on home video for us. That comparison, along with significantly fewer releases was the largest factor in the 21% decline in home video revenue in the quarter. 
On a more positive note, the performance of our television product was very strong in the quarter, and we have really been pleased with the initial home video release sales of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, which was released last month. This underscores the continued strong demand in home entertainment for our event films.
Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate record film profits in 2011. Our release slate starts to pick up at the second quarter with the theatrical releases of The Hangover II and the Green Lantern. In addition to the Harry Potter home video release, we have a great games lineup with Mortal Kombat 9 and LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean. That momentum should continue as the year progresses with the actual releases like the final Harry Potter and Happy Feet 2 as well as the syndication sale of Big Bang Theory. So we feel very good about the year here.
Moving over to Publishing. Advertising revenues were essentially flat in the quarter, but the reported growth rate here was affected by the transfer of management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner and the divestiture of certain titles at IPC. Excluding these 2 items, overall Advertising revenues were up 4% in the quarter, and digital Advertising revenues were up double digits. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate underlying domestic advertising trends to remain positive. 
Turning over to subscription revenues for a moment, the majority of the decline in the first quarter was in our International business, which was impacted by the divestitures at IPC that I just mentioned.
Domestic subscription revenue was also somewhat lower, however, due partly to continued pressure at newsstands. But we are seeing subscription fundamentals begin to stabilize. And as the year progresses, we expect to see an improvement in year-over-year revenue trends, particularly in the second half of the year. That reflects both favorable trends in renewals as well as the ramp up of new retail partnerships.
Operating income at Time Inc. was up 26%, with margins up 160 basis point. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc. 
Total expense here were down nearly $15 million over last year as we continue to remain focused on cost management. For the year, we continue to expect overall expenses at Publishing to be relatively flat as compared to 2010.
Moving to the next slide, which contains our 2011 outlook. Let me just pause for a second and talk about our expectations for the second quarter. As I mentioned before, coming into the year, we anticipated that the first quarter would be our most challenged from a profit growth rate perspective, and we absolutely expect profits to grow in the second quarter year-over-year. But keep in mind that we still expect to incur modest losses on the NCAA contract. And at our Film division, we expect P&A spending to be higher than the prior year, and we also expect to incur restructuring costs in the neighborhood of $25 million to $30 million.
So for Q2, we expect that year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income will clearly be considerably better than the first quarter but will lag what we will see in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year. Growth should accelerate significantly in the second half as we benefit from an improving film slate, a strong syndication lineup and lower programming expense growth at the networks.
Turning to the next slide, which looks at our free cash flow. We generated approximately $700 million of free cash in the quarter. That's a good start for the year but somewhat below the year ago levels. And the decline year-over-year was due mainly to the significant increase in working capital, and that was primarily attributable to the timing of TV syndications receipts and lower home video sales during the 2010 holiday season. Interest payments, cash taxes and CapEx were also somewhat higher. 
Looking at the final slide, which takes a look at our net debt. We ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in net debt, that's up about $650 million compared to the end of last year, and that's due to the increased pace of direct returns to shareholders. We returned, as I mentioned, over $1.2 billion during the quarter including $1 billion in share repurchases. So our total direct returns were up 60% over the first quarter a year ago.
During the quarter, we also spent about $160 million on M&A activity, and that related primarily to our acquisition of additional interest in HBO's operations in Latin America as well as increased ownership interest in CME. We saw this as a nice opportunity to further increase our exposure to businesses and regions where we see significant growth opportunities in the coming years. These acquisitions are consistent with our focus on international networks, which we expect to be one of the biggest growth drivers for the company over the next several years.
As a result of these actions, our leverage ratio is now almost 2.2x. That's up from around 2x at year end. That's consistent with our plans to move closer to our target leverage of about 2.5x by the year end this year in an effort to better optimize our capital structure. 
One last thing to note. Last month, we issued about $2 billion of public debt. We were able to access the markets at very attractive rates while further extending the average length of our debt maturities. As you know, we manage our capital structure with a goal of striking the right balance between maintaining a strong liquid balance sheet with solid credit ratings and actively deploying our capital to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and to return capital to our shareholders. So we're quite pleased with our progress that we made on our capital plan so far this year. And so with that being concluded, let me now turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A part of this session."

But then there's a loss cap calculation that's a little complicated. Let me begin by saying economically, we share revenues and costs equally with CBS, subject to the loss caps, and I'm going to come back to that in a minute. But as Jeff said, that means that we're going to share programming rights fees up to nearly $11 billion over the 14-year term, and that includes fees as well as production costs and ad revenues to be shared equally by Turner and CBS. CBS losses however, are limited to certain prespecified annual amounts and I think we've included those in our public filings. In the first quarter, we did trigger the loss cap, but the amount incurred under that cap was not significant at all. We think it's important to note that the loss cap is based on a cash cost, not a book cost. That's very important to understand, and the calculation is the same for us as it is for CBS. The cash cost increases very, very slowly over the 14-year life of the agreement. And going into the agreement, we fully expected that we were going to be losing money on a cash basis in the early years in the contract. But just to reiterate what Jeff said, we fully expect to make that up as we move into the agreement and we're highly confident only supported even more by the performance from this Tournament, that this is going to be incredibly accretive on an NPV basis in the fullness of time. And then the question is, why did we agree to cap CBS losses? Well put simply, we just feel like this is a terrific deal for us and capping CBS' losses made sense to us because we believe frankly we have more upside than them. We get more of the risk, and we'll get more of the reward as the nature of our relationship changes considerably over the life of the agreement. As Jeff said, it's going to be a significant factor in our future affiliate fee agreements, and even the number of games moves over time and we'll have 2/3 of the games by the end of the contract. So we're very, very confident in our ability to monetize it, and we feel really good on all fronts."

Much of that continued into Q1, and please appreciate that it really isn't possible to be exactly precise because the NCAA Tournament took up a lot of our prime time in the quarter. And so it displays the considerable amount of inventory that was programmed differently last year. And as a result of the NCAA, we programmed our networks very differently when you had was type of big, high-profile sporting event. For example, we had significantly fewer originals in the first quarter this year than we did a year ago. On TNT, for example, we had half the number of regionals. Last year, we had about 25. This year, we only had about 13. So it's not as simple as just pulling out the NCAA revenue. You have to make a number of estimates. But to just try to be transparent, we're estimating total revenue growth domestically and internationally if you normalize for the NCAA, would be in the high single digits in the quarter."

I think that the comments were taken a little bit out of context, and what the context was, was Charlie Rose and I talking in the Tribeca Film Festival was a question about, ""How do we think about M&A over time versus buybacks?"" And basically, what we were discussing was the fact that there seemed to be pretty widespread concerns about the sustainability of really all the media businesses, including the Time Warner ones and of growth over the long run. So what I was saying was sharing my confidence that given the industries that we operate in and the position we have, the strength of our assets, essentially the very stable and superior performance of all of our businesses in terms of earnings and revenues, did I think that we will continue to grow fairly steadily over the long run. And what I was saying was, if we're right over time and we have been so far, then we will outperform what seemed to be the consensus' expectations of not only our company but most of the media companies over the long run, and that's why we're buying back our stock. I certainly wasn't referring or focusing and certainly, Charlie wasn't asking about this quarter. He's not a financial analyst. In terms of the sports rights competition, it's a pretty important part of the offering at Turner. But we're focused on having the right sport, and I think John was just explaining the power of NCAA. But let's remember and add to that, that we're very happy with the performance of the NBA, national basketball, Major League Baseball as well as NCAA. And so we will continue to evaluate potential opportunities in the future. But the way we look at it, the TBS and TNT models are built on a pretty unique and fairly powerful balance of sports, original series and acquired series and some very powerful movies, and we think that's optimized mix to remain pretty attractive not just for viewers and advertisers but for distributors as well."

With the retrans support coming to broadcast networks, it makes them a little healthier and able to sustain economics. That's very helpful for not only Warner's, which is the lead supplier for this globally and in the United States. But it also helps our Cable Networks because given our unique position of reach with TBS and TNT, we're one of the biggest buyers and users of hit series programming. And so for us, the fact that the kind of economic support for making big series and making it available for syndication and then having the 2 of the leading broad-reach networks to program in syndication is a fairly virtual circle for us.

Well, clearly, it's a way to give consumers access to a deep library of content that they couldn't easily get before, particularly older shows although they're probably going to be able to get them more easily in other places now as time goes on. But it's been a useful thing to have subscription services for product that you couldn't get before. It's particularly also had -- I think there's been some utility for viewers in being able to get serialized shows that don't play as well on traditional Cable Networks or in syndication. So from that point of view, it can be good for consumers. And because SVOD monetizes some content that couldn't be monetized before and it monetizes some content better than it was monetized before, particularly the older library stuff. Then in that sense, you can add mind to the ecosystem, and that's good for everybody and performs a useful function. But what we've always said is that as you think of those positives, you need to make sure that SVOD doesn't devalue the content and disrupt the ecosystem. So basically, our view has been that it is not usually the right outlet for the newer higher value content that is functioning much more powerfully for viewers on other kinds of networks in other windows. We have said because of all that, we do not think that it would be a suitable substitute for multichannel TV for most consumers. And therefore, we don't think it'll upend the  multichannel TV business. We've been basically trying to emphasize that point, and so there's been I think a little understandable but somewhat overblown concern about cord cutting. But I'll leave that to further questions."

We watch it closely. I'm sure all of you do, but we haven't seen it yet. Let's look at SVOD generally and start with Netflix, which is certainly the leading entity there. I think Netflix has something around 23 milli",404,"Yes, okay. Well, thank you for asking. We watch it closely. I'm sure all of you do, but we haven't seen it yet. Let's look at SVOD generally and start with Netflix, which is certainly the leading entity there. I think Netflix has something around 23 million subs in the U.S. We believe there's only about 4 million households that have broadband and no multichannel TV, and that number is almost unchanged over the year since Netflix started its streaming or watch-instantly service. So even though people seem to like the Netflix service, evidenced by the number of subs, it hasn't led to very many Netflix subs cutting the core. And looking forward, it's hard to see how subscription VOD becomes a replacement for multichannel TV because as far as we can see, it probably won't economically be able to offer a lot of the current shows, sports, live events, first on of things of all kinds that are available on all of the high-value networks. And we don't think there's very many subscribers that are going to be willing to give those things up. And in general, we don't think U.S. consumers want less choice. The record of the last 30, 40 years has been they want more choice. And just to really acid test that, there are already a number of stripped-down TV packages that are available and very few consumers take them. Just take DISH Network has a focus on value. It's lowest priced packaged is $24.99. Most people don't take that, which is why the average revenue at DISH is closer to $70. And then you add the last part of the puzzle, which is -- and you can see it this week with HBO GO, TV Everywhere versions, VOD availability for all the networks everybody loves is going to make the current network subscriptions, foremost among them HBO, even more powerful and it fits right into the desire that as VOD services have shown is a pretty strong desire among consumers. So all this really suggests that things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't in terms of efficiency for all their product, wasn't as available as before. And they're likely to remain complementary to the strong multichannel brands that are getting stronger all the time and that are about to be more available on VOD."

I'll be then saying, ""Well, what about internet?"" So we don't need to do anything in that area, and we've been opportunistic. We are able to do whatever we would desire to do if it came down to an acquisition, and we don't need to do those if anything comes up in the competitive set. We can afford to pass it, let it go to a competitor and not weaken our competitive position. On the other hand, we, if we acquire something, it probably has more leverage to make it more synergistically a value creation than other buyers. So that's how we look at it. We haven't seen anything that has motivated us lately in those areas. If you go overseas, we have done some acquisitions, and we've done it for a scale to advantage both our strong position with global networks like HBO, which is #1 in every market it operates in; CNN and Cartoon channel (sic) [Cartoon Network], which are usually at the top of the global pack in whatever genre they're serving. And so where we've been mostly had some reasonably significant acquisitions in South America, which has led us to be the #1 network group in South America across all of Latin and Central America. We've done a significant thing in Eastern Europe with CME. We've made some moves in India, which haven't so far performed as well as we'd like. And that's basically what we've done so far."

So clearly, a portion of that growth is coming from syndication revenues and profits being recognized where we'll receive cash over time over the life of the agreement, whereas the accounting rules require that you recognize the revenue upon availability, which would be this year. So I think it's better to talk about the longer term, which is next 2, 3, 4, 5 years. We have said that conversion should go up again beginning next year. And I think if you look at just the free cash flow generation capability of our businesses, we don't see any difference looking back as to looking forward.

But actually, they do align with the other businesses. But let's start with the first one. If your question was, ""If it's good to release films earlier by, whenever, 8 or some weeks out, why not release them earlier still?"" It's not clear yet if the trade-offs for both viewers, people that buy tickets and go to movies, and the whole infrastructure of exhibition that needs to support that, really is valid one even at 8 weeks out. So we're going to have to see. We're doing a test to see what demand does it fulfill, to what extent does it under mark ticket sales, which we don't intend. But it does that. If it does that, it'll be something that we all have to rethink. As you move it closer, which I believe was your question, you simply exacerbate that, and it doesn't really seem at this point to be necessary. So it may not be necessary even to the extent that the test is pegged at 8 weeks out. So we'll see. It's a little early to say. What nobody wants to hear is really cannibalize the theatrical window. That's a legitimate concerns the exhibitors have, and it's a concern that we share with them. So that's so far the answer to that. On the HBO one, Rich, I've enjoyed and admired a lot of the stuff that you've been writing about. I mean I think everybody enjoys reading these thoughts because a lot of them are very forward thinking. I'd have to say in this case, it doesn't make any sense to us to consider spinning off HBO. I think you're right that if HBO is valued or thought to have the challenges that some have asked, they're not getting it as they saw in droves over the many years I've been associated with HBO. HBO's in a really strong position. You should watch what happens with GO this week and begin to appreciate that. And so if you say, ""Well, why should we have it?"" Well, we love having HBO. It's a strong performer. It aligns really well with the scale of our other networks. I don't suppose it's really appreciated out there, the extent to which we do benefit from the leverage of having the Turner Networks and HBO both here and overseas. So that's one thing. We like the business in itself. That's the second thing. We don't think it's going to be viewed more valuably separate than part of us. That'd be the third thing. We do have a very strong relationship with Warner as we have always had. It wouldn't be any better or worse if it were a separate company than it is together. In fact, we think there've been a lot of advantages running both ways at Warner and at HBO from being able to look at the world together because what happens in pay TV is that we look out about 10 years, and we always have the evidence of our VOD position, and the invention of VOD inside Time Warner proves that. It wouldn't have any effect on bidding for movies. And finally, it's not HBO's intent. It never has been to prevent consumers from accessing their legitimately purchased content. It's pretty clear that Warner's has been one of the leaders of making digital purchase more valuable and efficient for consumers. HBO has been a part of that and knows about it."

So we need to be careful focusing too much on the ratings, and I think maybe your question understood that because the ratings are an important indicator. But they're not the only indicator. And we always talk about programming for profits, which means we prioritize getting the right mix of programming as you asked and the one that's valued by consumers and advertisers and distribution partners, all mixing the right balance of revenues and costs. So the way to basically look at that it's not all ratings points are created equal. If you dissect the ratings, I'd say the trends this quarter are consistent with what we've seen for a while. I'll just start, and then John'll pick up with the facts. In sports, as you know, we had very strong sports programming. NCAA viewership was up 7% over last year, and it was the highest-rated Tournament since '05. The NBA's been very strong. That's in sports. In originals, they did well in the quarter. But given that we had more mix devoted, of air time to sports as you and someone else have asked, we have fewer originals in the quarter, and we'll have more of them in the next quarter. For acquired series, we have seen some weakness in some of our acquired series. It's been going on for a while. Some of that is because we've had a couple of aging acquired series that aren't performing as well as we expected like Bones, and some of it is because some of the shows we've had have been showing up on other services like SVOD, which we think has hurt them. And we think that what we've got to elevate the performance of acquired series is we've got Big Bang Theory coming to TBS, and we have The Mentalist coming to TNT. And we think that should have a significant impact, and we have some sports playoffs coming this spring and originals this summer, which in the short run should lift the ratings. But John, you have. . ."

And I think we've been pretty clear as to why that was, and that was all planned for. Coming into this year, what we said was if you set aside for a moment NCAA Tournament, all of the rest of our programming would be up in the high single digits, and we continue to believe -- I mean that is what's is going to happen. Remember, all of these costs are under our control and largely planned for well in advance. And so in the first quarter, we have the NCAA, which was a considerable percentage of the overall growth. In addition, we had some incremental investment in the higher profile programming that wasn't there a year ago including Conan. We did on the Cartoon Network the Hall of Game. We had some incremental investments in series like Southland. But if you look at all other programming costs growth beyond that, it was up in the midsingle digits. So I feel really good about our ability to control the cost growth and plan for it and do it with within the architecture of how to grow earnings over time, where we know where the subscription revenue growth is going to be, and we've got a pretty good guess as to what ad revenue is going to be. So hopefully, that's helpful."

We posted strong metrics this quarter including almost 20% revenue growth at our Networks segment. And while we knew coming in that we faced tough profit comparisons this quarter, our results came in right where we expected, putting us firmly on track to achieve our outlook for the full year. 
We're also making a lot of progress toward our longer-term strategic objectives. In particular, our efforts to allow consumers to buy our content once and then access it on whatever device they want, wherever and whenever they want, a set of initiatives that we call Content Everywhere, continue to gather momentum.
John will talk about our financial results in detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to highlight some of the key operational and strategic milestones that we have achieved over the past few months. And I'll start with Turner, where our investment in must-see sports is really paying off.
Of course, the big story this quarter was our NCAA coverage. It was a huge success commercially and creatively and a big boost for the TBS, TNT and truTV brands. Our collaboration with CBS worked even better than we'd anticipated in every way: ratings, financial performance, quality of the coverage and integration of our sales efforts. It was the most watched tournament since 2005, and traffic for March Madness On Demand was up over 60%. We also surpassed our expectations for ad sales, which powered Turner to over 30% ad revenue growth in the quarter.
Our investment in sports is also paying off with the NBA. The 2010-2011 regular season was the most watched in Turner's 27 years of airing the NBA, and it was up more than 40% over last year. That momentum has continued into the playoffs, making TNT the #1 network on basic cable in April and, on some nights, making TNT the #1 network on all of television.
CNN's performance this quarter was a testament to the critical role it plays in America and throughout the world. In the midst of the catastrophe in Japan and unrest in the Middle East, CNN’s prime time ratings were up more than 30% during the quarter while both of its cable news competitors saw declines. This shows that when news breaks, viewers seek out the breadth of coverage, the exceptional journalism and the trusted brand that only CNN offers. It also shows why CNN is always indispensable to its affiliates even if ratings sometimes fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
You're probably curious to get our view on the upcoming upfront. I won't be too specific. But with the current premiums in the scatter market, very low levels of cancellations and supply constraints at most of the broadcast networks, all the indicators are very positive. The combination of our strong brands, high-quality programming and talented sales force makes us confident that our pricing will again be near the top end of the industry range across broadcast and Cable.  At HBO, our investments in high-quality content are also paying off. Last month, we debuted Game of Thrones to tremendous critical acclaim, and the premier has already attracted 8 million viewers. When added to our roster of other tent-pole shows like True Blood and Boardwalk Empire, HBO now has the strongest slate of programming in its history. Just as this week, we also launched HBO GO on mobile devices including the iPad, iPhone and Android smartphones. Our iPad app is getting rave reviews from the consumers who are using it, and it was the most downloaded free iPad app in iTunes this weekend.
HBO GO is the first fully realized example of what TV Everywhere can be. And to those of you who've seen it, you know that it represents a quantum leap in the consumer value of subscribing to HBO. Besides all the benefits it provides to HBO and to HBO subscribers, we think it could also substantially increase consumer awareness of the TV Everywhere concept and accelerate momentum for the initiative across the industry.
Over the course of the year, we intend to steadily introduce new features including some that HBO can uniquely provide and expand availability to additional tablets and connected devices. HBO GO is now available through almost all of our major distributors, reaching about 80% of our subscriber base.
Time Warner Cable and Cablevision are the main exceptions. We're optimistic that these distributors will also realize the benefits of providing their highest revenue subscribers all this additional value at no extra cost.
Turning to our film and TV production businesses. Warner Bros. had a relatively light release late this quarter, but we're optimistic about the schedule for the rest of the year, which includes The Hangover Part I, Green Lantern, the eagerly anticipated finale of the Harry Potter franchise, Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2. 
We're also extremely well positioned at Warner Bros TV. As you know, we have a great syndication pipeline this year, most notably headlined by The Big Bang Theory. And although it's often overlooked, keep in mind that the strong advertising environment benefits Warner Bros. too. For many of our first on-and-off net syndicated shows, Warner makes up a big portion of our revenue. So while it's too early to talk about our pickups this year, we're feeling optimistic as we head into the broadcast upfronts in the next couple of weeks, both in terms of our powerful lineup of returning shows and in terms of new pilots.
With our strong film slate, the momentum in our TV business and several promising games, we continue to expect Warner will post record profits this year. 
I also want to talk for a moment about the important progress we've made toward our key home video digital initiatives over the last few months. As home video transactions continue to transition to digital, we have 2 main goals. First, we want to advantage our most profitable distribution channels; and second, we're working hard to make digital ownership more compelling for consumers. Toward these ends, we became the first studio to make it possible to rent movies through Facebook. And last week, we launched our test of premium VOD called Home Premier by offering the movie, Hall Pass through DirecTV. 
Similar to what we've done with other new windows, over the next few months, we'll expand the test to other titles and other distributors and then evaluate the impact. 
This week, we also agreed to acquire Flixster, a social network for movie fans. We'll use the Flixster brand and platform to launch several initiatives that aim to dramatically improve the consumer proposition of owning digital movies, and we'll do that in a studio-agnostic way that should benefit the whole industry. We will share more details in time. But in short order, we plan to expand the functionality of Flixster to allow consumers to organize and access their digital movie collections on whatever device they like as well as buy and rent movies.
Finally at Time Inc. During the quarter, we remain focused on outperforming the industry and maintaining the right cost structure. Like our other businesses, we also focused on giving consumers access to our content on more devices. We launched SI All Access, which enables Sports Illustrated readers to pay one price to get the print edition, as well as a digital edition and to have it accessible online or on Android tablets and smartphones. And we just reached agreement with Apple to enable our print subscribers to access the iPad versions of Time, Sports Illustrated and FORTUNE at no extra cost. 
Before I hand it off to John, one final note. As you probably noticed, this quarter, we bought back about $1 billion of our stock. That's double the quarterly pace of last year, and it represents about 2.5% of our equity base in just one quarter. This step reflects our commitment to continue to enhance stockholder returns and our confidence in the value of our stock, our competitive position and our growth prospects. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to John."
24689,129364150,122232,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks I'll be referring to a presentation that is now available on our website. So let me begin with the first slide, which shows the highlights for the quarter. Last quarter, I talked about our plans to be ev",2053,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks I'll be referring to a presentation that is now available on our website. 
So let me begin with the first slide, which shows the highlights for the quarter. Last quarter, I talked about our plans to be even more aggressive this year, pursuing our goals of investment, growth and returns, and I think we're off to a great start this year. 
Heading into the year, we knew as Jeff said, that the first quarter would be our most challenged from a profit growth perspective. This was due to the timing of programming investments, particularly in the NCAA Tournament and the timing of our film slate, which is heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. Nevertheless, we are very pleased with our strong revenue growth in the quarter, and that was helped by the great performance of the NCAA, which surpassed our expectations and was a major driver of advertising growth.
And while adjusted operating income was down year-over-year, it came in pretty much as we expected, and we firmly remain on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. And this morning, we reaffirmed our outlook for low-teens growth in adjusted EPS in 2011. We aim to do that while investing even more in our businesses and returning even more capital to our shareholders. 
During the quarter, as Jeff said, we repurchased about $1 billion of our shares, and we paid $260 million in dividends. That marks a significant acceleration from our previous pace of direct returns and underscores our confidence in the fundamentals of our businesses and their cash generation capabilities.
Moving over to the next slide, which shows consolidated first quarter financial highlights. Revenues were up 6% or more than $350 million year-over-year, and that was led by robust growth in both Subscription and Advertising revenues. Content revenues were down year-over-year, and that was due primarily to the tough comps at the studio. 
Overall operating expenses grew over 10%, causing adjusted operating income to decline by 10% year-over-year. This quarter, the programming production and marketing expenses were up a lot, and much of that was due to the costs of the NCAA Tournament. Over the remainder of the year, we expect that these expenses should grow in the mid-single digits. So margin trends should improve as the year progresses.
In general, we're continuing our efforts to fund investment in high-quality content and other revenue-generating areas by reallocating capital away from overhead. That was evident again this quarter. Beyond programming production and marketing as well as acquisitions, our expenses grew only in the low-single digits year-over-year. 
Continuing to move down the P&L. Adjusted EPS declined 5% in the quarter. That was a smaller decline as compared to adjusted operating income, and that's because of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Turning now to our segment highlights, and let's begin at the Networks division, where we had very strong revenue growth at both Turner and HBO. Advertising revenues were up 31%. This was driven largely by both the NCAA coverage on our networks and the generally strong domestic pricing environment. Our domestic entertainment networks, which includes kids and young adults, grew advertising over 30% in the quarter. Domestic news was up in the high single digits, and that was helped by the improved audience delivery at CNN.
International Advertising revenue grew over 50% in the quarter, and growth here was helped by some transactions we've done in the past year. And if you look through those, Advertising revenues were up single digits. 
Growth was much stronger than that in our European and Latin American entertainment businesses, which were both up strong double digits on an organic basis. But Asia and International News were negatively impacted by the events in the Middle East and Japan. And as a result of that, they were both down in the quarter.
So far in the second quarter, domestic scatter pricing remains robust, up 20% to 30% over the upfront, and cancellations remain low. We obviously won't get the same magnitude of lift in the second quarter from the NCAA Tournament. But we still expect very, very healthy year-over-year growth. And as Jeff mentioned, we feel extremely well positioned heading into the upfront.
Subscription revenue growth remained really terrific in the first quarter, up 9%. That reflects consistent strong growth trends domestically as well as continued expansion in growth internationally. Moving on, content revenues were up almost 50%, and that was led by the strong demand for HBO's original programming, including The Pacific, Sex and the City and Boardwalk Empire. 
Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter as the Networks grew. There were 2 reasons why year-over-year growth was so modest during the quarter. The first obviously is the NCAA Tournament, where we recognized the significant majority of the costs for the year during the first quarter when the tournament was aired. Most of the remaining costs will be recognized in the second quarter, and beyond that, non-NCAA-related programming expenses also grew at a higher rate in the first quarter as compared to what we expect for the full year, but that was really due just to timing. 
So before I move on here, let me just quickly pause and give you an update on HBO subscriber counts. We said coming into the year that we expected the U.S. subscriber count to stabilize this year, and I'm happy to report that that's exactly what we've seen so far this year. So we feel pretty good about that.
Let me turn now to film on the next slide. And as Jeff said this is a very light quarter for us. And again, we knew coming into the quarter that both revenue and adjusted operating income would be down significantly year-over-year. This was due to the tough comparisons in both theatrical and home video and a 2011 release slate that is more weighted towards later quarters. 
Last year's first quarter, for example, benefited from the strong theatrical performances of Sherlock Holmes and The Blind Side, and we just didn't have any comparable titles this year. The Blind Side was also particularly strong on home video for us. That comparison, along with significantly fewer releases was the largest factor in the 21% decline in home video revenue in the quarter. 
On a more positive note, the performance of our television product was very strong in the quarter, and we have really been pleased with the initial home video release sales of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, which was released last month. This underscores the continued strong demand in home entertainment for our event films.
Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate record film profits in 2011. Our release slate starts to pick up at the second quarter with the theatrical releases of The Hangover II and the Green Lantern. In addition to the Harry Potter home video release, we have a great games lineup with Mortal Kombat 9 and LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean. That momentum should continue as the year progresses with the actual releases like the final Harry Potter and Happy Feet 2 as well as the syndication sale of Big Bang Theory. So we feel very good about the year here.
Moving over to Publishing. Advertising revenues were essentially flat in the quarter, but the reported growth rate here was affected by the transfer of management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner and the divestiture of certain titles at IPC. Excluding these 2 items, overall Advertising revenues were up 4% in the quarter, and digital Advertising revenues were up double digits. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate underlying domestic advertising trends to remain positive. 
Turning over to subscription revenues for a moment, the majority of the decline in the first quarter was in our International business, which was impacted by the divestitures at IPC that I just mentioned.
Domestic subscription revenue was also somewhat lower, however, due partly to continued pressure at newsstands. But we are seeing subscription fundamentals begin to stabilize. And as the year progresses, we expect to see an improvement in year-over-year revenue trends, particularly in the second half of the year. That reflects both favorable trends in renewals as well as the ramp up of new retail partnerships.
Operating income at Time Inc. was up 26%, with margins up 160 basis points. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc. 
Total expenses here were down nearly $15 million over last year as we continue to remain focused on cost management. For the year, we continue to expect overall expenses at Publishing to be relatively flat as compared to 2010.
Moving to the next slide, which contains our 2011 outlook. Let me just pause for a second and talk about our expectations for the second quarter. As I mentioned before, coming into the year, we anticipated that the first quarter would be our most challenged from a profit growth rate perspective, and we absolutely expect profits to grow in the second quarter year-over-year. But keep in mind that we still expect to incur modest losses on the NCAA contract. And at our Film division, we expect P&A spending to be higher than the prior year, and we also expect to incur restructuring costs in the neighborhood of $25 million to $30 million.
So for Q2, we expect that year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income will clearly be considerably better than the first quarter but will lag what we will see in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year. Growth should accelerate significantly in the second half as we benefit from an improving film slate, a strong syndication lineup and lower programming expense growth at the networks.
Turning to the next slide, which looks at our free cash flow. We generated approximately $700 million of free cash in the quarter. That's a good start for the year but somewhat below the year ago levels. And the decline year-over-year was due mainly to the significant increase in working capital, and that was primarily attributable to the timing of TV-syndication receipts and lower home video sales during the 2010 holiday season. Interest payments, cash taxes and CapEx were also somewhat higher. 
Looking at the final slide, which takes a look at our net debt. We ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in net debt, that's up about $650 million compared to the end of last year, and that's due to the increased pace of direct returns to shareholders. We returned, as I mentioned, over $1.2 billion during the quarter including $1 billion in share repurchases. So our total direct returns were up 60% over the first quarter a year ago.
During the quarter, we also spent about $160 million on M&A activity, and that related primarily to our acquisition of additional interest in HBO's operations in Latin America as well as increased ownership interest in CME. We saw this as a nice opportunity to further increase our exposure to businesses and regions where we see significant growth opportunities in the coming years. These acquisitions are consistent with our focus on international networks, which we expect to be one of the biggest growth drivers for the company over the next several years.
As a result of these actions, our leverage ratio is now almost 2.2x. That's up from around 2x at year end. That's consistent with our plans to move closer to our target leverage of about 2.5x by the year end this year in an effort to better optimize our capital structure. 
One last thing to note. Last month, we issued about $2 billion of public debt. We were able to access the markets at very attractive rates while further extending the average length of our debt maturities. As you know, we manage our capital structure with a goal of striking the right balance between maintaining a strong liquid balance sheet with solid credit ratings and actively deploying our capital to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and to return capital to our shareholders. So we're quite pleased with our progress that we made on our capital plan so far this year. And so with that being concluded, let me now turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A part of this session."

But then there's a loss cap calculation that's a little complicated. Let me begin by saying economically, we share revenues and costs equally with CBS, subject to the loss caps, and I'm going to come back to that in a minute. But as Jeff said, that means that we're going to share programming rights fees up to nearly $11 billion over the 14-year term, and that includes fees as well as production costs and ad revenues to be shared equally by Turner and CBS. CBS losses however, are limited to certain pre-specified annual amounts and I think we've included those in our public filings. In the first quarter, we did trigger the loss cap, but the amount incurred under that cap was not significant at all. We think it's important to note that the loss cap is based on a cash cost, not a book cost. That's very important to understand, and the calculation is the same for us as it is for CBS. The cash cost increases very, very slowly over the 14-year life of the agreement. And going into the agreement, we fully expected that we were going to be losing money on a cash basis in the early years in the contract. But just to reiterate what Jeff said, we fully expect to make that up as we move into the agreement and we're highly confident only supported even more by the performance from this Tournament, that this is going to be incredibly accretive on an NPV basis in the fullness of time. And then the question is, “Why did we agree to cap CBS losses?” Well put simply, we just feel like this is a terrific deal for us and capping CBS' losses made sense to us because we believe frankly we have more upside than them. We get more of the risk, and we'll get more of the reward as the nature of our relationship changes considerably over the life of the agreement. As Jeff said, it's going to be a significant factor in our future affiliate fee agreements, and even the number of games moves over time and we'll have 2/3 of the games by the end of the contract. So we're very, very confident in our ability to monetize it, and we feel really good on all fronts."

Much of that continued into Q1. And please appreciate that it really isn't possible to be exactly precise because the NCAA Tournament took up a lot of our prime time in the quarter. And so it displaced the considerable amount of inventory that was programmed differently last year. And as a result of the NCAA, we programmed our networks very differently when you had was type of big, high-profile sporting event. For example, we had significantly fewer originals in the first quarter this year than we did a year ago. On TNT, for example, we had half the number of originals. Last year, we had about 25. This year, we only had about 13. So it's not as simple as just pulling out the NCAA revenue. You have to make a number of estimates. But to just try to be transparent, we're estimating total revenue growth domestically and internationally if you normalize for the NCAA, would be in the high single digits in the quarter."

I think that the comments were taken a little bit out of context, and what the context was, was Charlie Rose and I talking in the Tribeca Film Festival was a question about, ""How do we think about M&A over time versus buybacks?"" And basically, what we were discussing was the fact that there seemed to be pretty widespread concerns about the sustainability of really all the media businesses, including the Time Warner ones and of growth over the long run. So what I was saying was sharing my confidence that given the industries that we operate in and the position we have, the strength of our assets, essentially the very stable and superior performance of all of our businesses in terms of earnings and revenues, did I think that we will continue to grow fairly steadily over the long run. And what I was saying was, if we're right over time and we have been so far, then we will outperform what seemed to be the consensus expectations of not only our company, but most of the media companies over the long run, and that's why we're buying back our stock. I certainly wasn't referring or focusing and certainly, Charlie wasn't asking about this quarter. He's not a financial analyst. In terms of the sports-rights competition, it's a pretty important part of the offering at Turner. But we're focused on having the right sport, and I think John was just explaining the power of NCAA. But let's remember and add to that, that we're very happy with the performance of the NBA, National Basketball, Major League Baseball as well as NCAA. And so we will continue to evaluate potential opportunities in the future. But the way we look at it, the TBS and TNT models are built on a pretty unique and fairly powerful balance of sports, original series and acquired series and some very powerful movies, and we think that's optimized mix to remain pretty attractive not just for viewers and advertisers but for distributors as well."

And like for us, we're actually in an ever stronger position, giving the pipeline that we provide to the big 4 American broadcast networks and increasingly all the cable networks. So there's a lot going on there with some of the reality shows going on, broadcast network TV. It makes scripted shows, I think, more valuable. With the retrans support coming to broadcast networks, it makes them a little healthier and able to sustain economics. That's very helpful for not only Warner's, which is the lead supplier for this globally and in the United States. But it also helps our Cable Networks because given our unique position of reach with TBS and TNT, we're one of the biggest buyers and users of hit-series programming. And so for us, the fact that the kind of economic support for making big series and making it available for syndication and then having the 2 of the leading broad-reach networks to program in syndication is a fairly virtuous circle for us. And the international demand, which is increasing for the same product, simply helps us. So overall, it's a fairly strong situation. And I think that everybody ought to rethink, on the positive side, the strength and value of acquired series on syndicated networks."

Let's start by saying that HBO is a subscription VOD service. So is Netflix, and our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point. So let me try to be clear. We think there's definitely a role for subscription VOD services, library services and Netflix in the ecosystem. And what is the role? Well, clearly, it's a way to give consumers access to a deep library of content that they couldn't easily get before, particularly older shows, although they're probably going to be able to get them more easily in other places now as time goes on. But it's been a useful thing to have subscription services for product that you couldn't get before. It's particularly also had -- I think there's been some utility for viewers in being able to get serialized shows that don't play as well on traditional cable networks or in syndication. So from that point of view, it can be good for consumers. And because SVOD monetizes some content that couldn't be monetized before and it monetizes some content better than it was monetized before, particularly the older library stuff. Then in that sense, you can add money to the ecosystem, and that's good for everybody and performs a useful function. But what we've always said is that as you think of those positives, you need to make sure that SVOD doesn't devalue the content and disrupt the ecosystem. So basically, our view has been that it is not usually the right outlet for the newer higher value content that is functioning much more powerfully for viewers on other kinds of networks in other windows. We have said because of all that, we do not think that it would be a suitable substitute for multichannel TV for most consumers. And therefore, we don't think it'll upend the  multichannel TV business. We've been basically trying to emphasize that point, and so there's been I think a little understandable but somewhat overblown concern about cord cutting. But I'll leave that to further questions."

We watch it closely. I'm sure all of you do, but we haven't seen it yet. Let's look at SVOD generally and start with Netflix, which is certainly the leading entity there.

Let's look at SVOD generally and start with Netflix, which is certainly the leading entity there. I think Netflix has something around 23 million subs in the U.S. We believe there's only about 4 million households that have broadband and no multichannel TV, and that number is almost unchanged over the year since Netflix started its streaming or watch-instantly service. So even though people seem to like the Netflix service, evidenced by the number of subs, it hasn't led to very many Netflix subs cutting the cord. And looking forward, it's hard to see how subscription VOD becomes a replacement for multichannel TV because as far as we can see, it probably won't economically be able to offer a lot of the current shows, sports, live events, first on of things of all kinds that are available on all of the high-value networks. And we don't think there's very many subscribers that are going to be willing to give those things up. And in general, we don't think U.S. consumers want less choice. The record of the last 30, 40 years has been they want more choice. And just to really acid test that, there are already a number of stripped-down TV packages that are available and very few consumers take them. Just take DISH Network has a focus on value. It's lowest priced packaged is $24.99. Most people don't take that, which is why the average revenue at DISH is closer to $70. And then add the last part of the puzzle, which is -- and you can see it this week with HBO GO, TV Everywhere versions, VOD availability for all the networks everybody loves is going to make the current network subscriptions, foremost among them HBO, even more powerful and it fits right into the desire that as SVOD services have shown is a pretty strong desire among consumers. So all this really suggests that things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't in terms of efficiency for all their product, wasn't as available as before. And they're likely to remain complementary to the strong multichannel brands that are getting stronger all the time and that are about to be more available on VOD."

There's a number of reasons why. I think cash tax is being up is one big reason why. The second big reason, if you look at -- and we've said that we expect a record operating profit performance at Warner Bros. this year. So clearly, a portion of that growth is coming from syndication revenues and profits being recognized where we'll receive cash over time over the life of the agreement, whereas the accounting rules require that you recognize the revenue upon availability, which would be this year. So I think it's better to talk about the longer term, which is next 2, 3, 4, 5 years. We have said that conversion should go up again beginning next year. And I think if you look at just the free cash flow generation capability of our businesses, we don't see any difference looking back as to looking forward. In other words, we don't anticipate that the capital intensity is going to change very much. We don't anticipate that our conversions will be the depressed on any long-term sustainable basis.

But actually, they do align with the other businesses. But let's start with the first one. If your question was, ""If it's good to release films earlier by, whenever, 8 or some weeks out, why not release them earlier still?"" It's not clear yet if the trade-offs for both viewers, people that buy tickets and go to movies, and the whole infrastructure of exhibition that needs to support that, really is a valid one even at 8 weeks out. So we're going to have to see. We're doing a test to see what demand does it fulfill, to what extent does it under mark ticket sales, which we don't intend. But it does that. If it does that, it'll be something that we all have to rethink. As you move it closer, which I believe was your question, you simply exacerbate that, and it doesn't really seem at this point to be necessary. So it may not be necessary even to the extent that the test is pegged at 8 weeks out. So we'll see. It's a little early to say. What nobody wants to do is really cannibalize the theatrical window. That's a legitimate concerns the exhibitors have, and it's a concern that we share with them. So that's so far the answer to that. On the HBO one, thanks Rich. I've enjoyed and admired a lot of the stuff that you've been writing about. I mean I think everybody enjoys reading these thoughts because a lot of them are very forward thinking. I'd have to say in this case, it doesn't make any sense to us to consider spinning off HBO. I think you're right that if HBO is valued or thought to have the challenges that some have asked, they're not getting it as they saw in droves over the many years I've been associated with HBO. HBO's in a really strong position. You should watch what happens with GO this week and begin to appreciate that. And so if you say, ""Well, why should we have it?"" Well, we love having HBO. It's a strong performer. It aligns really well with the scale of our other networks. I don't suppose it's really appreciated out there, the extent to which we do benefit from the leverage of having the Turner Networks and HBO both here and overseas. So that's one thing. We like the business in itself. That's the second thing. We don't think it's going to be viewed more valuably separate than part of us. That'd be the third thing. We do have a very strong relationship with Warner as we have always had. It wouldn't be any better or worse if it were a separate company than it is together. In fact, we think there've been a lot of advantages running both ways at Warner and at HBO from being able to look at the world together because what happens in pay TV is that we look out about 10 years, and we always have the evidence of our VOD position, and the invention of VOD inside Time Warner proves that. It wouldn't have any effect on bidding for movies. And finally, it's not HBO's intent. It never has been to prevent consumers from accessing their legitimately purchased content. It's pretty clear that Warner's has been one of the leaders of making digital purchase more valuable and efficient for consumers. HBO has been a part of that and knows about it."

So we need to be careful focusing too much on the ratings, and I think maybe your question understood that because the ratings are an important indicator. But they're not the only indicator. And we always talk about programming for profits, which means we prioritize getting the right mix of programming as you asked and the one that's valued by consumers and advertisers and distribution partners, all mixing the right balance of revenues and costs. So the way to basically look at that it's not all ratings points are created equal. If you dissect the ratings, I'd say the trends this quarter are consistent with what we've seen for a while. I'll just start, and then John'll pick up with the facts. In sports, as you know, we had very strong sports programming. NCAA viewership was up 7% over last year, and it was the highest-rated Tournament since '05. The NBA's been very strong. That's in sports. In originals, they did well in the quarter. But given that we had more mix devoted, of air time to sports as you and someone else have asked, we have fewer originals in the quarter, and we'll have more of them in the next quarter. For acquired series, we have seen some weakness in some of our acquired series. It's been going on for a while. Some of that is because we've had a couple of aging acquired series that aren't performing as well as we expected like Bones. And some of it is because some of the shows we've had have been showing up on other services like SVOD, which we think has hurt them. And we think that what we've got to elevate the performance of acquired series is we've got Big Bang Theory coming to TBS, and we have The Mentalist coming to TNT. And we think that should add a significant impact, and we have some sports playoffs coming this spring and originals this summer, which in the short run should lift the ratings. But John, you have. . ."

But I mean clearly, our programming expense growth in the first quarter is going to be highest year-over-year growth percentage of the year. And I think we've been pretty clear as to why that was, and that was all planned for. Coming into this year, what we said was if you set aside for a moment NCAA Tournament, all of the rest of our programming would be up in the high single digits, and we continue to believe -- I mean that is what's is going to happen. Remember, all of these costs are under our control and largely planned for well in advance. And so in the first quarter, we have the NCAA, which was a considerable percentage of the overall growth. In addition, we had some incremental investment in the higher profile programming that wasn't there a year ago including Conan. We did on the Cartoon Network the Hall of Game. We had some incremental investments in series like Southland. But if you look at all other programming costs growth beyond that, it was up in the mid-single digits. So I feel really good about our ability to control the cost growth and plan for it and do it with within the architecture of how to grow earnings over time, where we know where what subscription revenue growth is going to be, and we've got a pretty good guess as to what ad revenue is going to be. So hopefully, that's helpful."

Overall, the second quarter was another pretty successful quarter for us. We posted our highest revenue growth in 4 years, up 10%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 20%, and we continue to buy back our stock at a faster pace than last year, acquiring another $1 billion worth to almost 3% of our equity base since we last reported earnings to you. And as you saw in our outlook released this morning, we remain fully on track to meet, if not exceed, our guidance for the full year. More important, this quarter we had significant progress toward our key strategic objectives. We continue to invest aggressively to make sure that our businesses each remain at the top of their competitive sets. At the same time, we continue to advance the new digital business models that will enable us to thrive as technology and consumption patterns evolve. 
Here's my perspective on some of the key highlights from the quarter starting in our Networks. As you know, the upfront market was very strong, particularly for TV. This year, the national cable network reportedly hold in higher dollar revenues in broadcast for the first time ever. Turner performed even better than its peers. Our large-reach entertainment networks, TNT and TBS, both saw a solid double-digit DPM increases putting them at the high end of all of TV, broadcast or Cable. It marks the third time in the last 4 years that our CPM increase has outstripped the average of the broadcast networks providing more evidence that we are narrowing the CPM gap in broadcast. 
The strength extends beyond TNT and TBS. Both truTV and Adult Swim saw pricing and volume increases substantially higher than the average for Cable Networks. And our news networks also performed extremely well, with CNN outpacing its cable news competitors for both CPM and volume growth. This performance across the entire portfolio is a broad endorsement by advertisers. It underscores the incredible reach of our Networks, the #1 and #2 reach Networks on Cable, TNT and TBS, the highest reach Cable news Networks, CNN and the growing reach of Adult Swim and truTV. And that reflects the appeal of our brands and programming and the skill of our sales force in creating compelling marketing partnerships. 
Beyond our performance in the upfront, I'll spend a moment updating you on recent ratings trends. TNT had its best quarter ever in primetime with our sports programming leading the way. We posted fantastic results from our coverage of the NBA playoffs on TNT, the best in Cable history and up more than 25% over last year. We also saw a strong performances from our originals on TNT, our new share of Falling Skies debuted as the #1 new series launch of the year and by the way, it's also been posting great numbers on our international networks. 
Last month, we brought back the Closer and also Rizzoli & Isles, which are delivering the biggest audiences of any dramas on Cable so far this year. So that's great, but we aren't satisfied with the recent ratings on some of our acquired content on TV and in TNT. That's something we're very focused on and plan to fix. Some of this recent performance is a reflection of the natural life cycle of acquired shows. It's going to decline over time. But we're confident that our plan to add some of the biggest hits on TV will boost viewership with shows like The Big Bang Theory, which is the #1 comedy on TV, and it will debut on CBS at the end of the third quarter. And The Mentalist, the #3 drama on TV, which will start showing on TNT next year. We also recently struck deals to bring Castle and Hawaii Five-0 to TNT. Keep in mind that even one successful show can have a significant impact for these Networks, and we think we have several in the pipeline. As a result, we expect these moves will improve ratings starting with TBS in the fourth quarter. 
Looking across channel portfolio, we had solid ratings performance from our other Networks during the quarter. TruTV posted its best second quarter primetime ratings ever, solidifying its position as a top-tier Cable network. Cartoon Networks posted double-digit gains in primetime in its demo and Adult Swim maintained its dominant position in late-night TV. And notably, CNN was up over 20% in its key demo again, outperforming its Cable news competitors. It's further evidence that when news breaks, more people turn to CNN than anywhere else. We're looking to capitalize on that momentum as we roll out our advanced primetime lineup next week. 
Let's shift to HBO where our programming lineup is stronger than ever and getting stronger. Even during the heyday of the Sopranos and Sex and the City, we never had the volume of top quality original programming that we have today on HBO. In June, we concluded the first season of Game of Thrones, which viewership steadily over the course of its run to end with over 9 million total viewers per episode. And we debuted the fourth season of True Blood to its highest premiere ratings ever. In fact, 5 of the top 7 most highly watched series in HBO's history are currently on the network: True Blood, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Entourage and Hung. 
Last month, HBO received the most Emmy nominations of any TV network for the 11th year in a row. Both Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones are nominated for outstanding drama series, the first time in decades that 2 freshmen shows from the same network are nominated. And with the richest developing slate in our history, we think the momentum will keep building. Next year, we'll debut Luck, a series from Michael Mann and David, starring Dustin Hoffman centered around the world of horse racing and another new series more as this story develops. And this show premier, what goes behind the scenes at a Cable News Network. You noticed some of the stories. At both Turner and HBO, our TV Everywhere initiatives are gaining momentum. As you know, in May, we launched HBO GO on ILX and Android mobile devices. It's still early, but it's been an even bigger hit than we expected. 
Mobile application has already been downloaded 40 million times. Our research shows that 85% of those users are watching much more HBO than they did before, and the satisfaction level of those users are through the roof. Over the rest of the year, we will widen the availability of HBO GO to include connected TV, game consoles and other connected devices, and we'll keep rolling out internationally. GO is now available throughout Central Europe, we'll launch Brazil and Mexico towards the end of the year and we'll start to launch in Asia next year. In addition, TV Everywhere versions of Turner's Networks are available to about 7 million households in the United States. Last month, we launched authenticated live streaming of CNN and headline news, online and through IOS apps that have already been downloaded more than 10 million times. We'll be launching apps for other Networks in the coming months and is now capturing TV Everywhere users in its C3 data, making us agnostic to whether viewers watch our shows on TVS, PCs or mobile devices. 
Turning to Warner Bros. Our film results were mixed this quarter, but the team at Warner has a great track record of making sure the hits outweigh the misses. While the performance of Green Lantern feel, shorter of our expectations, The Hangover Part II substantially exceeded them with global box office over $0.5 billion so far, making it the highest grossing R-rated comedy ever. And of course, after the end of the quarter, we shattered records with the opening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The records include the highest opening weekend ever, both domestically and internationally. Since its release, the film has already pulled in more than $1 billion globally, putting it on track to be the highest grossing film of the Harry Potter franchise. 
Looking out to the remainder of the year, we are very optimistic about 2 fourth quarter releases: Sherlock Holmes The Game of Shadows and Happy Feet 2. And we expect to have a strong slate again in 2012. Movies include The Dark Knight Rises and part 1 of The Hobbit, among many others. 
Warner Bros. TV production also had a great quarter. At this year's upfront, Warner placed 27 series on the broadcast schedule, including 16 returning shows and 11 new shows. That places Warner as the #1 producer of TV programming yet again this year. As another measure of our success and growth prospects, consider that our TV backlog costs $5 billion this quarter to reach its highest level ever. 
I'd also like to update you briefly on the progress Warner Bros. is make in accelerating the digital transition in home video. As we've discussed with you before, we're working hard to make digital ownership of movies more compelling for consumers. As part of that effort, we've been a proponent of the ultraviolet initiative to enable consumers to purchase movies and TV shows and then access them on the cloud on a wide range of devices. Beginning with the release of the and Green Lantern in the fourth quarter, the vast majority of our future home video new releases will be UV-enabled. A key part of our plan to drive use of ultraviolet is Flixster, which we purchased in May. Today, Flixster is one of the most popular applications for finding information about movies. And over the coming months, we'll begin to roll out new upgraded versions of the Flixster service, which will be deeply integrated with ultraviolet. It will enable consumers to establish ultraviolet to managing their digital collection whether store it locally or in the cloud to discover new contact and to share recommendations with friends. We'll start launching the first beta version this week. We believe this could fundamentally change how people manage and watch their movie collections, and it could significantly improve the value proposition of digital ownership. 
Moving on to Time Inc. During the quarter, we remained focused on outperforming the industry and maintaining the right cost structure while positioning ourselves to take advantage of new digital opportunities. This quarter, we reached agreement with Apple to enable print subscribers to People, Sports Illustrated, Time and Fortune to access the tablet editions on their iPads at no extra charge. In addition, we've struck agreements to sell single copies digital subscriptions and bundled print and digital subscriptions of selected titles with every other major tablet manufacturer, including Motorola, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, BlackBerry, Amazon and Barnes & Nobles, Nook, among others. 
As you may have seen, this morning, we announced plans to offer editions of all 21 of our domestic magazine titles on every major tablet platform by the end of this year. Similar to what we're doing in our other businesses, it's another example of the aggressive step we are taking to accelerate the digital transition and help define these new business models. 
In sum, we've accomplished a lot this quarter. Heading into the second half of the year, we're right on track to achieve our financial objectives. At the same time, as evidenced by our stock buyback this quarter, we remain committed to providing an attractive return to shareholders. But most important, we continue to make progress on the strategic objectives that we think will position us to prosper long term. 
With that, I'll hand it off to John."

We're focused on investing for long-term gro",1994,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is available on our website. Before I review our quarterly results, let me remind you first of our financial priorities. We're focused on investing for long-term growth, delivering attractive near-term results and continuing to provide significant direct returns to shareholders. Of course, any given quarter can be affected by the timing of investments, and you see all that at work in the results this quarter. We had very strong revenue and adjusted EPS growth, while our margins were somewhat impacted by planned investments. We grew revenues 10%, and that's the highest growth rate since the third quarter of 2007, and that was a result of strength across all revenue categories. 
Content revenue was particularly robust increasing 15% in the quarter, while both Subscription and Advertising growth were also strong. So that's good. Adjusted operating income was up 6% year-over-year, and that somewhat trailed the revenue growth, and that's because of strategic investments such as the NCAA basketball tournament and HBO GO, as well as the timing of our film slate. These investments both sets us up for accelerated earnings growth in the second half of this year and further strengthen our long-term growth prospects. 
Moving down the P&L. Adjusted EPS a very strong 20%, and that was helped by our ongoing share repurchase program. During the first half of the year, we repurchased $2 billion of shares, and that's twice as fast as our pace last year. And this morning, we updated our outlook to at least low teens growth in adjusted EPS, and that's for this year in 2011. And that reflects our year-to-date performance, plus our confidence in the remainder of the year. So we're very much on track to achieve all financial objectives for the year. 
So let me move on now and discuss our segments, and I'll begin with our Networks where we had another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Advertising revenues were up 11%. Our domestic entertainment Networks, which includes kids and young adults, grew Advertising double digits in the quarter. Now that includes ad revenues from the NCAA contract and some small transactions. And if you were to exclude those, growth would have been in the mid-single digits. Domestic news was flat, and that's a result of very good comparisons. You may recall that domestic news Advertising grew double digits in the second quarter last year while every other quarter during the year, it was actually down. 
International Advertising revenues grew approximately 35% in the quarter, and that was boosted by a couple of transactions and some favorable foreign exchange rates. And if you were to look through those, international Advertising revenues were up in the single digits. So you may ask why is that, why isn't it higher, and it's really 2 stories to tell here. First, we continue to perform very well in our European and Latin American entertainment Networks, both of which were up double digits in the quarter. But due to events in Japan and the Middle East, international news were down in the quarter, so that was a drag on the overall growth rate. 
In terms of the third quarter Advertising environment, the scatter market slowed a bit during the upfront, but now has largely come back in recent weeks. Domestic scatter pricing is now up in the mid-teens over the upfront. And looking ahead, we expect total ad growth in the third quarter to remain somewhat similar to what it was in the second quarter. And we should begin to benefit from the strong 2011, 2012 upfront in the fourth quarter. That should allow us to maintain very attractive Advertising growth rates even as we lap the acquisition of Chilevisión that occurred late last year. 
Moving to Subscription revenues where we saw another quarter of high single-digit growth. That reflects higher rates domestically and continued international growth. Content revenues were also higher in the quarter, up almost 20%. And that was driven by strong sales of HBO's original programming, including the season 3 home video release of True Blood and the licensing of Game of Thrones outside the U.S. 
Adjusted operating income here was up 5% in the quarter, and this was an improvement over the first quarter growth, but clearly, below our long-term expectations. And that's largely a result of the investments in the NCAA and HBO GO that I previously mentioned. Together, these investments reduced growth in Time Warner's adjusted operating income this quarter by 400 to 500 basis points. 
Turning now to film. Warner Bros. revenues were up a solid 13% in the quarter. On the home entertainment front, we saw significant increases in both video game and home video revenues. Our games business benefited from the releases of Mortal Kombat 9 and LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game. And Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, which is the #1 selling home video release year-to-date, drove home video revenues up 22% in the quarter. 
Despite this higher revenue, adjusted operating income was down modestly in the quarter, and that was because of higher prerelease E&A spending on third quarter releases, much of that tied to the Harry Potter film, as well as higher theatrical film valuation adjustments and increased overhead costs. And the increase in overhead was in part due to recent acquisitions and new business initiatives. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the second half of the year to be very, very strong. We are off to a great start with record-breaking performance of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 and the third quarter will also benefit from the syndication sales of the Big Bang Theory. And we're looking forward to our fourth quarter releases such as Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2, as Jeff just mentioned, as well as our strong home video and games lined up for the holiday season. So we remain confident, and we've said this before that 2011 will be a record year for Warner Bros.
On the Publishing where all 4 revenue buckets were actually up year-over-year in the quarter. Advertising revenues were up slightly. And if you will recall, we transferred management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner last year. So as a result, Time Inc. no longer books the Advertising revenue generated by these sites. We all saw that certain with IPC last year. So if you were to exclude those 2 items for comparability purposes, total Advertising revenues were up 4% and digital Advertising revenues were up in the low teens. 
Moving to subscriptions, which were up for the first time since last year's second quarter. That's subscription revenues. That was largely a result of an uptick in domestic revenues and favorable foreign exchange rates. And it was partially offset by the sale of titles at IPC. Operating income at Time Inc. was up 10% with margins up 120 basis points. The seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc. Total expenses were up modestly, and the biggest driver there was higher paper costs. 
Looking through third quarter, we are seeing some softness in both Advertising and newsstand sales. Adjusted operating income should also be negatively impacted by some continued expense growth, including higher paper prices. So if you were to take all of this into account, adjusted operating income should be down somewhat in the third quarter. However, we expect this segment to return to growth again in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the next slide, which looks at our full year outlook. As I noted a little earlier, we feel even more confident that we'll achieve our financial objectives this year. And this morning as an update to our outlook to grow at least low teens in adjusted EPS in 2011. In terms of the quarterly progression, the year is coming in more or less how we planned. The first quarter was our most challenging one from a profit growth perspective due to difficult film comparisons and significant investments we made in the NCAA basketball tournament. In the second quarter, we returned to profit growth and adjusted EPS growth. 
Now let me quickly highlight some things to be mindful of in each of Q3 and Q4 this year. So beginning in the third quarter, we expect accelerating year-over-year growth for both profit and adjusted EPS. That's largely a result of the strong theatrical and Syndication lineup at Warner Bros. In fact, growth would be even higher if not for the timing of programming and marketing spending in the third quarter at the Networks. We plan to increase programming spending in the mid-teens and to increase marketing spending, which should weigh on the Networks segment profits in Q3. Some of this is related to the airing of additional sports programs. Also recall that in last year's third quarter, we booked a $58 million reversal of a litigation reserve, which creates another headwind for growth in the quarter. But as we look beyond Q3 and as we look ahead into the fourth quarter, we expect another quarter of very, very strong profit growth. 
Warner Bros. should post a big quarter due to the home video and games release slate. But we anticipate strong growth for the Networks, very strong growth, in fact. Again, that's mostly a function of timing. In particular, growth in programming and marketing will be much more modest in Q4 as compared to the third quarter. But we will also benefit from this year's very strong upfront and our expectations for improved programming. So we fully anticipate a very strong second half for this year. 
Let me continue on, move to the next slide, which just quickly highlights our Free Cash Flow. Year-to-date for the second quarter, we generated $555 million of free cash. The big year-over-year decline is mainly due to an increase in working capital. For the first half, that was primarily attributable to increased production spending of both Warner Bros. and HBO. We said at the beginning of the year that this would be a down year in Free Cash Flow due to the timing of our investment spending in programming and production, as well as higher cash taxes. You saw that decline in the first half, but we expect Free Cash Flow generation to begin to improve starting in the second half now. And we fully expect to see both our Free Cash Flow and our rate of conversion increase in 2012. 
Looking at the last slide, which is on Net Debt position, we ended the quarter with $15 billion in Net Debt. That's up about $2.1 billion compared to the end of last year. We returned approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders during the first 6 months of the year, and that includes about $2 billion of share repurchases. That's double the pace of our share repurchases that we did last year. Year-to-date, we've also spent a little less than $300 million in M&A activity in the second quarter. The only significant acquisition we made was Flixster. And as Jeff described, we expect Flixster to play an important role than our efforts to accelerate the digital transition for our home video business. 
Our debt leverage ratio is now 2.4x, and that's up from around 2x at the end of 2010. That's consistent with our plan to move closer to our target leverage of 2.5x in an effort to better optimize our capital structure. As you know, we manage our capital structure with the goal of finding the right balance between maintaining a strong balance sheet and actively deploying our capital to invest in our businesses to make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. So with half the year completed, we feel very comfortable with the progress we've made and the path we're on. 
So thank you for listening. And now let me turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A portion."

We're always interested in having several competitors and healthy ones, digital ones, bidding for the value of our product. And so we can make structures for that, that accommodates the different positions that digital distributors are in as they try to build their businesses. The value of these things going up, what we've seen basically as you look at particularly Subscription VOD, which Amazon's interested in, Netflix is very successful in that area as is HBO. We think that there's a great place for subscription VOD. HBO already occupied a pretty good place in that area. But take Netflix, it provides another way for us to monetize our content, which is good. And it gives access to deep library of product that consumers couldn't easily get before, particularly the older shows. And so it may be filling a really functional thing for consumers so that particularly also in the case of serial live shows, which we don't play as well on traditional Cable Nets or Syndication. That can be a good place for subscription VOD services to operate. I mean, obviously, results in more monetization for the content than we were all getting previously. We don't think though that if you're flicking at Subscription VOD in most cases, if you think of all the big series or movie product that's out there in the relatively early windows, that's probably not the right outlet for the newer, higher-value content because it has so much money behind it as you take it through the year of its window.

That's a good question. In the case of HBO, the ratings are not as important although we've seen viewership go up with OnDemand, whether it was OnDemand on television for HBO, which had been going on 5, 10 years or now OnDemand on Internet for HBO, which is GO. When you put something OnDemand including this year's Game of Thrones or Sopranos from years ago, a lot more people watch it. So if you then that's the premium and pay TV side. HBO has a fairly deep library of all of that stuff, both current and older hit shows. If you go to -- when you ask ratings I think Advertising when you go to a ad supported Networks like TNT, TBS, we have a mix of new originals, acquired series, acquired movies. In the case of all the acquired stuff, they're all hit. In the case of original stuff on TNT, mostly those have been fortunately hits, including some of the new ones that we put out. If you then go to that and you say, all right, what happens as people have more ability to pick programming OnDemand, which has been -- that's given rise to a theory everybody has that been scheduled viewing ""collision viewing,"" which I think is an inaccurate term, will go down as people have more choice. Well, what everyone's forgetting is that when you put the hit programming, including the acquired hits on big Cable Networks like TNT, USA, TBS, when you put those OnDemand, you get the same lift that makes those popular programs more successful. So you have 2 effects going on. One is more choice, so a viewer can move away from a scheduled rerun. The other is more choice, so a viewer can watch the favorite hit show that is available now in rerun. On TV Everywhere, you'll have a habit that develops among all consumers across all Networks that lets you watch a lot of current episodes of your favorite show. And what's developing right behind that is last season, you've got some of that on Hulu Plus where you can see full seasons, last year's season. So what you have is basically newer forms of what everybody used to think of as Syndication that is now being available OnDemand. And if you have hit programming, you make it available, you get more viewing."

But if you look at it on a sustained period for the foreseeable future, we expect Turner's subscription revenues to be in the high single-digit growth range annually and HBO to be in the mid-single digit."

And so what I think is that it's important which series you're talking about. I think at Turner, we have some frankly bad, as it turned out, programming choices in some of the series we acquired over the last few years. And we talked about, I mean, specifically that they were hits on network TV and going up in ratings when we made the deal to acquire them. And then when they got on our network, they started to deteriorate faster than usual. Some of that maybe that they were available on some of the digital platforms, which if you're asking that, it doesn't help. But that aspect, which I don't think is a major part yet, it could become a larger deterioration effect if you're programming something on a big schedule TV network with a VOD component the way TNT will be. If that thing is available somewhere else all the time, that will obviously erode the viewership over time. So what's happened is our Networks, and I think many others, have stopped they essentially blocked those rights for VOD or they blocked them to be somewhere else. So that'll help, but that's not the issue here for us we don't think. We think the issue is the shows we picked didn't work as well as the shows some of our basic Cable competitors picked. And we've said today and named a few shows we think we'll begin to improve that. But that's basically a traditional programming kind of a problem that you fix by doing better programming."

Actually, I would go the other way and say that the audience for acquired programming because it's hits, because it's well-established is actually a very loyal audience. And the question really is how does that loyal audience comes to an acquired hit series, how does it stick with it over time because obviously, as you go year after year after year, eventually everything declines to some degree. So I think that's really the question. And there isn't a huge pattern change in the performance of acquired programming. Having said that, we still think that the combination of original series that, frankly, some of the strength of our original series, the ability to launch them is aided by the very strong platform of wider true-blue hits that are already on our schedule. And it's not the only reason, but it's one reason why we've been so successful in launching new series like The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles, et cetera. We're always evaluating the mix. We are constantly trying to create new long-term original series franchises at Turner, as well as HBO. I should mention not just in the remarks at the beginning, but now that truTV has created a really impressive number of, and so has Adult Swim of new series that are quite strong in their target demographics and quite strong with advertisers. So whether you're talking more niche-targeted programming, some acquired, some original or whether you're talking about big reach proven hits like on TBS, TNT, all of this is still strong and performing well. It really gets down to look what John was just answering in the last question. Big Bang Theory is an acquired series. It's going to be a big hit on CBS."

We grew adjusted earnings per share by 20%, and we continue to buy back our stock at a faster pace than last year, acquiring another $1 billion worth for almost 3% of our equity base since we last reported earnings to you. And as you saw in our outlook released this morning, we remain fully on track to meet, if not exceed, our guidance for the full year. More important, this quarter, we had significant progress toward our key strategic objectives. We continue to invest aggressively to make sure that our businesses each remain at the top of their competitive sets. At the same time, we continue to advance to new digital business models that will enable us to thrive as technology and consumption patterns evolve. 
Here's my perspective on some of the key highlights from the quarter starting in our Networks. As you know, the upfront marketplace was very strong, particularly for TV. This year, the National Cable Network reportedly pulled in higher dollar commitments than broadcast for the first time ever. Turner performed even better than its peers. Our large-reach entertainment networks, TNT and TBS, both saw in its solid double-digit CPM increases, putting them at the high end of all of TV, broadcast or Cable. It marks the third time in the last 4 years that our CPM increase has outstripped the average of the broadcast networks, providing more evidence that we're narrowing the CPM gap in broadcast. 
This strength extends beyond TNT and TBS. Both truTV and Adult Swim saw pricing and volume increases substantially higher than the average for Cable Networks. And our news networks also performed extremely well, with CNN outpacing its cable news competitors for both CPM and volume growth. This performance in the upfront across the entire portfolio is a broad endorsement by advertisers. It underscores the incredible reach of our Networks, the #1 and #2 reach networks on cable, TNT and TBS, the highest reach cable news network, CNN, and the growing reach of Adult Swim and truTV. And that reflects the appeal of our brands and programming and the skill of our sales force in creating compelling marketing partnerships. 
Beyond our performance in the upfront, I'll spend a moment updating you on recent ratings trends. TNT had its best quarter ever in primetime, with our sports programming leading the way. We posted fantastic results from our coverage of the NBA playoffs on TNT, clearly the best in cable history and up more than 25% over last year. We also saw strong performances from our originals on TNT, our new share of Falling Skies debuted as the #1 new series launch of the year and, by the way, it's also been posting great numbers on our international networks. Last month, we brought back the Closer and also Rizzoli & Isles, which are delivering the biggest audiences of any dramas on Cable so far this year. 
So that's great, but we aren't satisfied with the recent ratings on some of our acquired content on TBS and TNT. That's something we're very focused on and plan to fix. Some of this recent performance is a reflection of the natural life cycle of acquired shows, which tend to decline over time. But we're confident that our plans to add some of the biggest hits on TV will boost viewership, shows like The Big Bang Theory, which is the #1 comedy on TV, and it will debut on CBS at the end of the third quarter; and The Mentalist, the #3 drama on TV, which will start stripping on TNT next year. We also recently struck deals to bring Castle and Hawaii Five-0 to TNT. Keep in mind that even one successful show can have a significant impact for these networks, and we think we have several in the pipeline. As a result, we expect these moves will improve ratings starting with TBS in the fourth quarter. 
Looking across channels portfolio, we had solid ratings performance from our other networks during the quarter. TruTV posted its best second quarter primetime ratings ever, solidifying its position as a top-tier cable network. Cartoon Networks posted double-digit gains in primetime in its key demo, and Adult Swim maintained its dominant position in late-night TV. And notably, CNN was up over 20% in its key demo, again, outperforming its cable news competitors. It's further evidence that when news breaks, more people turn to CNN than anywhere else. We're looking to capitalize on that momentum as we roll out our vast primetime lineup next week. 
Let's shift to HBO, where our programming lineup is stronger than ever and getting stronger. Even during the heyday of the Sopranos and Sex and the City, we never had the volume of top quality original programming that we air today on HBO. In June, we concluded the first season of Game of Thrones, which steered viewership steadily over the course of its run to end with over 9 million total viewers per episode. And we debuted the fourth season of True Blood to its highest premiere ratings ever. In fact, 5 of the top 7 most highly watched series in HBO's history are currently on the network: True Blood, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Entourage and Hung. 
Last month, HBO received the most Emmy nominations of any TV network for the 11th year in a row. Both Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones are nominated for outstanding drama series, the first time in decades that 2 freshmen shows from the same network are nominees. And with the richest developing slate in our history, we think the momentum will keep building. Next year, we'll debut Luck, a series from Michael Mann and David Milch, starring Dustin Hoffman, centered around the world of horse racing, and another new series, more as this story develops. A new show from Aaron Sorkin. It goes behind his hands at a cable news network. You noticed that some are source materials. [ph] 
At both Turner and HBO, our TV Everywhere initiatives are gaining momentum. As you know, in May, we launched HBO GO on iOS and Android mobile devices. It's still early, but it's been an even bigger hit than we expected. Mobile application has already been downloaded close to 4 million times. Our research shows that 85% of GO users are watching much more HBO than they did before, and the satisfaction levels of GO users are through the roof. 
Over the rest of the year, we'll widen the availability of HBO GO to include connected TVs, game consoles and other connected devices, and we'll keep rolling out internationally. GO is now available throughout Central Europe. We'll launch Brazil and Mexico toward the end of the year, and we'll start to launch in Asia next year. In addition, TV Everywhere versions of Turner Networks are available to about 7 million households in the United States. 
Last month, we launched authenticated live streaming of CNN and headline news, online and through iOS apps that have already been downloaded more than 10 million times. We'll be launching apps for other networks in the coming months. And Nielsen is now capturing TV Everywhere usage in its C3 data, making us agnostic to whether viewers watch our shows on  TVs, PCs or mobile devices. 
Turning to Warner Bros. Our Film results were mixed this quarter, but the team at Warner's have a great track record of making sure the hits outweigh the misses. While the performance of Green Lantern fell shorter of our expectations, The Hangover Part 2  substantially exceeded them with global box office over $0.5 billion so far, making it the highest grossing R-rated comedy ever. And of course, after the end of the quarter, we shattered records with the opening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The records include the highest opening weekend ever, both domestically and internationally. Since its release, the film has already pulled in more than $1 billion globally, putting it on track to be the highest grossing film of the Harry Potter franchise. 
Looking out to the remainder of the year, we're very optimistic about 2 fourth quarter releases: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, and Happy Feet 2. And we expect to have a strong slate again in 2012. Movies include The Dark Knight Rises and part 1 of The Hobbit, among many others. 
Warner Bros. TV production also had a great quarter. At this year's upfront, Warner has placed 27 series on the broadcast schedule, including 16 returning shows and 11 new shows. That places Warner as the #1 producer of TV programming yet again this year. As another measure of our success and growth prospects, consider that our TV backlog costs $5 billion this quarter to reach its highest level ever. 
I'd also like to update you briefly on the progress Warner Bros. is making in accelerating the digital transition in home videos. As we've discussed with you before, we're working hard to make digital ownership of movies more compelling for consumers. As part of that effort, we've been a proponent of the ultraviolet initiative to enable consumers to purchase movies and TV shows and then access them from the cloud on a wide range of devices. Beginning with the releases of Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern in the fourth quarter, the vast majority of our future home video new releases will be UV-enabled. 
A key part of our plan to drive usage of ultraviolet is Flixster, which we purchased in May. Today, Flixster is one of the most popular applications for finding informations about movies. And over the coming months, we'll begin to roll out new upgraded versions of the Flixster service, which will be deeply integrated with ultraviolet. It will enable consumers to establish ultraviolet attempts [ph] to managing more [ph] their digital collection, whether to store it locally or in the cloud, to discover new contact and to share recommendations with friends. We'll start launching the first beta version this week. We believe this could fundamentally change how people manage and watch their movie collections, and it could significantly improve the value proposition of digital ownership. 
Moving on to Time Inc. During the quarter, we remained focused on outperforming the industry and maintaining the right cost structure while positioning ourselves to take advantage of new digital opportunities. This quarter, we reached agreement with Apple to enable print subscribers to People, Sports Illustrated, TIME and FORTUNE to access the tablet editions on their iPads at no extra charge. In addition, we've struck agreements to sell single copies, digital subscriptions and bundled print and digital subscriptions of selected titles with every other major tablet manufacturer including Motorola, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, BlackBerry, Amazon and Barnes & Nobles NOOK, among others. 
As you may have seen, this morning, we announced plans to offer editions of all 21 of our domestic magazine titles on every major tablet platform by the end of this year. Similar to what we're doing in our other businesses, it's another example of the aggressive step we are taking to accelerate the digital transition and help define these new business models. 
In sum, we've accomplished a lot this quarter. Heading into the second half of the year, we're right on track to achieve our financial objectives. At the same time, as evidenced by our stock buyback this quarter, we remain committed to providing an attractive return to shareholders. But most important, we continue to make progress on the strategic objectives that we think will position us to prosper long term. 
With that, I'll hand it off to John."

I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is available on our website. Before I review our quarterly results, let me remind you first of our financial priorities. We're focused on investing for long-term g",1997,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is available on our website. 
Before I review our quarterly results, let me remind you first of our financial priorities. We're focused on investing for long-term growth, delivering attractive near-term results and continuing to provide significant direct returns to shareholders. Of course, any given quarter can be affected by the timing of investments, and you see all that at work in the results this quarter. 
We had very strong revenue and adjusted EPS growth, while our margins were somewhat impacted by planned investments. We grew revenues 10% and that's the highest growth rate since the third quarter of 2007, and that was a result of strength across all revenue categories. 
Content revenue was particularly robust, increasing 15% in the quarter, while both Subscription and Advertising growth were also strong, so that's good. Adjusted operating income was up 6% year-over-year, and that somewhat trailed the revenue growth, and that's because of strategic investments such as the NCAA basketball tournament and HBO GO, as well as the timing of our film slate. These investments both set us up for accelerated earnings growth in the second half of this year and further strengthen our long-term growth prospects. 
Moving down the P&L. Adjusted EPS climbed a very strong 20%, and that was helped by ongoing share repurchase program. So during the first half of the year, we repurchased $2 billion of shares, and that's twice as fast as our pace last year. And this morning, we updated our outlook to at least low-teens growth in adjusted EPS, and that's for this year in 2011. And that reflects our year-to-date performance, plus our confidence in the remainder of the year. So we're very much on track to achieve all financial objectives for the year. 
So let me move on now and discuss our segments. And I'll begin with our Networks, where we had another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Advertising revenues were up 11%. Our domestic entertainment networks, which includes kids and young adults, grew Advertising double digits in the quarter. Now that includes ad revenues from the NCAA contract and some small transactions. And if you were to exclude those, growth would have been in the mid-single digits. Domestic news was flat, and that's a result of very typical comparisons. You may recall that domestic news advertising grew double digits in the second quarter last year while every other quarter during the year, it was actually down. 
International advertising revenues grew approximately 35% in the quarter, and that was boosted by a couple of transactions and some favorable foreign exchange rates. And if you were to look through those, international advertising revenues were up in the single digits. So you may ask, ""Why is that, why isn't it higher?"" And it's really 2 stories to tell here. First, we continue to perform very well in our European and Latin American entertainment networks, both of which were up double digits in the quarter. But due to events in Japan and the Middle East, international news were down in the quarter, so that was a drag on the overall growth rate. 
In terms of the third quarter Advertising environment, the scatter market slowed a bit during the upfront but now has largely come back in recent weeks. Domestic scatter pricing is now up in the mid-teens over the upfront. And looking ahead, we expect total ad growth in the third quarter to remain somewhat similar to what it was in the second quarter. And we should begin to benefit from the strong 2011, 2012 upfront in the fourth quarter. That should allow us to maintain very attractive Advertising gross rates even as we lap the acquisition of Chilevisión that occurred late last year. 
Moving to Subscription revenues, where we saw another quarter of high single-digit growth. That reflects higher rates domestically and continued international growth. Content revenues were also higher in the quarter, up almost 20%, and that was driven by strong sales with HBO's original programming, including the season 3 home video release of True Blood and the licensing of Game of Thrones outside the U.S. 
Adjusted operating income here was up 5% in the quarter, and this was an improvement over the first quarter growth, but clearly below our long-term expectations. And that's largely a result of the investments in the NCAA and HBO GO that I previously mentioned. Together, these investments reduced growth in Time Warner's adjusted operating income this quarter by 400 to 500 basis points. 
Turning now to film. Warner Bros. revenues were up a solid 13% in the quarter. On the home entertainment front, we saw significant increases in both video game and home video revenues. Our games business benefited from the releases of Mortal Kombat 9 and LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game. And Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, which is the #1 selling home video release year-to-date, drove home video revenues up 22% in the quarter. 
Despite this higher revenue, adjusted operating income was down modestly in the quarter, and that was because of higher prerelease P&A spending on third quarter releases, much of that tied to the Harry Potter film, as well as higher theatrical film valuation adjustments and increased overhead costs. And the increase in overhead was in part due to recent acquisitions and new business initiatives. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect the second half of the year to be very, very strong. We're off to a great start with record-breaking performance of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, and the third quarter will also benefit from the syndication sale of the Big Bang Theory. And we're looking forward to our fourth quarter releases such as Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2, as Jeff just mentioned, as well as our strong home video and games lineup for the holiday season. So we remain confident, and we've said this before that 2011 will be a record year for Warner Bros.
On the Publishing where all 4 revenue buckets were actually up year-over-year in the quarter. Advertising revenues were up slightly. And if you'll recall, we transferred management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner last year. So as a result, Time Inc. no longer books the advertising revenue generated by these sites. We all saw that as with certain titles in IPC last year. So if you were to exclude those 2 items for comparability purposes, total Advertising revenues were up 4% and digital advertising revenues were up in the low teens. 
Moving to Subscriptions, which were up for the first time since last year's second quarter. That's Subscription revenues. That was largely a result of an uptick in domestic revenue and favorable foreign exchange rates. And it was partially offset by the sale of titles at IPC. Operating income at Time Inc. was up 10%, with margins up 120 basis points. This is the seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc. Total expenses were up modestly, and the biggest driver there was higher paper costs. 
Looking to the third quarter, we are seeing some softness in both Advertising and newsstand sales. Adjusted operating income should also be negatively impacted by some continued expense growth, including higher paper prices. So if you were to take all of this into account, adjusted operating income should be down somewhat in the third quarter. However, we expect this segment to return to growth again in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the next slide, which looks at our full year outlook. As I noted a little earlier, we feel even more confident that we'll achieve our financial objectives this year. And this morning is update to our outlook to grow at least low teens in adjusted EPS in 2011. In terms of the quarterly progression, the year is coming in more or less how we planned. The first quarter was our most challenging one from a profit growth perspective due to difficult film comparisons and the significant investments we made in the NCAA basketball tournament. In the second quarter, we returned to profit growth and adjusted EPS growth. 
Now let me quickly highlight some things to be mindful of in each of Q3 and Q4 this year. So beginning in the third quarter, we expect accelerating year-over-year growth for both profit and adjusted EPS. That's largely a result of the strong theatrical and syndication lineup at Warner Bros. In fact, growth would be even higher if not for the timing of programming and marketing spending in the third quarter at the Networks. 
We plan to increase programming spending in the mid-teens and to increase marketing spending, which should weigh on the Networks segment profits in Q3. Some of this is related to the airing of additional sports programs. Also, recall that in last year's third quarter, we booked a $58 million reversal of a litigation reserve, which creates another headwind for growth in the quarter. But as we look beyond Q3 and as we look ahead into the fourth quarter, we expect another quarter of very, very strong profit growth. 
So Warner Bros. should post a big quarter due to the home video and games release slate. And we anticipate strong growth at the Networks, very strong growth, in fact. Again, that's mostly a function of timing. In particular, growth in programming and marketing will be much more modest in Q4 as compared to the third quarter. But we will also benefit from this year's very strong upfront and our expectations for improved programming. So we fully anticipate a very strong second half for this year. 
Let me continue on, move to the next slide, which just quickly highlights our free cash flow. Year-to-date, for the second quarter, we generated $555 million of free cash. The big year-over-year decline is mainly due to an increase in working capital. For the first half, that was primarily attributable to increased production spending of both Warner Bros. and HBO. 
We said at the beginning of the year that this would be a down year in free cash flow due to the timing of our investment spending in programming and production, as well as higher cash taxes. You saw that decline in the first half, but we expect free cash flow generation to begin to improve starting in the second half now. And we fully expect to see both our free cash flow and our rate of conversion increase in 2012. 
Looking at the last slide, which is our net debt position. We ended the quarter with $15 billion in net debt. That's up about $2.1 billion compared to the end of last year. We returned approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders during the first 6 months of the year, and that includes about $2 billion in share repurchases. That's double the pace of our share repurchases that we did last year. Year-to-date, we've also spent a little less than $300 million in M&A activity in the second quarter. The only significant acquisition we made was Flixster. And as Jeff described, we expect Flixster to play an important role in our efforts to accelerate the digital transition for our home video business. 
Our debt leverage ratio is now 2.4x, and that's up from around 2x at the end of 2010. That's consistent with our plan to move closer to our target leverage of 2.5x in an effort to better optimize our capital structure. As you know, we manage our capital structure with the goal of finding the right balance between maintaining our strong balance sheet and actively deploying our capital to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. So with half the year completed, we feel very comfortable with the progress we've made and the path we're on. 
So thank you for listening. And now let me turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A portion."

And so we can make structures for that, that accommodates the different positions that digital distributors are in as they try to build their businesses. The value of these things is going up, what we've seen basically as you look at particularly subscription VOD, which Amazon is interested in, Netflix is very successful in that area, as is HBO. We think that there is a great place for subscription VOD. HBO already occupied a pretty good place in that area. But take Netflix, it provides another way for us to monetize our content, which is good. And it gives access to deep library of products that consumers couldn't easily get before, particularly the older shows. And so it may be filling a really functional thing for consumers so that particularly also in the case of serial live shows, which we don't play as well on traditional cable nets or syndication, that can be a good place for subscription VOD services to operate, I mean, obviously, results in more monetization for the content than we were all getting previously. We don't think though that if you're looking at subscription VOD, in most cases, if you think of all the big series or movie products that's out there in the relatively early windows, that's probably not the right outlet for the newer, higher-value content because it has so much money behind it as you take it through the years of its window.

In the case of HBO, the ratings are not as important, although as we've seen viewership go up with On Demand, whether it was On Demand on television for HBO, which has had been going on 5, 10 years, or now On Demand on I",405,"All right. That's a good question. In the case of HBO, the ratings are not as important, although as we've seen viewership go up with On Demand, whether it was On Demand on television for HBO, which has had been going on 5, 10 years, or now On Demand on Internet for HBO, which is GO, when you put something On Demand, including this year's Game of Thrones or Sopranos from years ago, a lot more people watch it. So if you then -- that's the premium and pay TV side. HBO has a fairly deep library of all of that, both current and older hit shows. If you go to -- when you ask ratings, I think advertising, when you go to ad-supported networks like TNT, TBS, we have a mix of new originals, acquired series, acquired movies. In the case of all the acquired stuff, they're all hit. In the case of original stuff on TNT, mostly those have been fortunately hits, including some of the new ones that we've put out. If you then go to that and you say, all right, what happens as people have more ability to pick programming On Demand, which has been -- that's given rise to a theory everybody has that then scheduled viewing ""collision viewing,"" which I think is an inaccurate term, will go down as people have more choice. Well, what everyone's forgetting is that when you put the hit programming, including the acquired hits on big cable networks like TNT, USA, TBS, when you put those On Demand, you get the same lift that makes those popular programs more successful. So you have 2 effects going on. One is more choice, so a viewer can move away from a scheduled rerun. The other is more choice, so a viewer can watch the favorite hit show that is available now in rerun. On TV Everywhere, you'll have a habit that develops among all consumers across all Networks that lets you watch a lot of current episodes of your favorite show. And what's developing right behind that is last season, you've got some of that on Hulu Plus where you can see full seasons, last year's season. So what you have is basically newer forms of what everybody used to think of as syndication, that is now being available On Demand. And if you have hit programming, you make it available, you get more viewing."

And so what I think is that it's important which series you're talking about. I think at Turner, we had some, frankly, bad, as it turned out, programming choices in some of the series we acquired over the last few years. And we talked about, I mean, specifically that when they were hits on network TV and going up in ratings when we made the deal to acquire them and then when they got on our network, they started to deteriorate faster than usual. Some of that maybe that they were available on some of the digital platforms, which if you're asking that, it doesn't help. But that aspect, which I don't think is a major part yet, it could become a larger deterioration effect if you're programming something on a big schedule TV network with a VOD component the way TNT will be. If that thing is available somewhere else all the time, that will obviously erode the viewership over time. So what's happened is our networks, and I think many others, have stopped -- they essentially blocked those rights for VOD or they blocked them to be somewhere else, so that will help. But that's not the issue here for us we don't think. We think the issue is the shows we picked didn't work as well as the shows some of our basic cable competitors picked. And we've said today and named a few shows we think we'll begin to improve that. But that's basically a traditional programming kind of a problem that you fix by doing better programming."

And we think that it's going to monetize its audiences very well, and we have high expectations for the audience levels that it's going to be able to deliver on the network. As it relates from the production side, I think we're extremely pleased with how it's continuing to perform on the broadcast network. And with ratings continuing at very high levels, we think that spells for a great degree of optimism as we look ahead with the potential of multiple, multiple cycles of syndication and international licensing opportunities. And if you look back in history, Warner has had some of the most successful television series in history, and they've been franchises with very, very big numbers in front of them. So we're pleased that we have Big Bang, and we think that there's going to be plenty of monetization ahead."

Actually, I would go the other way and say that the audience for acquired programming because it's hits, because it's well-established, is actually a very loyal audience. And the question really is how does that loyal audience that comes to an acquired hit series, how does it stick with it over time because, obviously, as you go year after year after year, eventually everything declines at some degree. So I think that's really the question. And there isn't a huge pattern change in the performance of acquired programming. Having said that, we still think that the combination of original series that, frankly, some of the strength of our original series, the ability to launch them is aided by the very strong platform of acquired true-blue hits that are already on our schedule. And it's not the only reason, but it's one reason why we've been so successful in launching new series like The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles, et cetera. We're always evaluating the mix. We are constantly trying to create new long-term original series franchises at Turner, as well as HBO. I should mention not just in the remarks at the beginning, but now that truTV has created a really impressive number of -- and so has Adult Swim, of new series that are quite strong in their target demographics and quite strong with advertisers. So whether you're talking more niche-targeted programming, some acquired, some original or whether you're talking about big reach proven hits like on TBS, TNT, all of it is still strong and performing well. And It really gets down to -- look what John was just answering in the last question. Big Bang Theory is an acquired series. It's going to be a big hit on CBS."

Overall, the second quarter was another pretty successful quarter for us. We posted our highest revenue growth in 4 years, up 10%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 20%, and we continue to buy back our stock at a faster pace than last year, acquiring another $1 billion worth, for almost 3% of our equity base since we last reported earnings to you. And as you saw in our outlook released this morning, we remain fully on track to meet, if not exceed, our guidance for the full year. More important, this quarter, we had significant progress toward our key strategic objectives. We continue to invest aggressively to make sure that our businesses each remain at the top of their competitive sets. At the same time, we continue to advance to new digital business models that will enable us to thrive as technology and consumption patterns evolve. 
Here's my perspective on some of the key highlights from the quarter starting in our Networks. As you know, the upfront marketplace was very strong, particularly for TV. This year, the National Cable Network reportedly pulled in higher dollar commitments than broadcast for the first time ever. Turner performed even better than its peers. Our large-reach entertainment networks, TNT and TBS, both saw in its solid double-digit CPM increases, putting them at the high end of all of TV, broadcast or Cable. It marks the third time in the last 4 years that our CPM increase has outstripped the average of the broadcast networks, providing more evidence that we're narrowing the CPM gap in broadcast. 
This strength extends beyond TNT and TBS. Both truTV and Adult Swim saw pricing and volume increases substantially higher than the average for Cable Networks. And our news networks also performed extremely well, with CNN outpacing its cable news competitors for both CPM and volume growth. This performance in the upfront across the entire portfolio is a broad endorsement by advertisers. It underscores the incredible reach of our Networks, the #1 and #2 reach networks on cable, TNT and TBS, the highest reach cable news network, CNN, and the growing reach of Adult Swim and truTV. And that reflects the appeal of our brands and programming and the skill of our sales force in creating compelling marketing partnerships. 
Beyond our performance in the upfront, I'll spend a moment updating you on recent ratings trends. TNT had its best quarter ever in primetime, with our sports programming leading the way. We posted fantastic results from our coverage of the NBA playoffs on TNT, clearly the best in cable history and up more than 25% over last year. We also saw strong performances from our originals on TNT, our new share of Falling Skies debuted as the #1 new series launch of the year and, by the way, it's also been posting great numbers on our international networks. Last month, we brought back the Closer and also Rizzoli & Isles, which are delivering the biggest audiences of any dramas on Cable so far this year. 
So that's great, but we aren't satisfied with the recent ratings on some of our acquired content on TBS and TNT. That's something we're very focused on and plan to fix. Some of this recent performance is a reflection of the natural life cycle of acquired shows, which tend to decline over time. But we're confident that our plans to add some of the biggest hits on TV will boost viewership, shows like The Big Bang Theory, which is the #1 comedy on TV, and it will debut on TBS at the end of the third quarter; and The Mentalist, the #3 drama on TV, which will start stripping on TNT next year. We also recently struck deals to bring Castle and Hawaii Five-0 to TNT. Keep in mind that even one successful show can have a significant impact for these networks, and we think we have several in the pipeline. As a result, we expect these moves will improve ratings, starting with TBS, in the fourth quarter. 
Looking across channels portfolio, we had solid ratings performance from our other networks during the quarter. TruTV posted its best second quarter primetime ratings ever, solidifying its position as a top-tier cable network. Cartoon Network posted double-digit gains in primetime in its key demo, and Adult Swim maintained its dominant position in late-night TV. And notably, CNN was up over 20% in its key demo, again, outperforming its cable news competitors. It's further evidence that when news breaks, more people turn to CNN than anywhere else. We're looking to capitalize on that momentum as we roll out our vast primetime lineup next week. 
Let's shift to HBO, where our programming lineup is stronger than ever and getting stronger. Even during the heyday of the Sopranos and Sex and the City, we never had the volume of top quality original programming that we air today on HBO. In June, we concluded the first season of Game of Thrones, which steered viewership steadily over the course of its run to end with over 9 million total viewers per episode. And we debuted the fourth season of True Blood to its highest premiere ratings ever. In fact, 5 of the top 7 most highly watched series in HBO's history are currently on the network: True Blood, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Entourage and Hung. 
Last month, HBO received the most Emmy nominations of any TV network for the 11th year in a row. Both Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones are nominated for outstanding drama series, the first time in decades that 2 freshmen shows from the same network are nominees. And with the richest developing slate in our history, we think the momentum will keep building. Next year, we'll debut Luck, a series from Michael Mann and David Milch, starring Dustin Hoffman, centered around the world of horse racing, and another new series, More As This Story Develops. A new show from Aaron Sorkin. It goes behind his hands at a cable news network. You noticed that some are source materials. [ph] 
At both Turner and HBO, our TV Everywhere initiatives are gaining momentum. As you know, in May, we launched HBO GO on iOS and Android mobile devices. It's still early, but it's been an even bigger hit than we expected. The mobile application has already been downloaded close to 4 million times. Our research shows that 85% of GO users are watching much more HBO than they did before, and the satisfaction levels of GO users are through the roof. 
Over the rest of the year, we'll widen the availability of HBO GO to include connected TVs, game consoles and other connected devices, and we'll keep rolling out internationally. GO is now available throughout Central Europe. We'll launch Brazil and Mexico toward the end of the year, and we'll start to launch in Asia next year. In addition, TV Everywhere versions of Turner Networks are available to about 7 million households in the United States. 
Last month, we launched authenticated live streaming of CNN and headline news, online and through iOS apps that have already been downloaded more than 10 million times. We'll be launching apps for other networks in the coming months. And Nielsen is now capturing TV Everywhere usage in its C3 data, making us agnostic to whether viewers watch our shows on  TVs, PCs or mobile devices. 
Turning to Warner Bros. Our Film results were mixed this quarter, but the team at Warner's have a great track record of making sure the hits outweigh the misses. While the performance of Green Lantern fell short of our expectations, The Hangover Part II substantially exceeded them, with global box office over $0.5 billion so far, making it the highest grossing R-rated comedy ever. And of course, after the end of the quarter, we shattered records with the opening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The records include the highest opening weekend ever, both domestically and internationally. Since its release, the film has already pulled in more than $1 billion globally, putting it on track to be the highest grossing film of the Harry Potter franchise. 
Looking out to the remainder of the year, we're very optimistic about 2 fourth quarter releases: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, and Happy Feet 2. And we expect to have a strong slate again in 2012. Movies include The Dark Knight Rises and part 1 of The Hobbit, among many others. 
Warner Bros. TV production also had a great quarter. At this year's upfront, Warner has placed 27 series on the broadcast schedule, including 16 returning shows and 11 new shows. That places Warner as the #1 producer of TV programming yet again this year. As another measure of our success and growth prospects, consider that our TV backlog costs $5 billion this quarter, to reach its highest level ever. 
I'd also like to update you briefly on the progress Warner Bros. is making in accelerating the digital transition in home videos. As we've discussed with you before, we're working hard to make digital ownership of movies more compelling for consumers. As part of that effort, we've been a proponent of the ultraviolet initiative to enable consumers to purchase movies and TV shows and then access them from the cloud on a wide range of devices. Beginning with the releases of Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern in the fourth quarter, the vast majority of our future home video new releases will be UV-enabled. 
A key part of our plan to drive usage of ultraviolet, is Flixster, which we purchased in May. Today, Flixster is one of the most popular applications for finding informations about movies. And over the coming months, we'll begin to roll out new upgraded versions of the Flixster service, which will be deeply integrated with ultraviolet. It will enable consumers to establish ultraviolet attempts [ph] to managing more [ph] their digital collection, whether to store it locally or in the cloud, to discover new contact and to share recommendations with friends. We'll start launching the first beta version this week. We believe this could fundamentally change how people manage and watch their movie collections, and it could significantly improve the value proposition of digital ownership. 
Moving on to Time Inc. During the quarter, we remained focused on outperforming the industry and maintaining the right cost structure while positioning ourselves to take advantage of new digital opportunities. This quarter, we reached agreement with Apple to enable print subscribers to People, Sports Illustrated, TIME and FORTUNE to access the tablet editions on their iPads at no extra charge. In addition, we've struck agreements to sell single copies, digital subscriptions and bundled print and digital subscriptions of selected titles with every other major tablet manufacturer including Motorola, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, BlackBerry, Amazon and Barnes & Nobles NOOK, among others. 
As you may have seen, this morning, we announced plans to offer editions of all 21 of our domestic magazine titles on every major tablet platform by the end of this year. Similar to what we're doing in our other businesses, it's another example of the aggressive step we are taking to accelerate the digital transition and help define these new business models. 
In sum, we've accomplished a lot this quarter. Heading into the second half of the year, we're right on track to achieve our financial objectives. At the same time, as evidenced by our stock buyback this quarter, we remain committed to providing an attractive return to shareholders. But most important, we continue to make progress on the strategic objectives that we think will position us to prosper long term. 
With that, I'll hand it off to John."

We're focused on investing for long-term g",1995,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is available on our website. 
Before I review our quarterly results, let me remind you first of our financial priorities. We're focused on investing for long-term growth, delivering attractive near-term results and continuing to provide significant direct returns to shareholders. Of course, any given quarter can be affected by the timing of investments, and you see all that at work in the results this quarter. 
We had very strong revenue and adjusted EPS growth, while our margins were somewhat impacted by planned investments. We grew revenues 10%, and that's the highest growth rate since the third quarter of 2007, and that was a result of strength across all revenue categories. 
Content revenue was particularly robust, increasing 15% in the quarter, while both Subscription and Advertising growth were also strong, so that's good. Adjusted operating income was up 6% year-over-year, and that somewhat trailed the revenue growth, and that's because of strategic investments such as the NCAA basketball tournament and HBO GO, as well as the timing of our film slate. These investments both set us up for accelerated earnings growth in the second half of this year and further strengthen our long-term growth prospects. 
Moving down the P&L. Adjusted EPS climbed a very strong 20%, and that was helped by ongoing share repurchase program. So during the first half of the year, we repurchased $2 billion of shares, and that's twice as fast as our pace last year. And this morning, we updated our outlook to at least low-teens growth in adjusted EPS, and that's for this year in 2011. And that reflects our year-to-date performance, plus our confidence in the remainder of the year. So we're very much on track to achieve all financial objectives for the year. 
So let me move on now and discuss our segments. And I'll begin with our Networks, where we had another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Advertising revenues were up 11%. Our domestic entertainment networks, which includes kids and young adults, grew Advertising double digits in the quarter. Now that includes ad revenues from the NCAA contract and some small transactions. And if you were to exclude those, growth would have been in the mid-single digits. Domestic news was flat, and that's a result of very typical comparisons. You may recall that domestic news advertising grew double digits in the second quarter last year while every other quarter during the year, it was actually down. 
International advertising revenues grew approximately 35% in the quarter, and that was boosted by a couple of transactions and some favorable foreign exchange rates. And if you were to look through those, international advertising revenues were up in the single digits. So you may ask, ""Why is that, why isn't it higher?"" And it's really 2 stories to tell here. First, we continue to perform very well in our European and Latin American entertainment networks, both of which were up double-digits in the quarter. But due to events in Japan and the Middle East, international news were down in the quarter, so that was a drag on the overall growth rate. 
In terms of the third quarter Advertising environment, the scatter market slowed a bit during the upfront but now has largely come back in recent weeks. Domestic scatter pricing is now up in the mid-teens over the upfront. And looking ahead, we expect total ad growth in the third quarter to remain somewhat similar to what it was in the second quarter. And we should begin to benefit from the strong 2011, 2012 upfront in the fourth quarter. That should allow us to maintain very attractive Advertising gross rates even as we lap the acquisition of Chilevisión that occurred late last year. 
Moving to Subscription revenues, where we saw another quarter of high single-digit growth. That reflects higher rates domestically and continued international growth. Content revenues were also higher in the quarter, up almost 20%, and that was driven by strong sales with HBO's original programming, including the season 3 home video release of True Blood and the licensing of Game of Thrones outside the U.S. 
Adjusted operating income here was up 5% in the quarter, and this was an improvement over the first quarter growth, but clearly below our long-term expectations. And that's largely a result of the investments in the NCAA and HBO GO that I previously mentioned. Together, these investments reduced growth in Time Warner's adjusted operating income this quarter by 400 to 500 basis points. 
Turning now to film. Warner Bros. revenues were up a solid 13% in the quarter. On the home entertainment front, we saw significant increases in both video game and home video revenues. Our games business benefited from the releases of Mortal Kombat 9 and LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game. And Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, which is the #1 selling home video release year-to-date, drove home video revenues up 22% in the quarter. 
Despite this higher revenue, adjusted operating income was down modestly in the quarter, and that was because of higher prerelease P&A spending on third quarter releases, much of that tied to the Harry Potter film, as well as higher theatrical film valuation adjustments and increased overhead costs. And the increase in overhead was in part due to recent acquisitions and new business initiatives. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect the second half of the year to be very, very strong. We're off to a great start, with record-breaking performance of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, and the third quarter will also benefit from the syndication sale of The Big Bang Theory. And we're looking forward to our fourth quarter releases such as Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2, as Jeff just mentioned, as well as our strong home video and games lineup for the holiday season. So we remain confident, and we've said this before that 2011 will be a record year for Warner Bros.
On the Publishing where all 4 revenue buckets were actually up year-over-year in the quarter. Advertising revenues were up slightly. And if you'll recall, we transferred management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner last year. So as a result, Time Inc. no longer books the advertising revenue generated by these sites. We all saw that as with certain titles in IPC last year. So if you were to exclude those 2 items for comparability purposes, total Advertising revenues were up 4%, and digital advertising revenues were up in the low teens. 
Moving to Subscriptions, which were up for the first time since last year's second quarter. That's Subscription revenues. That was largely a result of an uptick in domestic revenue and favorable foreign exchange rates. And it was partially offset by the sale of titles at IPC. Operating income at Time Inc. was up 10%, with margins up 120 basis points. This is the seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc. Total expenses were up modestly, and the biggest driver there was higher paper costs. 
Looking to the third quarter, we are seeing some softness in both Advertising and newsstand sales. Adjusted operating income should also be negatively impacted by some continued expense growth, including higher paper prices. So if you were to take all of this into account, adjusted operating income should be down somewhat in the third quarter. However, we expect this segment to return to growth again in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the next slide, which looks at our full year outlook. As I noted a little earlier, we feel even more confident that we'll achieve our financial objectives this year. And this morning is update to our outlook to grow at least low teens in adjusted EPS in 2011. In terms of the quarterly progression, the year is coming in more or less how we planned. The first quarter was our most challenging one from a profit growth perspective due to difficult film comparisons, and the significant investments we made in the NCAA basketball tournament. In the second quarter, we returned to profit growth and adjusted EPS growth. 
Now let me quickly highlight some things to be mindful of in each of Q3 and Q4 this year. So beginning in the third quarter, we expect accelerating year-over-year growth for both profit and adjusted EPS. That's largely a result of the strong theatrical and syndication lineup at Warner Bros. In fact, growth would be even higher if not for the timing of programming and marketing spending in the third quarter at the Networks. 
We plan to increase programming spending in the mid-teens and to increase marketing spending, which should weigh on the Networks segment profits in Q3. Some of this is related to the airing of additional sports programming. Also, recall that in last year's third quarter, we booked a $58 million reversal of a litigation reserve, which creates another headwind for growth in the quarter. But as we look beyond Q3 and as we look ahead into the fourth quarter, we expect another quarter of very, very strong profit growth. 
Warner Bros. should post a big quarter due to the home video and games release slate. And we anticipate strong growth at the Networks, very strong growth, in fact. Again, that's mostly a function of timing. In particular, growth in programming and marketing will be much more modest in Q4 as compared to the third quarter. But we will also benefit from this year's very strong upfront and our expectations for improved programming. So we fully anticipate a very strong second half for this year. 
Let me continue on, move to the next slide, which just quickly highlights our free cash flow. Year-to-date, for the second quarter, we generated $555 million of free cash. The big year-over-year decline is mainly due to an increase in working capital. For the first half, that was primarily attributable to increased production spending of both Warner Bros. and HBO. 
We said at the beginning of the year that this would be a down year in free cash flow due to the timing of our investment spending in programming and production, as well as higher cash taxes. You saw that decline in the first half, but we expect free cash flow generation to begin to improve starting in the second half now. And we fully expect to see both our free cash flow and our rate of conversion increase in 2012. 
Looking at the last slide, which is our net debt position. We ended the quarter with $15 billion in net debt. That's up about $2.1 billion compared to the end of last year. We returned approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders during the first 6 months of the year, and that includes about $2 billion in share repurchases. That's double the pace of our share repurchases that we did last year. Year-to-date, we've also spent a little less than $300 million in M&A activity in the second quarter. The only significant acquisition we made was Flixster. And as Jeff described, we expect Flixster to play an important role in our efforts to accelerate the digital transition for our home video business. 
Our debt leverage ratio is now 2.4x, and that's up from around 2x at the end of 2010. That's consistent with our plan to move closer to our target leverage of 2.5x in an effort to better optimize our capital structure. As you know, we manage our capital structure with the goal of finding the right balance between maintaining our strong balance sheet and actively deploying our capital to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. So with half the year completed, we feel very comfortable with the progress we've made and the path we're on. 
So thank you for listening. And now let me turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A portion."

And then secondly, on HBO GO, I know it's really early, but any sense of how HBO GO could impact churn going forward?"

Basically, we're fairly vigorous in our approach to it, and I think we've been pretty clear generally that we're eager to maximize the value of all our series and movies. And we want to do it in a way which adds to the value of these over their lifetime, not detract from it. One of the things that -- so we do anything that fits that. We had thought that some of the sales that we saw content owners make to various digital outlets actually undervalued or reduced the lifetime stream of earnings for those products. So we didn't want to do that. And we think there's some good opportunities from all the digital players, including Netflix. On the GO question, things are going very well as we said in the call. The subscriber usage and take up of GO is very enthusiastic. We don't have the numbers on churn yet, but when you have your subscribers using it a lot more then it's obviously going to make the subscription more valuable, whether you're looking at churn, installation or really the value that consumers put on HBO, which will affect over time the support, the retail price and the wholesale price."

We're always interested in having several competitors and healthy ones, digital ones, bidding for the value of our product. And so we can make structures for that, that accommodates the different positions that digital distributors are in as they try to build their businesses. The value of these things is going up, what we've seen basically as you look at particularly subscription VOD, which Amazon is interested in, Netflix is very successful in that area, as is HBO. We think that there is a great place for subscription VOD. HBO already occupied a pretty good place in that area. But take Netflix, it provides another way for us to monetize our content, which is good. And it gives access to deep library of products that consumers couldn't easily get before, particularly the older shows. And so it may be filling a really functional thing for consumers, so that particularly also in the case of serial live shows, which we don't play as well on traditional cable nets or syndication, that can be a good place for subscription VOD services to operate, I mean, obviously, results in more monetization for the content than we were all getting previously. We don't think though that if you're looking at subscription VOD, in most cases, if you think of all the big series or movie products that's out there in the relatively early windows, that's probably not the right outlet for the newer, higher-value content because it has so much money behind it as you take it through the years of its window. So I don't know, does that answer the question?"

And I think the question broadly is what's the impact on ratings and profitability as consumers have more and more options to watch all of this stuff that isn't recent, that is older? What's the risk to ratings and is there a double-edged sword that -- how do we think about that issue?"

That's a good question. In the case of HBO, the ratings are not as important, although as we've seen viewership go up with On Demand, whether it was On Demand on television for HBO, which has had been going on 5, 10 years, or now On Demand on Internet for HBO, which is GO, when you put something On Demand, including this year's Game of Thrones or Sopranos from years ago, a lot more people watch it. So if you then -- that's the premium and pay TV side. HBO has a fairly deep library of all of that, both current and older hit shows. If you go to -- when you ask ratings, I think advertising, when you go to ad-supported networks like TNT, TBS, we have a mix of new originals, acquired series, acquired movies. In the case of all the acquired stuff, they're all hit. In the case of original stuff on TNT, mostly those have been fortunately hits, including some of the new ones that we've put out. If you then go to that and you say, all right, what happens as people have more ability to pick programming On Demand, which has been -- that's given rise to a theory everybody has that then scheduled viewing ""collision viewing,"" which I think is an inaccurate term, will go down as people have more choice. Well, what everyone's forgetting is that when you put the hit programming, including the acquired hits on big cable networks like TNT, USA, TBS, when you put those On Demand, you get the same lift that makes those popular programs more successful. So you have 2 effects going on. One is more choice, so a viewer can move away from a scheduled rerun. The other is more choice, so a viewer can watch the favorite hit show that is available now in rerun. On TV Everywhere, you'll have a habit that develops among all consumers across all Networks that lets you watch a lot of current episodes of your favorite show. And what's developing right behind that is last season, you've got some of that on Hulu Plus where you can see full seasons, last year's season. So what you have is basically newer forms of what everybody used to think of as syndication, that is now being available On Demand. And if you have hit programming, you make it available, you get more viewing."

And so what I think is that it's important which series you're talking about. I think at Turner, we had some, frankly, bad, as it turned out, programming choices in some of the series we acquired over the last few years. And we talked about, I mean, specifically that when they were hits on network TV and going up in ratings when we made the deal to acquire them and then when they got on our network, they started to deteriorate faster than usual. Some of that maybe that they were available on some of the digital platforms, which if you're asking that, it doesn't help. But that aspect, which I don't think is a major part yet, it could become a larger deterioration effect if you're programming something on a big schedule TV network with a VOD component the way TNT will be. If that thing is available somewhere else all the time, that will obviously erode the viewership over time. So what's happened is our networks, and I think many others, have stopped -- they essentially blocked those rights for VOD, or they blocked them to be somewhere else, so that will help. But that's not the issue here for us we don't think. We think the issue is the shows we picked didn't work as well as the shows some of our basic cable competitors picked. And we've said today and named a few shows we think we'll begin to improve that. But that's basically a traditional programming kind of a problem that you fix by doing better programming."

We've been very happy with the performance of NBA, Major League Baseball and NCAA. NCAA, as we said, is really outperforming. But we continue to evaluate potential opportunities as they come up.

And the question really is how does that loyal audience that comes to an acquired hit series, how does it stick with it over time because, obviously, as you go year after year after year, eventually everything declines at some degree. So I think that's really the question. And there isn't a huge pattern change in the performance of acquired programming. Having said that, we still think that the combination of original series that, frankly, some of the strength of our original series, the ability to launch them is aided by the very strong platform of acquired true-blue hits that are already on our schedule. And it's not the only reason, but it's one reason why we've been so successful in launching new series like The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles, et cetera. We're always evaluating the mix. We are constantly trying to create new long-term original series franchises at Turner, as well as HBO. I should mention not just in the remarks at the beginning, but now that truTV has created a really impressive number of -- and so has Adult Swim, of new series that are quite strong in their target demographics and quite strong with advertisers. So whether you're talking more niche-targeted programming, some acquired, some original or whether you're talking about big reach proven hits like on TBS, TNT, all of it is still strong and performing well. And It really gets down to -- look what John was just answering in the last question. Big Bang Theory is an acquired series. It's going to be a big hit on CBS."

Overall, the second quarter was another pretty successful quarter for us. We posted our highest revenue growth in 4 years, up 10%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 20%, and we continue to buy back our stock at a faster pace than last year, acquiring another $1 billion worth, for almost 3% of our equity base since we last reported earnings to you. And as you saw in our outlook released this morning, we remain fully on track to meet, if not exceed, our guidance for the full year. More important, this quarter, we had significant progress toward our key strategic objectives. We continue to invest aggressively to make sure that our businesses each remain at the top of their competitive sets. At the same time, we continue to advance to new digital business models that will enable us to thrive as technology and consumption patterns evolve. 
Here's my perspective on some of the key highlights from the quarter starting in our Networks. As you know, the upfront marketplace was very strong, particularly for TV. This year, the National Cable Network reportedly pulled in higher dollar commitments than broadcast for the first time ever. Turner performed even better than its peers. Our large-reach entertainment networks, TNT and TBS, both saw in its solid double-digit CPM increases, putting them at the high end of all of TV, broadcast or Cable. It marks the third time in the last 4 years that our CPM increase has outstripped the average of the broadcast networks, providing more evidence that we're narrowing the CPM gap in broadcast. 
This strength extends beyond TNT and TBS. Both truTV and Adult Swim saw pricing and volume increases substantially higher than the average for Cable Networks. And our news networks also performed extremely well, with CNN outpacing its cable news competitors for both CPM and volume growth. This performance in the upfront across the entire portfolio is a broad endorsement by advertisers. It underscores the incredible reach of our Networks, the #1 and #2 reach networks on cable, TNT and TBS, the highest reach cable news network, CNN, and the growing reach of Adult Swim and truTV. And that reflects the appeal of our brands and programming and the skill of our sales force in creating compelling marketing partnerships. 
Beyond our performance in the upfront, I'll spend a moment updating you on recent ratings trends. TNT had its best quarter ever in primetime, with our sports programming leading the way. We posted fantastic results from our coverage of the NBA playoffs on TNT, clearly the best in cable history and up more than 25% over last year. We also saw strong performances from our originals on TNT, our new share of Falling Skies debuted as the #1 new series launch of the year and, by the way, it's also been posting great numbers on our international networks. Last month, we brought back the Closer and also Rizzoli & Isles, which are delivering the biggest audiences of any dramas on Cable so far this year. 
So that's great, but we aren't satisfied with the recent ratings on some of our acquired content on TBS and TNT. That's something we're very focused on and plan to fix. Some of this recent performance is a reflection of the natural life cycle of acquired shows, which tend to decline over time. But we're confident that our plans to add some of the biggest hits on TV will boost viewership, shows like The Big Bang Theory, which is the #1 comedy on TV, and it will debut on TBS at the end of the third quarter; and The Mentalist, the #3 drama on TV, which will start stripping on TNT next year. We also recently struck deals to bring Castle and Hawaii Five-0 to TNT. Keep in mind that even one successful show can have a significant impact for these networks, and we think we have several in the pipeline. As a result, we expect these moves will improve ratings, starting with TBS, in the fourth quarter. 
Looking across channels portfolio, we had solid ratings performance from our other networks during the quarter. TruTV posted its best second quarter primetime ratings ever, solidifying its position as a top-tier cable network. Cartoon Network posted double-digit gains in primetime in its key demo, and Adult Swim maintained its dominant position in late-night TV. And notably, CNN was up over 20% in its key demo, again, outperforming its cable news competitors. It's further evidence that when news breaks, more people turn to CNN than anywhere else. We're looking to capitalize on that momentum as we roll out our vast primetime lineup next week. 
Let's shift to HBO, where our programming lineup is stronger than ever and getting stronger. Even during the heyday of the Sopranos and Sex and the City, we never had the volume of top quality original programming that we air today on HBO. In June, we concluded the first season of Game of Thrones, which steered viewership steadily over the course of its run to end with over 9 million total viewers per episode. And we debuted the fourth season of True Blood to its highest premiere ratings ever. In fact, 5 of the top 7 most highly watched series in HBO's history are currently on the network: True Blood, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Entourage and Hung. 
Last month, HBO received the most Emmy nominations of any TV network for the 11th year in a row. Both Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones are nominated for outstanding drama series, the first time in decades that 2 freshmen shows from the same network are nominees. And with the richest developing slate in our history, we think the momentum will keep building. Next year, we'll debut Luck, a series from Michael Mann and David Milch, starring Dustin Hoffman, centered around the world of horse racing, and another new series, More As This Story Develops, a new show from Aaron Sorkin. It goes behind his hands at a cable news network. You noticed that some are source materials [ph]. 
At both Turner and HBO, our TV Everywhere initiatives are gaining momentum. As you know, in May, we launched HBO GO on iOS and Android mobile devices. It's still early, but it's been an even bigger hit than we expected. The mobile application has already been downloaded close to 4 million times. Our research shows that 85% of GO users are watching much more HBO than they did before, and the satisfaction levels of GO users are through the roof. 
Over the rest of the year, we'll widen the availability of HBO GO to include connected TVs, game consoles and other connected devices, and we'll keep rolling out internationally. GO is now available throughout Central Europe. We'll launch Brazil and Mexico toward the end of the year, and we'll start to launch in Asia next year. In addition, TV Everywhere versions of Turner Networks are available to about 7 million households in the United States. 
Last month, we launched authenticated live streaming of CNN and headline news, online and through iOS apps that have already been downloaded more than 10 million times. We'll be launching apps for other networks in the coming months. And Nielsen is now capturing TV Everywhere usage in its C3 data, making us agnostic to whether viewers watch our shows on  TVs, PCs or mobile devices. 
Turning to Warner Bros. Our Film results were mixed this quarter, but the team at Warner's have a great track record of making sure the hits outweigh the misses. While the performance of Green Lantern fell short of our expectations, The Hangover Part 2 substantially exceeded them, with global box office over $0.5 billion so far, making it the highest grossing R-rated comedy ever. And of course, after the end of the quarter, we shattered records with the opening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The records include the highest opening weekend ever, both domestically and internationally. Since its release, the film has already pulled in more than $1 billion globally, putting it on track to be the highest grossing film of the Harry Potter franchise. 
Looking out to the remainder of the year, we're very optimistic about 2 fourth quarter releases: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, and Happy Feet 2. And we expect to have a strong slate again in 2012. Movies include The Dark Knight Rises and part 1 of The Hobbit, among many others. 
Warner Bros. TV production also had a great quarter. At this year's upfront, Warner has placed 27 series on the broadcast schedule, including 16 returning shows and 11 new shows. That places Warner as the #1 producer of TV programming yet again this year. As another measure of our success and growth prospects, consider that our TV backlog costs $5 billion this quarter, to reach its highest level ever. 
I'd also like to update you briefly on the progress Warner Bros. is making in accelerating the digital transition in home videos. As we've discussed with you before, we're working hard to make digital ownership of movies more compelling for consumers. As part of that effort, we've been a proponent of the ultraviolet initiative to enable consumers to purchase movies and TV shows and then access them from the cloud on a wide range of devices. Beginning with the releases of Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern in the fourth quarter, the vast majority of our future home video new releases will be UV-enabled. 
A key part of our plan to drive usage of ultraviolet, is Flixster, which we purchased in May. Today, Flixster is one of the most popular applications for finding informations about movies. And over the coming months, we'll begin to roll out new upgraded versions of the Flixster service, which will be deeply integrated with ultraviolet. It will enable consumers to establish ultraviolet attempts [ph] to managing more [ph] their digital collection, whether to store it locally or in the cloud, to discover new contact and to share recommendations with friends. We'll start launching the first beta version this week. We believe this could fundamentally change how people manage and watch their movie collections, and it could significantly improve the value proposition of digital ownership. 
Moving on to Time Inc. During the quarter, we remained focused on outperforming the industry and maintaining the right cost structure while positioning ourselves to take advantage of new digital opportunities. This quarter, we reached agreement with Apple to enable print subscribers to People, Sports Illustrated, TIME and FORTUNE to access the tablet editions on their iPads at no extra charge. In addition, we've struck agreements to sell single copies, digital subscriptions and bundled print and digital subscriptions of selected titles with every other major tablet manufacturer including Motorola, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, BlackBerry, Amazon and Barnes & Noble’s NOOK, among others. 
As you may have seen, this morning, we announced plans to offer editions of all 21 of our domestic magazine titles on every major tablet platform by the end of this year. Similar to what we're doing in our other businesses, it's another example of the aggressive step we are taking to accelerate the digital transition and help define these new business models. 
In sum, we've accomplished a lot this quarter. Heading into the second half of the year, we're right on track to achieve our financial objectives. At the same time, as evidenced by our stock buyback this quarter, we remain committed to providing an attractive return to shareholders. But most important, we continue to make progress on the strategic objectives that we think will position us to prosper long term. 
With that, I'll hand it off to John."

We're focused on investing for long-term g",1995,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is available on our website. 
Before I review our quarterly results, let me remind you first of our financial priorities. We're focused on investing for long-term growth, delivering attractive near-term results and continuing to provide significant direct returns to shareholders. Of course, any given quarter can be affected by the timing of investments, and you see all that at work in the results this quarter. 
We had very strong revenue and adjusted EPS growth, while our margins were somewhat impacted by planned investments. We grew revenues 10%, and that's the highest growth rate since the third quarter of 2007, and that was a result of strength across all revenue categories. 
Content revenue was particularly robust, increasing 15% in the quarter, while both Subscription and Advertising growth were also strong, so that's good. Adjusted operating income was up 6% year-over-year, and that somewhat trailed the revenue growth, and that's because of strategic investments such as the NCAA basketball tournament and HBO GO, as well as the timing of our film slate. These investments both set us up for accelerated earnings growth in the second half of this year and further strengthen our long-term growth prospects. 
Moving down the P&L. Adjusted EPS climbed a very strong 20%, and that was helped by ongoing share repurchase program. So during the first half of the year, we repurchased $2 billion of shares, and that's twice as fast as our pace last year. And this morning, we updated our outlook to at least low-teens growth in adjusted EPS, and that's for this year in 2011. And that reflects our year-to-date performance, plus our confidence in the remainder of the year. So we're very much on track to achieve all financial objectives for the year. 
So let me move on now and discuss our segments. And I'll begin with our Networks, where we had another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Advertising revenues were up 11%. Our domestic entertainment networks, which includes kids and young adults, grew Advertising double digits in the quarter. Now that includes ad revenues from the NCAA contract and some small transactions. And if you were to exclude those, growth would have been in the mid-single digits. Domestic news was flat, and that's a result of very typical comparisons. You may recall that domestic news advertising grew double digits in the second quarter last year while every other quarter during the year, it was actually down. 
International advertising revenues grew approximately 35% in the quarter, and that was boosted by a couple of transactions and some favorable foreign exchange rates. And if you were to look through those, international advertising revenues were up in the single digits. So you may ask, ""Why is that, why isn't it higher?"" And it's really 2 stories to tell here. First, we continue to perform very well in our European and Latin American entertainment networks, both of which were up double-digits in the quarter. But due to events in Japan and the Middle East, international news were down in the quarter, so that was a drag on the overall growth rate. 
In terms of the third quarter Advertising environment, the scatter market slowed a bit during the upfront but now has largely come back in recent weeks. Domestic scatter pricing is now up in the mid-teens over the upfront. And looking ahead, we expect total ad growth in the third quarter to remain somewhat similar to what it was in the second quarter. And we should begin to benefit from the strong 2011, 2012 upfront in the fourth quarter. That should allow us to maintain very attractive Advertising gross rates even as we lap the acquisition of Chilevisión that occurred late last year. 
Moving to Subscription revenues, where we saw another quarter of high single-digit growth. That reflects higher rates domestically and continued international growth. Content revenues were also higher in the quarter, up almost 20%, and that was driven by strong sales with HBO's original programming, including the season 3 home video release of True Blood and the licensing of Game of Thrones outside the U.S. 
Adjusted operating income here was up 5% in the quarter, and this was an improvement over the first quarter growth, but clearly below our long-term expectations. And that's largely a result of the investments in the NCAA and HBO GO that I previously mentioned. Together, these investments reduced growth in Time Warner's adjusted operating income this quarter by 400 to 500 basis points. 
Turning now to film. Warner Bros. revenues were up a solid 13% in the quarter. On the home entertainment front, we saw significant increases in both video game and home video revenues. Our games business benefited from the releases of Mortal Kombat 9 and LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game. And Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, which is the #1 selling home video release year-to-date, drove home video revenues up 22% in the quarter. 
Despite this higher revenue, adjusted operating income was down modestly in the quarter, and that was because of higher prerelease P&A spending on third quarter releases, much of that tied to the Harry Potter film, as well as higher theatrical film valuation adjustments and increased overhead costs. And the increase in overhead was in part due to recent acquisitions and new business initiatives. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect the second half of the year to be very, very strong. We're off to a great start, with record-breaking performance of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, and the third quarter will also benefit from the syndication sale of The Big Bang Theory. And we're looking forward to our fourth quarter releases such as Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2, as Jeff just mentioned, as well as our strong home video and games lineup for the holiday season. So we remain confident, and we've said this before that 2011 will be a record year for Warner Bros.
On the Publishing where all 4 revenue buckets were actually up year-over-year in the quarter. Advertising revenues were up slightly. And if you'll recall, we transferred management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner last year. So as a result, Time Inc. no longer books the advertising revenue generated by these sites. We all saw that as with certain titles in IPC last year. So if you were to exclude those 2 items for comparability purposes, total Advertising revenues were up 4%, and digital advertising revenues were up in the low teens. 
Moving to Subscriptions, which were up for the first time since last year's second quarter. That's Subscription revenues. That was largely a result of an uptick in domestic revenue and favorable foreign exchange rates. And it was partially offset by the sale of titles at IPC. Operating income at Time Inc. was up 10%, with margins up 120 basis points. This is the seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc. Total expenses were up modestly, and the biggest driver there was higher paper costs. 
Looking to the third quarter, we are seeing some softness in both Advertising and newsstand sales. Adjusted operating income should also be negatively impacted by some continued expense growth, including higher paper prices. So if you were to take all of this into account, adjusted operating income should be down somewhat in the third quarter. However, we expect this segment to return to growth again in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the next slide, which looks at our full year outlook. As I noted a little earlier, we feel even more confident that we'll achieve our financial objectives this year. And this morning is update to our outlook to grow at least low teens in adjusted EPS in 2011. In terms of the quarterly progression, the year is coming in more or less how we planned. The first quarter was our most challenging one from a profit growth perspective due to difficult film comparisons, and the significant investments we made in the NCAA basketball tournament. In the second quarter, we returned to profit growth and adjusted EPS growth. 
Now let me quickly highlight some things to be mindful of in each of Q3 and Q4 this year. So beginning in the third quarter, we expect accelerating year-over-year growth for both profit and adjusted EPS. That's largely a result of the strong theatrical and syndication lineup at Warner Bros. In fact, growth would be even higher if not for the timing of programming and marketing spending in the third quarter at the Networks. 
We plan to increase programming spending in the mid-teens and to increase marketing spending, which should weigh on the Networks segment profits in Q3. Some of this is related to the airing of additional sports programming. Also, recall that in last year's third quarter, we booked a $58 million reversal of a litigation reserve, which creates another headwind for growth in the quarter. But as we look beyond Q3 and as we look ahead into the fourth quarter, we expect another quarter of very, very strong profit growth. 
Warner Bros. should post a big quarter due to the home video and games release slate. And we anticipate strong growth at the Networks, very strong growth, in fact. Again, that's mostly a function of timing. In particular, growth in programming and marketing will be much more modest in Q4 as compared to the third quarter. But we will also benefit from this year's very strong upfront and our expectations for improved programming. So we fully anticipate a very strong second half for this year. 
Let me continue on, move to the next slide, which just quickly highlights our free cash flow. Year-to-date, for the second quarter, we generated $555 million of free cash. The big year-over-year decline is mainly due to an increase in working capital. For the first half, that was primarily attributable to increased production spending of both Warner Bros. and HBO. 
We said at the beginning of the year that this would be a down year in free cash flow due to the timing of our investment spending in programming and production, as well as higher cash taxes. You saw that decline in the first half, but we expect free cash flow generation to begin to improve starting in the second half now. And we fully expect to see both our free cash flow and our rate of conversion increase in 2012. 
Looking at the last slide, which is our net debt position. We ended the quarter with $15 billion in net debt. That's up about $2.1 billion compared to the end of last year. We returned approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders during the first 6 months of the year, and that includes about $2 billion in share repurchases. That's double the pace of our share repurchases that we did last year. Year-to-date, we've also spent a little less than $300 million in M&A activity in the second quarter. The only significant acquisition we made was Flixster. And as Jeff described, we expect Flixster to play an important role in our efforts to accelerate the digital transition for our home video business. 
Our debt leverage ratio is now 2.4x, and that's up from around 2x at the end of 2010. That's consistent with our plan to move closer to our target leverage of 2.5x in an effort to better optimize our capital structure. As you know, we manage our capital structure with the goal of finding the right balance between maintaining our strong balance sheet and actively deploying our capital to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. So with half the year completed, we feel very comfortable with the progress we've made and the path we're on. 
So thank you for listening. And now let me turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A portion."

We're always interested in having several competitors and healthy ones, digital ones, bidding for the value of our product. And so we can make structures for that, that accommodates the different positions that digital distributors are in as they try to build their businesses. The value of these things is going up, what we've seen basically as you look at particularly subscription VOD, which Amazon is interested in, Netflix is very successful in that area, as is HBO. We think that there is a great place for subscription VOD. HBO already occupied a pretty good place in that area. But take Netflix, it provides another way for us to monetize our content, which is good. And it gives access to deep library of products that consumers couldn't easily get before, particularly the older shows. And so it may be filling a really functional thing for consumers, so that particularly also in the case of serial live shows, which we don't play as well on traditional cable nets or syndication, that can be a good place for subscription VOD services to operate, I mean, obviously, results in more monetization for the content than we were all getting previously. We don't think though that if you're looking at subscription VOD, in most cases, if you think of all the big series or movie products that's out there in the relatively early windows, that's probably not the right outlet for the newer, higher-value content because it has so much money behind it as you take it through the years of its window.

That's a good question. In the case of HBO, the ratings are not as important, although as we've seen viewership go up with On Demand, whether it was On Demand on television for HBO, which has had been going on 5, 10 years, or now On Demand on Internet for HBO, which is GO, when you put something On Demand, including this year's Game of Thrones or Sopranos from years ago, a lot more people watch it. So if you then -- that's the premium and pay TV side. HBO has a fairly deep library of all of that, both current and older hit shows. If you go to -- when you ask ratings, I think advertising, when you go to ad-supported networks like TNT, TBS, we have a mix of new originals, acquired series, acquired movies. In the case of all the acquired stuff, they're all hit. In the case of original stuff on TNT, mostly those have been fortunately hits, including some of the new ones that we've put out. If you then go to that and you say, all right, what happens as people have more ability to pick programming On Demand, which has been -- that's given rise to a theory everybody has that then scheduled viewing ""collision viewing,"" which I think is an inaccurate term, will go down as people have more choice. Well, what everyone's forgetting is that when you put the hit programming, including the acquired hits on big cable networks like TNT, USA, TBS, when you put those On Demand, you get the same lift that makes those popular programs more successful. So you have 2 effects going on. One is more choice, so a viewer can move away from a scheduled rerun. The other is more choice, so a viewer can watch the favorite hit show that is available now in rerun. On TV Everywhere, you'll have a habit that develops among all consumers across all Networks that lets you watch a lot of current episodes of your favorite show. And what's developing right behind that is last season, you've got some of that on Hulu Plus where you can see full seasons, last year's season. So what you have is basically newer forms of what everybody used to think of as syndication, that is now being available On Demand.

I think at Turner, we had some, frankly, bad, as it turned out, programming choices in some of the series we acquired over the last few years. And we talked about, I mean, specifically that when they were hits on network TV and going up in ratings when we made the deal to acquire them and then when they got on our network, they started to deteriorate faster than usual. Some of that maybe that they were available on some of the digital platforms, which if you're asking that, it doesn't help. But that aspect, which I don't think is a major part yet, it could become a larger deterioration effect if you're programming something on a big schedule TV network with a VOD component the way TNT will be. If that thing is available somewhere else all the time, that will obviously erode the viewership over time. So what's happened is our networks, and I think many others, have stopped -- they essentially blocked those rights for VOD, or they blocked them to be somewhere else, so that will help. But that's not the issue here for us we don't think. We think the issue is the shows we picked didn't work as well as the shows some of our basic cable competitors picked. And we've said today and named a few shows we think we'll begin to improve that. But that's basically a traditional programming kind of a problem that you fix by doing better programming."

And the question really is how does that loyal audience that comes to an acquired hit series, how does it stick with it over time because, obviously, as you go year after year after year, eventually everything declines at some degree. So I think that's really the question. And there isn't a huge pattern change in the performance of acquired programming. Having said that, we still think that the combination of original series that, frankly, some of the strength of our original series, the ability to launch them is aided by the very strong platform of acquired true-blue hits that are already on our schedule. And it's not the only reason, but it's one reason why we've been so successful in launching new series like The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles, et cetera. We're always evaluating the mix. We are constantly trying to create new long-term original series franchises at Turner, as well as HBO. I should mention not just in the remarks at the beginning, but now that truTV has created a really impressive number of -- and so has Adult Swim, of new series that are quite strong in their target demographics and quite strong with advertisers. So whether you're talking more niche-targeted programming, some acquired, some original or whether you're talking about big reach proven hits like on TBS, TNT, all of it is still strong and performing well. And It really gets down to -- look what John was just answering in the last question. Big Bang Theory is an acquired series. It's going to be a big hit on CBS."

This was a great quarter for us financially and strategically, led by a fantastic performance from our studio. The opening was up 11%. That's our fastest growth rate in 4 years. Adjusted operating inco",2004,"Thanks, Doug, and thanks for joining us this morning. This was a great quarter for us financially and strategically, led by a fantastic performance from our studio. The opening was up 11%. That's our fastest growth rate in 4 years. Adjusted operating income climbed 18%, and adjusted EPS was up 27%. Over the last few months, we took advantage of the attractive value of our stock and increased the pace of our repurchases. We bought back $3.7 billion of our stock so far this year, more than double the pace at this time last year. 
Following the strong results this quarter, we've raised our expectations for full year adjusted EPS to grow in the high teens. That means we're on track and have doubled our earnings over the past 3 years. It's a testament to the strength of our assets and management depth that we've been able to produce these results during such an uncertain time for the economy and such a period of considerable change for our industry. 
Let me put some context around our performance this quarter, and then John will walk you through our results in detail. We believe it's clear that technology and globalization are increasing the demand for high-quality content. As the right business models develop, we believe the value of this content is growing, and we think we're positioned to be one of the chief beneficiaries of these trends. 
So to take advantage of this, we've invested and we'll continue to invest aggressively to create and acquire even more great content, and we're pushing hard to develop new business models that enhance the consumer experience in a way that supports our economics. 
We made progress toward both these goals this quarter. At Warner Bros. Film division, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 grossed $1.3 billion at the box office globally, making it the third-highest grossing film ever. The 8 Harry Potter films have now grossed $7.7 billion globally, making it far and away the most successful film series in history. Of course, that's a credit to JK Rowling's brilliant story. It also underscores Warner Bros. unequaled ability to create and manage film franchises. 
While this was the last film in the series, the Harry Potter franchise will endure in a variety of ways for a long time. As just one example, next spring, we'll open the making of Harry Potter attraction at our studio outside London, coinciding with the 2012 London Olympics. We'll give visitors a unique behind-the-scenes look at the productions on the actual sets. Advance tickets just went on sale, and they have blown away our expectations. 
Although Harry Potter overshadowed just about everything in the film world this quarter, it wasn't all about the Harry or Warner Bros. Contagion and Horrible Bosses were also very strong performance, and we're set up for a strong to the year with the sequels to Happy Feet and Sherlock Holmes coming later this quarter. 
We're also enjoying fantastic momentum at Warner Bros. Television Production. The growth prospects for TV content have never been better, and Warners is in the full position to benefit. The big story this quarter was the initial syndication of The Big Bang Theory. A hit show like Big Bang can be a tremendous asset to us across the company. Warner Bros. it generates a significant license fees and ongoing Warner revenue, and for Turner, it's a critical part of the lineup of TBS as I'll discuss in a moment. 
Plus looking out over the next few years, our Syndication pipeline is building. We've had a great start to the new broadcast network season for both our biggest returning shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, Mike & Molly and for several of our new shows, especially 2 Broke Girls, Suburgatory and Person of Interest. We reflect on this list for a moment. We've never had so many successful comedies on the air at one time. For all the change in the TV business in the last decade, the Holy Grail of TV production is still a hit 30-minute comedy. Not only do successful comedies substantial prices in syndication, they can run for multiple cycles and become multibillion annuities. And we've got 4 of the top 7 on all of television. 
Over the last few weeks, we've also struck a couple of game-changing deals at The CW with both Netflix and Hulu. Historically, our stake in The CW has been profitable for us because it's a valuable platform for launching new shows. These deals substantially improve the economics of The CW. At the same time, they're great examples of how new distribution outlets can be additive to the traditional TV ecosystem. Many of the shows on The CW target a very specific demographic, and they are serialized, making them tough to syndicate through traditional networks. But they are perfect fit for SVOD providers like Netflix and Hulu. 
In recent months, Warners also made further progress toward improving the value proposition of owning digital movies. Its home entertainment transitions to digital distribution, we think it's critical to make it more compelling and easier for consumers to buy digital movies and to manage their collections. That's why we've been a big supporter of the UltraViolet initiative, which will allow consumers to access their movies from the cloud on a wide variety of devices in and out of the home. 
And to help kickstart the process, we bought Flixster, which is the first service to allow consumers to access a UV title. Over time, we expect to see many more UV services launch. In August, we launched the beta of Flixster's collection management service, and we subsequently released the first 2 UltraViolet titles: Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern. We're really happy with the early results, and we expect UltraViolet to gain traction in the coming year as more UV titles are released and many more retail partners rollout their own UV services. In the coming months, we intend to steadily add new features to Flixster. For instance, we'll add a movie starter kit that will give consumers a choice of a complementary digital movie when they create a new UV account. We'll open a studio agnostic storefront and we'll introduce a disk to digital service that will allow consumers to convert their physical DVD collections into digital copies. We'll also keep adding new devices and platforms. 
I'll now move over to our Networks business. At Turner this quarter, we again saw strong performance from the original programming at our big entertainment Networks. Most notably, Falling Skies on TNT was the #1 new film of the year while returning shows, Rizzoli & Isles and the Closer, premier in the top-tier scripted shows on Cable. We're also confident that the rating for our acquired programming will improve as we refresh our lineup with new hit shows, the first of which is The Big Bang Theory on TBS. 
So after a great start so far, it's only been on the regular schedule for 2 weeks, but it's significantly outperforming the programming that was previously in its timeslot, that's providing a boost to other parts of the TBS schedule, including Conan. Just as important, we think Big Bang will prove to be a great platform for launching original companies, which you'll see more of in the coming year. So not only should we see a big improvement in TBS ratings in the fourth quarter, we're also excited about the opportunity to drive growth in 2012 and beyond. 
CNN had another very strong quarter with ratings up more than 30% in its key demo, dramatically outpacing its Cable news competitors again. It's further evidence that more viewers turn to CNN than anywhere else when news breaks. Importantly, we're also seeing the payoff from some of our recent lineup changes with both Anderson Cooper's AC 360 and Piers Morgan Tonight up double digits. With our coverage of the Republican primary debates already breaking audience records in CNN, we think we're really well positioned heading into the 2012 election season. 
We also benefited from strong performance at some of our faster growing network as both truTV and Adult Swim posted their most watched third quarters ever in their key demos. As you all know, Turner's revenue is split between Advertising and affiliate fees. So growing ratings is important for our ad sales effort. But to bolster our affiliate fees, it's also important to schedule high-profile programming like sports. That's why we acquired the rights to the NCAA men's basketball tournament. When we announced this NCAA deal, we told you that we expect that it would be significantly profitable for us over the life of the deal. We said that because we expected to negotiate higher affiliate fees for airing March Madness games on TNT, TBS and Turner. We're just starting that process. It will take a couple of years to complete. Recently, we successfully completed our first deals with distributors that include the values that we were seeking for this program. And we had very constructive conversations with many of our other affiliates too, so I'm even more confident today about the profit potential of the NCAA deal than we were when we signed. 
This quarter, we continue to make progress with our deployment of TV Everywhere at both Turner and HBO. The past 2 years, we've been primarily focused on getting TV Everywhere up and running technically. Now we're turning to the next phase, increasing awareness and making it easy for consumers to use. Turner now has TV Everywhere versions of its networks available to 70 million U.S. households, and we expect to reach about 80 million by the end of the year. 
In addition through authenticated websites for almost all our U.S. Networks, we've now rolled out iOS apps for our CNN, headline news, HLN, TBS, TNT through our Turner and Adult Swim. And we'll roll out versions for Android devices and several TV platforms by the end of the year. 
At HBO, we're excited by the early success of HBO GO. The mobile app has now been downloaded almost 5 million times. HBO subscribers using GO are watching substantially more HBO than they did before, and the user satisfaction is through the roof. Users are spending the vast majority of their time watching HBO's original program, which continues to set the standard for the television industry. That was evident in September when HBO won more primetime Emmys than any other network for the 10th straight year. We're continuing to launch new platforms and feature enhancements. For instance, HBO GO will be available on this week and we're soon to file on Xbox. 
In this quarter, we launched MAX GO for mobile devices. I'm also happy to report that we've made a lot of progress with the 2 major affiliates who don't yet have agreements. I'm hopeful for their sake, they'll be up and running for the next few months. 
Turning to our Publishing business. Like our other divisions, Time Inc. is pushing the digital evolution of its businesses more aggressively than any other in the same publisher. It's the only publisher committed to launching tablet versions of its entire domestic portfolio, and it's the only publisher designing content specifically for each device. We'll be launching tablet versions of at least one magazine every week between now and the end of the year. Early results are very encouraging with hundreds of thousands of print subscribers authenticating across the titles we've launched so far. As I said at the outset, we had another great quarter both financially and strategically. 
Across the company, we are focused on increasing our output of high-quality content and leading the evolution of new business models that give consumers what they want and where it's economically attractive for us. As we aim to do every quarter, we made a lot of progress on both fronts, which makes me very confident about how we're positioned for 2012 and beyond. 
I'll now turn it over to John."

I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. 3/4 of the way through the year, we're really pleased with how we've executed against our goals for investment, growth and returns.",2355,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. 3/4 of the way through the year, we're really pleased with how we've executed against our goals for investment, growth and returns. Our plan involves some significant investments in the first half of the year, which we told you would result in growth being more back-end weighted for 2011, and you could see this with our strong results this third quarter. 
Revenue was up double digits, and that's the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2007. And adjusted operating income was up 18% year-over-year. Now that translated to a very strong 27% growth in adjusted EPS, and we can't do it every quarter. These results are consistent with our long-term goal of growing operating income faster than revenue and growing earnings per share faster than operating income. 
During the quarter, we also continued to generate significant free cash flow increasing our conversion to 60% of adjusted OIBDA. And as Jeff noted, we've increased our direct returns to shareholders. We repurchased about $1.4 billion of our shares since we last reported earnings, and we paid about $250 million in dividends during the quarter. So in light of this strong performance and confidence that it will continue through the fourth quarter, we've raised our 2011 outlook for adjusted EPS to grow in the high teens.
Now let me move to a discussion of our segments. Let me begin with our Networks, where we saw another quarter of really good revenue growth. Advertising revenues were up 9%. Our domestic entertainment Networks, including kids and young adults, grew Advertising mid-single digits, and domestic news grew high single digits. That reflected strong ratings momentum at CNN and Adult Swim and as expected, softer ratings at TNT and TBS. 
International Advertising grew over 30% in the quarter, helped by a couple of transactions, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. If you look through those, international Advertising revenues were up in the high single digits, which admittedly was a little lighter than we expected. Let me provide a little bit more context as to what's happening here. 
We're continuing to see very strong performance from our Latin American operations, which have become a key growth driver internationally for us. By way of context, it's a very profitable business for us with margins closer to the levels that we have here in the U.S. And by our estimate, we are now the largest Cable program in Latin America. We also saw solid growth in our European businesses but it was a bit lower than we had anticipated going into the quarter. And our results have not been as strong as we'd like in India where ratings in Advertising from our largest entertainment network have been somewhat disappointing. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Turner is seeing similar Advertising trends as it did in the third quarter. The cancellation of NBA games should reduce growth by about 200 to 300 basis points in the quarter. We're also lapping an international acquisition that we made in the fourth quarter of last year. So we expect Advertising growth on a reported basis to be in the mid-single digits. 
Now for planning purposes, we're assuming here that there will be no NBA games in the fourth quarter, and while that will negative impact that I just said on Advertising, there would also be an offsetting reduction in programming expenses. So the impact to adjusted operating income from the lost games in the fourth quarter should be relatively immaterial. 
In terms of the scatter market, I just know generally that pricing is up high single to low double digits over the recent upfront. Moving over to Subscription revenues now for a moment in the quarter, they're up 6% year-over-year. As is often the case, there were some retroactive adjustments in the third quarter of this year, excuse me, the third quarter of both this year and last year, but together had the impact of reducing growth by about 100 basis points. As we look ahead, we expect Subscription growth to be in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, and that's due to similar adjustments, as well as some headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar and recent modest declines in U.S. multi-channel subscribers. 
For all of 2011, we continue to expect underlying Subscription revenue growth to be in the high single digit to Turner and in the mid-single digits at HBO. And while the quarters can certainly bounce around from a variety of reasons, those expectations that I just communicated are consistent with what we have coming into the year.
Adjusted operating income was down at the Networks group, 4% in the quarter, and that's largely due to 2 factors, both of which were highlighted on our second quarter earnings call. The first was programming and marketing expenses were up double digits in the quarter, and that was partly due to the timing of our sports programming, including the Major League Baseball playoffs and NASCAR. Second, recall that in last year's third quarter, we booked a $58 million reversal of a litigation reserve. That cost us 500 basis points of growth in this quarter. Please keep in mind for the full year, our programming expenses are turning pretty much exactly as we had expected. And excluding the NCAA Basketball Tournament, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we continue to anticipate programming expenses to be up mid-single digits this year.
As we look to the fourth quarter, some of the timing issues that worked against us this quarter in the third quarter should actually turnaround and work in our favor. So we expect programming expenses to be about flat year-over-year. And again, for planning purposes here, we're assuming that there will be no NBA games played in the quarter. As a result, we expect the fourth quarter to be by far our strongest of the year at the Networks group in terms of growth and adjusted operating income. 
Now let me turn to Film where Warner Bros. had its best quarter ever. Revenue was up nearly 20%, and profits more than doubled to a record of more than $0.5 billion. These strong results were principally a result of the theatrical release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 and the Syndication sales of The Big Bang Theory. The incredible success of these properties underscores our view that the biggest hits are actually increasing in value, and we think the strong theatrical performance of the final Harry Potter movie bodes well for its upcoming home video release in the fourth quarter. 
The Big Bang Theory was made available for both broadcast and Cable syndications starting in September and was the principal driver of the more than 20% growth in our television revenue at this division in the quarter. And given the continued strong ratings of the show on broadcast, we anticipate that it will be a strong contributor to the profitability of the studio for many years to come. 
Our Home Video revenue declined in the quarter, but that was mainly due to a lighter release slate. Our biggest title from a year ago was Clash of the Titans, and we didn't have anything of a similar large release in this year's quarter. It is worth noting, however, that for the industry, we estimate total U.S. home entertainment consumer sales were up almost 4% in the third quarter, which is an encouraging improvement from recent trends.
We anticipate a significant improvement in Home Video revenue for us in the fourth quarter as a result of a strong slate that includes the final Harry Potter film, The Hangover Part 2, Green Lantern and Horrible Bosses. The fourth quarter will also benefit from a strong slate of video games headlined by Batman Arkham City, which has been the best reviewed game of the year and shipped almost 5 million units at launch. And we should also see a nice lift from the SVOD deal that we recently struck and announced with Netflix for CW programming. And we're looking forward to the fourth quarter theatrical releases of Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2: A Game of Shadows. So the fourth quarter should be another very, very strong quarter for us in terms of profits here, and we remain very confident that 2011 will be a record year for Warner Bros. 
Moving over to Publishing, where in the third quarter, Advertising revenues declined reflecting lower domestic print Advertising. These results were also continuing to be negatively affected by something we've mentioned to you in the past. It's the transfer of the management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner, as well as the divestiture of titles in IPC. And if you would exclude these items, overall ad revenue was essentially flat this quarter. 
Subscription revenues were also almost flat, and that was a result of continued softness at newsstand, particularly for the celebrity category, and that's offsetting an improvement in domestic Subscription. Operating income declined in the quarter, and that was a function of both the modest decline in revenue and an increase in expenses resulting partly from higher paper costs. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we do not see a significant change in top line trends. The good news is that pay Advertising market appears to have stabilized. Much of the softness that occurred in the third quarter happened in July in the run up in the U.S. debt ceiling deadline, and trends actually improved somewhat in August and September. So we don't anticipate seeing a further deterioration relative to the third quarter, which is good. 
We do expect Subscription revenue to remain under pressure at the newsstand due to continued softness in the celebrity category, but expenses should also benefit in the fourth quarter from the favorable comparison relative to its restructuring charge last year. So we anticipate a return to growth in adjusted operating income at Publishing in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the next slide, which just highlights our outlook. We're very encouraged by our results for the first 9 months of the year, and our execution gives us confidence to raise our full year outlook as I mentioned earlier. We came into this year thinking that it would be a really good year, and it's been better than we expected. We're on track to grow revenue more than $2 billion this year, and we now expect high teens growth in adjusted EPS. That's particularly notable coming on the heels of about 30% growth in adjusted EPS to both 2009 and 2010. 
I think it's also important to point out that we've been able to do this even though, as what usually happens, not everything has worked perfectly this year. For instance, TBS and TNT ratings have been softer than we anticipated. Green Lantern underperformed our expectations. The home video industry has remained soft, and our largest entertainment network in India has struggled. And, of course, we've been operating against a relatively difficult backdrop of slowing economic growth and stagnant multichannel household formation. 
But we've been able to more than offset all of that due to strong results from CNN, Adult Swim and our sports properties, the outperformance of the rest of our theatricals slate and a great year from our Television Production unit. Broadly speaking, I think our performance is a testament to the strength and the diversity of our revenue streams, and it gives us great confidence in our growth outlook as we look beyond 2011. 
Turning to the next slide, which quickly details free cash flow. Year-to-date through the first 3 quarters, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash with the vast majority of that coming in the third quarter. As we anticipated, conversion remains a little down compared to the year ago, year-to-date first 9 months. And that's largely a result of higher working capital requirements from planned increases in production spending at Warner Bros. and HBO. However, our conversion increased during the quarter, and we fully expect to see our rate of conversion move up next year. We've been talking about that all year. 
And the next slide, which is the last slide, provides a net debt reconciliation. We ended the quarter with about $15.3 billion in net debt. That's an increase of about $2.4 billion compared to the end of last year, and that's largely due to the continued direct returns to shareholders that we've been providing. We returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter, and that includes over $1.1 billion in share repurchases. We also bought back another $584 million of stock subsequent to the end of the quarter. And as I noted earlier, that's an acceleration in the pace of our returns to shareholders relative to recent quarters. So year-to-date, we have returned more than $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends. That helped fund activity while maintaining a strong liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. We recently issued $1 billion in long-term debt, and we were able to do that at very, very attractive rates. 
I'd also note that year-to-date, we've spent about $300 million on M&A activity. We didn't have any significant acquisitions that occurred in the third quarter. Our leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter is about 2.3x. That's down a little bit from the second quarter, but up from around 2x at the end of 2010. Given the pace of our cash generation and share repurchases, we are on track to be closer to our target leverage of 2.5x by year end. We continue to believe that 2.5x strikes the right balance of maintaining balance sheet strength while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. So with only one quarter left in the year, we are very pleased with our progress to date, and we are confident that we will achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives.

And I guess the question is are you going to take baby steps with SVOD or a giant leap? And what I mean by that is you got a lot of TV shows that could have outsized strategic value to online distributors sort of list friends and so on. And so I guess first do you actually control the licensing for Seinfeld or is that at Sony? And then second again, as you sort of think, you sort of want to position 2012 for all of us, should we be thinking about potential for a full library deal or is this something where we should think that you're going to take baby steps? And then for John, I'm just curious if the amortization for television programming is changing now that the online SVOD window's getting locked in. So do you spend less upfront and more later in the show, which could help TV production profitability in the short term?"

On the opportunity, you're quite right about because Warners is so big about what we've got for online and a number of distributors: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and others. But a big one, I don't -- we've never taken a baby step with anything. We did not recently take baby steps. We were not reticent or slow to do any of that. It was all the way we were planning to enforce and increase value of all our programming to all our distributors, including new SVOD-type distributors. So the recent deals are pretty big. We're happy to do big deals. We just want them to fit into the support of the other gigantic deals that we do every month with traditional Networks. So there's plenty of room for us to do more deals out of our giant library of film and TV and not just from Warners but some of our other programming that we make. The people that want to buy it can afford it."

On international, I don't think I understand your question. Our international Networks are growing pretty fast. And as we've said before between HBO and Turner, we think we can double the operating income over the next 3 to 4 years, and they're already making $0.5 billion. They're very different assets from what Discovery does. They're in different markets.

I think -- let me say a few things about that. There's been a lot of speculation about the strength of acquired series on whichever Cable Networks have them. And basically, I think you're right off with that. If you have acquired series, th",547,"Yes, possibly. I think -- let me say a few things about that. There's been a lot of speculation about the strength of acquired series on whichever Cable Networks have them. And basically, I think you're right off with that. If you have acquired series, they do tend to decline into somewhat predictable way over time. One question asked are they declining faster? No, if you look across the various Networks not just ours. Secondly, what has been happening is a bit of an up-and-down supply of high-quality series, acquired series that our hits on broadcast. That could be ours. There's been a dearth of half, half hours which is about to turn around because the Networks have a lot more of them on. So we think that on the acquired series side, there's a fair amount of value, and it may not go down. It may go up. As those series get scheduled with some critical mass on big reach Cable Networks that offer them on demand. And remember, those kind of series will not be available on demand anywhere else. So that's the kind of good news on the longevity of acquired series. If we're all sitting here saying hey, the bids are going up and the value is going up on series programming over the Lifetime, which we've all seen in these deals, then that means that the value on whichever outlet puts them on is also sustainable not declining. Having said that, we've all seen for years in both Turner and HBO have been leaders in that original series can be very important and very significant in terms of CPMs, branding the Networks, content sale profits. And you get big hits, we've had them on HBO, we've got them now on TNT. That's very important value to the network and even content earnings for those kind of shows. When the issue gets to be one of mix, we think Time Warner is in a very advantaged place versus our competition because we make more of these hit shows hours and half hour and sell it to all Networks. We're the only series supplier coming out of Warners that has shows on all 4 broadcast Networks, and we not only have a show on all of them, we have 3 shows on all of them. So that's a fantastic business if you think about it at Warners side. The fact that we didn't have 2 big reach Networks at TBS and TNT, the pick and support whichever of those become really valuable and to put them on an on-demand offering to support the TNT, TBS brands alongside of high-value sports, alongside of high-value original series gives us a huge advantage and a tremendous platform and schedule in which to launch original series. So to finish, the obvious thing, you've seen it at HBO, you'll see it increasing at TNT, TBS is to have hit original series on those Networks as well. And we'll see about how many -- if you take the balance of what acquired series are there, what originals were there, you'd like to increase the originals, and that'll probably happen unless there's so many value relative coming off acquired broadcast that those that's kind of a balance between those 2 things."

Adjusted operating income c",2014,"Thanks, Doug, and thanks for joining us this morning. This was a great quarter for us financially and strategically, led by a fantastic performance from our studio. Revenue was up 11%. That's our fastest growth rate in 4 years. Adjusted operating income climbed 18%, and adjusted EPS was up 27%. Over the last few months, we took advantage of the attractive value of our stock and increased the pace of our repurchases. We bought back $3.7 billion of our stock so far this year, more than double the pace at this time last year.
Following the strong results this quarter, we've raised our expectations for full year adjusted EPS to growth in the high teens. That means we're on track and have doubled our earnings over the past 3 years. It's a testament to the strength of our assets and management depth that we've been able to produce these results during such an uncertain time for the economy and such a period of considerable change for our industry.
Let me put some context around our performance this quarter, and then John will walk you through our results in detail. We believe it's clear that technology and globalization are increasing the demand for high-quality content. As the right business models develop, we believe the value of this content is growing, and we think we're positioned to be one of the chief beneficiaries of these trends.
So to take advantage of this, we've invested and we'll continue to invest aggressively to create and acquire even more great content, and we're pushing hard to develop new business models that enhance the consumer experience in a way that supports our economics.
We made progress toward both these goals this quarter. At Warner Bros. film division, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 grossed $1.3 billion at the box office globally, making it the third-highest grossing film ever. The 8 Harry Potter films have now grossed $7.7 billion globally, making it far and away the most successful film series in history. Of course, that's a credit to JK Rowling's brilliant story. It also underscores Warner Bros. unequaled ability to create and manage film franchises.
While this was the last film in the series, the Harry Potter franchise will endure in a variety of ways for a long time. As just one example, next spring, we'll open the making of Harry Potter attraction at our studio outside London, coinciding with the 2012 London Olympics. We'll give visitors a unique behind-the-scenes look at the productions on the actual sets. Advance tickets just went on sale, and they have blown away our expectations.
Although Harry Potter overshadowed just about everything in the film world this quarter, it wasn't all about the Harry at Warner Bros. Contagion and Horrible Bosses were also very strong performers, and we're set up for a strong finish to the year with the sequels to Happy Feet and Sherlock Holmes coming later this quarter.
We're also enjoying fantastic momentum at Warner Bros. Television Production arm. The growth prospects for TV content have never been better, and Warner is in the pole position to benefit. The big story this quarter was the initial syndication of The Big Bang Theory. A hit show like Big Bang can be a tremendous asset to us across the company. For Warner Bros. it generates significant license fees and ongoing barter revenue, and for Turner, it's a critical part of the lineup at TBS, as I'll discuss in a moment.
Plus looking out over the next few years, our syndication pipeline is building. We've had a great start to the new broadcast network season for both our biggest returning shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, Mike & Molly and for several of our new shows, especially 2 Broke Girls, Suburgatory and Person of Interest. Reflect on this list for a moment. We've never had so many successful comedies on the air at one time. For all the change in the TV business in the last decade, the holy grail of TV production is still a hit 30-minute comedy. Not only do successful comedies fetch substantial prices in syndication, they can run for multiple cycles and become multibillion dollar annuities. And we've got 4 of the top 7 on all of television.
Over the last few weeks, we've also struck a couple of game-changing deals at The CW with both Netflix and Hulu. Historically, our stake in The CW has been profitable for us because it's a valuable platform for launching new shows. These deals substantially improve the economics of The CW. At the same time, they are great examples of how new distribution outlets can be additive to the traditional TV ecosystem. Many of the shows on The CW target a very specific demographic, and they are serialized, making them tough to syndicate through traditional networks. But they're a perfect fit for SVOD providers like Netflix and Hulu.
In recent months, Warner has also made further progress toward improving the value proposition of owning digital movies. Its home entertainment transitions to digital distribution, we think it's critical to make it more compelling and easier for consumers to buy digital movies and to manage their collections. That's why we've been a big supporter of the UltraViolet initiative, to allow consumers to access their movies from the cloud on a wide variety of devices in and out of the home.
And to help kickstart the process, we bought Flixster, which is the first service to allow consumers to access a UV title. Over time, we expect to see many more UV services launch. In August, we launched the beta of Flixster's collection management service, and we subsequently released the first 2 UltraViolet titles: Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern. We're really happy with the early results, and we expect UltraViolet to gain traction in the coming year as more UV titles are released and many more retail partners rollout their own UV services. In the coming months, we intend to steadily add new features to Flixster. For instance, we'll add a movie starter kit that will give consumers a choice of a complementary digital movie when they create a new UV account. We will open a studio agnostic storefront, and we'll introduce a disk to digital service that will allow consumers to convert their physical DVD collections into digital copies. We'll also keep adding new devices and platforms.
I'll now move over to our Networks business. At Turner this quarter, we again saw strong performance from the original programming at our big entertainment networks. Most notably, Falling Skies on TNT was the #1 new film of the year, while returning shows, Rizzoli & Isles and The Closer, remain the top 2 scripted shows on Cable. We're also confident that the ratings for our acquired programming will improve as we refresh our lineup with new hit shows, the first of which is The Big Bang Theory on TBS.
So after a great start so far, it's only been on the regular schedule for 2 weeks, but it's significantly outperforming the programming that was previously in its time slot, and that's providing a boost to other parts of the TBS schedule, including Conan. Just as important, we think Big Bang will prove to be a great platform for launching original comedies, which you'll see more of in the coming year. So not only should we see a big improvement in TBS ratings in the fourth quarter, we're also excited about the opportunity to drive growth in 2012 and beyond.
CNN had another very strong quarter with ratings up more than 30% in its key demo, dramatically outpacing its cable news competitors again. It's further evidence that more viewers turn to CNN than anywhere else when news breaks. Importantly, we're also seeing the payoff from some of our recent lineup changes with both Anderson Cooper's AC 360 and Piers Morgan Tonight up double digits. With our coverage of the Republican primary debates already breaking audience records on CNN, we think we're really well positioned heading into the 2012 election season.
We also benefited from strong performance at some of our faster growing network, as both truTV and Adult Swim posted their most watched third quarters ever in their key demos. As you all know, Turner's revenue is split between advertising and affiliate fees. So growing ratings is important for our ad sales effort. But to bolster our affiliate fees, it's also important to schedule high-profile programming like sports. That's why we acquired the rights to the NCAA men's basketball tournament. When we announced this NCAA deal, we told you that we expect that it would be significantly profitable for us over the life of the deal. We said that because we expected to negotiate higher affiliate fees for airing March Madness games on TNT, TBS and Turner. We're just starting that process. It should take a couple of years to complete. But recently, we successfully completed our first deals with distributors that include the values that we were seeking for this program. And we've had very constructive conversations with many of our other affiliates too, so I'm even more confident today about the profit potential of the NCAA deal than we were when we signed it.
This quarter, we continue to make progress with our deployment of TV Everywhere at both Turner and HBO. For the past 2 years, we've been primarily focused on getting TV Everywhere up and running technically. Now we're turning to the next phase, increasing awareness and making it easy for consumers to use. Turner now has TV Everywhere versions of its networks available to 70 million U.S. households, and we expect to reach about 80 million by the end of the year.
In addition to authenticated websites for almost all our key U.S. networks, we've now rolled out iOS apps for our CNN, Headline News, HLN, TBS, TNT, tru, Cartoon and Adult Swim. And we'll roll out versions for Android devices and several TV platforms by the end of the year.
At HBO, we're excited by the early success of HBO GO. The mobile app has now been downloaded almost 5 million times. HBO subscribers using GO are watching substantially more HBO than they did before, and the user satisfaction is through the roof. Users are spending the vast majority of their time watching HBO's original program, which continues to set the standard for the television industry. That was evident in September when HBO won more primetime Emmys than any other network for the 10th straight year. We're continuing to launch new platforms and feature enhancements. For instance, HBO GO will be available on row[ph] this week and is soon to follow on the Xbox.
In this quarter, we launched MAX GO for mobile devices. I'm also happy to report that we've made a lot of progress with the 2 major affiliates who don't yet have authentication agreements. I'm hopeful for their sake, they'll be up and running in the next few months.
Turning to our Publishing business. Like our other divisions, Time Inc. is pushing the digital evolution of its businesses more aggressively than any other magazine publisher. It's the only publisher committed to launching tablet versions of its entire domestic portfolio, and it's the only publisher designing content specifically for each device. We'll be launching tablet versions of at least one magazine every week between now and the end of the year. Early results are very encouraging with hundreds of thousands of print subscribers authenticating across the titles we've launched so far. As I said at the outset, we had another great quarter both financially and strategically.
Across the company, we are focused on increasing our output of high-quality content and leading the evolution of new business models that give consumers what they want and where it's economically attractive for us. As we aim to do every quarter, we made a lot of progress on both fronts, which makes me very confident about how we're positioned for 2012 and beyond.
I'll now turn it over to John."
24689,141044815,183091,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. 3/4 of the way through the year, we're really pleased with how we've executed against our goals for investment, growth and returns.",2367,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. 3/4 of the way through the year, we're really pleased with how we've executed against our goals for investment, growth and returns. Our plan involves some significant investments in the first half of the year, which we told you would result in growth being more back end weighted for 2011, and you could see this with our strong results this third quarter.
Revenue was up double digits, and that's the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2007. And adjusted operating income was up 18% year-over-year. Now that's translated to a very strong 27% growth in adjusted EPS, and we can't do it every quarter. But these results are consistent with our long-term goal of growing operating income faster than revenue, and growing earnings per share faster than operating income.
During the quarter, we also continued to generate significant free cash flow, increasing our conversion to 60% of adjusted OIBDA. And as Jeff noted, we've increased our direct returns to shareholders. We repurchased about $1.4 billion of our shares since we last reported earnings, and we paid about $250 million in dividends during the quarter. So in light of this strong performance and confidence that it will continue through the fourth quarter, we've raised our 2011 outlook for adjusted EPS to grow in the high teens.
Now let me move to a discussion of our segments. Let me begin with our Networks, where we saw another quarter of really good revenue growth. Advertising revenues were up 9%. Our domestic entertainment networks, including kids and young adults, grew advertising mid-single digits, and domestic news grew high single digits. That reflected strong ratings momentum at CNN and Adult Swim and as expected, softer ratings at TNT and TBS.
International advertising grew over 30% in the quarter, helped by a couple of transactions, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. If you look through those, international advertising revenues were up in the high single digits, which admittedly was a little lighter than we had expected. Let me provide a little bit more context as to what's happening here.
We're continuing to see very strong performance from our Latin American operations, which have become a key growth driver internationally for us. By way of context, it's a very profitable business for us with margins closer to the levels that we have here in the U.S. And by our estimate, we are now the largest cable programmer in Latin America. We also saw solid growth in our European businesses, but it was a bit lower than we had anticipated going into the quarter. And our results have not been as strong as we'd like in India, where ratings and advertising for our largest entertainment network have been somewhat disappointing.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Turner is seeing similar advertising trends as it did in the third quarter. But the cancellation of NBA games should reduce growth by about 200 to 300 basis points in the quarter. We're also lapping an international acquisition that we made in the fourth quarter of last year. So we expect advertising growth on a reported basis to be in the mid-single digits.
Now for planning purposes, we are assuming here that there will be no NBA games in the fourth quarter, and while that would have the negative impact that I just said on advertising, there will also be an offsetting reduction in programming expenses. So the impact to adjusted operating income from the lost games in the fourth quarter should be relatively immaterial.
In terms of the scatter market, I just know generally that pricing is up high single to low double digits over the recent upfront. Moving over to Subscription revenues now for a moment in the quarter, they're up 6% year-over-year. As is often the case, there were some retroactive adjustments in the third quarter of this year, excuse me, the third quarter of both this year and last year, but together had the impact of reducing growth by about 100 basis points. As we look ahead, we expect subscription growth to be in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, and that's due to similar adjustments, as well as some headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar and recent modest declines in U.S. multi-channel subscribers.
For all of 2011, we continue to expect underlying Subscription revenue growth to be in the high single digits at Turner and in the mid-single digits at HBO. And while the quarters can certainly bounce around from a variety of reasons, those expectations that I just communicated are consistent with what we have coming into the year.
Adjusted operating income was down at the Networks group, 4% in the quarter, and that's largely due to 2 factors, both of which were highlighted on our second quarter earnings call. The first is programming and marketing expenses were up double digits in the quarter, and that was partly due to the timing of our sports programming, including the Major League Baseball playoffs and NASCAR. Second, recall that in last year's third quarter, we booked a $58 million reversal of a litigation reserve. That cost us 500 basis points of growth in this quarter. Please keep in mind for the full year, our programming expenses are trending pretty much exactly as we had expected. And excluding the NCAA Basketball Tournament, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we continue to anticipate programming expenses to be up mid-single digits this year.
As we look to the fourth quarter, some of the timing issues that worked against us this quarter in the third quarter should actually turnaround and work in our favor. So we expect programming expenses to be about flat year-over-year. And again, for planning purposes here, we're assuming that there will be no NBA games played in the quarter. As a result, we expect the fourth quarter to be by far our strongest of the year at the Networks group in terms of growth and adjusted operating income.
Now let me turn to film where Warner Bros. had its best quarter ever. Revenue was up nearly 20%, and profits more than doubled to a record of more than $0.5 billion. These strong results were principally a result of the theatrical release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 and the syndication sale of The Big Bang Theory. The incredible success of these properties underscores our view that the biggest hits are actually increasing in value, and we think the strong theatrical performance of the final Harry Potter movie bodes well for its upcoming home video release in the fourth quarter.
The Big Bang Theory was made available for both broadcast and cable syndications starting in September and was the principal driver of the more than 20% growth in our television revenue at this division in the quarter. And given the continued strong ratings of the show on broadcast, we anticipate that it will be a strong contributor to the profitability of the studio for many years to come.
Our Home Video revenue declined in the quarter, but that was mainly due to a lighter release slate. Our biggest title from a year ago was Clash of the Titans, and we didn't have anything of a similar large release in this year's quarter. It is worth noting, however, that for the industry, we estimate total U.S. home entertainment consumer sales were up almost 4% in the third quarter, which is an encouraging improvement from recent trends.
We anticipate a significant improvement in Home Video revenue for us in the fourth quarter as a result of a strong slate that includes the final Harry Potter film, The Hangover Part II, Green Lantern and Horrible Bosses. The fourth quarter will also benefit from a strong slate of video games headlined by Batman: Arkham City, which has been the best reviewed game of the year and shipped almost 5 million units at launch. And we should also see a nice lift from the SVOD deal that we recently struck and announced with Netflix for CW programming. And we're looking forward to the fourth quarter theatrical releases of Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2: A Game of Shadows. So the fourth quarter should be another very, very strong quarter for us in terms of profits here, and we remain very confident that 2011 will be a record year for Warner Bros.
Moving over to Publishing, where in the third quarter, Advertising revenues declined reflecting lower domestic print advertising. These results were also continuing to be negatively affected by something we've mentioned to you in the past. It's the transfer of the management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner, as well as the divestiture of titles in IPC. And if you would exclude these items, overall ad revenue was essentially flat in the quarter.
Subscription revenues were also almost flat, and that was a result of continued softness at newsstand, particularly for the celebrity category, and that's offsetting an improvement in domestic subscriptions. Operating income declined in the quarter, and that was a function of both the modest decline in revenue and an increase in expenses resulting partly from higher paper costs.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we do not see a significant change in top line trends. The good news is that print advertising market appears to have stabilized. Much of the softness that occurred in the third quarter happened in July in the run up to the U.S. debt ceiling deadline, and trends actually improved somewhat in August and September. So we don't anticipate seeing a further deterioration relative to the third quarter, which is good.
We do expect Subscription revenue to remain under pressure at the newsstand due to continued softness in the celebrity category, but expenses should also benefit in the fourth quarter from a favorable comparison relative to its restructuring charge last year. So we anticipate a return to growth in adjusted operating income at Publishing in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the next slide, which just highlights our outlook. We're very encouraged by our results for the first 9 months of the year, and our execution gives us confidence to raise our full year outlook as I mentioned earlier. We came into this year thinking that it would be a really good year, and it's been better than we expected. We're on track to grow revenue more than $2 billion this year, and we now expect high teens growth in adjusted EPS. That's particularly notable coming on the heels of about 30% growth in adjusted EPS in both 2009 and 2010.
I think it's also important to point out that we've been able to do this even though, as what usually happens, not everything has worked perfectly this year. For instance, TBS and TNT ratings have been softer than we anticipated. Green Lantern underperformed our expectations. The home video industry has remained soft, and our largest channel entertainment network in India has struggled. And, of course, we've been operating against a relatively difficult backdrop of slowing economic growth and a stagnant multichannel household formation.
But we've been able to more than offset all of that due to strong results from CNN, Adult Swim and our sports properties, the outperformance of the rest of our theatrical slate and a great year from our Television Production unit. Broadly speaking, I think our performance is a testament to the strength and the diversity of our revenue streams, and it gives us great confidence in our growth outlook as we look beyond 2011.
Turning to the next slide, which quickly details free cash flow. Year-to-date through the first 3 quarters, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash, with the vast majority of that coming in the third quarter. As we anticipated, conversion remains a little down compared to the year ago, year-to-date first 9 months. And that's largely a result of higher working capital requirements from planned increases in production spending at Warner Bros. and HBO. However, our conversion increased during the quarter, and we fully expect to see our rate of conversion move up next year. We've been talking about that all year.
And the next slide, which is the last slide, provides a net debt reconciliation. We ended the quarter with about $15.3 billion in net debt. That's an increase of about $2.4 billion compared to the end of last year, and that's largely due to the continued direct returns to shareholders that we've been providing. We returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter, and that includes over $1.1 billion in share repurchases. We also bought back another $584 million of stock subsequent to the end of the quarter. And as I noted earlier, that's an acceleration in the pace of our returns to shareholders relative to recent quarters. So year-to-date, we have returned more than $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends. And to help fund that activity while maintaining strong liquidity and balance sheet flexibility, we recently issued $1 billion in long-term debt, and we were able to do that at very, very attractive rates.
I'd also note that year-to-date, we've spent about $300 million on M&A activity. We didn't have any significant acquisitions that occurred in the third quarter. Our leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter is about 2.3x. That's down a little bit from the second quarter, but up from around 2x at the end of 2010. Given the pace of our cash generation and share repurchases, we are on track to be closer to our target leverage of 2.5x by year end. And we continue to believe that 2.5x strikes the right balance of maintaining balance sheet strength while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. So with only one quarter left in the year, we are very pleased with our progress to date, and we are confident that we will achieve our capital planned priorities and objectives.
Now let me end there and turn the call back over to Doug who will start the Q&A portion."

Is that we always thought there was a role for Netflix and other library SVOD services in the ecosystem. It provides everyone a new way, provides us another way to monetize our concept, which is good. It gives consumers access to content they couldn't easily get before like older and serialized shows. So it can be very good for consumers because they weren't really getting those or would have trouble getting them on a VOD basis. For our studio, what that does is it monetizes some content, particularly the serialized and older series better than it was monetized before. So it adds money to the ecosystem. There's some differences because of the nature of what Netflix is and what Hulu is about how both of those work. But basically each of them is consistent and does not impinge upon the economics and value of the other kind of traditional networks. Not to get too specific, the economics of The CW and Netflix deal, The CW to Netflix deal is basically good for both of us, just think -- did I answer your question or is there a little more dimension to what you're looking for?"

But for shows that might not be a great fit for traditional buyers of syndicated programming, particularly serialized stuff, and depending on the demographic appeal, it may make sense to licensed those before even the traditional syndication window because the traditional syndication window for some of those shows, think of The CW shows we licensed to Hulu and to Netflix, actually fit that description.

And there's no trend problem or issue there. For HBO, basically the sub volumes are also related to multichannel sub growth because HBO is in most, pretty much all of the packages for pay TV other than the ones where our distributor is giving away free subs. So those have been pretty stable on the volume side and the HBO issue on paying subs had to do with the mix between which affiliates were above or below benchmarks. It's a little arcane. The general fact there is the revenues have been very smooth and increasing because the basic paying sub base is strong and stable and growing, and the affiliate rates abilities at both Turner and HBO are steady and strong.

I think -- let me say a few things about that. There's been a lot of speculation about the strength of acquired series on whichever cable networks have them. And basically, I think you're right off with that. If you have acquired series, th",551,"Yes, possibly. I think -- let me say a few things about that. There's been a lot of speculation about the strength of acquired series on whichever cable networks have them. And basically, I think you're right off with that. If you have acquired series, they do tend to decline into somewhat predictable way over time. One question asked, are they declining faster? No, if you look across the various networks not just ours. Secondly, what has been happening is a bit of an up-and-down supply of high-quality series, acquired series that are hits on broadcast. That could be ours. There's been a dearth of half, half hours which is about to turn around because the networks have a lot more of them on. So we think that on the acquired series side, there's a fair amount of value, and it may not go down. It may go up. As those series get scheduled with some critical mass on big reach cable networks that offer them on demand. And remember, those kind of series will not be available on demand anywhere else. So that's the kind of good news on the longevity of acquired series. If we're all sitting here saying, hey, the bids are going up and the value is going up on series programming over the lifetime, which we've all seen in these deals, then that means that the value on whichever outlet puts them on is also sustainable not declining. Having said that, we've all seen for years in both Turner and HBO have been leaders in that original series can be very important and very significant in terms of CPMs, branding the networks, content sale profits. And you get big hits, we've had them on HBO, we've got them now on TNT. That's very important value to the network and even content earnings for those kind of shows. So the issue gets to be one of mix, we think Time Warner is in a very advantaged place versus our competition because we make more of these hit shows, hours and half hour and sell them to all networks. We're the only series supplier coming out of Warners that has shows on all 4 broadcast networks, and we not only have a show on all of them, we have 3 shows or more on all of them. So that's a fantastic business if you think about it at the Warners side. The fact that we then have 2 big reach networks at TBS and TNT, to pick and support whichever of those become really valuable and to put them on an on-demand offering to support the TNT, TBS brands alongside of high-value sports, alongside of high-value original series gives us a huge advantage and a tremendous platform and schedule in which to launch original series. So to finish, the obvious thing, you've seen it at HBO, you'll see it increasing at TNT, TBS is to have hit original series on those networks as well. And we'll see about how many -- if you take the balance of what acquired series are there, what originals are there, you'd like to increase the originals, and that'll probably happen unless there's so many valuable hits relative coming off acquired broadcast that does, it's kind of a balance between those 2 things."

This was a great quarter for us financially and strategically, led by a fantastic performance from our studio. Revenue was up 11%. That's our fastest growth rate in 4 years. Adjusted operating income c",2016,"Thanks, Doug, and thanks for joining us this morning. This was a great quarter for us financially and strategically, led by a fantastic performance from our studio. Revenue was up 11%. That's our fastest growth rate in 4 years. Adjusted operating income climbed 18%, and adjusted EPS was up 27%. Over the last few months, we took advantage of the attractive value of our stock and increased the pace of our repurchases. We bought back $3.7 billion of our stock so far this year, more than double the pace at this time last year.
Following the strong results this quarter, we've raised our expectations for full year adjusted EPS to growth in the high teens. That means we're on track and have doubled our earnings over the past 3 years. It's a testament to the strength of our assets and management depth that we've been able to produce these results during such an uncertain time for the economy and such a period of considerable change for our industry.
Let me put some context around our performance this quarter, and then John will walk you through our results in detail. We believe it's clear that technology and globalization are increasing the demand for high-quality content. As the right business models develop, we believe the value of this content is growing, and we think we're positioned to be one of the chief beneficiaries of these trends.
So to take advantage of this, we've invested and we'll continue to invest aggressively to create and acquire even more great content, and we're pushing hard to develop new business models that enhance the consumer experience in a way that supports our economics.
We made progress toward both these goals this quarter. At Warner Bros. film division, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 grossed $1.3 billion at the box office globally, making it the third-highest grossing film ever. The 8 Harry Potter films have now grossed $7.7 billion globally, making it far and away the most successful film series in history. Of course, that's a credit to JK Rowling's brilliant story. But it also underscores Warner Bros. unequaled ability to create and manage film franchises.
While this was the last film in the series, the Harry Potter franchise will endure in a variety of ways for a long time. As just one example, next spring, we'll open the making of Harry Potter attraction at our studio outside London, coinciding with the 2012 London Olympics. We'll give visitors a unique behind-the-scenes look at the productions on the actual sets. Advance tickets just went on sale, and they have blown away our expectations.
Although Harry Potter overshadowed just about everything in the film world this quarter, it wasn't all about Harry at Warner Bros. Contagion and Horrible Bosses were also very strong performers, and we're set up for a strong finish to the year with the sequels to Happy Feet and Sherlock Holmes coming later this quarter.
We're also enjoying fantastic momentum at Warner Bros. Television Production arm. The growth prospects for TV content have never been better, and Warner is in the pole position to benefit. The big story this quarter was the initial syndication of The Big Bang Theory. A hit show like Big Bang can be a tremendous asset to us across the company. For Warner Bros. it generates significant license fees and ongoing barter revenue, and for Turner, it's a critical part of the new lineup at TBS, as I'll discuss in a moment.
Plus looking out over the next few years, our syndication pipeline is building. We've had a great start to the new broadcast network season for both our biggest returning shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, Mike & Molly and for several of our new shows, especially 2 Broke Girls, Suburgatory and Person of Interest. Reflect on this list for a moment. We've never had so many successful comedies on the air at one time. For all the change in the TV business in the last decade, the holy grail of TV production is still a hit 30-minute comedy. Not only do successful comedies fetch substantial prices in syndication, they can run for multiple cycles and become multibillion dollar annuities. And we've got 4 of the top 7 on all of television.
Over the last few weeks, we've also struck a couple of game-changing deals at The CW with both Netflix and Hulu. Historically, our stake in The CW has been profitable for us because it's a valuable platform for launching new shows. These deals substantially improve the economics of The CW. At the same time, they are great examples of how new distribution outlets can be additive to the traditional TV ecosystem. Many of the shows on The CW target a very specific demographic, and they are serialized, making them tough to syndicate through traditional networks. But they're a perfect fit for SVOD providers like Netflix and Hulu.
In recent months, Warner has also made further progress toward improving the value proposition of owning digital movies. Its home entertainment transitions to digital distribution, we think it's critical to make it more compelling and easier for consumers to buy digital movies and to manage their collections. That's why we've been a big supporter of the UltraViolet initiative, to allow consumers to access their movies from the cloud on a wide variety of devices in and out of the home.
And to help kickstart the process, we bought Flixster, which is the first service to allow consumers to access a UV title. Over time, we expect to see many more UV services launch. In August, we launched the beta of Flixster's collection management service, and we subsequently released the first 2 UltraViolet titles: Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern. We're really happy with the early results, and we expect UltraViolet to gain traction in the coming year as more UV titles are released and many more retail partners rollout their own UV services. In the coming months, we intend to steadily add new features to Flixster. For instance, we'll add a movie starter kit that will give consumers a choice of a complementary digital movie when they create a new UV account. We will open a studio agnostic storefront, and we'll introduce a disk to digital service that will allow consumers to convert their physical DVD collections into digital copies. We'll also keep adding new devices and platforms.
I'll now move over to our Networks business. At Turner this quarter, we again saw strong performance from the original programming at our big entertainment networks. Most notably, Falling Skies on TNT was the #1 new show of the year, while returning shows, Rizzoli & Isles and The Closer, remain the top 2 scripted shows on Cable. We're also confident that the ratings for our acquired programming will improve as we refresh our lineup with new hit shows, the first of which is The Big Bang Theory on TBS.
So after a great start so far, it's only been on the regular schedule for 2 weeks, but it's significantly outperforming the programming that was previously in its time slot, and that's providing a boost to other parts of the TBS schedule, including Conan. Just as important, we think Big Bang will prove to be a great platform for launching original comedies, which you'll see more of in the coming year. So not only should we see a big improvement in TBS ratings in the fourth quarter, we're also excited about the opportunity to drive growth in 2012 and beyond.
CNN had another very strong quarter with ratings up more than 30% in its key demo, dramatically outpacing its cable news competitors again. It's further evidence that more viewers turn to CNN than anywhere else when news breaks. Importantly, we're also seeing the payoff from some of our recent lineup changes with both Anderson Cooper's AC 360 and Piers Morgan Tonight up double digits. With our coverage of the Republican primary debates already breaking audience records on CNN, we think we're really well positioned heading into the 2012 election season.
We also benefited from strong performance at some of our faster growing network, as both truTV and Adult Swim posted their most watched third quarters ever in their key demos. As you all know, Turner's revenue is split between advertising and affiliate fees. So growing ratings is important for our ad sales effort. But to bolster our affiliate fees, it's also important to schedule high-profile programming like sports. That's why we acquired the rights to the NCAA men's basketball tournament. When we announced this NCAA deal, we told you that we expect that it would be significantly profitable for us over the life of the deal. We said that because we expected to negotiate higher affiliate fees for airing March Madness games on TNT, TBS and Turner. We're just starting that process. It should take a couple of years to complete. But recently, we successfully completed our first deals with distributors that include the values that we were seeking for this program. And we've had very constructive conversations with many of our other affiliates too, so I'm even more confident today about the profit potential of the NCAA deal than we were when we signed it.
This quarter, we continue to make progress with our deployment of TV Everywhere at both Turner and HBO. For the past 2 years, we've been primarily focused on getting TV Everywhere up and running technically. Now we're turning to the next phase, increasing awareness and making it easy for consumers to use. Turner now has TV Everywhere versions of its networks available to 70 million U.S. households, and we expect to reach about 80 million by the end of the year.
In addition to authenticated websites for almost all our key U.S. networks, we've now rolled out iOS apps for our CNN, Headline News, HLN, TBS, TNT, tru, Cartoon and Adult Swim. And we'll roll out versions for Android devices and several TV platforms by the end of the year.
At HBO, we're excited by the early success of HBO GO. The mobile app has now been downloaded almost 5 million times. HBO subscribers using GO are watching substantially more HBO than they did before, and the user satisfaction is through the roof. Users are spending the vast majority of their time watching HBO's original program, which continues to set the standard for the television industry. That was evident in September when HBO won more primetime Emmys than any other network for the 10th straight year. We're continuing to launch new platforms and feature enhancements. For instance, HBO GO will be available on Roku this week and is soon to follow on the Xbox.
In this quarter, we launched MAX GO for mobile devices. I'm also happy to report that we've made a lot of progress with the 2 major affiliates who don't yet have authentication agreements. I'm hopeful for their sake, they'll be up and running in the next few months.
Turning to our Publishing business. Like our other divisions, Time Inc. is pushing the digital evolution of its businesses more aggressively than any other magazine publisher. It's the only publisher committed to launching tablet versions of its entire domestic portfolio, and it's the only publisher designing content specifically for each device. We'll be launching tablet versions of at least one magazine every week between now and the end of the year. Early results are very encouraging with hundreds of thousands of print subscribers authenticating across the titles we've launched so far. As I said at the outset, we had another great quarter both financially and strategically.
Across the company, we are focused on increasing our output of high-quality content and leading the evolution of new business models that give consumers what they want in a way that's economically attractive for us. As we aim to do every quarter, we made a lot of progress on both fronts, which makes me very confident about how we're positioned for 2012 and beyond.
I'll now turn it over to John."
24689,141044815,183280,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2011",2011-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. 3/4 of the way through the year, we're really pleased with how we've executed against our goals for investment, growth and returns.",2366,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. 3/4 of the way through the year, we're really pleased with how we've executed against our goals for investment, growth and returns. Our plan involves some significant investments in the first half of the year, which we told you would result in growth being more back end weighted for 2011, and you could see this with our strong results this third quarter.
Revenue was up double digits, and that's the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2007. And adjusted operating income was up 18% year-over-year. Now that translated to a very strong 27% growth in adjusted EPS, and we can't do it every quarter. But these results are consistent with our long-term goal of growing operating income faster than revenue, and growing earnings per share faster than operating income.
During the quarter, we also continued to generate significant free cash flow, increasing our conversion to 60% of adjusted OIBDA. And as Jeff noted, we've increased our direct returns to shareholders. We repurchased about $1.4 billion of our shares since we last reported earnings, and we paid about $250 million in dividends during the quarter. So in light of this strong performance and confidence that it will continue through the fourth quarter, we've raised our 2011 outlook for adjusted EPS to grow in the high teens.
Now let me move to a discussion of our segments. Let me begin with our Networks, where we saw another quarter of really good revenue growth. Advertising revenues were up 9%. Our domestic entertainment networks, including kids and young adults, grew advertising mid-single digits, and domestic news grew high single digits. That reflected strong ratings momentum at CNN and Adult Swim and as expected, softer ratings at TNT and TBS.
International advertising grew over 30% in the quarter, helped by a couple of transactions, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. If you look through those, international advertising revenues were up in the high single digits, which admittedly was a little lighter than we had expected. Let me provide a little bit more context as to what's happening here.
We're continuing to see very strong performance from our Latin American operations, which have become a key growth driver internationally for us. By way of context, it's a very profitable business for us with margins closer to the levels that we have here in the U.S. And by our estimate, we are now the largest cable programmer in Latin America. We also saw solid growth in our European businesses, but it was a bit lower than we had anticipated going into the quarter. And our results have not been as strong as we'd like in India, where ratings and advertising for our largest entertainment network have been somewhat disappointing.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Turner is seeing similar advertising trends as it did in the third quarter. But the cancellation of NBA games should reduce growth by about 200 to 300 basis points in the quarter. We're also lapping an international acquisition that we made in the fourth quarter of last year. So we expect advertising growth on a reported basis to be in the mid-single digits.
Now for planning purposes, we are assuming here that there will be no NBA games in the fourth quarter, and while that would have the negative impact that I just said on advertising, there will also be an offsetting reduction in programming expenses. So the impact to adjusted operating income from the lost games in the fourth quarter should be relatively immaterial.
In terms of the scatter market, I just know generally that pricing is up high single to low double digits over the recent upfront. Moving over to Subscription revenues now for a moment in the quarter, they're up 6% year-over-year. As is often the case, there were some retroactive adjustments in the third quarter of this year, excuse me, the third quarter of both this year and last year, but together had the impact of reducing growth by about 100 basis points. As we look ahead, we expect subscription growth to be in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, and that's due to similar adjustments, as well as some headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar and recent modest declines in U.S. multi-channel subscribers.
For all of 2011, we continue to expect underlying Subscription revenue growth to be in the high single digits at Turner and in the mid-single digits at HBO. And while the quarters can certainly bounce around from a variety of reasons, those expectations that I just communicated are consistent with what we have coming into the year.
Adjusted operating income was down at the Networks group, 4% in the quarter, and that's largely due to 2 factors, both of which were highlighted on our second quarter earnings call. The first is programming and marketing expenses were up double digits in the quarter, and that was partly due to the timing of our sports programming, including the Major League Baseball playoffs and NASCAR. Second, recall that in last year's third quarter, we booked a $58 million reversal of a litigation reserve. That cost us 500 basis points of growth in this quarter. Please keep in mind for the full year, our programming expenses are trending pretty much exactly as we had expected. And excluding the NCAA Basketball Tournament, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we continue to anticipate programming expenses to be up mid-single digits this year.
As we look to the fourth quarter, some of the timing issues that worked against us this quarter in the third quarter should actually turnaround and work in our favor. So we expect programming expenses to be about flat year-over-year. And again, for planning purposes here, we're assuming that there will be no NBA games played in the quarter. As a result, we expect the fourth quarter to be by far our strongest of the year at the Networks group in terms of growth and adjusted operating income.
Now let me turn to film where Warner Bros. had its best quarter ever. Revenue was up nearly 20%, and profits more than doubled to a record of more than $0.5 billion. These strong results were principally a result of the theatrical release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 and the syndication sale of The Big Bang Theory. The incredible success of these properties underscores our view that the biggest hits are actually increasing in value, and we think the strong theatrical performance of the final Harry Potter movie bodes well for its upcoming home video release in the fourth quarter.
The Big Bang Theory was made available for both broadcast and cable syndications starting in September and was the principal driver of the more than 20% growth in our television revenue at this division in the quarter. And given the continued strong ratings of the show on broadcast, we anticipate that it will be a strong contributor to the profitability of the studio for many years to come.
Our Home Video revenue declined in the quarter, but that was mainly due to a lighter release slate. Our biggest title from a year ago was Clash of the Titans, and we didn't have anything of a similar large release in this year's quarter. It is worth noting, however, that for the industry, we estimate total U.S. home entertainment consumer sales were up almost 4% in the third quarter, which is an encouraging improvement from recent trends.
We anticipate a significant improvement in Home Video revenue for us in the fourth quarter as a result of a strong slate that includes the final Harry Potter film, The Hangover Part II, Green Lantern and Horrible Bosses. The fourth quarter will also benefit from a strong slate of video games headlined by Batman: Arkham City, which has been the best reviewed game of the year and shipped almost 5 million units at launch. And we should also see a nice lift from the SVOD deal that we recently struck and announced with Netflix for CW programming. And we're looking forward to the fourth quarter theatrical releases of Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2: A Game of Shadows. So the fourth quarter should be another very, very strong quarter for us in terms of profits here, and we remain very confident that 2011 will be a record year for Warner Bros.
Moving over to Publishing, where in the third quarter, Advertising revenues declined reflecting lower domestic print advertising. These results were also continuing to be negatively affected by something we've mentioned to you in the past. It's the transfer of the management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner, as well as the divestiture of titles in IPC. And if you would exclude these items, overall ad revenue was essentially flat in the quarter.
Subscription revenues were also almost flat, and that was a result of continued softness at newsstand, particularly for the celebrity category, and that's offsetting an improvement in domestic subscriptions. Operating income declined in the quarter, and that was a function of both the modest decline in revenue and an increase in expenses resulting partly from higher paper costs.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we do not see a significant change in top line trends. The good news is that print advertising market appears to have stabilized. Much of the softness that occurred in the third quarter happened in July in the run up to the U.S. debt ceiling deadline, and trends actually improved somewhat in August and September. So we don't anticipate seeing a further deterioration relative to the third quarter, which is good.
We do expect Subscription revenue to remain under pressure at the newsstand due to continued softness in the celebrity category, but expenses should also benefit in the fourth quarter from a favorable comparison relative to its restructuring charge last year. So we anticipate a return to growth in adjusted operating income at Publishing in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the next slide, which just highlights our outlook. We're very encouraged by our results for the first 9 months of the year, and our execution gives us confidence to raise our full year outlook as I mentioned earlier. We came into this year thinking that it would be a really good year, and it's been better than we expected. We're on track to grow revenue more than $2 billion this year, and we now expect high teens growth in adjusted EPS. That's particularly notable coming on the heels of about 30% growth in adjusted EPS in both 2009 and 2010.
I think it's also important to point out that we've been able to do this even though, as what usually happens, not everything has worked perfectly this year. For instance, TBS and TNT ratings have been softer than we anticipated. Green Lantern underperformed our expectations. The home video industry has remained soft, and our largest channel entertainment network in India has struggled. And, of course, we've been operating against a relatively difficult backdrop of slowing economic growth and stagnant multichannel household formation.
But we've been able to more than offset all of that due to strong results from CNN, Adult Swim and our sports properties, the outperformance of the rest of our theatrical slate and a great year from our Television Production unit. Broadly speaking, I think our performance is a testament to the strength and the diversity of our revenue streams, and it gives us great confidence in our growth outlook as we look beyond 2011.
Turning to the next slide, which quickly details free cash flow. Year-to-date through the first 3 quarters, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash, with the vast majority of that coming in the third quarter. As we anticipated, conversion remains a little down compared to the year ago, year-to-date first 9 months. And that's largely a result of higher working capital requirements from planned increases in production spending at Warner Bros. and HBO. However, our conversion increased during the quarter, and we fully expect to see our rate of conversion move up next year. We've been talking about that all year.
And the next slide, which is the last slide, provides a net debt reconciliation. We ended the quarter with about $15.3 billion in net debt. That's an increase of about $2.4 billion compared to the end of last year, and that's largely due to the continued direct returns to shareholders that we've been providing. We returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter, and that includes over $1.1 billion in share repurchases. We also bought back another $584 million of stock subsequent to the end of the quarter. And as I noted earlier, that's an acceleration in the pace of our returns to shareholders relative to recent quarters. So year-to-date, we have returned more than $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends. And to help fund that activity while maintaining strong liquidity and balance sheet flexibility, we recently issued $1 billion in long-term debt, and we were able to do that at very, very attractive rates.
I'd also note that year-to-date, we've spent about $300 million on M&A activity. We didn't have any significant acquisitions that occurred in the third quarter. Our leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter is about 2.3x. That's down a little bit from the second quarter, but up from around 2x at the end of 2010. Given the pace of our cash generation and share repurchases, we are on track to be closer to our target leverage of 2.5x by year end. And we continue to believe that 2.5x strikes the right balance of maintaining balance sheet strength while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. So with only one quarter left in the year, we are very pleased with our progress to date, and we are confident that we will achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives.

So it can be very good for consumers because they weren't really getting those or would have trouble getting them on a VOD basis. For our studio, what that does is it monetizes some content, particularly the serialized and older series better than it was monetized before. So it adds money to the ecosystem. There's some differences because of the nature of what Netflix is and what Hulu is about how both of those work.

On the opportunity, you're quite right about, because Warners is so big, about what we've got for online and a number of distributors: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and others. Yes, it's a big one. I don't -- we've never taken a baby step with anything. We did not recently take baby steps. We were not reticent or slow to do any of that. It was all the way we were planning to enforce and increase the value of all our programming to all our distributors, including the new SVOD-type distributors. So the recent deals are pretty big. We're happy to do big deals. We just want them to fit into the support of the other gigantic deals that we do every month with traditional networks. So there's plenty of room for us to do more deals out of our giant library of film and TV and not just from Warners, but some of our other programming that we make. If the people that want to buy it can afford it."

So those have been pretty stable on the volume side and the HBO issue on paying subs had to do with the mix between which affiliates were above or below benchmarks. It's a little arcane. The general fact there is the revenues have been very smooth and increasing because the basic paying sub base is strong and stable and growing, and the affiliate rates abilities at both Turner and HBO are steady and strong.

There's been a lot of speculation about the strength of acquired series on whichever cable networks have them. And basically, I think you lead off with that. If you have acquired series, they do tend to decline in a somewhat predictable way over time. One question asked, are they declining faster? No, if you look across the various networks not just ours. Secondly, what has been happening is a bit of an up-and-down supply of high-quality series, acquired series that are hits on broadcast. That could be ours. There's been a dearth of half, half hours which is about to turn around because the networks have a lot more of them on. So we think that on the acquired series side, there's a fair amount of value, and it may not go down. It may go up. As those series get scheduled with some critical mass on big reach cable networks that offer them on demand. And remember, those kind of series will not be available on demand anywhere else. So that's the kind of good news on the longevity of acquired series. If we're all sitting here saying, hey, the bids are going up and the value is going up on series programming over the lifetime, which we've all seen in these deals, then that means that the value on whichever outlet puts them on is also sustainable not declining. Having said that, we've all seen for years and both Turner and HBO have been leaders in this, that original series can be very important and very significant in terms of CPMs, branding the networks, content sale profits. And you get big hits, we've had them on HBO, we've got them now on TNT. That's very important value to the network and even content earnings for those kind of shows. So the issue gets to be one of mix, we think Time Warner is in a very advantaged place versus our competition because we make more of these hit shows, hours and half hour and sell them to all networks. We're the only series supplier coming out of Warners that has shows on all 4 broadcast networks, and we not only have a show on all of them, we have 3 shows or more on all of them. So that's a fantastic business if you think about it at the Warners side. The fact that we then have 2 big reach networks at TBS and TNT, to pick and support whichever of those become really valuable and to put them on an on-demand offering to support the TNT, TBS brands alongside of high-value sports, alongside of high-value original series, gives us a huge advantage and a tremendous platform and schedule in which to launch original series. So to finish, the obvious thing, you've seen it at HBO, you'll see it increasing at TNT, TBS is to have hit original series on those networks as well. And we'll see about how many -- if you take the balance of what acquired series are there, what originals are there, you'd like to increase the originals, and that'll probably happen unless there's so many valuable hits coming off acquired broadcast that does, it's kind of a balance between those 2 things."
