Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's fourth quarter 2010 earnings call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Bob Brust, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Bob will be joining us remotely today due to family reasons. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor's Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K, Part II Item 1A quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and when filed, Part I Item 1A of our Form 10-K for 2010.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the fourth quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the fourth quarter were $0.31 compared to $0.30 in the third quarter 2010 and $0.34 in the year-ago period. Net tax expense for the full year 2010 was $166 million. In the fourth quarter, we reported a next tax benefit of $5 million, primarily due to resolution of state tax matters, which cost our full year tax expense to be lower than we have projected at the end of third quarter. We expect that for the full year 2011, we will record a net tax expense of approximately 10% to 12% on pretax loss. I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

The momentum Sprint has been showing in recent quarters continued in the fourth quarter, and Q4 represents a good way to cap our turnaround efforts throughout 2010. Sprint's three key priorit",1578,"Thank you, Yijing, and thank you for joining us this morning. The momentum Sprint has been showing in recent quarters continued in the fourth quarter, and Q4 represents a good way to cap our turnaround efforts throughout 2010. 
Sprint's three key priorities have remained unchanged for three years. Number one, the customer experience is the foundation of building; number two, a strong brand, which leads to attracting and retaining customers fundamental to note three, improving our cash position. 
At the beginning of 2000 I told you on my first what Sprint that the turnaround would not be quick and that there were no magic bullets. I'm not declaring mission accomplished yet far from it. We are not even close to reaching what I think Sprint is capable of, but as I'll describe, our progress has been significant, and we're on the right track.
Let me begin with the customer experience on Slide 4. Bob Johnson and Steve have completed their first of three years of our journey with their 12th consecutive quarter of improved satisfaction with customer care in First Call Resolution, according to the Advantage survey. Both numbers achieved all-time best results. Our top box and bottom box satisfaction scores were also best ever. 
This progress was corroborated by Vocalabs, independent survey that was completed three weeks ago, where Sprint move into first place in the industry for both overall call satisfaction and First Call Resolution in the fourth quarter from last place just one year earlier. In the recently released J.D. Power survey, Sprint was the only carrier to show a double-digit improvement in their care customer satisfaction score over the past year.
In consumer reports, Sprint was the only major carrier to improve in each of the past two years, so much so, that we move from last place two years ago into a statistical tie for first as the best overall choice. In calls per care declined 10% from last year, reaching both an all-time best in achieving industry best in class.
Please turn to Slide 5. A leading independent survey, we did customer satisfaction with Sprint's data service best in the industry in November and in December. In the same independent source-rated customer satisfaction with Sprint's CDMA and iDEN networks both best ever. In addition, our CDMA and iDEN networks both achieved best-ever result for blocked calls. As a result, our fourth quarter postpaid churn was our best fourth quarter ever, contributing to our best-ever annual churn performance. Fourth quarter prepaid churn results represent our best quarter in five years, and our prepaid annual churn was at its lowest level in five years.
Please turn to Slide 6. I'll talk about the brand. These customer experience improvements have strengthened the Sprint brand. Our brand health metrics, which are most want to investigate, purchase consideration, first brand preference and positive brand momentum all achieved best-ever results in the second half. 
In a well-known independent survey in the third and fourth quarters, Sprint improved its number of promoters and detractors significantly in each of the past two years, and the combination of these two, the net promoter score for the Sprint brand and CDMA, is up a whopping 24 points in two years, and we're the only major U.S. carrier to show any gain. We've moved from a distant fourth to a strong number two in just two years. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'm pleased to report these improvements in the customer experience in the brand helped us deliver 1.1 million total net adds, and we were also postpaid net add positive for the quarter. Both results our best in almost five years. 
The fourth quarter was also the first quarter where our entire Postpaid business has been net port positive, that is, more customers switched to the Sprint and Nextel brands than switched from Sprint and Nextel. And was also the first time that the Sprint brand, which was net port positive for its third consecutive quarter was net port positive against every major competitor. 
The Sprint branded postpaid subscriber base, which increased by another 519,000 customers in the fourth quarter, is the fastest-growing in the country among major wireless carriers, and the Sprint brand was net add positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our postpaid's share of gross adds improved year-over-year for the six the second quarter and was up over 300 basis points year-over-year and up 460 basis points for all of 2010 versus 2009.
We improved our share of gross adds, while the percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a strong 84% as of the end of 2010. Prepaid net adds were up by a 175,000 sequentially, delivering our best prepaid Q4 net add performance ever. Our Boost, Virgin Mobile insurance brands also had positive net adds in the quarter.
Sprint launched 4G service in 16 new cities during the quarter including New York, San Francisco, Miami and Los Angeles. Sprint 4G is now available in 71 markets reaching more than 110 million people. We had strong growth in our dual-mode 3G/4G customer base, driven by our industry-leading device lineup. The EVO and Epic continue to garner even more awards and accolades in the quarter, and the announcements of HTC EVO shift and the exclusive BlackBerry 4G PlayBook brings our industry-leading 4G device lineup to 18. The EVO 4G is fastest selling new device ever.
Moving to Slide 8. On the cash front, we maintained a strong liquidity position by generating $930 million in free cash flow for the quarter and $2.5 million in free cash flow for the year. Quarterly adjusted OIBDA was $1.32 billion as ARPU gains were offset by the investment costs associated with more postpaid and prepaid adds and upgrades. 
Net operating revenue grew sequentially and in calendar year 2010, for the first time since 2006. Our fourth quarter operating loss of $139 million showed a 74% improvement year-over-year, and our annual operating loss was better by 57% versus 2009. Also in 2010, we significantly exceeded our synergy targets for the Virgin Mobile and iPCS acquisitions that we made in late 2009.
The first year of our network advise outsourcing project with Ericsson met or exceeded its performance its financial savings objectives. Also during the fourth quarter, we announced our network vision blueprint, a multi-year initiative to enhance voice and data services, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability. 
We have selected Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson and Samsung to installed Network Equipment software, including multi-mode stations over the next three to five years. The project will bring together different spectra brands onto a single base station and will allow for the flexibility to offer new technologies using a range of spectrum brands.
We intend to repurpose some of our 800 megahertz for CDMA service, which has coverage and in particular in-building experience for customers. We also expect to launch the next generation of Push-to-Talk services in 2011 on the CDMA network, offering customers subsecond call-center time along with robust data capabilities. It is expected that iDEN cell sites will be phased out beginning in 2013.
Currently, we are conducting laboratory testing and expect to begin field integration testing around the middle of the second quarter. We expect the first upgraded cell sites to go live with the new equipment in eight of the largest metro areas beginning in the August time frame. This will allow us to deliver performance improvement to as many of our customers as quickly as possible, and this will also set the stage for cost reductions starting in 2012. 
We expect that Network Vision will provide us with additional flexibility to potentially use our own spectrum and network assets to provide additional 4G capacity or use other spectrum that may be available to us in the future over our network to create further 4G capacity. If Clearwire utilizes our modernized network, there could be significant economic benefits for both companies.
So in conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we made in the fourth quarter and all of 2010. Sprint's customer experience, brand and subscriber performance all strengthened throughout the year, and we generated strong cash flow too. 
Chart 9 shows the change in major carriers postpaid net subscribers versus the previous year. Sprint's annual improvement of 2.7 million net subscribers versus the previous year is unprecedented in the history of our industry. 
If I were to pick a sports analogy, it would be 1999's Indianapolis Colts or Arizona Diamondbacks, both registered record-breaking turnaround years and Peyton Manning's rookie season the Mark, the pulse finishing and three after finishing three and 13 the previous year, a 10-game improvement. And after going 65 and 97 in 1998, Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo added Randy Johnson in a number of new free agents. In 1999, they won 100 games in their division. Both teams lost in the first round of the playoffs, so in spite of their improvements, they finished the season far from satisfied, but their enormous progress better things to come.
In spite of very strong competitive pressures in 2011, we expect to generate positive postpaid net adds and to improve total net adds this year as compared to 2010. The company expects full year capital expenditures to be approximately $3 billion, and we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow during 2011. 
I would now like to turn it over to our CFO, Bob Brust, will talk about our financial performance in more detail. Bob?"
417206,118478973,101273,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2011",2011-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving onto Slide 10, I would like to start out by discussing revenue performance for the fourth quarter and full year. We are pleased that total consolidated revenues grew sequentially for the second consecuti",1770,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving onto Slide 10, I would like to start out by discussing revenue performance for the fourth quarter and full year. 
We are pleased that total consolidated revenues grew sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. Revenues improved by 1.8% as compared to the third quarter of last year and were up 5.5% compared to the year-ago period. The sequential and year-over-year improvements were driven by higher equipment and wireless service revenues, partially offset by lower wireline revenue. Acquisitions completed in the latter part in the fourth quarter of 2009 also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. 
Wireless service revenues grew sequentially, primarily due to a higher average revenue per user for postpaid. Growth in the number of prepaid subscribers also drove sequential improvement in wireless service revenue. Postpaid ARPU, while still a lot of the $55, benefited sequentially from higher monthly recurring charges, including a $10 premium data services add-on an improvement in cost partially offset by lower usage base charges.  
We expect postpaid ARPU to grow in 2011 due to continued growth in smart phone sales and the $10 premium data service charge, which now applies to all smart phones activated since January 30. We project prepaid ARPU will be declined slightly in 2011 due primarily to the continued success of the insurance wireless and our Boost in Shrinkage program, which we announced last October. 
Boost and Shrinkage Allows customers to reduce their bills and increments of $5 after six onetime payments as well is $35 per month. We believe that program will lead to higher price satisfaction amongst our customers and lower churn.
Postpaid subscriber losses in 2010 slowed significantly as compared to 2009, improving by nearly 2.7 million on a full year basis. Although we still lost postpaid subscribers for the full year, we are very pleased with our improvement we saw throughout 2010, including the net addition of 58,000 postpaid subscribers during the fourth quarter. 
The improvement in postpaid subscriber results and continued growth in prepaid subscribers, along with fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions, have been the key drivers in stabilizing revenue in 2010. In 2011, we expect wireless service revenues to grow, Wireline revenues decline and total consolidated operating revenues to be stable to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving to Slide 11. As Dan mentioned, we had a good quarter in terms of free cash flow, generating $913 million during the quarter. This was up from $384 million in the third quarter, due in part in favorable working capital changes, a onetime federal tax stimulus refund of $153 million and lower sequential schedule interest payments. 
For the full year 2010, we generated a total of $2.5 billion of free cash flow, which was approximately $300 million lower than last year. The decrease in free cash flow was roughly equal to the increase in CapEx between the two years. 
Looking ahead, we expect first quarter free cash flow to be lower sequentially. The primary reasons for the projected sequential decline include scheduled higher interest payments and the expected reversal of other working capital changes, which benefited in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the tax stimulus refund we received during the quarter is not expected to recur, and we intend to make pension contributions totaling approximately $150 million with the majority of it occurring in the first quarter. We expect to continue to generate positive free cash for the total year 2011.
We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. At the end of 2010, we repaid a $1.65 billion note that came due in January 2011. That was our only note maturity during 2011. 
In January, we amended our export development Canada loan to extend the maturity on a portion of the $750 million originally due in the first quarter of 2012. We extended $500 million of this facility through December of 2015, while the remaining $250 million will still much or in March of 2012. As a result, the 2012 maturities decreased $2.75 billion to $2.25 billion.
Capital expenditures were $608 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $462 million in the third quarter and $554 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Total capital expenditures for 2010 were slightly over $1.9 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. Capital investment in 2010 focused on wireless quality, coverage and capacity to maintain our competitive position and data services and network quality. As Dan talked about earlier, we expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, including about $500 million of incremental spend due to the Network Vision program.
Originally, we had planned to spend about $2.5 billion in CapEx in 2011, including expenditures at add-on capacity. Some of the capital assumed in the original plan will be substituted with spend through the Network Vision program. Keep in mind, the $500 million I referenced is incremental spend. Total capital expenditures remained in Network Vision for 2011 will likely be higher than $500 million.
The total incremental cost of the Network Vision program over the estimated three to five-year deployment program is expected to be between $4 billion and $5 billion. We expect that just over 50% of the incremental cost will be capital, while the remainder will be operating expenses. We plan on ramping up capital expenditures related to Network Vision in the second half of 2011, with the highest levels of capital investment taking place in 2012 and 2013.
We spent approximately $450 million on rebanding for the full year 2010 and are targeting to spend a similar amount in 2011. Some spend that was originally expected to occur in 2010 will likely occur in 2011 due to the timing of certain licensee reconfigurations.
Moving onto Slide 12. I will talk about the drivers of the sequential change in consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. As Dan mentioned, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.315 billion, down $24 million sequentially and down $94 million from the year ago. The Adjusted OIBDA margins declined 50 basis point sequentially. 
Adjusted OIBDA declines sequentially primarily due to higher net subsidy and sales and marketing costs, which were partially offset by higher service revenue and lower cost of service. SG&A increased sequentially, primarily due to higher fourth quarter media spend and selling expenses associated with stronger retail, gross adds and upgrades. Retail gross adds increased by approximately 5% as compared to the third quarter. We should sequential increase in net subsidy was driven mostly by higher postpaid and prepaid handset sales and also higher postpaid subsidies per device sold due primarily to the continued growth in the smartphone mix.
Cost of services loan is due largely to the effects of a seasonally, including lower service cell site utility expenses. Wireline contribution to Adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially as the revenue decline was mostly offset by a decline in cost of service. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume, which also drove the improvement in the positive service. Looking ahead, we are forecasting wireline Adjusted OIBDA to decline significantly in 2011.
The schedule migration of wholesale customers of the Sprint wireline platform is expected to cause of wireline Adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $25 million sequentially in the first quarter and slightly $200 million for the full year 2011. We expect the migration of our largest Sprint customers who last through 2014. 
At the beginning of each year, we re-established intercompany rates for transactions between our tech segments, which are generally dependent based on market rates. Over the past several years, I have been an interesting trend of lower rates due to increased competition of other wireline and wireless communications companies as well as cable and Internet service providers. We changed this year will have no impact on the consolidated Adjusted OIBDA but is projected to result in a decline to wireline OIBDA of approximately $250 million for the full year. The sequential decline in the first quarter is expected to be approximately $60 million.
On a full year basis, we are pleased that our force manager results resulted in significant consolidated operating expense in 2010. Headcount reductions in 2009 resolving approximately $150 million last year. We also realized service and repairs savings of about $150 million, primarily driven by a focus on repairing customers handsets and using refurbished devices instead of using new devices for repricing. We saw improvement in our marketing productivity as well as lower customer care costs as we continue to reduce call volumes, primarily due to fewer calls per subscriber. As a result of these savings, we were able to offset some of the increased costs associated with higher retail gross adds and growing subsidy expense. 
As Dan mentioned, our consolidated net operating revenues grew by approximately $300 million year-over-year, and operating expenses declined by approximately $500 million in 2010, resulting in a greater than 50% reduction in the company's operating loss. As I stated earlier, despite pressure related to scheduled migration of cable customers, we expect total consolidated operating revenues to be stable to slightly up in 2011. Growing revenues and improving our cost structure is key to improving long-term margin. 
The Network Vision project significantly improve our cost structure and is expected to yield $10 billion to $11 billion in net benefits over a seven-year time frame. We should start seeing benefits reduced wired backhaul cost in 2012. We expected margin expansion starting in 2013. We expect that 2014 will be the first year in which benefits should more than offset the incremental OpEx and CapEx. we currently assume that the project should breakeven on a cumulative cash flow basis in 2015.
We expect that subsidies and growth in data usage will continue to place pressure on margins in 2011 and anticipate that postpaid ARPU growth and continued focus on cost management should offset some of that pressure. Consolidated Adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter will likely be relatively stable sequentially. 
In summary, we are pleased with the recent improvements in subscriber and revenue performance. We look forward to focus on revenue growth and cash in 2011. Looking back on my time at Sprint, I'm encouraged by how far the company has come. When I joined the team about three years ago, the company was in a very difficult position. However, despite sizable economic headwinds and tough competition, that the managed to stabilize and even began to grow the business. 
Sprint will continue to face new challenges down the road. However, as I prepare to return to the beach, I am confident that the company is in good hands. Now back to Yijing for questions."

With respect to Verizon, obviously, our customers not only have strong device lineup, but they got a lot of value with what we provide them.

And fundamentally, what drove it was that smartphone users used a lot more of our network that non-smartphone users. And so, our cost of service, if you will, was higher for smart devices that non=smart devices. So we were very much wanted to keep our differentiation in the market and what keeps our customers satisfied and what we know they want, which is the simplicity of unlimited. And to be able to maintain that, we felt that this was the right thing to do rather than go into a metered approach for those higher-end users. So that is really the driver. And I would signal at this point, looking at doing it for other devices but it getting to your question was really what drove it, in it was really the additional cost of service on smart devices. Because the usage has been increasing further substantially year-over-year. Second, with respect to Clearwire, we have very good discussions and negotiations going on with Clearwire, with respect to, if you will, resolving some of the differences in view between the companies. You mentioned one of them. We're discussing is very public. We have good discussions going back and forth, good faith discussions with respect to wholesale rates and wholesale pricing. But I would not read anything more into that with respect to funding. We are not at that point where we're made any decisions in that regard moving forward. We're very pleased with the fact that Clearwire was able to secure additional external funding in the fourth quarter. And if they need more, that will be a bridge that we cross at that time."

So it kind of feels like the revenue picture on a consolidated basis is kind of flattish, maybe slightly up, maybe up for wireless a little bit. But on the margin front, you say a lot of moving parts. If we are spending $500 million of incremental capital on Vision, it seems like a healthy percentage of the amount of operating expense we're looking for over this process I guess $2 billion to $2.25 billion is probably coming out of over that time. So it feels like in the Wireless business, there's going to be $200 million, $300 million, $400 million of incremental expense coming in the second half. but then I guess I think I also heard you say that you're going to change the cost allocations where why this is going to be paying the wireline business about $250 million less, and that's going to start at the beginning of the year. So can you kind of try to walk us through how spending more on Vision, reallocating costs and then whatever other costs going on gets us to the kind of flattish EBITDA the in 2011 versus 2010?

Bob is joining us remotely today due to family reasons. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investors Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K, Part II Item 1A quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and when filed, Part I Item 1A of our Form 10-K for 2010.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the fourth quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the fourth quarter were $0.31 compared to $0.30 in the third quarter 2010 and $0.34 in the year-ago period. Net tax expense for the full year 2010 was $166 million. In the fourth quarter, we reported a next tax benefit of $5 million, primarily due to resolution of state tax matters, which cost our full year tax expense to be lower than we have projected at the end of third quarter. We expect that for the full year 2011, we will record a net tax expense of approximately 10% to 12% on pretax loss. I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."

The momentum Sprint has been showing in recent quarters continued in the fourth quarter, and Q4 represents a good way to cap our turnaround efforts throughout 2010. Sprint's three key priorit",1592,"Thank you, Yijing, and thank you for joining us this morning. The momentum Sprint has been showing in recent quarters continued in the fourth quarter, and Q4 represents a good way to cap our turnaround efforts throughout 2010. 
Sprint's three key priorities have remained unchanged for three years. Number one, the customer experience is the foundation of building; number two, a strong brand, which leads to attracting and retaining customers; fundamental three, improving our cash position. 
At the beginning of 2008, I told you on my first call at Sprint that the turnaround would not be quick and that there were no magic bullets. I'm not declaring mission accomplished yet far from it. We are not even close to reaching what I think Sprint is capable of, but as I'll describe, our progress has been significant and we're on the right track.
Let me begin with the customer experience on Slide 4. Bob Johnson and his team have completed their first three years of our journey with their 12th consecutive quarter of improved satisfaction with customer care in First Call Resolution, according to the Advanis survey. Both numbers achieved all-time best results. Our top box and bottom box satisfaction scores were also best ever. 
This progress was corroborated by Vocalabs, independent survey that was completed three weeks ago, where Sprint move into first place in the industry for both overall call satisfaction and First Call Resolution in the fourth quarter from last place just one year earlier. In the recently released J.D. Power survey, Sprint was the only carrier to show a double-digit improvement in their care customer satisfaction score over the past year.
In consumer reports, Sprint was the only major carrier to improve in each of the past two years, so much so that we move from last place two years ago into a statistical tie for first as the best overall choice. In calls to care per customer declined 10% from last year, reaching both an all-time best and achieving industry best in class.
Please turn to Slide 5. A leading independent survey rated customer satisfaction with Sprint's data service best in the industry in November and in December. In the same independent source rated customer satisfaction with Sprint's CDMA and iDEN networks both best ever. In addition, our CDMA and iDEN networks both achieved best-ever results for blocked calls. As a result, our fourth quarter postpaid churn was our best fourth quarter ever, contributing to our best-ever annual churn performance. Fourth quarter prepaid churn results represent our best quarter in five years, and our prepaid annual churn was at its lowest level in five years.
Please turn to Slide 6. I'll talk about the brand. These customer experience improvements has strengthened the Sprint brand. Our brand health metrics, which are most want to investigate, purchase consideration, first brand preference and positive brand momentum all achieved best-ever results in the second half. 
In a well-known independent survey in the third and fourth quarters, Sprint improved its number of promoters and detractors significantly in each of the past two years, and the combination of these two, the net promoter score for the Sprint brand or CDMA, is up a whopping 24 points in two years, and we're the only major U.S. carrier to show any gain. We've moved from a distant fourth to a strong number two in just two years. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'm pleased to report these improvements in the customer experience in the brand helped us deliver 1.1 million total net adds, and we were also postpaid net add positive for the quarter. Both results are our best in almost five years. 
The fourth quarter was also the first quarter where our entire Postpaid business has been net port positive, that is, more customers switched to the Sprint and Nextel brands than switched from Sprint and Nextel. It was also the first time that the Sprint brand, which was net port positive for its third consecutive quarter was net port positive against every major competitor. 
The Sprint branded postpaid subscriber base, which increased by another 519,000 customers in the fourth quarter, is the fastest growing in the country among major wireless carriers as the Sprint brand was net add positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our postpaid's share of gross adds improved year-over-year for the sixth straight quarter and was up over 300 basis points year-over-year and up 460 basis points for all of 2010 versus 2009.
We improved our share of gross adds while the percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a strong 84% as of the end of 2010. Prepaid net adds were up by a 175,000 sequentially, delivering our best prepaid Q4 net add performance ever. Our Boost, Virgin Mobile insurance brands also had positive net adds in the quarter.
Sprint launched 4G service in 16 new cities during the quarter including New York, San Francisco, Miami and Los Angeles. Sprint 4G is now available in 71 markets reaching more than 110 million people. We had strong growth in our dual-mode 3G/4G customer base, driven by our industry-leading device lineup. The EVO and Epic continue to garner even more awards and accolades in the quarter, and the announcements of the HTC EVO shift and the exclusive BlackBerry 4G PlayBook brings our industry leading 4G device lineup to 18. The EVO 4G is our fastest selling new device ever.
Moving to Slide 8. On the cash front, we maintained a strong liquidity position by generating $913 million in free cash flow for the quarter and $2.5 billion in free cash flow for the year. Quarterly adjusted OIBDA was $1.32 billion as ARPU gains were offset by the investment costs associated with more postpaid and prepaid adds and upgrades. 
Net operating revenue grew sequentially and in calendar year 2010, for the first time since 2006, our fourth quarter operating loss of $139 million showed a 74% improvement year-over-year and our annual operating loss was better by 57% versus 2009. Also in 2010, we significantly exceeded our synergy targets for the Virgin Mobile and iPCS acquisitions that we made in late 2009.
The first year of our network advantage outsourcing project with Ericsson met or exceeded its performance in financial savings objectives. Also during the fourth quarter, we announced our network vision blueprint, a multi-year initiative to enhance voice and data services, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability. 
We have selected Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson and Samsung to install new network equipment software, including multi-mode base stations over the next three to five years. The project will bring together a different spectrum brands onto a single-base station and will allow for the flexibility to offer new technologies using a range of spectrum brands.
We intend to repurpose some of our 800 megahertz spectrum for CDMA service which will enhance coverage and in particular, the in-building experience for our customers. We also expect to launch the next generation of push-to-talk services in 2011 on the CDMA network, offering customers subsecond call set of time along with robust data capabilities. It is expected that iDEN cell sites will be phased out beginning in 2013.
Currently, we are conducting laboratory testing and expect to begin field integration testing around the middle of the second quarter. We expect the first upgraded cell sites to go live with the new equipment in eight of the largest metro areas beginning in the August time frame. This will allow us to deliver performance improvement to as many of our customers as quickly as possible, and this will also set the stage for cost reductions starting in 2012. 
We expect that Network Vision will provide us with additional flexibility to potentially use our own spectrum and network assets to provide additional 4G capacity or use other spectrum that may be available to us in the future over our network to create further 4G capacity. If Clearwire utilizes our modernized network, there could be significant economic benefits for both companies.
So in conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we made in the fourth quarter and all of 2010. Sprint's customer experience, brand and subscriber performance all strengthened throughout the year and we generated strong cash flow too. 
Chart 9 shows the change in major carriers postpaid net subscribers versus the previous year. Sprint's annual improvement of 2.7 million net subscribers versus the previous year is unprecedented in the history of our industry. If I were to pick a sports analogy, it would be 1999's Indianapolis Colts or Arizona Diamondbacks, both which registered record-breaking turnaround years and Peyton Manning's rookie season the Colts finished 13 and three after finishing three and 13 the previous year, a 10-game improvement. And after going 65 and 97 in 1998, Diamondbacks' owner Jerry Colangelo added Randy Johnson in a number of new free agents. In 1999, they won 100 games in their division. Both teams lost in the first round of the playoffs, so in spite of their improvements, they finished the season far from satisfied but their enormous progress better things to come.
In spite of very strong competitive pressures in 2011, we expect to generate positive postpaid net adds and to improve total net adds this year as compared to 2010. The company expects full year capital expenditures to be approximately $3 billion and we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow during 2011. 
I would now like to turn it over to our CFO, Bob Brust, who will talk about our financial performance in more detail. Bob?"
417206,118478973,101400,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2011",2011-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving on to Slide 10, I would like to start out by discussing revenue performance for the fourth quarter and full year. We are pleased that total consolidated revenues grew sequentially for the second consecut",1785,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving on to Slide 10, I would like to start out by discussing revenue performance for the fourth quarter and full year. 
We are pleased that total consolidated revenues grew sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. Revenues improved by 1.8% as compared to the third quarter of last year and were up 5.5% compared to the year-ago period. The sequential and year-over-year improvements were driven by higher equipment and wireless service revenues, partially offset by lower Wireline revenue. Acquisitions completed in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2009 also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. 
Wireless service revenues grew sequentially, primarily due to a higher average revenue per user for postpaid. Growth in the number of prepaid subscribers also drove sequential improvement in wireless service revenues. Postpaid ARPU, while still running to $55, benefited sequentially from higher monthly recurring charges, including a $10 premium data services add-on, an improvement in care cost partially offset by lower usage base charges.  
We expect postpaid ARPU to grow in 2011 due to continued growth in smart phone sales and the $10 premium data service charge, which now applies to all smart phones activated since January 30. We project prepaid ARPU will decline slightly in 2011 due primarily to the continued success of insurance wireless and our Boost with Shrinkage program, which we announced last October. 
Boost with Shrinkage allows customers to reduce their bills in increments of $5 after six on-time payments through as well as $35 per month. We believe the program will lead to higher price satisfaction amongst our customers and lower churn.
Postpaid subscriber losses in 2010 slowed significantly as compared to 2009, improving by nearly 2.7 million on a full year basis. Although we still lost postpaid subscribers for the full year, we are very pleased with the improvement we saw throughout 2010, including the net addition of 58,000 postpaid subscribers during the fourth quarter. 
The improvement in postpaid subscriber results and continued growth in prepaid subscribers, along with fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions, have been the key drivers in stabilizing revenue in 2010. In 2011, we expect wireless service revenues to grow, Wireline revenue decline and total consolidated operating revenues to be stable to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving to Slide 11. As Dan mentioned, we had a good quarter in terms of free cash flow, generating $913 million during the quarter. This was up from $384 million in the third quarter, due in part from favorable working capital changes, a one-time federal tax stimulus refund of $153 million and lower sequential schedule interest payments. 
For the full year 2010, we generated a total of $2.5 billion of free cash flow, which was approximately $300 million lower than last year. The decrease in free cash flow was roughly equal to the increase in CapEx between the two years. 
Looking ahead, we expect first quarter free cash flow to be lower sequentially. The primary reasons for the projected sequential decline include scheduled higher interest payments and the expected reversal of other working capital changes, which benefited in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the tax stimulus refund received during the quarter is not expected to recur and we intend to make pension contributions totaling approximately $150 million, with the majority of it occurring in the first quarter. We expect to continue to generate positive free cash for the total year 2011.
We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. At the end of 2010, we repaid a $1.65 billion note that came due in January 2011. That was our only note maturity during 2011. 
In January, we amended our export development Canada loan to extend the maturity on a portion of the $750 million originally due in the first quarter of 2012. We extended $500 million of this facility through December of 2015, while the remaining $250 million will still mature in March of 2012. As a result, 2012 maturities decreased from $2.75 billion to $2.25 billion.
Capital expenditures were $608 million in the fourth quarter compared to $462 million in the third quarter and $554 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Total capital expenditures for 2010 were slightly over $1.9 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. Capital investment in 2010 focused on wireless quality, coverage and capacity to maintain our competitive position and data services and network quality. As Dan talked about earlier, we expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, including about $500 million of incremental spend due to the Network Vision program.
Originally, we had planned to spend about $2.5 billion in CapEx in 2011, including expenditures to add data capacity. Some of the capital assumed in the original plan will be substituted with spend through the Network Vision program. Keep in mind, the $500 million I referenced is incremental spend. Total capital expenditures remained to Network Vision in 2011 will likely be higher than $500 million.
The total incremental cost of the Network Vision program over the estimated three- to five-year deployment program is expected to be between $4 billion and $5 billion. We expect that just over 50% of the incremental cost will be capital, while the remainder will be operating expenses. We plan on ramping up capital expenditures related to Network Vision in the second half of 2011, with the highest levels of capital investment taking place in 2012 and 2013.
We spent approximately $450 million on rebanding for the full year 2010 and are targeting to spend a similar amount in 2011. Some spend that was originally expected to occur in 2010 will likely occur in 2011 due to the timing of certain licensing reconfigurations.
Moving on to Slide 12. I will talk about the drivers of the sequential change in consolidated adjusted OIBDA. As Dan mentioned, consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.315 billion, down $24 million sequentially and down $94 million from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 50 basis point sequentially. 
Adjusted OIBDA declines sequentially primarily due to a higher net subsidy and sales and marketing costs, which were partially offset by higher service revenue and lower cost of service. SG&A increased sequentially, primarily due to higher fourth quarter media spend and selling expenses associated with stronger retail, gross adds and upgrades. Retail gross adds increased by approximately 5% as compared to the third quarter. The sequential increase in net subsidy was driven mostly by a higher postpaid and prepaid handset sales and also higher postpaid subsidies per device sold due primarily to the continued growth in the smartphone mix.
Cost of service was lower sequentially due largely to the effects of seasonally, including lower service seasonality including lower service and repair and cell site utility expenses. Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially as the revenue decline was mostly offset by a decline in cost of service. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume, which also drove the improvement in the positive service. Looking ahead, we are forecasting Wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline significantly in 2011.
The schedule migration of wholesale camera VoIP customers off of Sprint's Wireline platform is expected because Wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $25 million sequentially in the first quarter and slightly as of $200 million for the full year 2011. We expect the migration of our largest VoIP customer to last through 2014. 
At the beginning of each year, we re-established intercompany rates for transactions between our segments, which are generally dependent based on market rates. Over the past several years, it has been an industry-wide trend of lower rates due to increased competition of other Wireline and wireless communications companies as well as cable and Internet service providers. The change for this year will have no impact on the consolidated adjusted OIBDA but is projected to result in a decline to Wireline OIBDA of approximately $250 million for the full year. The sequential decline in first quarter is expected to be approximately $60 million.
On a full year basis, we are pleased with our cost managing results resulted in significant consolidated operating expense savings in 2010. Headcount reductions in 2009 resulted in savings of approximately $150 million last year. We also realized service and repairs savings of about $150 million, primarily driven by a focus on repairing customers handsets and using refurbished devices instead of using new devices for repricing. We saw an improvement in our marketing productivity as well as lower customer care costs as we continue to reduce call volumes, primarily due to fewer calls per subscriber. As a result of these savings, we were able to offset some of the increased costs associated with higher retail gross add and growing subsidy expense. 
As Dan mentioned, our consolidated net operating revenues grew by approximately $300 million year-over-year, and operating expenses declined by approximately $500 million in 2010, resulting in a greater than 50% reduction in the company's operating loss. As I stated earlier, despite pressure related to scheduled migration of cable VoIP customers, we expect total consolidated operating revenues to be stable to slightly up in 2011. Growing revenues and improving our cost structure is key to improving long-term margin. 
The Network Vision project significantly improved our cost structure and is expected to yield $10 billion to $11 billion in net benefits over a seven-year time frame. We should start seeing benefits from reduced roaming and backhaul cost in 2012 with expected margin expansion starting in 2013. We expect that 2014 will be the first year in which benefits should more than offset the incremental OpEx and CapEx. We currently assume that the project should breakeven on a cumulative cash flow basis in 2015.
We expect that subsidies and growth in data usage will continue to place pressure on margins through 2011 and anticipate that postpaid ARPU growth and continued focus on cost management should offset some of that pressure. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter will likely be relatively stable sequentially. 
In summary, we are pleased with the recent improvements in subscriber and revenue performance. We look forward to focus on revenue growth and cash in 2011. Looking back on my time at Sprint, I'm encouraged by how far the company has come. When I joined the team about three years ago, the company was in a very difficult position. However, despite sizable economic headwinds and tough competition, the team managed to stabilize and even began to grow the business. 
Sprint will continue to face new challenges down the road. However, as I prepare to return to the beach, I am confident that the company is in good hands. Now back to Yijing for questions."

And fundamentally, what drove it was that smartphone users used a lot more of our network than non-smartphone users. And so our cost of service, if you will, was higher for smart devices that non-smart devices. So we very much wanted to keep our differentiation in the market and what keeps our customers satisfied and what we know they want, which is the simplicity of unlimited. And to be able to maintain that, we felt this was the right thing to do rather than go into a metered approach for those higher-end users. So that was really the driver. And I would signal at this point looking at doing it for other devices but, again, your question was really what drove it and it was really the additional cost of service on smart devices because the usage has been increasing fairly substantially year-over-year. Second, with respect to Clearwire, we have very good discussions and negotiations going on with Clearwire with respect to, if you will, resolving some of the differences in view between the companies. You mentioned one of them. We're discussing -- it's very public. We have good discussions going back and forth, good faith discussions with respect to wholesale rates and wholesale pricing, but I would not read anything more into that with respect to funding. We are not at that point where we've made any decisions in that regard moving forward. We're very pleased with the fact that Clearwire was able to secure additional external funding in the fourth quarter. And if they need more, that will be a bridge that we cross at that time."

But on the margin front, as you say, lots of moving parts. If we're spending $500 million of incremental capital on Vision, it seems like a healthy percentage of the amount of operating expense we're looking for over this process, I guess, $2 billion to $2.25 billion is probably coming out of over that time. So it feels like in the Wireless business, there's going to be, I don't know, $200 million, $300 million, $400 million of incremental expense coming in the second half. But then I guess I think I also heard you say that you're going to change the cost allocations where wireless is going to be paying the Wireline business about $250 million less, and that's going to start at the beginning of the year. So could you kind of try to walk us through how spending more on Vision, reallocating costs and then whatever other cost initiatives are going on gets us to the kind of flattish EBITDA in 2011 versus 2010, because again, it feels like we should probably be anticipating a little bit more downside with the spending that's going to go on here?"

We're doing a lot of work in terms of migration now but we're not spending a lot of OpEx. And so we're anticipating in the 2013 period to be looking at migration cost.

Bob is joining us remotely today due to family reasons. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investors Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K, Part II Item 1A quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and when filed, Part I Item 1A of our Form 10-K for 2010.

Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the fourth quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the fourth quarter were $0.31 compared to $0.30 in the third quarter 2010 and $0.34 in the year-ago period. Net tax expense for the full year 2010 was $166 million. In the fourth quarter, we reported a net tax benefit of $5 million, primarily due to resolution of state tax matters, which caused our full year tax expense to be lower than we have projected at the end of third quarter. We expect that for the full year 2011, we will record a net tax expense of approximately 10% to 12% on pretax loss. I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."

The momentum Sprint has been showing in recent quarters continued in the fourth quarter, and Q4 represents a good way to cap our turnaround efforts throughout 2010. 
Sprint's three key priorities have remained unchanged for three years. Number one, the customer experience is the foundation of building; number two, a strong brand, which leads to attracting and retaining customers; fundamental three, improving our cash position. 
At the beginning of 2008, I told you on my first call at Sprint that the turnaround would not be quick and that there were no magic bullets. I'm not declaring mission accomplished yet far from it. We are not even close to reaching what I think Sprint is capable of, but as I'll describe, our progress has been significant and we're on the right track.
Let me begin with the customer experience on Slide 4. Bob Johnson and his team have completed their first three years of our journey with their 12th consecutive quarter of improved satisfaction with customer care and First Call Resolution, according to the Advanis survey. Both numbers achieved all-time best results. Our top box and bottom box satisfaction scores were also best ever. This progress was corroborated by Vocalabs, independent survey that was completed three weeks ago, where Sprint move into first place in the industry for both overall call satisfaction and First Call Resolution in the fourth quarter from last place just one year earlier. In the recently released J.D. Power survey, Sprint was the only carrier to show a double-digit improvement in their care customer satisfaction score over the past year. In consumer reports, Sprint was the only major carrier to improve in each of the past two years, so much so that we moved from last place two years ago into a statistical tie for first as the best overall choice. In calls to care per customer declined 10% from last year, reaching both an all-time best and achieving industry best in class.
Please turn to Slide 5. A leading independent survey rated customer satisfaction with Sprint's data service best in the industry in November and in December. In the same independent source rated customer satisfaction with Sprint's CDMA and iDEN networks both best ever. In addition, our CDMA and iDEN networks both achieved best-ever results for blocked calls. As a result, our fourth quarter postpaid churn was our best fourth quarter ever, contributing to our best-ever annual churn performance. Fourth quarter prepaid churn results represent our best quarter in five years, and our prepaid annual churn was at its lowest level in five years.
Please turn to Slide 6. I'll talk about the brand. These customer experience improvements has strengthened the Sprint brand. Our brand health metrics, which are most want to investigate, purchase consideration, first brand preference and positive brand momentum all achieved best-ever results in the second half. 
In a well-known independent survey in the third and fourth quarters, Sprint improved its number of promoters and detractors significantly in each of the past two years, and the combination of these two, the net promoter score for the Sprint brand or CDMA, is up a whopping 24 points in two years, and we're the only major U.S. carrier to show any gain. We've moved from a distant fourth to a strong number two in just two years. Turning to Slide 7, I'm pleased to report these improvements in the customer experience in the brand helped us deliver 1.1 million total net adds, and we were also postpaid net add positive for the quarter. Both results are our best in almost five years. 
The fourth quarter was also the first quarter where our entire Postpaid business has been net port positive, that is, more customers switched to the Sprint and Nextel brands than switched from Sprint and Nextel. It was also the first time that the Sprint brand, which was net port positive for its third consecutive quarter was net port positive against every major competitor. 
The Sprint branded postpaid subscriber base, which increased by another 519,000 customers in the fourth quarter, is the fastest growing in the country among major wireless carriers as the Sprint brand was net add positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our postpaid's share of gross adds improved year-over-year for the sixth straight quarter and was up over 300 basis points year-over-year and up 460 basis points for all of 2010 versus 2009.
We improved our share of gross adds while the percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a strong 84% as of the end of 2010. Prepaid net adds were up by a 175,000 sequentially, delivering our best prepaid Q4 net add performance ever. Our Boost, Virgin Mobile and Assurance brands also a positive net adds in the quarter.
Sprint launched 4G service in 16 new cities during the quarter including New York, San Francisco, Miami and Los Angeles6. Sprint 4G is now available in 71 markets reaching more than 110 million people. We had strong growth in our dual-mode 3G/4G customer base, driven by our industry-leading device lineup. The EVO and Epic continue to garner even more awards and accolades in the quarter, and the announcements of the HTC EVO shift and the exclusive BlackBerry 4G PlayBook brings our industry leading 4G device lineup to 18. The EVO 4G is our fastest selling new device ever.
Moving to Slide 8. On the cash front, we maintained a strong liquidity position by generating $913 million in free cash flow for the quarter and $2.5 billion in free cash flow for the year. Quarterly adjusted OIBDA was $1.32 billion as ARPU gains were offset by the investment costs associated with more postpaid and prepaid adds and upgrades. 
Net operating revenue grew sequentially and in calendar year 2010, for the first time since 2006, our fourth quarter operating loss of $139 million showed a 74% improvement year-over-year and our annual operating loss was better by 57% versus 2009. Also in 2010, we significantly exceeded our synergy targets for the Virgin Mobile and iPCS acquisitions that we made in late 2009.
The first year of our network advantage outsourcing project with Ericsson met or exceeded its performance in financial savings objectives. Also during the fourth quarter, we announced our network vision blueprint, a multi-year initiative to enhance voice and data services, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability. 
We have selected Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson and Samsung to install new network equipment software, including multi-mode base stations over the next three to five years. The project will bring together a different spectrum bands onto a single-base station and will allow for the flexibility to offer new technologies using a range of spectrum bands.
We intend to repurpose some of our 800 megahertz spectrum for CDMA service which will enhance coverage and in particular, the in-building experience for our customers. We also expect to launch the next generation of push-to-talk services in 2011 on the CDMA network, offering customers subsecond call set of time along with robust data capabilities. It is expected that iDEN cell sites will be phased out beginning in 2013.
Currently, we are conducting laboratory testing and expect to begin field integration testing around the middle of the second quarter. We expect the first upgraded cell sites to go live with the new equipment in eight of the largest metro areas beginning in the August time frame. This will allow us to deliver performance improvement to as many of our customers as quickly as possible, and this will also set the stage for cost reductions starting in 2012. 
We expect that Network Vision will provide us with additional flexibility to potentially use our own spectrum and network assets to provide additional 4G capacity or use other spectrum that may be available to us in the future over our network to create further 4G capacity. If Clearwire utilizes our modernized network, there could be significant economic benefits for both companies.
So in conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we made in the fourth quarter and all of 2010. Sprint's customer experience, brand and subscriber performance all strengthened throughout the year and we generated strong cash flow too. 
Chart 9 shows the change in major carriers postpaid net subscribers versus the previous year. Sprint's annual improvement of 2.7 million net subscribers versus the previous year is unprecedented in the history of our industry. If I were to pick a sports analogy, it would be 1999's Indianapolis Colts or Arizona Diamondbacks, both which registered record-breaking turnaround years and Peyton Manning's rookie season the Colts finished 13 and three after finishing three and 13 the previous year, a 10-game improvement. And after going 65 and 97 in 1998, Diamondbacks' owner Jerry Colangelo added Randy Johnson and a number of new free agents. In 1999, they won 100 games in their division. Both teams lost in the first round of the playoffs, so in spite of their improvements, they finished the season far from satisfied but their enormous progress signaled better things to come.
In spite of very strong competitive pressures in 2011, we expect to generate positive postpaid net adds and to improve total net adds this year as compared to 2010. The company expects full year capital expenditures to be approximately $3 billion and we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow during 2011. 
I would now like to turn it over to our CFO, Bob Brust, who will talk about our financial performance in more detail. Bob?"

Moving on to Slide 10, I would like to start out by discussing revenue performance for the fourth quarter and full year. We are pleased that total consolidated revenues grew sequentially for the second consecut",1784,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving on to Slide 10, I would like to start out by discussing revenue performance for the fourth quarter and full year. 
We are pleased that total consolidated revenues grew sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. Revenues improved by 1.8% as compared to the third quarter of last year and were up 5.5% compared to the year-ago period. The sequential and year-over-year improvements were driven by higher equipment and wireless service revenues, partially offset by lower Wireline revenue. Acquisitions completed in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2009 also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. 
Wireless service revenues grew sequentially, primarily due to a higher average revenue per user for postpaid. Growth in the number of prepaid subscribers also drove sequential improvement in wireless service revenues. Postpaid ARPU, while still rounding to $55, benefited sequentially from higher monthly recurring charges, including a $10 premium data services add-on, an improvement in care cost partially offset by lower usage base charges.  
We expect postpaid ARPU to grow in 2011 due to continued growth in smart phone sales and the $10 premium data service charge, which now applies to all smart phones activated since January 30. We project prepaid ARPU will decline slightly in 2011 due primarily to the continued success of Assurance wireless and our Boost with Shrinkage program, which we announced last October. 
Boost with Shrinkage allows customers to reduce their bills in increments of $5 after six on-time payments to as low as $35 per month. We believe the program will lead to higher price satisfaction amongst our customers and lower churn.
Postpaid subscriber losses in 2010 slowed significantly as compared to 2009, improving by nearly 2.7 million on a full year basis. Although we still lost postpaid subscribers for the full year, we are very pleased with the improvement we saw throughout 2010, including the net addition of 58,000 postpaid subscribers during the fourth quarter. 
The improvement in postpaid subscriber results and continued growth in prepaid subscribers, along with fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions, have been the key drivers in stabilizing revenue in 2010. In 2011, we expect wireless service revenues to grow, Wireline revenue decline and total consolidated operating revenues to be stable to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving to Slide 11. As Dan mentioned, we had a good quarter in terms of free cash flow, generating $913 million during the quarter. This was up from $384 million in the third quarter, due in part to favorable working capital changes, a one-time federal tax stimulus refund of $153 million and lower sequential scheduled interest payments. 
For the full year 2010, we generated a total of $2.5 billion of free cash flow, which was approximately $300 million lower than last year. The decrease in free cash flow was roughly equal to the increase in CapEx between the two years. 
Looking ahead, we expect first quarter free cash flow to be lower sequentially. The primary reasons for the projected sequential decline includes scheduled higher interest payments and the expected reversal of other working capital changes, which benefited the fourth quarter. Additionally, the tax stimulus refund received during the quarter is not expected to recur and we intend to make pension contributions totaling approximately $150 million, with the majority of it occurring in the first quarter. We expect to continue to generate positive free cash for the total year 2011.
We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. At the end of 2010, we repaid a $1.65 billion note that came due in January 2011. That was our only note maturity during 2011. 
In January, we amended our export development Canada loan to extend the maturity on a portion of the $750 million originally due in the first quarter of 2012. We extended $500 million of this facility through December of 2015, while the remaining $250 million will still mature in March of 2012. As a result, 2012 maturities decreased from $2.75 billion to $2.25 billion.
Capital expenditures were $608 million in the fourth quarter compared to $462 million in the third quarter and $554 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Total capital expenditures for 2010 were slightly over $1.9 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. Capital investment in 2010 focused on wireless quality, coverage and capacity to maintain our competitive position and data services and network quality. As Dan talked about earlier, we expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, including about $500 million of incremental spend due to the Network Vision program.
Originally, we had planned to spend about $2.5 billion in CapEx in 2011, including expenditures to add data capacity. Some of the capital assumed in the original plan will be substituted with spend through the Network Vision program. Keep in mind, the $500 million I referenced is incremental spend. Total capital expenditures related to Network Vision in 2011 will likely be higher than $500 million.
The total incremental cost of the Network Vision program over the estimated three- to five-year deployment program is expected to be between $4 billion and $5 billion. We expect that just over 50% of the incremental cost will be capital, while the remainder will be operating expenses. We plan on ramping up capital expenditures related to Network Vision in the second half of 2011, with the highest levels of capital investment taking place in 2012 and 2013.
We spent approximately $450 million on re-banding for the full year 2010 and are targeting to spend a similar amount in 2011. Some spend that was originally expected to occur in 2010 will likely occur in 2011 due to the timing of certain licensee reconfigurations.
Moving on to Slide 12. I will talk about the drivers of the sequential change in consolidated adjusted OIBDA. As Dan mentioned, consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.315 billion, down $24 million sequentially and down $94 million from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 50 basis point sequentially. 
Adjusted OIBDA declines sequentially primarily due to a higher net subsidy and sales and marketing costs, which were partially offset by higher service revenue and lower cost of service. SG&A increased sequentially, primarily due to higher fourth quarter media spend and selling expenses associated with stronger retail, gross adds and upgrades. Retail gross adds increased by approximately 5% as compared to the third quarter. The sequential increase in net subsidy was driven mostly by a higher postpaid and prepaid handset sales and also higher postpaid subsidies per device sold due primarily to the continued growth in the smartphone mix.
Cost of service was lower sequentially due largely to the effects of seasonally, including lower service seasonality including lower service and repair and cell site utility expenses. Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially as the revenue decline was mostly offset by a decline in cost of service. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume, which also drove the improvement in the positive service. Looking ahead, we are forecasting Wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline significantly in 2011.
The schedule migration of wholesale camera VoIP customers off of Sprint's Wireline platform is expected because Wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $25 million sequentially in the first quarter and slightly less than $200 million for the full year 2011. We expect the migration of our largest VoIP customer to last through 2014. 
At the beginning of each year, we re-established intercompany rates for transactions between our segments, which are generally dependent based on market rates. Over the past several years, there has been an industry-wide trend of lower rates due to increased competition of other Wireline and wireless communications companies as well as cable and Internet service providers. The change for this year will have no impact on the consolidated adjusted OIBDA but is projected to result in a decline to Wireline OIBDA of approximately $250 million for the full year. The sequential decline in first quarter is expected to be approximately $60 million.
On a full year basis, we are pleased with our cost managing results resulted in significant consolidated operating expense savings in 2010. Headcount reductions in 2009 resulted in savings of approximately $150 million last year. We also realized service and repairs savings of about $150 million, primarily driven by a focus on repairing customers’ handsets and using refurbished devices instead of using new devices for replacing. We saw an improvement in our marketing productivity as well as lower customer care costs as we continue to reduce call volumes, primarily due to fewer calls per subscriber. As a result of these savings, we were able to offset some of the increased costs associated with higher retail gross add and growing subsidy expense. 
As Dan mentioned, our consolidated net operating revenues grew by approximately $300 million year-over-year, and operating expenses declined by approximately $500 million in 2010, resulting in a greater than 50% reduction in the company's operating loss. As I stated earlier, despite pressure related to scheduled migration of cable VoIP customers, we expect total consolidated operating revenues to be stable to slightly up in 2011. Growing revenues and improving our cost structure is key to improving long-term margin. 
The Network Vision project significantly improved our cost structure and is expected to yield $10 billion to $11 billion in net benefits over a seven-year time frame. We should start seeing benefits from reduced roaming and backhaul cost in 2012 with expected margin expansion starting in 2013. We expect that 2014 will be the first year in which benefits should more than offset the incremental OpEx and CapEx. We currently assume that the project should breakeven on a cumulative cash flow basis in 2015.
We expect that subsidies and growth in data usage will continue to place pressure on margins through 2011 and anticipate that postpaid ARPU growth and continued focus on cost management should offset some of that pressure. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter will likely be relatively stable sequentially. 
In summary, we are pleased with the recent improvements in subscriber and revenue performance. We look forward to focus on revenue growth and cash in 2011. Looking back on my time at Sprint, I'm encouraged by how far the company has come. When I joined the team about three years ago, the company was in a very difficult position. However, despite sizable economic headwinds and tough competition, the team managed to stabilize and even began to grow the business. 
Sprint will continue to face new challenges down the road. However, as I prepare to return to the beach, I am confident that the company is in good hands. Now back to Yijing for questions."

And fundamentally, what drove it was that smartphone users used a lot more of our network than non-smartphone users.

And to be able to maintain that, we felt this was the right thing to do rather than go into a metered approach for those higher-end users. So that was really the driver. And I wouldn’t signal at this point looking at doing it for other devices but, again, your question was really what drove it and it was really the additional cost of service on smart devices because the usage has been increasing fairly substantially year-over-year.

So it feels like in the Wireless business, there's going to be, I don't know, $200 million, $300 million, $400 million of incremental expense coming in the second half. But then I guess I think I also heard you say that you're going to change the cost allocations where wireless is going to be paying the Wireline business about $250 million less, and that's going to start at the beginning of the year.

If you think about 50% of the incremental spend is OpEx over the period, and the way I’d look at that is break that into two halves. First half, and that is, when we are at cell sites and for a few months at each cell site, we're going to have an overlapping rent. So that increase happens, and it is really as we're building out over time, so not loaded into this year at all. Second thing to look at in terms of the expense is actually the migration of our iDEN customers and the cost of that. And that's quite back-end loaded because, of course, we're having -- iDEN's still going to be around until 2013. We're doing a lot of work in terms of migration now but we're not spending a lot of OpEx. And so we're anticipating in the 2013 period to be looking at migration cost. So that's the way I would sort of characterize the 50% OpEx spending."

Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. 
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including part 1, item 1-a of our Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2010.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the first quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our loss per share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the first quarter were $0.15, compared to $0.31 in the fourth quarter 2010 and $0.29 in the year ago period. 
The improvement in loss per share as compared to the fourth quarter 2010 was partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in Adjusted OIBDA., which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. 
In addition, loss per share improved sequentially due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization and interest expense. The reduction in interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized, which is related to our intention to deploy certain spectrum licenses as part of Network Vision, that were not previously utilized. We expect full year capitalized interest related to these spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million.
Looking ahead, at depreciation and amortization, the successful testing of Push-to-Talk technology on the CDMA network as part of the deployment of Network Vision in our test markets during the remainder of the year is expected to result in accelerated depreciation and amortization on certain assets. 
We recorded a net tax expense of $37 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to the temporary  difference associated with amortization of our spectrum. 
For tax reporting purposes, the spectrum intangible is amortized, so for financial reporting, it is considered an indefinite life asset with no associate amortization. Therefore, rather than expressing our income tax expense as a percentage of pretax loss as we did at year end in prior, we are now providing our expectations in terms of net tax expense to provide a clear view of our tax outlook. 
For the full year 2011, we expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

First, our thoughts and prayers are with the people in the southern unit states in the wake of the tragic tornadoes that have touched down there and Sprint will do all we can to help with that tragic situation. 
While this is my 13th quarter at Sprint and it sure beats reporting the results after my first quarter on the job, which was the fourth quarter of 2008. Driven by customer service and sub-prime issues, that quarter I reported the worst postpaid churn since the Sprint Nextel merger 2.45%. 
By contrast, this quarter, I'm reporting the best quarterly postpaid churn in Sprint's long history. We continue to make slow but steady progress with respect to our goals of improving the customer experience, strengthening our brand and generating cash. 
This quarter's performance is particularly noteworthy because of the unique changes in the first quarter's market dynamic. Verizon announced its iPhone and AT&T responded with price as even if duopoly  provides more competition than the device monopoly. 
Even with these headwinds, because of our relentless focus on improving the customer experience, we felt we could increase our price per data on smart devices so that we could maintain Sprint's unique customer friendly unlimited and worry-free data plans.
Our strengthening brand help us mitigate what otherwise would have been difficult to navigate, increasing our price in the face of a new iconic competitive device and widespread industry price pressure.
Going to Slide 4. Beginning with our first goal, the customer experience. I am pleased to report our 13th consecutive quarter of improved customer satisfaction with Care and First Call Resolution. It's a tough street to keep going as the bar keeps getting higher. Our top box and bottom box satisfaction scores also reached best ever levels according to the Advanis survey. 
In spite of the increased complexity inherent customer questions generated by smartphones which reached an all-time high of 73% of quarterly CDMA sales and 54% of the base, calls to care per customer decreased yet again to another all-time low, achieving industry best in class levels.
We were recently named by J.D. Power 2011 Customer Service Champion, one of only 40 U.S. companies to earn this distinction across 800 companies assessed across 12 industries. 
Also in the quarter, a very well-known third party report evaluating our CDMA service rated us best in the industry and customer service satisfaction, and we also maintained our number 1 ranking for data network satisfaction. 
Based on internal metrics, our iDEN network achieved best ever performance for blocks and drops.
If you please go to Slide 5, our brand continues to strengthen. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the Sprint brand was the fastest-growing national postpaid wireless brand in the country as measured by net subscriber growth. The Sprint brand added 310,000 net postpaid subscribers and our entire postpaid business was net port positive versus our competition for the second consecutive quarter. 
Last quarter, was the first time our postpaid business had ever achieved being net port positive come including the Nextel brand. 
Unlike last quarter, the gains in Sprint brand customers did not fully offset the decline in Nextel customers, but our postpaid subscriber loss number improved 80% versus last year.
Our total company net assets of $1.12 million versus a net loss 1 year ago was our highest number in 5 years in our retail net adds of 732,000 was also a 5-year best. 
The quarter's NPV was churn. We registered our best postpaid churn number ever and the best year-over-year improvement we've made and quarterly churn in 5 years. 
In Sprint's entire history, if you were to pick the 4 best individual quarters for churn ever, those 4 would be the last 4. Prepaid churn was also strong hitting our lowest level in over 5 years.
Turning to Slide 6 as you know subscriber performance depends upon a strong brand. The Reputation Institute is a very well-respected research organization that publishes its findings on corporate reputation each year in Forbes Magazine. Their extensive research has found that 7 factors drive a company's reputation, which is arguably synonymous with a holistic measure of the company's brand. 
These 7 factors our performance, products and services, leadership, governance, the workplace, system ship and innovation. 
We recently learned that of the 1500 large companies that the Reputation Institute includes in its worldwide survey, they found that from 2009 to 2010 Sprint's corporate reputation was the most improved of any company in the world and Sprint showed 1 of the largest gains they've ever seen in any year by any company.
We are seeing other brand metrics improve as well, with purchase consideration and first brand preference achieving best ever levels in the quarter. 
Our net promoter score according to our recent Yankee group study improved far more than for any carrier over the past year, which is consistent with the results of another very well-known third-party study. 
Our brand stretches beyond the consumer market. Atlantic ACM recently ranked Sprint the number 1 brand for the first time for U.S. Wholesale Excellence and for Global Wholesale Excellence. Sprint achieved additional number 1 rankings for U.S. provisioning, network and customer service and for global voice value.
Moving onto prepaid, which is on Slide 7. We achieved our best ever quarter for prepaid net adds, 842,000, with each of our brands, boost, Virgin and Assurance posting positive gains and as I mentioned, our best prepaid churn in over 5 years. 
Boost won the 2011 J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction awards for non-contract or prepaid services. Purchase consideration for both Boost and Virgin were also had best ever levels last quarter.
Our device leadership is also key to the brand. As is the innovation and citizenship demonstrated through our green initiatives. The new Samsung replenish pictured on Slide 8, our fourth green phones sets a new benchmark for renewable devices. It's made with 82% recycled materials, housed and recycled plastics and it's energy-efficient and built with far fewer environmentally sensitive materials than a typical smart phone. 
We're pricing this Android 2.2 touch qwerty smartphone at only $49. We're also making available another technical breakthrough of back panel that is solar charger as a $29 accessory. 
Our green products do well, but they haven't reached mainstream status. So to take Green mainstream, we're lowering the monthly rate for the smartphone only by $10 a month for new or existing customers.
Sprint has launched or announced 22 4G devices, the largest 4G portfolio of any wireless carrier in the U.S. During the first quarter, Sprint launched its third 4G phone the HTC EVO Shift 4G and the Overdrive Pro 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot by Sierra wireless. 
In addition, we announced the upcoming availability of two 4G tablets, the BlackBerry 4G PlayBook and HTC EVO View 4G, as well as 2 more handsets including the HTC EVO 3D and the Nexus S 4G from Google. 
Sprint dominated the device recognition coming out of the recent CEIG show in Orlando. You've got to see the no glasses 3D screen on the new EVO 3D to believe it.
Turning to Slide 9 and our final priority, cash. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.541 billion and represented the highest sequential percentage improvement in OIBDA over 5 years and the first year-over-year increase in OIBDA in over 4 years. The main reason for this improvement beyond normal seasonality is ARPU, mainly postpaid, but also prepaid. 
Postpaid ARPU showed both its biggest year-over-year gain and largest sequential increase in over 5 years. Wireless service revenue grew sequentially 2.9%, the highest increase in 4.5 years. 
Cash flow remain positive and in the first quarter, we paid off all of 2011's remaining maturities.
Finally, I'd like to take some comments about the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T. It's a well-known fact that innovation and competition go hand-in-hand. Innovation and customer choice would be threatened if it wobble were created. 
As investors in this industry, I bet there are a few listeners on this call that would like to see wireless prices rise which would be more likely in a duopoly structure, but I believe these industry benefits would be more than offset by industry health risks like the decline in innovation and creativity that could result from a duopoly.
Sprint's innovative influence on this industry demonstrates why the wireless industry is much better off by having a strong number 3 player. I think there's little doubt Sprint's leadership in rolling out the first national 4G network greatly influenced Verizon's decision to pressure the industry suppliers to accelerate the market availability timetables for the LTE standard and Verizon's own timetable to rollout 4G services, which in turn accelerated AT&T's deployment timetable for 4G. 
As a result, after losing global wireless technology leadership when Europe introduce d2G with GSM, the U.S. has regained wireless network technology and innovation supremacy because of America's leadership in 4G. 
If Sprint had not been a legitimate high ARPU postpaid customer competitive threat, the U.S. would still be a wireless also RAM. 
Our leadership in pricing and simplicity has led others to follow to. AT&T recently enacted a rate plan in response to losing their iPhone Monopoly which looks eerily similar to Any Mobile anytime. The rate plan introduced by Sprint in 2009. 
Many of you on the phone are analysts and investors thinking about the macro impact of such a merger on our industry. It seems that some believe that a duopoly and the inherent price stability that might result for marginalizing the innovative number 3 competitor is a good thing for carriers, anyway, if not for other wireless industry suppliers and participants, based upon the increases in the AT&T and Verizon stock prices since the proposed merger was announced, but I don't think enough thought has been given to the likely reduction in wireless innovation, the possibility of more regulation to make up for the loss of competitive market forces and the influence more regulation could have in diverting away investment dollars from wireless to say nothing of the impact for carry duopoly could have on other industry players like network infrastructure or handset suppliers or approximately developers. 
Sprint is pro-competitive and our investment thesis is that all votes will float higher in a vibrant and innovative industry especially in industry that has unbridled potential of wireless.
Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Joe Euteneuer, who wasn't here in the first quarter but who has come up to speed remarkably quickly who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Thank you."

I'd like to start out by saying how excited I am to have joined Sprint. In my short-term time so far, I've been very impressed by the team that Dan has assembled and I look forward to helping Sprint realize the full potential of the opportunities ahead of us.
Moving onto Slide 10, I'd like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the first quarter. Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues grew slightly as growth in wireless service revenues were offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue and Wireline revenue. 
Total consolidated revenues grew by 2.8%, compared to the year ago period, primarily due to higher ARPU in postpaid and prepaid subscribers, growth in the number of prepaid subscribers and higher wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers and lower Wireline revenues.
Wireless service revenues which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues improved by 2.9% as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, and 3.7% as compared to the year ago period. 
The sequential and year-over-year improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid and prepaid ARPU and growth in prepaid net subscribers. 
Postpaid ARPU improved by nearly $1 as compared to the fourth quarter 2010 and as Dan mentioned, this was the largest sequential improvement in over 5 years.
Postpaid ARPU benefited sequentially from higher monthly recurring charges, primarily related to the $10 premium data add-on charge which we have applied to all smart phones activated since January 30. We expect sequential growth in postpaid ARPU in the second quarter due to continued growth in smartphone sales and the $10 premium data add-on charge.
Prepaid ARPU improved sequentially driven by growth in Boost Mobile ARPU, an improvement in rate plan mix among our Virgin Mobile Beyond Talk customer base. 
Looking forward, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base, among our brands can cause overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short-term. 
In 2011, we continue to expect wireless service revenues to grow, Wireline revenue to decline and total consolidated net operating revenues to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving on to Slide 11. I'll talk about the drivers of consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. As Dan mentioned, consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was slightly over $1.5 billion, up $199 million sequentially and $36 million from the year ago quarter. 
Consolidated Adjusted OIBDA grew year-over-year for the first time in over 4 years. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved 230 basis points sequentially, the largest improvement in almost 4 years. Wireless Adjusted OIBDA grew sequentially primarily due to growth in wireless service revenues and reduced net subsidy and sales cost driven by fewer postpaid gross adds and upgrades.
Wireless cost of service was slightly higher sequentially as the benefit related to the change in intercompany rates was offset by higher cost, including increased 4G wholesale costs from growth in a number of 4G smartphones and the settlement of the pricing dispute with Clearwire, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Wireline Adjusted OIBDA declined as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to lower revenue associated with the intercompany rate change and the migration of wholesale cable, voice over IP subscribers off of Sprint's Wireline platform. 
As a reminder, each year, we update our intercompany rates for transactions between our Wireline and wireless segments to better reflect market-based pricing.
The change has no impact on consolidated Adjusted OIBDA, but does have a positive impact on wireless cost of service and an equally offsetting negative impact on Wireline revenue as compared to prior periods. 
As previously communicated, net impact is expected to be slightly less than $250 million for the full year 2011 and was approximately $60 million sequentially for the first quarter. 
We previously expected a sequential decline in the first quarter in both Wireline Adjusted OIBDA of $25 million related to the cable, voice over IP migration. However, the sequential impact was less than expected due to migration to lace by our wholesale partners. 
In addition, cost reductions offset some of this sequential decline in Wireline Adjusted OIBDA.
Due to the timing of migrations, we now expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voice over IP customers to cause Wireline Adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year 2011 as compared to our previous expectation of slightly less than $200 million for 2011. We continue to expect the cable voice over IP migration to last through 2014.
Again, we are pleased with the consolidated Adjusted OIBDA results for the quarter given that we face a number of postpaid competitive pressures in the first quarter, including device launches as well as service plan and device pricing changes. 
We expect the competitive environment to remain challenging in 2011. However, we are encouraged by the consistent improvement we have seen in the Sprint brand and continue to focus on making further progress on postpaid subscriber results. 
We expect for the full year that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid subscribers will benefit Adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by negative impacts of entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in Wireline cable voice over IP revenues and higher wireless costs of service driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly competitive handset pricing environment.
As a result, we expect for the full year 2011 Adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat with 2010, excluding incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200 million and $250 million.
Now moving onto slide 12. We ended the quarter with approximately $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We also had $800 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver for a total liquidity position of $4.8 billion as of the end of the first quarter. 
We repaid the $1.65 billion note in January 2011 which is our only note maturity due in 2011. Our next note and loan maturities totaling $2.25 billion are not due until March of 2012. 
Going forward, we plan to continue to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach allowing for repayment of debt, investing in capital expenditures, our accrued capital expenditures excluding capital interest for $555 million in the first quarter, compared to $608 million in the first quarter of 2010 and $419 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
Capital investment in the first quarter continue to focus on wireless quality and capacity. We continue to expect the full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest, driven largely by CDMA capacity in Network Vision.
We generated $178 million in free cash flow in the first quarter. This was down from the $913 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a 1-time federal tax stimulus refund of approximately $153 million received in the fourth quarter of 2010, approximately $150 million in higher cash interest payments, which is typical for the first quarter of each year, a $100 million pension contribution and other working capital changes. 
We intend to make additional pension contributions during the remainder of 2011, totaling approximately $35 million. 
Looking ahead, we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011. However, our 2011 annual free cash flow is expected to be substantially lower than in 2010, due to the rollout of Network Vision.
Now moving onto Slide 13. As a reminder, the goals of our Network Vision initiative are to enhance voice and data services for our customers, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability. 
With this project, we believe we will be installing new equipment and software, including multi-mode base stations, allowing for the flexibility to offer multiple technology standards using a range of spectrum brands. 
As part of Network Vision, we also intend to repurpose some of our 800 megahertz spectrum for CDMA service to enhance coverage for customers and launch the next generation of Push to Talk services in 2011 on the CDMA network. 
As previously stated, it is expected that iDEN cell services will be phased out beginning in 2013.
 
The Network Vision project progressed well through the first quarter. We will continue to conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field and we expect to begin initial deployment in 8 of the largest Metro markets following successful testing in early fourth quarter. 
Our expectations of the costs and benefits related to Network Vision are unchanged since the program was initially announced. As previously stated, the Network Vision project is expected to yield $10 billion to $11 billion in net benefits over a 7-year time frame. 
The total incremental cost to the Network Vision program over to estimated 3 to 5-year deployment period is expected to be between $4 billion and $5 billion. We project that slightly over 50% of the incremental cost will be capital while the remainder will be operating expenses. We plan on ramping up capital expenditures related to Network Vision for the remainder of 2011. 
As part of our 4G strategy, we have amended our agreement with Clearwire for wholesale pricing. The agreement resulted in simplify data usage base pricing structures. As previously disclosed, we have agreed to pay Clearwire $175 million in prepayments for 4G wholesale services to be used in 2011 and beyond and minimum usage commitments of $300 million in 2011 and $550 million in 2012.
Additionally, we look forward to expanding our 4G capabilities through custom network solution deployments and rewholesale and services which will be possible under this new agreement. 
In February, we shared that we would provide our long-term 4G strategy by mid-year. We are still on target to provide our plans within this timeframe. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets and also to deploy spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides us the opportunities to provide 4G services that were not available in the past. 
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011, which we have reconfirmed today. The company expects postpaid subscriber net additions for the full year 2011 into an improved total wireless net subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. 
We expect full year capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $3 billion. 
In addition, the company expects to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011. 
In conclusion, one of the things that impress me the most about the predecessor is his relentless focus on controlling costs. You can expect to see the same for me. Sprint is clearly shown progress on improving revenue trends over the last several quarters and we have a place, a plan in place with Network Vision which we believe will significantly improve the cost structure of the business over the longer-term. 
As I look forward to remainder of 2011 and beyond, maximizing shareholder value and cash flow will be a primarily objective for the business. 
Again, I'd like to reiterate how excited I am about the opportunities ahead for Sprint and I look forward to talking to all of you more in the future.

Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. 
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and, when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the first quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our loss per share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the first quarter were $0.15, compared to $0.31 in the fourth quarter 2010 and $0.29 in the year ago period. 
The improvement in loss per share as compared to the fourth quarter 2010 was partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. 
In addition, loss per share improved sequentially due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization and interest expense. The reduction in interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in amount of interest capitalized, which is related to our intention to deploy certain spectrum licenses as part of Network Vision, that were not previously utilized. We expect full year capitalized interest related to these spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million.
Looking ahead at depreciation and amortization, the successful testing of push-to-talk technology on the CDMA network as part of the deployment of Network Vision in our test markets during the remainder of the year is expected to result in accelerated depreciation and amortization on certain assets. 
We recorded a net tax expense of $37 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to the temporary  difference associated with amortization of our spectrum. 
For tax reporting purposes, the spectrum intangible is amortized. So for financial reporting, it is considered an indefinite life asset with no associate amortization. Therefore, rather than expressing our income tax expense as a percentage of pretax loss as we did at year end in prior, we're now providing our expectations in terms of net tax expense to provide a clearer view of our tax outlook. 
For the full year 2011, we expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

First, our thoughts and prayers are with the people in the Southern United States in the wake of the tragic tornadoes that have touched down there and Sprint will do all we can to help with that tragic situation. 
While this is my 13th quarter at Sprint and it sure beats reporting the results after my first quarter on the job, which was the first quarter of 2008. Driven by customer service and sub-prime issues, that quarter I reported the worst postpaid churn since the Sprint Nextel merger, 2.45%. 
By contrast, this quarter, I'm reporting the best quarterly postpaid churn in Sprint's long history. We continue to make slow but steady progress with respect to our goals of improving the customer experience, strengthening our brand and generating cash. 
This quarter's performance is particularly noteworthy because of the unique changes in the first quarter's market dynamic. Verizon announced its iPhone and AT&T responded with price as even if duopoly provides more competition than device monopoly. 
Even with these headwinds, because of our relentless focus on improving the customer experience, we felt we could increase our price per data on smart devices so that we could maintain Sprint's unique, customer friendly, unlimited and worry-free data plans.
Our strengthening brand help us mitigate what otherwise would have been difficult to navigate, increasing our price in the face of a new iconic competitive device and widespread industry price pressure.
Going to Slide 4. Beginning with our first goal, the customer experience, I am pleased to report our 13th consecutive quarter of improved customer satisfaction with Care and First Call Resolution. It's a tough street to keep going as the bar keeps getting higher. Our top box and bottom box satisfaction scores also reached best ever levels according to the Advanis survey. 
In spite of the increased complexity in inherent customer questions generated by smartphones which reached an all-time high of 73% of quarterly CDMA device sales and 54% of the base, calls to care per customer decreased yet again to another all-time low, achieving industry best in class levels.
We were recently named the J.D. Power 2011 Customer Service Champion, one of only 40 U.S. companies to earn this distinction across 800 companies assessed across 12 industries. 
Also in the quarter, a very well-known third party report evaluating our CDMA service rated us best in the industry in customer service satisfaction, and we also maintained our number one ranking for data network satisfaction. 
Based on internal metrics, our iDEN network achieved best ever performance for blocks and drops.
If you'd please go to Slide 5, our brand continues to strengthen. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the Sprint brand was the fastest-growing national postpaid wireless brand in the country as measured by net subscriber growth. The Sprint brand added 310,000 net postpaid subscribers and our entire Postpaid business was net port positive versus our competition for the second consecutive quarter. 
Last quarter was the first time our Postpaid business had ever achieved being net port positive come including the Nextel brand. 
Unlike last quarter, the gains in Sprint brand customers did not fully offset the decline in Nextel customers, but our postpaid subscriber loss number improved 80% versus last year.
Our total company net adds of 1.12 million versus the net loss one year ago was our highest number in five years in our retail net adds of 732,000 was also a five-year best. 
The quarter's MVP was churn. We registered our best postpaid churn number ever and the best year-over-year improvement we've made in quarterly churn in five years. 
In Sprint's entire history, if you were to pick the four best individual quarters for churn, those four would be the last four. Prepaid churn was also strong hitting our lowest level in over five years.
Turning to Slide 6. As you know, subscriber performance depends upon a strong brand. The Reputation Institute is a very well-respected research organization that publishes its findings on corporate reputation each year in Forbes Magazine. Their extensive research has found that seven factors drive a company's reputation, which is arguably synonymous with a holistic measure of a company's brand. 
These seven factors are: performance, products and services, leadership, governance, the workplace, citizenship and innovation. 
We recently learned that of the 1,500 large companies that the Reputation Institute includes in its worldwide survey, they found that from 2009 to 2010 Sprint's corporate reputation was the most improved of any company in the world and Sprint showed one of the largest gains they've ever seen in any year by any company.
We are seeing other brand metrics improve as well, with purchase consideration and first brand preference achieving best ever levels in the quarter. 
Our net promoter score according to our recent Yankee Group study improved far more than for any carrier over the past year, which is consistent with the results of another very well-known third-party study. 
Our brand stretches beyond the consumer market. ATLANTIC-ACM recently ranked Sprint the number one brand for the first time for U.S. wholesale excellence and for global wholesale excellence. Sprint achieved additional number one rankings for U.S. provisioning, network and customer service and for global voice value.
Moving onto prepaid, which is on Slide 7. We achieved our best ever quarter for prepaid net adds, 846,000, with each of our brands, Boost, Virgin and Assurance posting positive gains. And as I mentioned, our best prepaid churn in over five years. 
Boost won the 2011 J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction awards for non-contract or prepaid services. Purchase Consideration for both Boost and Virgin were also at best ever levels last quarter.
Our device leadership is also key to the brand, as is the innovation and citizenship demonstrated through our green initiatives. The new Samsung Replenish pictured on Slide 8, our fourth green phones, sets a new benchmark for renewable devices. It's made with 82% recycled materials, housed in recycled plastics and it's energy-efficient and built with far fewer environmentally sensitive materials than a typical smart phone. 
We're pricing this Android 2.2 touch qwerty smartphone at only $49. We're also making available another technical breakthrough, a back panel that's a solar charger as a $29 accessory. 
Our green products do well, but they haven't reached mainstream status. So to take Green mainstream, we're lowering the monthly rate for this smartphone only by $10 a month for new or existing customers.
Sprint has launched or announced 22 4G devices, the largest 4G portfolio of any wireless carrier in the U.S. During the first quarter, Sprint launched its third 4G phone the HTC EVO Shift 4G and the Overdrive Pro 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot by Sierra Wireless.
In addition, we announced the upcoming availability of two 4G tablets, the BlackBerry 4G PlayBook and HTC EVO View 4G, as well as two more handsets including the HTC EVO 3D and the Nexus S 4G from Google. 
Sprint dominated the device recognition coming out of the recent CTIA show in Orlando. You've got to see the no glasses 3D screen on the new EVO 3D to believe it.
Turning to Slide 9 and our final priority, cash. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.514 billion and represented the highest sequential percentage improvement in OIBDA in over five years and the first year-over-year increase in OIBDA in over four years. The main reason for this improvement beyond normal seasonality is ARPU, mainly postpaid, but also prepaid. Postpaid ARPU showed both its biggest year-over-year gain and largest sequential increase in over five years. Wireless service revenue grew sequentially 2.9%, the highest increase in 4.5 years. 
Cash flow remain positive and in the first quarter, we paid off all of 2011's remaining maturities.
Finally, I'd like to make some comments about the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T. It's a well-known fact that innovation and competition go hand-in-hand. Innovation and customer choice would be threatened if a duopoly were created. 
As investors in this industry, I bet there are a few listeners on this call that would like to see wireless prices rise which would be more likely in a duopoly structure. But I believe these industry benefits would be more than offset by industry health risks like the decline in innovation and creativity that could result from a duopoly.
Sprint's innovative influence on this industry demonstrates why the wireless industry is much better off by having a strong #3 player. I think there's little doubt Sprint's leadership in rolling out the first national 4G network greatly influenced Verizon's decision to pressure the industry suppliers to accelerate the market availability timetables for the LTE standard in Verizon's own timetable to rollout 4G services, which in turn, accelerated AT&T's deployment timetable for 4G. 
As a result, after losing global wireless technology leadership when Europe introduce 2G with GSM, the U.S. has regained wireless network technology and innovation supremacy because of America's leadership in 4G. 
If Sprint had not been a legitimate high ARPU postpaid customer competitive threat, the U.S. would still be a wireless also-ran. 
Our leadership in pricing and in simplicity has led others to follow too. AT&T recently enacted a rate plan in response to losing their iPhone monopoly, which looks eerily similar to Any Mobile, Anytime, the rate plan introduced by Sprint in 2009. 
Many of you on the phone are analysts and investors thinking about the macro impact of such a merger on our industry. It seems that some believe that a duopoly and the inherent price stability that might result for marginalizing the innovative #3 competitor is a good thing for carriers, anyway, if not for other wireless industry suppliers and participants, based upon the increases in the AT&T and Verizon stock prices since the proposed merger was announced. But I don't think enough thought has been given to the likely reduction in wireless innovation, the possibility of more regulation to make up for the loss of competitive market forces in the influence more regulation could have on diverting away investment dollars from wireless to say nothing of the impact a carrier duopoly could have on other industry players like network infrastructure or handset suppliers or app developers. 
Sprint is pro-competitive and our investment thesis is that all votes will float higher in a vibrant and innovative industry especially in the industry that has the unbridled potential of wireless.
Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Joe Euteneuer, who wasn't here in the first quarter but who has come up to speed remarkably quickly, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Thank you."

In my short time here so far, I have been very impressed by the team that Dan has assembled and I look forward to helping Sprint realize the full potential of the opportunities ahead of us.
Moving onto Slide 10. I'd like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the first quarter. Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues grew slightly as growth in wireless service revenues were offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue and Wireline revenue. 
Total consolidated revenues grew by 2.8%, compared to the year ago period, primarily due to higher ARPU in postpaid and prepaid subscribers, growth in the number of prepaid subscribers and higher wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers and lower Wireline revenues.
Wireless service revenues which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues improved by 2.9% as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, and 3.7% as compared to the year ago period. 
The sequential and year-over-year improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid and prepaid ARPU and growth in prepaid net subscribers. 
Postpaid ARPU improved by nearly $1 as compared to the fourth quarter 2010 and as Dan mentioned, this was the largest sequential improvement in over five years.
Postpaid ARPU benefited sequentially from higher monthly recurring charges, primarily related to the $10 premium data add-on charge which we have applied to all smartphones activated since January 30. We expect sequential growth in postpaid ARPU in the second quarter due to continued growth in smartphone sales and the $10 premium data add-on charge.
Prepaid ARPU improved sequentially driven by growth in Boost Mobile ARPU, an improvement in rate plan mix among our Virgin Mobile Beyond Talk customer base. 
Looking forward, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cause overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short-term. 
In 2011, we continue to expect wireless service revenues to grow, Wireline revenue to decline and total consolidated net operating revenues to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving on to Slide 11. I'll talk about the drivers of consolidated adjusted OIBDA. As Dan mentioned, consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was slightly over $1.5 billion, up $199 million sequentially and $36 million from the year ago quarter. 
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA grew year-over-year for the first time in over four years. Adjusted OIBDA margin improved 230 basis points sequentially, the largest improvement in almost four years. Wireless adjusted OIBDA grew sequentially primarily due to growth in wireless service revenues and reduced net subsidy and sales cost driven by fewer postpaid gross adds and upgrades.
Wireless cost of service was slightly higher sequentially as the benefit related to the change in intercompany rates was offset by higher cost, including increased 4G wholesale cost from growth in a number of 4G smartphones and the settlement of the pricing dispute with Clearwire, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Wireline adjusted OIBDA declined as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to lower revenue associated with the intercompany rate change and the migration of wholesale cable voiceover IP subscribers off of Sprint's Wireline platform. 
As a reminder, each year, we update our intercompany rates for transactions between our Wireline and Wireless segments to better reflect market-based pricing.
The change has no impact on consolidated adjusted OIBDA, but does have a positive impact on wireless cost of service and an equally offsetting negative impact on Wireline revenue as compared to prior periods. 
As previously communicated, debt impact is expected to be slightly less than $250 million for the full year 2011 and was approximately $60 million sequentially for the first quarter. 
We previously expected a sequential decline in the first quarter in Wireline adjusted OIBDA of $25 million related to the cable voiceover IP migration. However, this sequential impact was less than expected due to migration delays by our wholesale partner. 
In addition, cost reductions offset some of the sequential decline in Wireline adjusted OIBDA.
Due to the timing of migrations, we now expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voiceover IP customers to cause Wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year 2011 as compared to our previous expectation of slightly less than $200 million for 2011. We continue to expect the cable voiceover IP migration to last through 2014.
Again, we are pleased with the consolidated adjusted OIBDA results for the quarter given that we faced a number of postpaid competitive pressures in the first quarter, including device launches as well as service plan and device pricing changes. 
We expect the competitive environment to remain challenging in 2011. However, we are encouraged by the consistent improvement we have seen in the Sprint brand and continue to focus on making further progress on postpaid subscriber results. 
We expect for the full year that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid subscribers will benefit adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by negative impacts of entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in Wireline cable voiceover IP revenues and higher wireless costs of service driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly competitive handset pricing environment.
As a result, we expect for the full year 2011 adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat with 2010, excluding incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200 million and $250 million.
Now moving onto slide 12. We ended the quarter with approximately $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We also had $800 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver for a total liquidity position of $4.8 billion as of the end of the first quarter. 
We repaid the $1.65 billion note in January 2011 which was our only note maturity due in 2011. Our next note and loan maturities totaling $2.25 billion are not due until March of 2012. 
Going forward, we plan to continue to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach allowing for repayment of debt, investing in capital expenditures, and future growth. Our accrued capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest were $555 million in the first quarter, compared to $608 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $419 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
Capital investment in the first quarter continue to focus on wireless quality and capacity. We continue to expect the full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest, driven largely by CDMA capacity and Network Vision.
We generated $178 million in free cash flow in the first quarter. This was down from the $913 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a one-time federal tax stimulus refund of approximately $153 million received in the fourth quarter of 2010, approximately $150 million in higher cash interest payments, which is typical for the first quarter of each year, a $100 million pension contribution and other working capital changes. 
We intend to make additional pension contributions during the remainder of 2011, totaling approximately $35 million. 
Looking ahead, we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011. However, our 2011 annual free cash flow is expected to be substantially lower than in 2010, due to the rollout of Network Vision.
Now moving onto Slide 13. As a reminder, the goals of our Network Vision initiative are to enhance voice and data services for our customers, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability. 
With this project, we believe we will be installing new equipment and software, including multi-mode base stations, allowing for the flexibility to offer multiple technology standards using a range of spectrum brands. 
As part of Network Vision, we also intend to repurpose some of our 800 megahertz spectrum for CDMA service to enhance coverage for customers and launch the next generation of push-to-talk services in 2011 on the CDMA network. 
As previously stated, it is expected that iDEN cell services will be phased out beginning in 2013.
 
The Network Vision project progressed well through the first quarter. We will continue to conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field and we expect to begin initial deployment in eight of the largest metro markets following successful testing in early fourth quarter. 
Our expectations of the costs and benefits related to Network Vision are unchanged since the program was initially announced. As previously stated, the Network Vision project is expected to yield $10 billion to $11 billion in net benefits over a seven-year time frame. 
The total incremental cost to the Network Vision program over the estimated three- to five-year deployment period is expected to be between $4 billion and $5 billion. We project that slightly over 50% of the incremental cost will be capital while the remainder will be operating expenses. We plan on ramping up capital expenditures related to Network Vision for the remainder of 2011. 
As part of our 4G strategy, we have amended our agreement with Clearwire for wholesale pricing. The agreement resulted in simplified data usage base pricing structures. As previously disclosed, we have agreed to pay Clearwire $175 million in prepayments for 4G wholesale services to be used in 2011 and beyond and minimum usage commitments of $300 million in 2011 and $550 million in 2012.
Additionally, we look forward to expanding our 4G capabilities through custom network solution deployments and re-wholesale-ing services which will be possible under this new agreement. 
In February, we shared that we would provide our long-term 4G strategy by mid-year. We are still on target to provide our plans within this timeframe. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets and also to deploy spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides us the opportunities to provide 4G services that were not available in the past. 
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011, which we have reconfirmed today. The company expects postpaid subscriber net additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total wireless net subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. 
We expect full year capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $3 billion. 
In addition, the company expects to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011. 
In conclusion, one of the things that impressed me the most about the predecessor as his relentless focus on controlling costs. You can expect the same for me. Sprint has clearly shown progress on improving revenue trends over the last several quarters and we have a place -- a plan in place with Network Vision which we believe will significantly improve the cost structure of the business over the longer-term. 
As I look forward to remainder of 2011 and beyond, maximizing shareholder value and cash flow will be a primarily objective for the business. 
Again, I'd like to reiterate how excited I am about the opportunities ahead for Sprint and I look forward to talking to all of you more in the future. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Yijing for Q&A"

First, we don't disclose the specific numbers with respect to the $10 smartphone benefit to ARPU. Clearly, it clearly benefited ARPU in the quarter and that it will benefit postpaid ARPU next quarter because it basically was put into place at the end of January in Q1. It's not pushed on customers. The existing customers don't get an increase in price, it's only customers, in essence, gross adds or customers that upgrade to one of the smartphone devices that carry the data, the premium data charge that are affected. Second, with respect to churn and your comment about sub-prime, still in essence, last quarter, it rounded. It was $83 in change it rounded up to $84. This quarter, it's $83 in change, it rounds down to $83. There really is not a significant change at all in terms of our -- it continues to be very solid prime mix. We have seen significant improvements in voluntary churn and actually the last two quarters, we look at really what affects churn is on contract and off contract. And what we can tell -- with respect to our off contract churn, which really tells you a lot about how your customer service and loyalty is resonating with customers. The last two quarters have been our lowest two quarters -- our best two quarters ever for off contract churns. So we feel good about the progress that we've been making in churn.

We have done some things in Q1 in the market like the $10 data add-on fee, the premium data charge that we mentioned beginning April 1. So in the second quarter, our loyalty programs aren't quite as rich as they were in the past. And of course with Verizon's launch of the iPhone, it did -- in essence, what we saw was AT&T getting more aggressive in pricing T-Mobile, particularly on the device side becoming more aggressive from a price perspective as well. Kind of all, if you will, moving into not only in the first quarter but moving into the second quarter. So we'll just -- we're not expecting there to be a significant change, if you will, beyond what we've seen so far, in terms of the brand position and pricing position in the industry.

Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's first quarter 2011 earnings call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and, when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the first quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our loss per share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the first quarter were $0.15, compared to $0.31 in the fourth quarter 2010 and $0.29 in the year ago period. 
The improvement in loss per share as compared to the fourth quarter 2010 was partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. 
In addition, loss per share improved sequentially due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization and interest expense. The reduction in interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in amount of interest capitalized, which is related to our intention to deploy certain spectrum licenses as part of Network Vision, that were not previously utilized. We expect full year capitalized interest related to these spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million.
Looking ahead at depreciation and amortization, the successful testing of push-to-talk technology on the CDMA network as part of the deployment of Network Vision in our test markets during the remainder of the year is expected to result in accelerated depreciation and amortization on certain assets. 
We recorded a net tax expense of $37 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to the temporary difference associated with amortization of our spectrum. 
For tax reporting purposes, the spectrum intangible is amortized. So for financial reporting, it is considered an indefinite life asset with no associate amortization. Therefore, rather than expressing our income tax expense as a percentage of pretax loss as we did at year end and prior, we're now providing our expectations in terms of net tax expense to provide a clearer view of our tax outlook. 
For the full year 2011, we expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

And good morning and thanks for joining us. First, our thoughts and prayers are with the people in the Southern United States in the wake of the tragic tornadoes that have touched down there and Sprint will do all we can to help with that tragic situation. 
Well, this is my 13th quarter at Sprint and it sure beats reporting the results after my first quarter on the job, which was the first quarter of 2008. Driven by customer service and sub-prime issues, that quarter I reported the worst postpaid churn since the Sprint Nextel merger, 2.45%. 
By contrast, this quarter, I'm reporting the best quarterly postpaid churn in Sprint's long history. We continue to make slow but steady progress with respect to our goals of improving the customer experience, strengthening our brand and generating cash. 
This quarter's performance is particularly noteworthy because of the unique changes in the first quarter's market dynamic. Verizon announced its iPhone and AT&T responded with price as even a duopoly provides more competition than device monopoly. 
Even with these headwinds, because of our relentless focus on improving the customer experience, we felt we could increase our price for data on smart devices so that we could maintain Sprint's unique, customer friendly, unlimited and worry-free data plans.
Our strengthening brand helped us mitigate what otherwise would have been difficult to navigate, increasing our price in the face of a new iconic competitive device and widespread industry price pressure.
Going to Slide 4. Beginning with our first goal, the customer experience, I am pleased to report our 13th consecutive quarter of improved customer satisfaction with Care and First Call Resolution. It's a tough streak to keep going as the bar keeps getting higher. Our top box and bottom box satisfaction scores also reached best ever levels according to the Advanis survey.
 
In spite of the increased complexity in inherent customer questions generated by smartphones which reached an all-time high of 73% of quarterly CDMA device sales and 54% of the base, calls to care per customer decreased yet again to another all-time low, achieving industry best in class levels.
We were recently named the J.D. Power 2011 Customer Service Champion, one of only 40 U.S. companies to earn this distinction across 800 companies assessed across 12 industries. 
Also in the quarter, a very well-known third party report evaluating our CDMA service rated us best in the industry in customer service satisfaction, and we also maintained our number one ranking for data network satisfaction. 
Based on internal metrics, our iDEN network achieved best ever performance for blocks and drops.
If you'd please go to Slide 5, our brand continues to strengthen. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the Sprint brand was the fastest-growing national postpaid wireless brand in the country as measured by net subscriber growth. The Sprint brand added 310,000 net postpaid subscribers and our entire Postpaid business was net port positive versus our competition for the second consecutive quarter. 
Last quarter was the first time our Postpaid business had ever achieved being net port positive come including the Nextel brand. 
Unlike last quarter, the gains in Sprint brand customers did not fully offset the decline in Nextel customers, but our postpaid subscriber loss number improved 80% versus last year.
Our total company net adds of 1.12 million versus the net loss one year ago was our highest number in 5 years in our retail net adds of 732,000 was also a 5-year best. 
The quarter's MVP was churn. We registered our best postpaid churn number ever and the best year-over-year improvement we've made in quarterly churn in 5 years. 
In Sprint's entire history, if you were to pick the four best individual quarters for churn, those 4 would be the last 4. Prepaid churn was also strong hitting our lowest level in over 5 years.
Turning to Slide 6. As you know, subscriber performance depends upon a strong brand. The Reputation Institute is a very well-respected research organization that publishes its findings on corporate reputation each year in Forbes Magazine. Their extensive research has found that seven factors drive a company's reputation, which is arguably synonymous with a holistic measure of a company's brand.
These seven factors are: Performance; products and services; leadership; governance; the workplace; citizenship; and innovation. 
We recently learned that of the 1,500 large companies that the Reputation Institute includes in its worldwide survey, they found that from 2009 to 2010 Sprint's corporate reputation was the most improved of any company in the world and Sprint showed one of the largest gains they've ever seen in any year by any company.
We are seeing other brand metrics improve as well, with purchase consideration and first brand preference achieving best ever levels in the quarter. 
Our net promoter score according to our recent Yankee Group study improved far more than for any carrier over the past year, which is consistent with the results of another very well-known third-party study. 
Our brand stretches beyond the consumer market. ATLANTIC-ACM recently ranked Sprint the #1 brand for the first time for U.S. wholesale excellence and for global wholesale excellence. Sprint achieved additional #1 rankings for U.S. provisioning, network and customer service and for global voice value.
Moving onto prepaid, which is on Slide 7. We achieved our best ever quarter for prepaid net adds, 846,000, with each of our brands, Boost, Virgin and Assurance posting positive gains. And as I mentioned, our best prepaid churn in over 5 years. 
Boost won the 2011 J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction awards for non-contract or prepaid services. Purchase Consideration for both Boost and Virgin were also at best ever levels last quarter.
Our device leadership is also key to the brand, as is the innovation and citizenship demonstrated through our green initiatives. The new Samsung Replenish pictured on Slide 8, our fourth green phone, sets a new benchmark for renewable devices. It's made with 82% recycled materials, housed in recycled plastics and it's energy-efficient and built with far fewer environmentally sensitive materials than a typical smart phone. 
We're pricing this Android 2.2 touch qwerty smartphone at only $49. We're also making available another technical breakthrough, a back panel that's a solar charger as a $29 accessory. 
Our green products do well, but they haven't reached mainstream status. So to take Green mainstream, we're lowering the monthly rate for this smartphone only by $10 a month for new or existing customers.
Sprint has launched or announced 22 4G devices, the largest 4G portfolio of any wireless carrier in the U.S. During the first quarter, Sprint launched its third 4G phone the HTC EVO Shift 4G and the Overdrive Pro 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot by Sierra Wireless.
In addition, we announced the upcoming availability of two 4G tablets, the BlackBerry 4G PlayBook and HTC EVO View 4G, as well as two more handsets including the HTC EVO 3D and the Nexus S 4G from Google. 
Sprint dominated the device recognition coming out of the recent CTIA show in Orlando. You've got to see the no glasses 3D screen on the new EVO 3D to believe it.
Turning to Slide 9 and our final priority, cash. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.514 billion and represented the highest sequential percentage improvement in OIBDA in over 5 years and the first year-over-year increase in OIBDA in over 4 years. The main reason for this improvement beyond normal seasonality is ARPU, mainly postpaid, but also prepaid. Postpaid ARPU showed both its biggest year-over-year gain and largest sequential increase in over 5 years. Wireless service revenue grew sequentially 2.9%, the highest increase in
4 1/2 years. 
Cash flow remained positive and in the first quarter, we paid off all of 2011's remaining maturities.
Finally, I'd like to make some comments about the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T. It's a well-known fact that innovation and competition go hand-in-hand. Innovation and customer choice would be threatened if a duopoly were created. 
As investors in this industry, I bet there are a few listeners on this call that would like to see wireless prices rise which would be more likely in a duopoly structure. But I believe these industry benefits would be more than offset by industry health risks like the decline in innovation and creativity that could result from a duopoly.
Sprint's innovative influence on this industry demonstrates why the wireless industry is much better off by having a strong #3 player. I think there's little doubt Sprint's leadership in rolling out the first national 4G network greatly influenced Verizon's decision to pressure the industry suppliers to accelerate the market availability timetables for the LTE standard in Verizon's own timetable to rollout 4G services, which in turn, accelerated AT&T's deployment timetable for 4G. 
As a result, after losing global wireless technology leadership when Europe introduce 2G with GSM, the U.S. has regained wireless network technology and innovation supremacy because of America's leadership in 4G. 
If Sprint had not been a legitimate high ARPU postpaid customer competitive threat, the U.S. would still be a wireless also-ran. 
Our leadership in pricing and in simplicity has led others to follow too. AT&T recently enacted a rate plan in response to losing their iPhone monopoly, which looks eerily similar to Any Mobile, Anytime, the rate plan introduced by Sprint in 2009. 
Many of you on the phone are analysts and investors thinking about the macro impact of such a merger on our industry. It seems that some believe that a duopoly and the inherent price stability that might result for marginalizing the innovative #3 competitor is a good thing for carriers, anyway, if not for other wireless industry suppliers and participants, based upon the increases in the AT&T and Verizon stock prices since the proposed merger was announced. But I don't think enough thought has been given to the likely reduction in wireless innovation, the possibility of more regulation to make up for the loss of competitive market forces and the influence more regulation could have on diverting away investment dollars from wireless, to say nothing of the impact a carrier duopoly could have on other industry players like network infrastructure or handset suppliers or app developers. 
Sprint is pro-competitive and our investment thesis is that all boats will float higher in a vibrant and innovative industry especially in the industry that has the unbridled potential of wireless.
Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Joe Euteneuer, who wasn't here in the first quarter but who has come up to speed remarkably quickly, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Thank you."

In my short time here so far, I have been very impressed by the team that Dan has assembled and I look forward to helping Sprint realize the full potential of the opportunities ahead of us.
Moving onto Slide 10. I'd like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the first quarter. Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues grew slightly as growth in wireless service revenues were offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue and Wireline revenue. 
Total consolidated revenues grew by 2.8%, compared to the year ago period, primarily due to higher ARPU in postpaid and prepaid subscribers, growth in the number of prepaid subscribers and higher wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers and lower Wireline revenues.
Wireless service revenues which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues improved by 2.9% as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, and 3.7% as compared to the year ago period. 
The sequential and year-over-year improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid and prepaid ARPU and growth in prepaid net subscribers. 
Postpaid ARPU improved by nearly $1 as compared to the fourth quarter 2010 and as Dan mentioned, this was the largest sequential improvement in over 5 years.
Postpaid ARPU benefited sequentially from higher monthly recurring charges, primarily related to the $10 premium data add-on charge which we have applied to all smartphones activated since January 30. We expect sequential growth in postpaid ARPU in the second quarter due to continued growth in smartphone sales and the $10 premium data add-on charge.
Prepaid ARPU improved sequentially driven by growth in Boost Mobile ARPU, an improvement in rate plan mix among our Virgin Mobile Beyond Talk customer base. 
Looking forward, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cause overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short-term. 
In 2011, we continue to expect wireless service revenues to grow, Wireline revenue to decline and total consolidated net operating revenues to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving on to Slide 11. I'll talk about the drivers of consolidated adjusted OIBDA. As Dan mentioned, consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was slightly over $1.5 billion, up $199 million sequentially and $36 million from the year ago quarter. 
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA grew year-over-year for the first time in over 4 years. Adjusted OIBDA margin improved 230 basis points sequentially, the largest improvement in almost 4 years. Wireless adjusted OIBDA grew sequentially primarily due to growth in wireless service revenues and reduced net subsidy and sales cost driven by fewer postpaid gross adds and upgrades.
Wireless cost of service was slightly higher sequentially as the benefit related to the change in intercompany rates was offset by higher cost, including increased 4G wholesale cost from growth in a number of 4G smartphones and the settlement of the pricing dispute with Clearwire, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Wireline adjusted OIBDA declined as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to lower revenue associated with the intercompany rate change and the migration of wholesale cable voiceover IP subscribers off of Sprint's Wireline platform. 
As a reminder, each year, we update our intercompany rates for transactions between our Wireline and Wireless segments to better reflect market-based pricing.
The change has no impact on consolidated adjusted OIBDA, but does have a positive impact on wireless cost of service and an equally offsetting negative impact on Wireline revenue as compared to prior periods. 
As previously communicated, debt impact is expected to be slightly less than $250 million for the full year 2011 and was approximately $60 million sequentially for the first quarter. 
We previously expected a sequential decline in the first quarter in Wireline adjusted OIBDA of $25 million related to the cable voiceover IP migration. However, this sequential impact was less than expected due to migration delays by our wholesale partner. 
In addition, cost reductions offset some of the sequential decline in Wireline adjusted OIBDA.
Due to the timing of migrations, we now expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voiceover IP customers to cause Wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year 2011 as compared to our previous expectation of slightly less than $200 million for 2011. We continue to expect the cable voiceover IP migration to last through 2014.
Again, we are pleased with the consolidated adjusted OIBDA results for the quarter given that we faced a number of postpaid competitive pressures in the first quarter, including device launches as well as service plan and device pricing changes. 
We expect the competitive environment to remain challenging in 2011. However, we are encouraged by the consistent improvement we have seen in the Sprint brand and continue to focus on making further progress on postpaid subscriber results. 
We expect for the full year that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid subscribers will benefit adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by negative impacts of entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in Wireline cable voiceover IP revenues and higher wireless costs of service driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly competitive handset pricing environment.
As a result, we expect for the full year 2011 adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat with 2010, excluding incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200 million and $250 million.
Now moving onto slide 12. We ended the quarter with approximately $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We also had $800 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver for a total liquidity position of $4.8 billion as of the end of the first quarter. 
We repaid the $1.65 billion note in January 2011 which was our only note maturity due in 2011. Our next note and loan maturities totaling $2.25 billion are not due until March of 2012. 
Going forward, we plan to continue to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach allowing for repayment of debt, investing in capital expenditures, and future growth. Our accrued capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest were $555 million in the first quarter, compared to $608 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $419 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
Capital investment in the first quarter continued to focus on wireless quality and capacity. We continue to expect the full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest, driven largely by CDMA capacity and Network Vision.
We generated $178 million in free cash flow in the first quarter. This was down from the $913 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a one-time federal tax stimulus refund of approximately $153 million received in the fourth quarter of 2010, approximately $150 million in higher cash interest payments, which is typical for the first quarter of each year, a $100 million pension contribution and other working capital changes. 
We intend to make additional pension contributions during the remainder of 2011, totaling approximately $35 million. 
Looking ahead, we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011. However, our 2011 annual free cash flow is expected to be substantially lower than in 2010, due to the rollout of Network Vision.
Now moving onto Slide 13. As a reminder, the goals of our Network Vision initiative are to enhance voice and data services for our customers, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability. 
With this project, we believe we will be installing new equipment and software, including multi-mode base stations, allowing for the flexibility to offer multiple technology standards using a range of spectrum brands. 
As part of Network Vision, we also intend to repurpose some of our 800 megahertz spectrum for CDMA service to enhance coverage for customers and launch the next generation of push-to-talk services in 2011 on the CDMA network. 
As previously stated, it is expected that iDEN cell services will be phased out beginning in 2013.
 
The Network Vision project progressed well through the first quarter. We will continue to conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field and we expect to begin initial deployment in 8 of the largest metro markets following successful testing in early fourth quarter. 
Our expectations of the costs and benefits related to Network Vision are unchanged since the program was initially announced. As previously stated, the Network Vision project is expected to yield $10 billion to $11 billion in net benefits over a 7-year time frame. 
The total incremental cost to the Network Vision program over the estimated 3- to 5-year deployment period is expected to be between $4 billion and $5 billion. We project that slightly over 50% of the incremental cost will be capital while the remainder will be operating expenses. We plan on ramping up capital expenditures related to Network Vision for the remainder of 2011. 
As part of our 4G strategy, we have amended our agreement with Clearwire for wholesale pricing. The agreement resulted in simplified data usage base pricing structures. As previously disclosed, we have agreed to pay Clearwire $175 million in prepayments for 4G wholesale services to be used in 2011 and beyond and minimum usage commitments of $300 million in 2011 and $550 million in 2012.
Additionally, we look forward to expanding our 4G capabilities through custom network solution deployments and re-wholesale-ing services which will be possible under this new agreement. 
In February, we shared that we would provide our long-term 4G strategy by mid-year. We are still on target to provide our plans within this timeframe. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets and also to deploy spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides us the opportunities to provide 4G services that were not available in the past. 
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011, which we have reconfirmed today. The company expects postpaid subscriber net additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total wireless net subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. 
We expect full year capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $3 billion. 
In addition, the company expects to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011. 
In conclusion, one of the things that impressed me the most about the predecessor has -- his relentless focus on controlling costs. You can expect the same for me. Sprint has clearly shown progress on improving revenue trends over the last several quarters and we have a place -- a plan in place with Network Vision which we believe will significantly improve the cost structure of the business over the longer-term. 
As I look forward to remainder of 2011 and beyond, maximizing shareholder value and cash flow will be a primary objective for the business. 
Again, I'd like to reiterate how excited I am about the opportunities ahead for Sprint and I look forward to talking to all of you more in the future. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Yijing for Q&A"

Clearly, it clearly benefited ARPU in the quarter and that it will benefit postpaid ARPU next quarter because it basically was put into place at the end of January in Q1. It's not pushed on customers. The existing customers don't get an increase in price, it's only customers, in essence, gross adds or customers that upgrade to one of the smartphone devices that carry the data, the premium data charge that are affected. Second, with respect to churn and your comment about sub-prime, still in essence, last quarter, it rounded. It was $83 and change it rounded out to $84. This quarter, it's $83 and change, it rounds down to $83. There really is not a significant change at all in terms of our -- it continues to be very solid prime mix. We have seen significant improvements in voluntary churn and actually the last two quarters, we look at really what affects churn is on contract and off contract. And what we can tell -- with respect to our off contract churn, which really tells you a lot about how your customer service and loyalty is resonating with customers.

But it continues to be -- the iPhone does continue to be a significant, if you will, competitive threat to us. First, in the hands of AT&T and then in the hands of Verizon. The additional impact of the iPhone has had on us recently and continues to have it is, AT&T is pricing the iPhone 3Gs at $49. So you have to think about both Verizon's iPhone 4 and of course, AT&T's response to that, which I alluded to in my opening comments, not only continuing to offer the iPhone 4 but offering a lower-priced 3Gs. So the iPhone continues to be, quarter after quarter, a successful device and one that provides very strong competition to Sprint. But needless to say, Verizon's introduction of their new iPhone in Q1 this past quarter did have a notable impact on our net add performance for the quarter."

So in the second quarter, our loyalty programs aren't quite as rich as they were in the past.

Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's first quarter 2011 earnings call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and, when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the first quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our loss per share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the first quarter were $0.15, compared to $0.31 in the fourth quarter 2010 and $0.29 in the year ago period. 
The improvement in loss per share as compared to the fourth quarter 2010 was partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. 
In addition, loss per share improved sequentially due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization and interest expense. The reduction in interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in amount of interest capitalized, which is related to our intention to deploy certain spectrum licenses as part of Network Vision, that were not previously utilized. We expect full year capitalized interest related to these spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million.
Looking ahead at depreciation and amortization, the successful testing of push-to-talk technology on the CDMA network as part of the deployment of Network Vision in our test markets during the remainder of the year is expected to result in accelerated depreciation and amortization on certain assets. 
We recorded a net tax expense of $37 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to the temporary difference associated with amortization of our spectrum. 
For tax reporting purposes, the spectrum intangible is amortized. So for financial reporting, it is considered an indefinite life asset with no associate amortization. Therefore, rather than expressing our income tax expense as a percentage of pretax loss as we did at year end and prior, we're now providing our expectations in terms of net tax expense to provide a clearer view of our tax outlook. 
For the full year 2011, we expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

Well, this is my 13th quarter at Sprint and it sure beats reporting the results after my first quarter on the job, which was the first quarter of 2008. Driven by customer service and sub-prime issues, that quarter I reported the worst postpaid churn since the Sprint Nextel merger, 2.45%. 
By contrast, this quarter, I'm reporting the best quarterly postpaid churn in Sprint's long history. We continue to make slow but steady progress with respect to our goals of improving the customer experience, strengthening our brand and generating cash. 
This quarter's performance is particularly noteworthy because of the unique changes in the first quarter's market dynamic. Verizon announced its iPhone and AT&T responded with price as even a duopoly provides more competition than device monopoly. 
Even with these headwinds, because of our relentless focus on improving the customer experience, we felt we could increase our price for data on smart devices so that we could maintain Sprint's unique, customer friendly, unlimited and worry-free data plans.
Our strengthening brand helped us mitigate what otherwise would have been difficult to navigate, increasing our price in the face of a new iconic competitive device and widespread industry price pressure.
Going to Slide 4. Beginning with our first goal, the customer experience, I am pleased to report our 13th consecutive quarter of improved customer satisfaction with Care and First Call Resolution. It's a tough streak to keep going as the bar keeps getting higher. Our top box and bottom box satisfaction scores also reached best ever levels according to the Advanis survey.
 
In spite of the increased complexity in inherent customer questions generated by smartphones which reached an all-time high of 73% of quarterly CDMA device sales and 54% of the base, calls to care per customer decreased yet again to another all-time low, achieving industry best in class levels.
We were recently named the J.D. Power 2011 Customer Service Champion, one of only 40 U.S. companies to earn this distinction across 800 companies assessed across 12 industries. 
Also in the quarter, a very well-known third party report evaluating our CDMA service rated us best in the industry in customer service satisfaction, and we also maintained our number one ranking for data network satisfaction. Based on internal metrics, our iDEN network achieved best ever performance for blocks and drops.
If you'd please go to Slide 5, our brand continues to strengthen. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the Sprint brand was the fastest-growing national postpaid wireless brand in the country as measured by net subscriber growth. The Sprint brand added 310,000 net postpaid subscribers and our entire Postpaid business was net port positive versus our competition for the second consecutive quarter. 
Last quarter was the first time our Postpaid business had ever achieved being net port positive come including the Nextel brand. Unlike last quarter, the gains in Sprint brand customers did not fully offset the decline in Nextel customers, but our postpaid subscriber loss number improved 80% versus last year.
Our total company net adds of 1.12 million versus the net loss one year ago was our highest number in 5 years in our retail net adds of 732,000 was also a 5-year best. 
The quarter's MVP was churn. We registered our best postpaid churn number ever and the best year-over-year improvement we've made in quarterly churn in 5 years. 
In Sprint's entire history, if you were to pick the four best individual quarters for churn, those 4 would be the last 4. Prepaid churn was also strong hitting our lowest level in over 5 years.
Turning to Slide 6. As you know, subscriber performance depends upon a strong brand. The Reputation Institute is a very well-respected research organization that publishes its findings on corporate reputation each year in Forbes Magazine. Their extensive research has found that seven factors drive a company's reputation, which is arguably synonymous with a holistic measure of a company's brand.
These seven factors are: Performance; products and services; leadership; governance; the workplace; citizenship; and innovation. 
We recently learned that of the 1,500 large companies that the Reputation Institute includes in its worldwide survey, they found that from 2009 to 2010 Sprint's corporate reputation was the most improved of any company in the world and Sprint showed one of the largest gains they've ever seen in any year by any company.
We are seeing other brand metrics improve as well, with purchase consideration and first brand preference achieving best ever levels in the quarter. 
Our net promoter score according to our recent Yankee Group study improved far more than for any carrier over the past year, which is consistent with the results of another very well-known third-party study. 
Our brand stretches beyond the consumer market. ATLANTIC-ACM recently ranked Sprint the #1 brand for the first time for U.S. wholesale excellence and for global wholesale excellence. Sprint achieved additional #1 rankings for U.S. provisioning, network and customer service and for global voice value.
Moving onto prepaid, which is on Slide 7. We achieved our best ever quarter for prepaid net adds, 846,000, with each of our brands, Boost, Virgin and Assurance posting positive gains. And as I mentioned, our best prepaid churn in over 5 years. 
Boost won the 2011 J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction awards for non-contract or prepaid services. Purchase Consideration for both Boost and Virgin were also at best ever levels last quarter.
Our device leadership is also key to the brand, as is the innovation and citizenship demonstrated through our green initiatives. The new Samsung Replenish pictured on Slide 8, our fourth green phone, sets a new benchmark for renewable devices. It's made with 82% recycled materials, housed in recycled plastics and it's energy-efficient and built with far fewer environmentally sensitive materials than a typical smart phone. 
We're pricing this Android 2.2 touch qwerty smartphone at only $49. We're also making available another technical breakthrough, a back panel that's a solar charger as a $29 accessory. 
Our green products do well, but they haven't reached mainstream status. So to take Green mainstream, we're lowering the monthly rate for this smartphone only by $10 a month for new or existing customers.
Sprint has launched or announced 22 4G devices, the largest 4G portfolio of any wireless carrier in the U.S. During the first quarter, Sprint launched its third 4G phone the HTC EVO Shift 4G and the Overdrive Pro 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot by Sierra Wireless.
In addition, we announced the upcoming availability of two 4G tablets, the BlackBerry 4G PlayBook and HTC EVO View 4G, as well as two more handsets including the HTC EVO 3D and the Nexus S 4G from Google. 
Sprint dominated the device recognition coming out of the recent CTIA show in Orlando. You've got to see the no glasses 3D screen on the new EVO 3D to believe it.
Turning to Slide 9 and our final priority, cash. Adjusted OIBDA was $1.514 billion and represented the highest sequential percentage improvement in OIBDA in over 5 years and the first year-over-year increase in OIBDA in over 4 years. The main reason for this improvement beyond normal seasonality is ARPU, mainly postpaid, but also prepaid. Postpaid ARPU showed both its biggest year-over-year gain and largest sequential increase in over 5 years. Wireless service revenue grew sequentially 2.9%, the highest increase in 4 1/2 years. Cash flow remained positive and in the first quarter, we paid off all of 2011's remaining maturities.
Finally, I'd like to make some comments about the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T. It's a well-known fact that innovation and competition go hand-in-hand. Innovation and customer choice would be threatened if a duopoly were created. 
As investors in this industry, I bet there are a few listeners on this call that would like to see wireless prices rise which would be more likely in a duopoly structure. But I believe these industry benefits would be more than offset by industry health risks like the decline in innovation and creativity that could result from a duopoly.
Sprint's innovative influence on this industry demonstrates why the wireless industry is much better off by having a strong #3 player. I think there's little doubt Sprint's leadership in rolling out the first national 4G network greatly influenced Verizon's decision to pressure the industry suppliers to accelerate the market availability timetables for the LTE standard in Verizon's own timetable to rollout 4G services, which in turn, accelerated AT&T's deployment timetable for 4G. 
As a result, after losing global wireless technology leadership when Europe introduce 2G with GSM, the U.S. has regained wireless network technology and innovation supremacy because of America's leadership in 4G. If Sprint had not been a legitimate high ARPU postpaid customer competitive threat, the U.S. would still be a wireless also-ran. 
Our leadership in pricing and in simplicity has led others to follow too. AT&T recently enacted a rate plan in response to losing their iPhone monopoly, which looks eerily similar to Any Mobile, Anytime, the rate plan introduced by Sprint in 2009. 
Many of you on the phone are analysts and investors thinking about the macro impact of such a merger on our industry. It seems that some believe that a duopoly and the inherent price stability that might result for marginalizing the innovative #3 competitor is a good thing for carriers, anyway, if not for other wireless industry suppliers and participants, based upon the increases in the AT&T and Verizon stock prices since the proposed merger was announced. But I don't think enough thought has been given to the likely reduction in wireless innovation, the possibility of more regulation to make up for the loss of competitive market forces and the influence more regulation could have on diverting away investment dollars from wireless, to say nothing of the impact a carrier duopoly could have on other industry players like network infrastructure or handset suppliers or app developers. 
Sprint is pro-competitive and our investment thesis is that all boats will float higher in a vibrant and innovative industry especially in the industry that has the unbridled potential of wireless.
Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Joe Euteneuer, who wasn't here in the first quarter but who has come up to speed remarkably quickly, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Thank you."

I'd like to start out by saying how excited I am to have joined Sprint. In my short time here so far, I have been very impressed by the team that Dan has assembled and I look forward to helping Sprint realize the full potential of the opportunities ahead of us.
Moving onto Slide 10. I'd like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the first quarter. Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues grew slightly as growth in wireless service revenues were offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue and Wireline revenue. 
Total consolidated revenues grew by 2.8%, compared to the year ago period, primarily due to higher ARPU in postpaid and prepaid subscribers, growth in the number of prepaid subscribers and higher wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers and lower Wireline revenues.
Wireless service revenues which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues improved by 2.9% as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, and 3.7% as compared to the year ago period. 
The sequential and year-over-year improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid and prepaid ARPU and growth in prepaid net subscribers. 
Postpaid ARPU improved by nearly $1 as compared to the fourth quarter 2010 and as Dan mentioned, this was the largest sequential improvement in over 5 years.
Postpaid ARPU benefited sequentially from higher monthly recurring charges, primarily related to the $10 premium data add-on charge which we have applied to all smartphones activated since January 30. We expect sequential growth in postpaid ARPU in the second quarter due to continued growth in smartphone sales and the $10 premium data add-on charge.
Prepaid ARPU improved sequentially driven by growth in Boost Mobile ARPU, an improvement in rate plan mix among our Virgin Mobile Beyond Talk customer base. 
Looking forward, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cause overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short-term. In 2011, we continue to expect wireless service revenues to grow, Wireline revenue to decline and total consolidated net operating revenues to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving on to Slide 11. I'll talk about the drivers of consolidated adjusted OIBDA. As Dan mentioned, consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was slightly over $1.5 billion, up $199 million sequentially and $36 million from the year ago quarter. 
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA grew year-over-year for the first time in over 4 years. Adjusted OIBDA margin improved 230 basis points sequentially, the largest improvement in almost 4 years. Wireless adjusted OIBDA grew sequentially primarily due to growth in wireless service revenues and reduced net subsidy and sales cost driven by fewer postpaid gross adds and upgrades.
Wireless cost of service was slightly higher sequentially as the benefit related to the change in intercompany rates was offset by higher cost, including increased 4G wholesale cost from growth in a number of 4G smartphones and the settlement of the pricing dispute with Clearwire, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Wireline adjusted OIBDA declined as compared to the fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to lower revenue associated with the intercompany rate change and the migration of wholesale cable Voice over IP subscribers off of Sprint's Wireline platform. 
As a reminder, each year, we update our intercompany rates for transactions between our Wireline and Wireless segments to better reflect market-based pricing.
The change has no impact on consolidated adjusted OIBDA, but does have a positive impact on wireless cost of service and an equally offsetting negative impact on Wireline revenue as compared to prior periods. 
As previously communicated, debt impact is expected to be slightly less than $250 million for the full year 2011 and was approximately $60 million sequentially for the first quarter. 
We previously expected a sequential decline in the first quarter in Wireline adjusted OIBDA of $25 million related to the cable Voice over IP migration. However, this sequential impact was less than expected due to migration delays by our wholesale partner. In addition, cost reductions offset some of the sequential decline in Wireline adjusted OIBDA.
Due to the timing of migrations, we now expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable Voice over IP customers to cause Wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year 2011 as compared to our previous expectation of slightly less than $200 million for 2011. We continue to expect the cable Voice over IP migration to last through 2014.
Again, we are pleased with the consolidated adjusted OIBDA results for the quarter given that we faced a number of postpaid competitive pressures in the first quarter, including device launches as well as service plan and device pricing changes. 
We expect the competitive environment to remain challenging in 2011. However, we are encouraged by the consistent improvement we have seen in the Sprint brand and continue to focus on making further progress on postpaid subscriber results. 
We expect for the full year that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid subscribers will benefit adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by negative impacts of entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in Wireline cable Voice over IP revenues and higher wireless costs of service driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly competitive handset pricing environment.
As a result, we expect for the full year 2011 adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat with 2010, excluding incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200 million and $250 million.
Now moving onto slide 12. We ended the quarter with approximately $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We also had $800 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver for a total liquidity position of $4.8 billion as of the end of the first quarter. 
We repaid the $1.65 billion note in January 2011 which was our only note maturity due in 2011. Our next note and loan maturities totaling $2.25 billion are not due until March of 2012. 
Going forward, we plan to continue to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach allowing for repayment of debt, investing in capital expenditures, and future growth. Our accrued capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest were $555 million in the first quarter, compared to $608 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $419 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
Capital investment in the first quarter continued to focus on wireless quality and capacity. We continue to expect the full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest, driven largely by CDMA capacity and Network Vision.
We generated $178 million in free cash flow in the first quarter. This was down from the $913 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a one-time federal tax stimulus refund of approximately $153 million received in the fourth quarter of 2010, approximately $150 million in higher cash interest payments, which is typical for the first quarter of each year, a $100 million pension contribution and other working capital changes. We intend to make additional pension contributions during the remainder of 2011, totaling approximately $35 million. 
Looking ahead, we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011. However, our 2011 annual free cash flow is expected to be substantially lower than in 2010, due to the rollout of Network Vision.
Now moving onto Slide 13. As a reminder, the goals of our Network Vision initiative are to enhance voice and data services for our customers, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental sustainability. 
With this project, we believe we will be installing new equipment and software, including multi-mode base stations, allowing for the flexibility to offer multiple technology standards using a range of spectrum brands. 
As part of Network Vision, we also intend to repurpose some of our 800 megahertz spectrum for CDMA service to enhance coverage for customers and launch the next generation of push-to-talk services in 2011 on the CDMA network. As previously stated, it is expected that iDEN cell services will be phased out beginning in 2013.
 
The Network Vision project progressed well through the first quarter. We will continue to conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field and we expect to begin initial deployment in 8 of the largest metro markets following successful testing in early fourth quarter. 
Our expectations of the costs and benefits related to Network Vision are unchanged since the program was initially announced. As previously stated, the Network Vision project is expected to yield $10 billion to $11 billion in net benefits over a 7-year time frame. 
The total incremental cost to the Network Vision program over the estimated 3- to 5-year deployment period is expected to be between $4 billion and $5 billion. We project that slightly over 50% of the incremental cost will be capital while the remainder will be operating expenses. We plan on ramping up capital expenditures related to Network Vision for the remainder of 2011. 
As part of our 4G strategy, we have amended our agreement with Clearwire for wholesale pricing. The agreement resulted in simplified data usage base pricing structures. As previously disclosed, we have agreed to pay Clearwire $175 million in prepayments for 4G wholesale services to be used in 2011 and beyond and minimum usage commitments of $300 million in 2011 and $550 million in 2012.
Additionally, we look forward to expanding our 4G capabilities through custom network solution deployments and re-wholesale-ing services which will be possible under this new agreement. 
In February, we shared that we would provide our long-term 4G strategy by mid-year. We are still on target to provide our plans within this timeframe. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets and also to deploy spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides us the opportunities to provide 4G services that were not available in the past. 
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011, which we have reconfirmed today. The company expects postpaid subscriber net additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total wireless net subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. 
We expect full year capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $3 billion. In addition, the company expects to continue to generate positive free cash flow for the remainder of 2011. 
In conclusion, one of the things that impressed me the most about the predecessor has -- his relentless focus on controlling costs. You can expect the same for me. Sprint has clearly shown progress on improving revenue trends over the last several quarters and we have a place -- a plan in place with Network Vision which we believe will significantly improve the cost structure of the business over the longer-term. 
As I look forward to remainder of 2011 and beyond, maximizing shareholder value and cash flow will be a primary objective for the business. 
Again, I'd like to reiterate how excited I am about the opportunities ahead for Sprint and I look forward to talking to all of you more in the future. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Yijing for Q&A."

The additional impact of the iPhone has had on us recently and continues to have it is, AT&T is pricing the iPhone 3Gs at $49. So you have to think about both Verizon's iPhone 4 and of course, AT&T's response to that, which I alluded to in my opening comments, not only continuing to offer the iPhone 4 but offering a lower-priced 3Gs.

But if you look at the cost structure at Sprint. Have you been able to identify a bucket of costs that you think you can take out over the course of the next year or 2? We'd estimated that there's sort of addressable costs of potentially sort of $600 million to $800 million some time ago. I'm just wondering what you think of that estimate? And then also just to get a sense of where things stand on free cash flow, I think that what happens, we've just shifted about $400 million of interest expense into CapEx, so the change should be neutral to pre-cash grow.

Thanks for joining us this morning.For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Jo",802,"Thank you, Brenda. Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and, when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our loss per share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the second quarter were $0.28, compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.25 in the year ago period. The current period loss per share includes $0.20 in equity losses of unconsolidated investments and other. Net of the effect have increased valuation allowance. Loss per share increased sequentially due to higher equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as well as higher net tax expense. We recorded a net tax expense of $99 million in 2Q '11, including a $52 million expense, resulting from cumulative effects on Michigan's corporate income tax law enacted in the second quarter.
For the full year 2011, we now expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million to $250 million, which is higher than our previously communicated expectation of $200 million, due to the Michigan charge I just discussed. Also please keep in mind that Clearwire second quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. As a result, the amount reflected for Sprint's share of Clearwire's results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, is an estimate and based upon the finalization of Clearwire's results may need to be revised if our estimates materially differs from Clearwire's actual results. Changes in our estimate, if any, would affect the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire, net loss and basic and diluted loss per common share, but with no effect on Sprint's operating income, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA or consolidated statement of cash flow.
The carrying value of Sprint's investment in Clearwire as of June 30, 2011, was approximately $2.1 billion. Clearwire's stock price is subject to significant volatility and currently their estimated of their value, based on their quoted first share value is below Sprint's per share carrying value. Although we have determined that the excess of our book value over the estimated fair value of our investment is the result of a temporary decline, there is significant risk that the estimated value of our investment in Clearwire does not improve. And accordingly, we could face significant non-cash charge up to the full amount of our net carrying value. Similar to the first quarter, we recognize the capitalize interest of approximately $100 million related to certain previously unutilized spectrum licenses, which we intend to deploy as part of Network Vision. We continue to expect full year capitalize interest related to this spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, the successful testing and deployment of Network Vision is expected to result in accelerated depreciation expense, primarily associated with iDEN related assets due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful life of certain long-lived assets and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations. 
As of June 30, 2011, the remaining net carrying value of iDEN-related assets was approximately $4 billion, with a composite estimate useful life of 4.5 years, resulting in depreciation expense of approximately $800 million annually.
Successful completion of Network Vision earlier than the end of 2015 would result in an acceleration of these depreciation costs. Assuming the completion of successful testing of Push-to-Talk and finalization of a migration plan for Push-to-Talk customers, accelerated depreciation could begin in late 2011 or early 2012. 
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."
417206,137257329,147622,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report once again we've made progress with respect to each of our 3 key objectives, improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash. If you turn to Slide 4, the",1707,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report once again we've made progress with respect to each of our 3 key objectives, improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash. 
If you turn to Slide 4, the customer experience has steadily improved for 3.5 years. In the quarter, the American Customer Satisfaction Index or ACSI not only had Sprint tied for the top spot in the industry for overall satisfaction, but Sprint was the most improved U.S. company across all industries over the past 3 years.
I'm also pleased to report Sprint's 14th consecutive quarter of improved Customer Care Satisfaction. Our top and bottom box customer satisfaction results were all-time bests.
Turning to Slide 5, in addition, Vocal Labs rated Sprint's call satisfaction best in the industry and yet another very well-known independent research firm also rated overall satisfaction with Sprint branded services best ever in data satisfaction unbeaten in the industry. The customer experience is an important factor for churn and postpaid churn reached 1.75%, an all-time Sprint record. Sprint's best 5 quarters for churn in history have been the last 5. Prepaid churn also reached its lowest level in almost 6 years. The number of calls per customer to customer care in the quarter once a glaring Sprint weak spots achieved an all-time best in the quarter and is now among the Best-in-Class in the industry. We strive to provide a customer experience second to none.
Please turn to Slide 6, if you will. Perhaps the best indicator of brand strength is subscriber performance. Driven by improvements in churn, we achieved $1.1 million net adds in the second quarter, an improvement of $1 million from last year's second quarter, and this was our third consecutive quarter with over $1 million total net new subscribers. The Sprint brand was net add positive for the seventh consecutive quarter and net port positive for the fifth straight quarter, which means more customers switched to Sprint branded postpaid services from our competitors than switched from Sprint to our competitors.
Growth in the Sprint brand was not enough to offset losses with the Nextel branded quarter, but we achieved year-over-year postpaid net add improvement for the eighth consecutive quarter. To be net add positive for all of 2011 an objective we still maintain, Sprint need to improve year-over-year net add performance by 855,000 versus last year. 
Through two quarters, we're 2/3 of the way there. Key second quarter third-party measures of brand health like first brand preference in most want to investigate reached best ever levels and like last year, we again showed the most year-over-year improvement among major carriers in our net promoter score.
We launched a number of new devices in the quarter, including the HTC EVO 3D, the industry's first 3D phone and the HTC View, America's first 4G tablet. We added several Motorola devices to our portfolio. These devices included the Motorola Xoom tablet, the Motorola XPRT, Sprint's first Android world phone that offers enterprise level security features, the Motorola Titanium, which combines Push-to-Talk and Android on an iDen network and the Motorola PHOTON 4G, our first international 4G smartphone which will be available next week.
76% of Sprint branded devices sold in the quarter were smartphones, bringing the smartphone percentage of our Sprint branded CD main customer base to 58%. Our 4G momentum continues as we sold $1.7 million 4G devices in the quarter, our highest quarterly number ever. 
Moving to prepaid in Slide 7, driven by our best churn performance in nearly 6 years, we had 674,000 prepaid net adds, our second best second quarter, which benefited from second quarter of 2009, which benefited from the relaunch of Boost. The Boost brand received yet another lift with today's announcement by J.D. Power and Associates for the #1 ranking in customer care for non-contract wireless services. 
If you turn to Slide 8, in addition to being known for simplicity and value, the Sprint brand is increasingly being associated with sustainability. It was a privilege last week to share the stage with EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson, to discuss the Sprint's industry-leading reuse and recycling practices. 
Also in the quarter, the Samsung Replenish was awarded the UL Environment first ever platinum level certification for mobile device. And for the second year in a row, Sprint received the Sustainability Leadership Award from the International Electronics Recycling Conference and Expo.
For esthetics, evaluated paper, used practices across the 3 major industries in the valuation included Sprint, Verizon and AT&T. No company in any industry was given higher than a C+ except for one, Sprint, which was awarded a solid day.
Moving to Slide 9, with respect to our final priority, cash, we generated positive free cash flow of $267 million in the second quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we also generated positive operating income. Wireless service revenue increased sequentially and year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, driven by the largest year-over-year improvement in postpaid ARPU in over 7 years. Postpaid service revenue grew sequentially for the third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted OIBDA was down sequentially as the benefits of better postpaid ARPU in prepaid subscriber growth were offset by higher cost of service and postpaid subsidy expense, mainly attributable to going from mainland rebates to instant rebates to simplify the customer experience, but also partly due to a higher mix of smartphones especially 4G devices. June, though, was by far our best postpaid net subscriber month of 2011, so we believe these investments and the customer and in our competitive position will pay off in the long run. Joe will discuss our financials in more detail.
Please turn to Slide 10. Sprint continues to differentiate itself with customers and with wireless ecosystem partners because of our unique adoption of an open strategy. We launched the Samsung Nexus as 4G in the quarter, the first 4G device with an embedded MCP chip. This enables Google Wallet, a mobile capability currently offered only by Sprint, rather than push our customer stores are carrier control mobile payments platform, we want to provide our customers with choice, whether it be Google Wallet, Sprint Wallet or American Express served digital wallet platform. Sprint ID is uniquely open and it allows a third-party like ESPN, yaga games or MTV to shape the user interface. Sprint shows its openness yet again by being the only wireless carrier to provide Google Voice, launched in the quarter, which lets the end-user and a third-party rather than the carrier create a calling and voicemail experience. Sprint is taking the concept of openness even further by introducing the innovative concept of spectrum hosting, which today's announcement of our agreement with LightSquared shows. 
Our first priority is the customer experience. Therefore, our 4G strategy began with our Network Vision plans to enhance our customers, network experience including coverage, quality and speed improvements through the employment of new multimode network technology that supports both 3G and 4G utilizing multiple spectral bands. 
Our second priority is to maximize the utilization of and return on our existing assets and investments. This means optimizing the use of our existing 1.9 and 800 spectrum as part of the Network Vision deployment. It also meant negotiating a new wholesale agreement with our existing 4G, Clearwire, that ensures we can provide our customer high-quality 4G service and also that we would be supporting Clearwire by committing to purchase and resale services through at least the end of 2012.
Today, we are announcing the next piece of the plan. Sprint will further leverage its core investment in Network Vision by entering into a spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared where Sprint will build and operate a 4G LTE network and deploy the 1.6 megahertz spectrum owned by LightSquared. The spectrum hosting leverages the Network Vision platform while it improves Sprint's cash flow. Sprint will receive cash payments and also receive wholesale purchase credits worth a total of approximately $13.5 billion if Sprint chooses to resell capacity generated by the LightSquared spectrum. 
The OIBDA margin impact is expected to be positive and is one of the ways we will improve our margins. Now some of you are aware that LightSquared has made a proposal to the SEC to resolve concerns about the potential GPS interference. As a provider of GPS they services ourselves, Sprint wants this issue to be resolved and we will not turn on the network until this issue is resolved. 
So in conclusion, we continue to oppose AT&T's proposed takeover of T-Mobile U.S.A. Sprint has been the most visible leader of those that oppose the proposed takeover, but opposition is beginning to  come from all corners. Just last week, Senator Coal, Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Anti Trust competition policy and consumer rights sent a strong letter urging to take over B block. Subcommittee member, Senator Franken, sent a letter opposing the merger this week. 
In addition, other key members of Congress like Representatives Markey, are making their voices heard along with state attorneys general, consumer groups and a trust experts, influential business editors and columnists, competitors and most importantly, ten of thousands of customers and consumers. There have already been more comments filed at the SEC largely in opposition to the proposed acquisition than with any other transaction ever approved by the agency. The California PUC has likewise opened investigation to explode impact of the deal on its constituents and several other PUCs are reviewing the transaction.
The big 2 have grown their collective postpaid market share in the industry dominance every year since Sprint began keeping market share records in 2004, and we don't expect 2011 to slow down this problematic trend. We intended to continue to ensure that the dangers of this takeover and the negative impact that will have on our industry continued to be heard. The spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared provides one more piece to our network evolution plan. We will meet with the investment community in New York on October 7 to describe this network evolution plan in more detail and the additional time between now and then will allow us to complete more pieces to our plan. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe who will discuss our financial results in more detail"
417206,137257329,147622,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I want to start the call by thanking the Sprint team for their hard-working and execution during the second quarter in a very tough, competitive environment. If we move onto Slide 11, I would like to begin by d",2657,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I want to start the call by thanking the Sprint team for their hard-working and execution during the second quarter in a very tough, competitive environment. 
If we move onto Slide 11, I would like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the second quarter. Today, consolidated revenues grew by 4% compared to the year ago period, primarily due to higher wireless service and equipment revenues, partially offset by lower wireline revenues. Sequentially, total consolidated operating revenues were flat as growth in wireless service revenues were offset by lower wireline revenues. Wireless service revenues which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, improved by almost 5% as compared to the year ago period and by approximately 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2011.
The year-over-year sequential and sequential improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and growth in net prepaid subscribers, partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers. Postpaid ARPU improved sequentially to $57 and grew by nearly $2 as compared to the second quarter of 2010. This was the largest quarterly year-over-year increase in over 7 years. Strong smartphone sales and the related $10 premium data add-on charge continued to drive sequential postpaid ARPU growth in the second quarter, and we expect the $10 add-on charge will lead to additional postpaid ARPU improvement in the second half of this year.
Prepaid ARPU declined sequentially due primarily to a higher mix of relatively low ARPU assurance customers. 
Looking forward, and as we stated previously, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cost overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short-term. We are also focused on improving revenue by growing the subscriber base. We are very pleased to have added over $1 million net wireless customers in the second quarter and nearly $4 million over the last 4 quarters, representing an 8% increase in the size of the total subscriber base as compared to the second quarter of last year.
It is also important to note that we added more than $1.4 million Sprint branded postpaid customers over the past year. As Dan mentioned and shown on Slide 12, we faced a number of competitive headwinds that became more pronounced in the second quarter. This includes the first full quarter both major competitors offered the iPhone aggressive pricing on the iPhone, as well as a variety of other handsets. We continue to be encouraged by the improvements we are seeing in key brand and customer-service metrics, and we feel that our standing in the marketplace continues to progress and momentum is with us. 
A key contributor to our improvement in postpaid subscriber performance has been the popularity of the HTC EVO line of handsets. We launched the latest marquee HTC EVO device, the 3D, late in the second quarter, and although we didn't have the benefit of a full quarter sales of the HTC EVO 3D, we are pleased with the early sales results. 
At the same time, the HTC EVO, the nation's first 4G phone, continues to be the best-selling device in our history. As we look to the second half of the year, we recognize the importance that device selection has on our ability to attract and retain quality customers, and we will remain focused on providing a strong lineup, including the highly anticipated Motorola PHOTON, which would be available next week.
In 2011, we continue to expect wireless service revenues to grow, wireline revenues to decline and total consolidated net operating revenues to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving onto Slide 13, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA declined $200 million sequentially and $187 million year-over-year to slightly over $1.3 billion for the second quarter. This includes the estimated incremental impact of approximately $120 million from customer acquisition and retention expenditures to remain competitive in the marketplace. And $73 million related to the speeds and settlements, including the $80 million settlement with Clearwire and ongoing Network Vision expenses of approximately $24 million. 
As Network Vision expenses continue to grow, we plan to start reporting these costs separately so that investors can track the progress of Network Vision and the operating business separately. 
During the second quarter, we took a series of actions to compete in the marketplace to minimize market share loss, which had an impact on our Adjusted OIBDA results. In the second quarter, we saw price reductions on the original HTC EVO and a full quarter of instant rebates, which put pressure on our postpaid net subsidy rate. We felt this incremental investments of approximately $120 million was necessary and help mitigate the subscriber impact from competitor actions given the highly competitive environment of the second quarter.
Total net subsidy remained relatively flat sequentially as lower overall prepaid subsidy was offset by higher average subsidy rate for postpaid handsets. Wireless cost of service increased sequentially, primarily due to increased data volume, primarily related to 4G, higher service and repair costs and Network Vision related costs. Higher service and repair costs were related to increased mix of smartphones in the subscriber base, which on average, have a higher replacement cost as well as fewer refurbished HTC EVO devices available for replacement.
Selling, general and administrative costs were flat sequentially as lower sales and marketing cost were offset by higher bad debt. Wireline Adjusted OIBDA declined sequentially as expected, primarily due to lower revenue resulting from the migration of wholesale cable voice over IP subscribers off of the Sprint's wireline platform. Cost reductions partially offset some of the sequential decline in wireline revenue. 
We continue to expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voice over IP customers to cause wireline Adjusted OIBDA to decline approximately by $150 million for the full year of 2011.
Our full year adjusted OIBDA outlook is unchanged from what we communicated on our first quarter earnings call. We continue to expect for the full year that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid subscribers will benefit Adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by the negative impact of entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in wireline cable voice over IP revenues and higher wireless cost of service driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly competitive handset pricing environment.
As a result, we expect for the full year 2011, adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat compared to 2010, excluding the incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200 million and $250 million. As a reminder, seasonality generally drives higher third quarter cost of service expenses, including roaming and service and repair. In addition, we also expect typical seasonal increases for postpaid churn in the third quarter of this year.
Now moving onto Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $5.2 billion, included a $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments and $900 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver. Our next note and low maturities totaling $2.25 billion are due in March 2012. 
Going forward, we plan to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach, allowing for repayment of debt, investing in capital expenditures and future growth.
Our accrued capital expenditures, excluding capitalize interest, were $640 million in the second quarter, compared to $555 million in the first quarter and $437 million in the second quarter of 2010. The sequential and year-over-year increase in capital investment was primarily driven by higher data capacity spend. We continue to expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalize interest, driven largely by CDMA capacity and Network Vision. We generated $267 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. This was up from the $178 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower cash interest payments and pension contributions, changes to certain vendor payment schedules and a $90 million prepayment received from LightSquared for spectrum hosting, offset by a decline in OIBDA, higher capital spending and increased device and accessory inventory.
Additionally, we received $200 million from LightSquared early in the third quarter for a total of $290 million receive year-to-date. We made pension contributions of $12 million in the second quarter and early in the third quarter, and we intend to make a similar contribution in the first quarter of this year. 
During the second quarter, our device and accessory inventory balance increased by over $400 million. Over 60% of this increase resulted from 5 of the new devices we added to our handset lineup during the quarter as we build inventory prior to handset launches. 
Approximately 1/3 of the increase in those new device inventories resulted from the HTC EVO 3D, which we launched near the end of the quarter and was one of Sprint's best-selling devices for first week in sales. The remaining increase in inventory was associated with devices we felt could add delivery issues relating to the global parts shortage. We expect by the end of the fourth quarter our ending inventory balance to be more consistent with prior quarters.
We previously communicated that we expected rebrand spent in 2011 to be similar to the same level spent in 2010, which was approximately $450 million. We now expect 2011 rebranding spend of $300 million to $350 million due to additional time needed by public safety licensees to complete the reconfigurations. 
Looking ahead, and consistent with our previous forecast, the company expects to generate positive free cash flow for 2011 and for the second to the fourth quarter of 2011. For the third quarter, we expect the free cash flow will be negative due to higher CapEx, interest payments and a decline in accounts payable. 
In the second quarter, the accounts payable balance increased resulting from device purchases near the end of the quarter and is expected to return to a normal lower level in the third quarter. We expect free cash flow to be positive in the fourth quarter.
Now moving onto Slide 15. The Network Vision project progressed well through the second quarter, working with our 3 vendors Alcatel Lucent, Samsung and Ericsson, we reached a number of milestones, including the successful completion of 1x voice calls and 1x data and SMS transmissions in both the 800 and 19 megahertz bands, as well as EVDO in 1900. 
We have started zoning and permitting work on over 20,000 sites and expect to complete deployment on a small number of those cell sites by the end of the fourth quarter. As we stated on our first quarter earnings call, we will continue to conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field and we expect to begin initial deployment in 8 of the largest Metro markets following successful testing in early fourth quarter. 
We are in the process of renegotiating our master agreements for cell site leases with a major tower companies in connection with Network Vision and have executed agreements with 3 of those power companies, including amendments to important contracts with Crown Castle, impacting over 10,000 of Sprint cell sites.
These agreements established uniform rates for deploying all Network Vision sites rather than negotiating power contracts on a site by site basis. This provides a high degree of cost predictability to Sprint as our network evolves and grows. The lease negotiations completed through June 30, 2011 resulted in an incremental increase to future lease commitments related to cell sites totaling $2.3 billion. Once the migration of existing iDen customers to a single network platform under Network Vision is complete, we expect our cell and switch sites commitments to decline.
For the second quarter, we recorded additional non-cash rent expense of $10 million as a result of these new agreements. Our expectation of the costs and benefits related the Network Vision, excluding spectrum hosting are unchanged since the program was initially announced. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets and also to deploy spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides Sprint the opportunity to offer 4G services that were not available in the past.
As Dan mentioned, we will hold the meeting in New York on October 7, in which we will outline our plans to leverage this innovative architecture to enable our 4G strategy. We plan to discuss our technology and spectrum roadmap, including the potential for additional spectrum hosting.
Now turning to Slide 16. As Dan mentioned, consistent with our Network Vision plan, we have entered into a 15-year agreement with LightSquared that includes spectrum hosting, 4G wholesale and 3G roaming services. This agreement leverages our core investment in Network Vision to provide flexibility and access to spectrum that we may choose to use in the future. Obviously, this agreement is also a benefit to LightSquared as a result of avoiding having to build a Greenfield network. From Sprint's perspective, as a result of the work we expected to do for LightSquared during the 8-year initial performance period under the contract, we expect to receive approximately $9 billion of cash. We also expect to receive LTE and satellite purchase credits, which are currently estimated to be valued at approximately $4.5 billion. We expect to receive the benefits of the cash and the credits over an 11-year period as a result of the staggered bill and assuming we use 100% of the credits earned. 
This $13.5 billion is expected to be recorded in revenue over the 11-year period. The OIBDA and margin impact is expected to be positive and as one of the ways we may improve our margins. It is also expected to be free cash flow accretive over the same 11-year period. This transaction has no current impact on Clearwire. We will continue to operate under our existing wholesale agreement with Clearwire, which includes 4G purchase commitments through 2012 and at option, could continue to wholesale arrangement indefinitely. 
Sprint may have discussions with other spectrum owners regarding spectrum hosting. Any future agreements could provide Sprint additional 4G capacity to further improve our margin by allowing a spectrum partner to reduce cost and time-to-market to deploy their own 4G services.
The LightSquared arrangements contains contingencies related to the resolution of interference issues with LightSquared spectrum, including the right of Sprint to terminate the agreement if certain conditions are not met by the end of 2011. This Sprint exercises its termination right, only those payments received from LightSquared that have not been contractually earned, including amounts not expected or contractually committed to support hosting services will be required to be refunded to LightSquared. 
During the term of the arrangement, Sprint has the option to purchase up to 50% of the expected 4G LTE capacity. In the event the arrangement is terminated for LightSquared material breach, nonpayment or insolvency, Sprint maintains a second lien on certain of LightSquared's spectrum related assets.
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011. Today, we reconfirmed our forecast for 2011 as provided in the forecast section of our first quarter 2011 earnings release, dated April 28, 2011. The company expects net postpaid subscriber additions for the full year 2011, and to improve total net wireless subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. We expect full year capital expenditures, excluding capitalize interest, to be approximately $3 billion. In addition, the company expects to generate positive free cash flow for 2011 and for the second to the fourth quarters of 2011. 
In conclusion, in the second quarter, we continue to build momentum in several key metrics, but we are particularly pleased with the growth in wireless service revenue. After the revenue decline the company experienced a few years ago, reporting of a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in wireless service revenue is encouraging. We look forward to sharing more on our strategic network in operation plants in October. I'll now turn the call back over to Yijing for Q&A."

So we felt confident in reaffirming -- as you mentioned earlier, our previous guidance with respect to being postpaid net ad positive for the year based upon the way we exited the quarter. And they were based upon actions we took in the quarter. The one thing that's kind of changing in terms of what we call the economics of our industry is that with the advent of smartphones, actually customer lifetime value per customer is going up, is improving, because as you know, there's 4 elements of our the profitability of customers. The most important to are churn and ARPU, those are both improving, but the subsidy expense and the cost of service, the expenses are higher, so in essence, it's slightly, if you will, the customer financials have a little more risk in them. But they have more long-term benefits. So the cost of, if you will, of adding new customers early on is higher. So as we mentioned, we took some actions in the quarter that -- and we had some new devices launched let's say late in the quarter, in this quarter, the bigger the largest increase in cost or subsidy cost really had to do with changing as I mentioned in my comments earlier, changing from a mail-in rebate to an instant rebate. That is much more consistent with the simplicity that we're trying to provide our customers and there's basically a cost to do that. So that's really -- I think I hope I have answered your question. That is the relationship to we'll  call it our guidance for the year that we saw improving performance through the second quarter, particularly we had pretty strong, June was our best month of the year. So that's why we felt we felt we were exiting more Q2 more strongly and it was as a result of some of the actions that we took in the largest and most significant was going to instant rebates."

Thanks for joining us this morning.For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Jo",803,"Thank you, Brenda. Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release, and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our loss per share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the second quarter were $0.28 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.25 in the year ago period. The current period loss per share includes $0.20 in equity losses of unconsolidated investments and other. Net of the effect have increased the valuation allowance. Loss per share increased sequentially due to higher equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as well as higher net tax expense. We recorded a net tax expense of $99 million in 2Q '11, including a $52 million expense, resulting from cumulative effects on changes in Michigan's corporate income tax law enacted in the second quarter.
For the full year 2011, we now expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million to $250 million, which is higher than our previously communicated expectation of $200 million, due to the Michigan charge I just discussed. Also, please keep in mind that Clearwire second quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. As a result, the amount reflected for Sprint's share of Clearwire's results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, is an estimate, and based upon the finalization of Clearwire's results may need to be revised if our estimates materially differs from Clearwire's actual results. Changes in our estimate, if any, would affect the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire, net loss and basic and diluted loss per common share, but would have no effect on Sprint's operating income, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA or consolidated statement of cash flows.
The carrying value of Sprint's investment in Clearwire as of June 30, 2011, was approximately $2.1 billion. Clearwire's stock price is subject to significant volatility, and currently their estimated value based on their quoted first share value is below Sprint's per share carrying value. Although we have determined that the excess of our book value over the estimated fair value of our investment is the result of a temporary decline, there is significant risk that the estimated value of our investment in Clearwire does not improve. And accordingly, we could face significant non-cash charges up to the full amount of our net carrying value. Similar to the first quarter, we recognize the capitalized interest of approximately $100 million related to certain previously unutilized spectrum licenses, which we intend to deploy as part of Network Vision. We continue to expect full year capitalized interest related to these spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, the successful testing and deployment of Network Vision is expected to result in accelerated depreciation expense, primarily associated with iDEN-related assets due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful life of certain long-lived assets, and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations.  As of June 30, 2011, the remaining net carrying value of iDEN-related assets was approximately $4 billion, with a composite estimate useful life of 4.5 years, resulting in depreciation expense of approximately $800 million annually.
Successful completion of Network Vision earlier than the end of 2015 would result in an acceleration of these depreciation costs. Assuming the completion of successful testing of push-to-talk and finalization of a migration plan for push-to-talk customers, accelerated depreciation could begin in late 2011 or early 2012. 
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."
417206,137257329,147797,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report once again we've made progress with respect to each of our 3 key objectives, improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash. If you would turn to Slide",1711,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report once again we've made progress with respect to each of our 3 key objectives, improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash. 
If you would turn to Slide 4, the customer experience has steadily improved for 3.5 years. In the quarter, the American Customer Satisfaction Index or ACSI not only had Sprint tied for the top spot in the industry for overall satisfaction, but Sprint was the most improved U.S. company across all industries over the past 3 years. I'm also pleased to report Sprint's 14th consecutive quarter of improved customer care satisfaction. Our top and bottom box customer satisfaction results were all-time bests.
Turning to Slide 5, in addition, Vocalabs rated Sprint's call satisfaction best in the industry, and yet another very well-known independent research firm also rated overall satisfaction with Sprint-branded services best ever and data satisfaction unbeaten in the industry. The customer experience is an important factor for churn, and postpaid churn reached 1.75%, an all-time Sprint record. Sprint's best 5 quarters for churn in history have been the last 5. Prepaid churn also reached its lowest level in almost 6 years. The number of calls per customer to customer care in the quarter, once a glaring Sprint weak spot, achieved an all-time best in the quarter, and is now among the best-in-class in the industry. We strive to provide a customer experience second to none.
Please turn to Slide 6, if you will. Perhaps, the best indicator of brand strength is subscriber performance. Driven by improvements in churn, we achieved $1.1 million net adds in the second quarter, an improvement of $1 million from last year's second quarter, and this was our third consecutive quarter with over $1 million total net new subscribers. The Sprint brand was net add positive for the seventh consecutive quarter, and net port positive for the fifth straight quarter, which means more customers switched to Sprint-branded postpaid services from our competitors than switched from Sprint to our competitors.  Growth in the Sprint brand was not enough to offset losses with the Nextel brand this quarter, but we achieved year-over-year postpaid net add improvement for the eighth consecutive quarter. To be net add positive for all of 2011, an objective we still maintain, Sprint will need to improve year-over-year net add performance by 855,000 versus last year.  Through two quarters, we're 2/3 of the way there. Key second quarter third-party measures of brand health like first brand preference and most want to investigate, reached best ever levels. And like last year, we again showed the most year-over-year improvement among major carriers in our net promoter score.
We launched a number of new devices in the quarter, including the HTC EVO 3D, the industry's first 3D phone and the HTC View, America's first 4G tablet. We added several Motorola devices to our portfolio. These devices included the Motorola Xoom tablet, the Motorola XPRT, Sprint's first Android world phone that offers enterprise-level security features, the Motorola Titanium, which combines push-to-talk and Android on an iDEN network, and the Motorola PHOTON 4G, our first international 4G smartphone, which will be available next week.  76% of Sprint-branded devices sold in the quarter were smartphones, bringing the smartphone percentage of our Sprint branded or CDMA customer base to 58%. Our 4G momentum continues as we sold $1.7 million 4G devices in the quarter, our highest quarterly number ever. 
Moving to prepaid in Slide 7. Driven by our best churn performance in nearly 6 years, we had 674,000 prepaid net adds, our second best second quarter, which benefited from -- second quarter of 2009, which benefited from the relaunch of Boost, and that ends in our best. The Boost brand received yet another lift with today's announcement by J.D. Power and Associates for the #1 ranking in customer care for non-contract Wireless Services. 
If you turn to Slide 8, in addition to being known for simplicity and value, the Sprint brand is increasingly being associated with sustainability. It was a privilege last week to share the stage with EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson, to discuss Sprint's industry-leading reuse and recycling practices.  Also in the quarter, the Samsung Replenish was awarded UL Environment's first ever Platinum level certification for a mobile device. And for the second year in a row, Sprint received the Sustainability Leadership Award from the International Electronics Recycling Conference and Expo.  ForestEthics evaluated paper-use practices across 3 major industries, and the evaluation included Sprint, Verizon and AT&T. No company in any industry was given higher than a C+ except for one, Sprint, which was awarded a solid A.
Moving to Slide 9, with respect to our final priority, cash, we generated positive free cash flow of $267 million in the second quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we also generated positive operating income. Wireless Service revenue increased sequentially and year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, driven by the largest year-over-year improvement in postpaid ARPU in over 7 years. Postpaid Service revenue grew sequentially for the third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted OIBDA was down sequentially as the benefits of better Postpaid ARPU and prepaid subscriber growth were offset by higher cost of service and Postpaid subsidy expense, mainly attributable to going from mail-in rebates to instant rebates to simplify the customer experience, but also partly due to a higher mix of smartphones, especially 4G devices. Juno, was by far our best postpaid net subscriber month of 2011, so we believe these investments and the customer experience and in our competitive position will pay off in the long run. Joe will discuss our financials in more detail.
Please turn to Slide 10. Sprint continues to differentiate itself with customers and with wireless ecosystem partners because of our unique adoption of an open strategy. We launched the Samsung Nexus S 4G in the quarter, the first 4G device with an embedded NFC chip. This enables Google Wallet, a mobile capability currently offered only by Sprint, rather than push our customers toward a carrier-controlled mobile payments platform, we want to provide our customers with choice, whether it be Google Wallet, Sprint Wallet or American Express served digital wallet platform. Sprint ID is uniquely open, and that it allows a third-party like ESPN, Youdagames or MTV to shape the user interface. Sprint shows its openness yet again by being the only wireless carrier to provide Google Voice, launched in the quarter, which lets the end-user and a third-party rather than the carrier create a calling and voice mail experience. Sprint is taking the concept of openness even further by introducing the innovative concept of spectrum hosting, which today's announcement of our agreement with LightSquared shows. 
Our first priority is the customer experience. Therefore, our 4G strategy began with our Network Vision plan to enhance our customers' network experience including coverage, quality and speed improvements through the deployment of new multi-mode network technology that supports both 3G and 4G, utilizing multiple spectral bands.  
Our second priority is to maximize the utilization of and return on our existing assets and investments. This means optimizing the use of our existing 1.9 and 800 spectrum as part of the Network Vision deployment. It also meant negotiating a new wholesale agreement with our existing 4G partner, Clearwire, that ensures we can provide our customers with high-quality 4G service. And also, that we would be supporting Clearwire by committing to purchase and resale services through at least the end of 2012.
Today, we are announcing the next piece of the plan. Sprint will further leverage its core investment in Network Vision by entering into a spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared, where Sprint will build and operate a 4G LTE network, and deploy the 1.6 megahertz spectrum owned by LightSquared. This spectrum hosting leverages the Network Vision platform, while it improves Sprint's cash flow. Sprint will receive cash payments, and also receive wholesale purchase credits worth a total of approximately $13.5 billion if Sprint chooses to resell capacity generated by the LightSquared spectrum.  The OIBDA margin impact is expected to be positive and is one of the ways we will improve our margins. Now some of you are aware that LightSquared has made a proposal to the SEC to resolve concerns about potential GPS interference. As a provider of GPS-based services ourselves, Sprint wants this issue to be resolved, and we will not turn on the network until this issue is resolved. 
So in conclusion, we continue to oppose AT&T's proposed takeover of T-Mobile U.S.A. Sprint has been the most visible leader of those that oppose the proposed takeover, but opposition is beginning to  come from all corners. Just last week, Senator Coal, Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition, Policy and Consumer Rights, sent a strong letter urging the take over be blocked. Senate committee member, Senator Franken, sent a letter opposing the merger this week. 
In addition, other key members of Congress like Representatives Markey, Conyers and Eshoo are making their voices heard along with state attorneys general, consumer groups and antitrust experts, influential business editors and columnists, competitors and most importantly, tens of thousands of customers and consumers. There have already been more comments filed at the SEC largely in opposition to the proposed acquisition than with any other transaction ever appealed by the agency. The California PUC has likewise opened investigation to explore the impact of the deal on its constituents, and several other PUCs are reviewing the transaction.
The big 2 have grown their collective postpaid market share and industry dominance every year since Sprint began keeping market share records in 2004, and we don't expect 2011 to slow down this problematic trend. We intended to continue to ensure that the dangers of this takeover and the negative impact it will have on our industry continued to be heard. The spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared provides one more piece to our network evolution plan. We will meet with the investment community in New York on October 7 to describe this network evolution plan in more detail, and the additional time between now and then will allow us to complete more pieces to our plan. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Joe?"
417206,137257329,147797,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I want to start the call by thanking the Sprint team for their hard-working and execution during the second quarter in a very tough, competitive environment. If you move onto Slide 11, I would like to begin by",2652,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I want to start the call by thanking the Sprint team for their hard-working and execution during the second quarter in a very tough, competitive environment. 
If you move onto Slide 11, I would like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the second quarter. Today, consolidated revenues grew by 4% compared to the year ago period, primarily due to higher Wireless Service and equipment revenues, partially offset by lower Wireline revenues. Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues were flat, as growth in Wireless Service revenues were offset by lower Wireline revenues. Wireless Service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, improved by almost 5% as compared to the year ago period, and by approximately 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2011.
The year-over-year sequential and sequential improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU, and growth in net prepaid subscribers, partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers. Postpaid ARPU improved sequentially to $57, and grew by nearly $2 as compared to the second quarter of 2010. This was the largest quarterly year-over-year increase in over 7 years. Strong smartphone sales and the related $10 premium data add-on charge continued to drive sequential postpaid ARPU growth in the second quarter, and we expect the $10 add-on charge will lead to additional postpaid ARPU improvement in the second half of this year.  Prepaid ARPU declined sequentially due primarily to a higher mix of relatively low ARPU assurance customers. 
Looking forward, and as we stated previously, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cost overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short term. We are also focused on improving revenue by growing the subscriber base. We are very pleased to have added over $1  million net wireless customers in the second quarter and nearly $4 million over the last 4 quarters, representing an 8% increase in the size of the total subscriber base as compared to the second quarter of last year.
It is also important to note that we added more than $1.4 million Sprint-branded postpaid customers over the past year. As Dan mentioned and shown on Slide 12, we faced a number of competitive headwinds that became more pronounced in the second quarter. This includes the first full quarter both major competitors offered the iPhone aggressive pricing on the iPhone, as well as a variety of other handsets. We continue to be encouraged by the improvements we are seeing in key brand and customer-service metrics, and we feel that our standing in the marketplace continues to progress and momentum is with us.  
A key contributor to our improvement in postpaid subscriber performance has been the popularity of the HTC EVO line of handsets. We launched the latest marquee HTC EVO device, the 3D, late in the second quarter. And although we didn't have the benefit of a full quarter sales of the HTC EVO 3D, we are pleased with the early sales results.  At the same time, the HTC EVO, the nation's first 4G phone, continues to be the best-selling device in our history. As we look to the second half of the year, we recognize the importance that device selection has on our ability to attract and retain quality customers, and we will remain focused on providing a strong lineup, including the highly anticipated Motorola PHOTON, which will be available next week.  In 2011, we continue to expect Wireless Service revenues to grow, Wireline revenues to decline and total consolidated net operating revenues to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving onto Slide 13, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA declined $200 million sequentially, and $187 million year-over-year to slightly over $1.3 billion for the second quarter. This includes the estimated incremental impact of approximately $120 million from customer acquisition and retention expenditures to remain competitive in the marketplace, and $73 million related to the speeds and settlements, including the $80 million settlement with Clearwire and ongoing Network Vision expenses of approximately $24 million.  As Network Vision expenses continue to grow, we plan to start reporting these costs separately, so that investors can track the progress of Network Vision and the operating business separately. 
During the second quarter, we took a series of actions to compete in the marketplace to minimize market share loss, which had an impact on our Adjusted OIBDA results. In the second quarter, we saw price reductions on the original HTC EVO and a full quarter of instant rebates, which put pressure on our postpaid net subsidy rate. We felt this incremental investment of approximately $120 million was necessary, and help mitigate the subscriber impact from competitor actions, given the highly competitive environment of the second quarter.
Total net subsidy remained relatively flat sequentially as lower overall prepaid subsidy was offset by higher average subsidy rate for postpaid handsets. Wireless cost of service increased sequentially, primarily due to increased data volume, primarily related to 4G, higher service and repair costs and Network Vision-related costs. Higher service and repair costs were related to increased mix of smartphones in the subscriber base, which on average, have a higher replacement cost as well as fewer refurbished HTC EVO devices available for replacements.
Selling, general and administrative costs were flat sequentially, as lower sales and marketing cost were offset by higher bad debt. Wireline-adjusted OIBDA declined sequentially as expected, primarily due to lower revenue, resulting from the migration of wholesale cable voice over IP subscribers off of the Sprint's Wireline platform. Cost reductions partially offset some of the sequential decline in Wireline revenue.  We continue to expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voice over IP customers to cause Wireline-adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year of 2011.
Our full year adjusted OIBDA outlook is unchanged from what we communicated on our first quarter earnings call. We continue to expect for the full year that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid subscribers will benefit adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by the negative impacts of entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in Wireline cable voice over IP revenues, and higher Wireless cost of service, driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly competitive handset pricing environment.
As a result, we expect for the full year 2011, adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat compared to 2010, excluding the incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200 million and $250 million. As a reminder, seasonality generally drives higher third quarter cost of service expenses, including roaming and service and repair. In addition, we also expect typical seasonal increases for postpaid churn in the third quarter of this year.
Now moving onto Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $5.2 billion, including $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments, and $900 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver. Our next note and low maturities totaling $2.25 billion are due in March of 2012. Going forward, we plan to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach, allowing for repayment of debt, investing in capital expenditures and future growth.
Our accrued capital expenditures, excluding capitalize interest, were $640 million in the second quarter compared to $555 million in the first quarter, and $437 million in the second quarter of 2010. The sequential and year-over-year increase in capital investment was primarily driven by higher data capacity spend. We continue to expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest, driven largely by CDMA capacity and Network Vision. We generated $267 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. This was up from the $178 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower cash interest payments and pension contributions, changes to certain vendor payment schedules, and a $90 million prepayment received from LightSquared for spectrum hosting, offset by a decline in OIBDA, higher capital spending and increased device and accessory inventory.  Additionally, we received $200 million from LightSquared early in the third quarter for a total of $290 million received year-to-date. We made pension contributions of $12 million in the second quarter and early in the third quarter, and we intend to make a similar contribution in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the second quarter, our device and accessory inventory balance increased by over $400 million. Over 60% of this increase resulted from 5 of the new devices we added to our handset lineup during the quarter as we build inventory prior to handset launches.  Approximately 1/ 3 of the increase in those new device inventories resulted from the HTC EVO 3D, which we launched near the end of the quarter, and was one of Sprint's best-selling devices for first weekend sales. The remaining increase in inventory was associated with devices we felt could add delivery issues relating to the global parts shortage. We expect by the end of the fourth quarter our ending inventory balance to be more consistent with prior quarters.
We previously communicated that we expected rebanding spent in 2011 to be similar to the same level spent in 2010, which was approximately $450 million. We now expect 2011 rebanding spend of $300 million to $350 million due to additional time needed by public safety licensees to complete their reconfigurations.  
Looking ahead and consistent with our previous forecast, the company expects to generate positive free cash flow for 2011 and for the second through the fourth quarter of 2011. For the third quarter, we expect that free cash flow will be negative due to higher CapEx, interest payments and a decline in accounts payable.  In the second quarter, the accounts payable balance increased resulting from device purchases near the end of the quarter, and is expected to return to a normal lower level in the third quarter. We expect free cash flow to be positive in the fourth quarter.
Now moving onto Slide 15. The Network Vision project progressed well through the second quarter, working with our 3 vendors, Alcatel-Lucent, Samsung and Ericsson. We reached a number of milestones, including the successful completion of 1x voice calls and 1x data and SMS transmissions in both the 800 and 19 megahertz bands, as well as EVDO in 1900.  We have started zoning and permitting work on over 20,000 sites, and expect to complete deployment on a small number of those cell sites by the end of the fourth quarter. As we stated on our first quarter earnings call, we will continue to conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field, and we expect to begin initial deployment in 8 of the largest Metro markets, following successful testing in early fourth quarter. 
We are in the process of renegotiating our master agreements for cell site leases with the major tower companies in connection with Network Vision, and have executed agreements with 3 of those power companies, including amendments to important contracts with Crown Castle, impacting over 10,000 of Sprint cell sites.
These agreements established uniform rates for deploying all Network Vision sites rather than negotiating power contracts on a site-by-site basis. This provides a high degree of cost predictability to Sprint as our network evolves and grows. The lease renegotiations completed through June 30, 2011, resulted in an incremental increase to future lease commitments related to cell sites totaling $2.3 billion. Once the migration of existing iDEN customers to a single network platform under Network Vision is complete, we expect our cell and switch sites lease commitments to decline.
For the second quarter, we recorded additional non-cash rent expense of $10 million as a result of these new agreements. Our expectation of the cost and benefits related to Network Vision, excluding spectrum hosting, are unchanged since the program was initially announced. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets and also to deploy spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides Sprint the opportunity to offer 4G services that were not available in the past.
As Dan mentioned, we will hold the meeting in New York on October 7, in which we will outline our plans to leverage this innovative architecture to enable our 4G strategy. We plan to discuss our technology and spectrum roadmap, including the potential for additional spectrum hosting.
Now turning to Slide 16. As Dan mentioned, consistent with our Network Vision plan, we have entered into a 15-year agreement with LightSquared that includes spectrum hosting, 4G wholesale and 3G roaming services. This agreement leverages our core investment in Network Vision to provide flexibility and access to spectrum that we may choose to use in the future. Obviously, this agreement is also a benefit to LightSquared as a result of avoiding having to build a greenfield network. From Sprint's perspective, as a result of the work we expect to do for LightSquared during the 8-year initial performance period under the contract, we expect to receive approximately $9 billion of cash. We also expect to receive LTE and satellite purchase credits, which are currently estimated to be valued at approximately $4.5 billion. We expect to receive the benefits of the cash and the credits over an 11-year period as a result of the staggered bill, and assuming we use 100% of the credits earned. 
This $13.5 billion is expected to be recorded in revenue over the 11-year period. The OIBDA and margin impact is expected to be positive and is one of the ways we may improve our margins. It is also expected to be free cash flow accretive over the same 11-year period. This transaction has no current impact on Clearwire. We will continue to operate under our existing wholesale agreement with Clearwire, which includes 4G purchase commitments through 2012 and at our option, could continue to wholesale arrangement indefinitely.  Sprint may have discussions with other spectrum owners regarding spectrum hosting. Any future agreements could provide Sprint additional 4G capacity to further improve our margin by allowing a spectrum partner to reduce cost and time-to-market to deploy their own 4G services.
The LightSquared arrangements contains contingencies related to the resolution of interference issues with LightSquared spectrum, including the right of Sprint to terminate the agreement if certain conditions are not met by the end of 2011. If Sprint exercises its termination right, only those payments received from LightSquared that have not been contractually earned, including amounts not expended or contractually committed to support hosting services, will be required to be refunded to LightSquared.  During the term of the arrangement, Sprint has the option to purchase up to 50% of the expected 4G LTE capacity. In the event the arrangement is terminated for LightSquared's material breach, non-payment or insolvency, Sprint maintains a second lien on certain of LightSquared's spectrum-related assets.
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011. Today, we reconfirmed our forecast for 2011 as provided in the forecast section of our first quarter 2011 earnings release, dated April 28, 2011. The company expects net postpaid subscriber additions for the full year 2011, and to improve total net wireless subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. We expect full year capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $3 billion. In addition, the company expects to generate positive free cash flow for 2011 and for the second to the fourth quarters of 2011. 
In conclusion, in the second quarter, we continue to build momentum in several key metrics, but we are particularly pleased with the growth in wireless service revenue. After the revenue decline the company experienced a few years ago, reporting a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in Wireless Service revenue is encouraging. We look forward to sharing more on our strategic network and operation plants in October. I'll now turn the call back over to Yijing for Q&A."

So we felt confident in reaffirming our -- as you mentioned earlier, our previous guidance with respect to being postpaid net add positive for the year based upon the way we exited the quarter. And they were based upon actions we took in the quarter. The one thing that's kind of changing in terms of, we'll call it, the economics of our industry is that with the advent of smartphones, actually, customer lifetime value per customer is going up, is improving. Because as you know, there's 4 elements to drive the profitability of a customer, and the most important too are churn and ARPU. Those are both improving, but the subsidy expense and the cost of service, the expenses are higher. So in essence, it's slightly, if you will, the customer financials have a little more risk in them. But they have more long-term benefits. So the cost of, if you will, of adding new customers early on is higher. So as we mentioned, we took some actions in the quarter that -- and we had some new devices launched, let's say, later in the quarter. In this quarter, the bigger, by the way, the largest increase in cost or subsidy cost really had to do with changing, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, changing from a mail-in rebate to an instant rebate. That is even much more consistent with the simplicity that we're trying to provide our customers, and there was basically a cost to do that. So that's really -- I think I hope I have answered your question. That is the relationship to, we'll call it, our guidance for the year that we saw improving performance through the second quarter, particularly, and we had pretty strong. June was our best month of the year. So that's why we felt we were exiting Q2 more strongly, and it was as a result of some of the actions that we took. And the largest and most significant was going to the instant rebates."

Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning.For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO,",804,"Thank you, Brandis. Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release, and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our loss per share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the second quarter were $0.28 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.25 in the year ago period. The current period loss per share includes $0.20 in equity losses of unconsolidated investments and other. Net of the effect have increased the valuation allowance. Loss per share increased sequentially due to higher equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as well as higher net tax expense. We recorded a net tax expense of $99 million in 2Q '11, including a $52 million expense, resulting from cumulative effects on changes in Michigan's corporate income tax law enacted in the second quarter.
For the full year 2011, we now expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million to $250 million, which is higher than our previously communicated expectation of $200 million, due to the Michigan charge I just discussed. Also, please keep in mind that Clearwire second quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. As a result, the amount reflected for Sprint's share of Clearwire's results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, is an estimate, and based upon the finalization of Clearwire's results may need to be revised if our estimate materially differs from Clearwire's actual results. Changes in our estimate, if any, would affect the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire, net loss and basic and diluted loss per common share, but would have no effect on Sprint's operating income, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA or consolidated statement of cash flows.
The carrying value of Sprint's investment in Clearwire as of June 30, 2011, was approximately $2.1 billion. Clearwire's stock price is subject to significant volatility, and currently their estimated fair value based on their quoted first share value is below Sprint's per share carrying value. Although we have determined that the excess of our book value over the estimated fair value of our investment is the result of a temporary decline, there is significant risk that the estimated value of our investment in Clearwire does not improve. And accordingly, we could face significant non-cash charges up to the full amount of our net carrying value. Similar to the first quarter, we recognize the capitalized interest of approximately $100 million related to certain previously unutilized spectrum licenses, which we intend to deploy as part of Network Vision. We continue to expect full year capitalized interest related to these spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, the successful testing and deployment of Network Vision is expected to result in accelerated depreciation expense, primarily associated with iDEN-related assets due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful life of certain long-lived assets, and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations.  As of June 30, 2011, the remaining net carrying value of iDEN-related assets was approximately $4 billion, with a composite estimate useful life of 4.5 years, resulting in depreciation expense of approximately $800 million annually.
Successful completion of Network Vision earlier than the end of 2015 would result in an acceleration of these depreciation costs. Assuming the completion of successful testing of push-to-talk and finalization of a migration plan for push-to-talk customers, accelerated depreciation could begin in late 2011 or early 2012. 
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."
417206,137257329,147858,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report once again we've made progress with respect to each of our 3 key objectives: improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash. If you would turn to Slide",1710,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report once again we've made progress with respect to each of our 3 key objectives: improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash. 
If you would turn to Slide 4, the customer experience has steadily improved for 3.5 years. In the quarter, the American Customer Satisfaction Index or ACSI not only had Sprint tied for the top spot in the industry for overall satisfaction, but Sprint was the most improved U.S. company across all industries over the past 3 years. I'm also pleased to report Sprint's 14th consecutive quarter of improved customer care satisfaction. Our top and bottom box customer satisfaction results were all-time bests.
Turning to Slide 5. In addition, Vocalabs rated Sprint's call satisfaction best in the industry, and yet another very well-known independent research firm also rated overall satisfaction with Sprint-branded services best ever and data satisfaction unbeaten in the industry. The customer experience is an important factor for churn, and postpaid churn reached 1.75%, an all-time Sprint record. Sprint's best 5 quarters for churn in history have been the last 5. Prepaid churn also reached its lowest level in almost 6 years. The number of calls per customer to customer care in the quarter, once a glaring Sprint weak spot, achieved an all-time best in the quarter, and is now among the best-in-class in the industry. We strive to provide a customer experience second to none.
Please turn to Slide 6, if you will. Perhaps, the best indicator of brand strength is subscriber performance. Driven by improvements in churn, we achieved $1.1 million net adds in the second quarter, an improvement of $1 million from last year's second quarter, and this was our third consecutive quarter with over $1 million total net new subscribers. The Sprint brand was net add positive for the seventh consecutive quarter, and net port positive for the fifth straight quarter, which means more customers switched to Sprint-branded postpaid services from our competitors than switched from Sprint to our competitors.  Growth in the Sprint brand was not enough to offset losses with the Nextel brand this quarter, but we achieved year-over-year postpaid net add improvement for the eighth consecutive quarter. To be net add positive for all of 2011, an objective we still maintain, Sprint will need to improve year-over-year net add performance by 855,000 versus last year.  Through two quarters, we're 2/3 of the way there. Key second quarter third-party measures of brand health like first brand preference and most want to investigate, reached best ever levels. And like last year, we again showed the most year-over-year improvement among major carriers in our net promoter score.
We launched a number of new devices in the quarter, including the HTC EVO 3D, the industry's first 3D phone and the HTC View, America's first 4G tablet. We added several Motorola devices to our portfolio. These devices included the Motorola Xoom tablet; the Motorola XPRT, Sprint's first Android world phone that offers enterprise-level security features; the Motorola Titanium, which combines push-to-talk and Android on an iDEN network; and the Motorola PHOTON 4G, our first international 4G smartphone, which will be available next week. 76% of Sprint-branded devices sold in the quarter were smartphones, bringing the smartphone percentage of our Sprint branded or CDMA customer base to 58%. Our 4G momentum continues as we sold $1.7 million 4G devices in the quarter, our highest quarterly number ever. 
Moving to prepaid in Slide 7. Driven by our best churn performance in nearly 6 years, we had 674,000 prepaid net adds, our second best second quarter, which benefited from -- second quarter of 2009, which benefited from the relaunch of Boost, and that ends in our best. The Boost brand received yet another lift with today's announcement by J.D. Power and Associates for the #1 ranking in customer care for non-contract Wireless Services. 
If you turn to Slide 8, in addition to being known for simplicity and value, the Sprint brand is increasingly being associated with sustainability. It was a privilege last week to share the stage with EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson, to discuss Sprint's industry-leading reuse and recycling practices.  Also in the quarter, the Samsung Replenish was awarded UL Environment's first ever Platinum level certification for a mobile device. And for the second year in a row, Sprint received the Sustainability Leadership Award from the International Electronics Recycling Conference and Expo. ForestEthics evaluated paper-use practices across 3 major industries, and the evaluation included Sprint, Verizon and AT&T. No company in any industry was given higher than a C+ except for one, Sprint, which was awarded a solid A.
Moving to Slide 9. With respect to our final priority, cash, we generated positive free cash flow of $267 million in the second quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we also generated positive operating income. Wireless Service revenue increased sequentially and year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, driven by the largest year-over-year improvement in postpaid ARPU in over 7 years. Postpaid Service revenue grew sequentially for the third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted OIBDA was down sequentially as the benefits of better postpaid ARPU and prepaid subscriber growth were offset by higher cost of service and postpaid subsidy expense, mainly attributable to going from mail-in rebates to instant rebates to simplify the customer experience, but also partly due to a higher mix of smartphones, especially 4G devices. June though, was by far our best postpaid net subscriber month of 2011, so we believe these investments and the customer experience and in our competitive position will pay off in the long run. Joe will discuss our financials in more detail.
Please turn to Slide 10. Sprint continues to differentiate itself with customers and with wireless ecosystem partners because of our unique adoption of an open strategy. We launched the Samsung Nexus S 4G in the quarter, the first 4G device with an embedded NFC chip. This enables Google Wallet, a mobile capability currently offered only by Sprint, rather than push our customers toward a carrier-controlled mobile payments platform, we want to provide our customers with choice, whether it be Google Wallet, Sprint Wallet or American Express' Serve digital wallet platform. Sprint ID is uniquely open, in that it allows a third-party like ESPN, Youdagames or MTV to shape the user interface. Sprint shows its openness yet again by being the only wireless carrier to provide Google Voice, launched in the quarter, which lets the end-user and a third-party rather than the carrier create a calling and voice mail experience. Sprint is taking the concept of openness even further by introducing the innovative concept of spectrum hosting, which today's announcement of our agreement with LightSquared shows. 
Our first priority is the customer experience. Therefore, our 4G strategy began with our Network Vision plan to enhance our customers' network experience including coverage, quality and speed improvements through the deployment of new multi-mode network technology that supports both 3G and 4G, utilizing multiple spectrum bands.  
Our second priority is to maximize the utilization of and return on our existing assets and investments. This means optimizing the use of our existing 1.9 and 800 spectrum as part of the Network Vision deployment. It also meant negotiating a new wholesale agreement with our existing 4G partner, Clearwire, that ensures we can provide our customers with high-quality 4G service. And also, that we would be supporting Clearwire by committing to purchase and resale services through at least the end of 2012.
Today, we are announcing the next piece of the plan. Sprint will further leverage its core investment in Network Vision by entering into a spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared, where Sprint will build and operate a 4G LTE network and deploy the 1.6 megahertz spectrum owned by LightSquared. This spectrum hosting leverages the Network Vision platform, while it improves Sprint's cash flow. Sprint will receive cash payments, and also receive wholesale purchase credits worth a total of approximately $13.5 billion if Sprint chooses to resell capacity generated by the LightSquared spectrum.  The OIBDA margin impact is expected to be positive and is one of the ways we will improve our margins. Now some of you are aware that LightSquared has made a proposal to the SEC to resolve concerns about potential GPS interference. As a provider of GPS-based services ourselves, Sprint wants this issue to be resolved, and we will not turn on the network until this issue is resolved. 
So in conclusion, we continue to oppose AT&T's proposed takeover of T-Mobile U.S.A. Sprint has been the most visible leader of those that oppose the proposed takeover, but opposition is beginning to  come from all corners. Just last week, Senator Kohl, Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, sent a strong letter urging the takeover be blocked. Subcommittee member, Senator Franken, sent a letter opposing the merger this week. 
In addition, other key members of Congress like Representatives Markey, Conyers and Eshoo are making their voices heard along with state attorneys general, consumer groups and antitrust experts, influential business editors and columnists, competitors and most importantly, tens of thousands of customers and consumers. There have already been more comments filed at the SEC largely in opposition to the proposed acquisition than with any other transaction ever appealed by the agency. The California PUC has likewise opened investigation to explore the impact of the deal on its constituents, and several other PUCs are reviewing the transaction.
The big 2 have grown their collective postpaid market share and industry dominance every year since Sprint began keeping market share records in 2004, and we don't expect 2011 to slow down this problematic trend. We intend to continue to ensure that the dangers of this takeover and the negative impact it will have on our industry continue to be heard. The spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared provides one more piece to our network evolution plan. We will meet with the investment community in New York on October 7 to describe this network evolution plan in more detail, and the additional time between now and then will allow us to complete more pieces to our plan. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Joe?"
417206,137257329,147858,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I want to start the call by thanking the Sprint team for their hard-working and execution during the second quarter in a very tough, competitive environment. If you move onto Slide 11, I would like to begin by",2651,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I want to start the call by thanking the Sprint team for their hard-working and execution during the second quarter in a very tough, competitive environment. 
If you move onto Slide 11, I would like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the second quarter. Today, consolidated revenues grew by 4% compared to the year ago period, primarily due to higher Wireless Service and equipment revenues, partially offset by lower Wireline revenues. Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues were flat, as growth in Wireless Service revenues were offset by lower Wireline revenues. Wireless Service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, improved by almost 5% as compared to the year ago period, and by approximately 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2011.
The year-over-year sequential and sequential improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU, and growth in net prepaid subscribers, partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers. Postpaid ARPU improved sequentially to $57, and grew by nearly $2 as compared to the second quarter of 2010. This was the largest quarterly year-over-year increase in over 7 years. Strong smartphone sales and the related $10 premium data add-on charge continued to drive sequential postpaid ARPU growth in the second quarter, and we expect the $10 add-on charge will lead to additional postpaid ARPU improvement in the second half of this year.  Prepaid ARPU declined sequentially due primarily to a higher mix of relatively low ARPU assurance customers. 
Looking forward, and as we stated previously, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cause overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short term. We are also focused on improving revenue by growing the subscriber base. We are very pleased to have added over 1  million net wireless customers in the second quarter and nearly 4 million over the last 4 quarters, representing an 8% increase in the size of the total subscriber base as compared to the second quarter of last year.
It is also important to note that we added more than 1.4 million Sprint-branded postpaid customers over the past year. As Dan mentioned and shown on Slide 12, we faced a number of competitive headwinds that became more pronounced in the second quarter. This includes the first full quarter both major competitors offered the iPhone, aggressive pricing on the iPhone, as well as a variety of other handsets. We continue to be encouraged by the improvements we are seeing in key brand and customer-service metrics, and we feel that our standing in the marketplace continues to progress and momentum is with us.  
A key contributor to our improvement in postpaid subscriber performance has been the popularity of the HTC EVO line of handsets. We launched the latest marquee HTC EVO device, the 3D, late in the second quarter. And although we didn't have the benefit of a full quarter sales of the HTC EVO 3D, we are pleased with the early sales results.  At the same time, the HTC EVO, the nation's first 4G phone, continues to be the best-selling device in our history. As we look to the second half of the year, we recognize the importance that device selection has on our ability to attract and retain quality customers, and we will remain focused on providing a strong lineup, including the highly anticipated Motorola PHOTON, which will be available next week.  In 2011, we continue to expect Wireless Service revenues to grow, Wireline revenues to decline and total consolidated net operating revenues to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving onto Slide 13. Consolidated Adjusted OIBDA declined $200 million sequentially, and $187 million year-over-year to slightly over $1.3 billion for the second quarter. This includes the estimated incremental impact of approximately $120 million from customer acquisition and retention expenditures to remain competitive in the marketplace and $73 million related to the speeds and settlements, including the $18 million settlement with Clearwire and ongoing Network Vision expenses of approximately $24 million.  As Network Vision expenses continue to grow, we plan to start reporting these costs separately, so that investors can track the progress of Network Vision and the operating business separately. 
During the second quarter, we took a series of actions to compete in the marketplace to minimize market share loss, which had an impact on our Adjusted OIBDA results. In the second quarter, we saw price reductions on the original HTC EVO and a full quarter of instant rebates, which put pressure on our postpaid net subsidy rate. We felt this incremental investment of approximately $120 million was necessary, and helped mitigate the subscriber impact from competitor actions, given the highly competitive environment of the second quarter.
Total net subsidy remained relatively flat sequentially as lower overall prepaid subsidy was offset by higher average subsidy rate for postpaid handsets. Wireless cost of service increased sequentially, primarily due to increased data volume, primarily related to 4G, higher service and repair costs and Network Vision-related costs. Higher service and repair costs were related to increased mix of smartphones in the subscriber base, which on average, have a higher replacement cost as well as fewer refurbished HTC EVO devices available for replacements.
Selling, general and administrative costs were flat sequentially, as lower sales and marketing cost were offset by higher bad debt. Wireline-adjusted OIBDA declined sequentially as expected, primarily due to lower revenue, resulting from the migration of wholesale cable voice over IP subscribers off of the Sprint's Wireline platform. Cost reductions partially offset some of the sequential decline in Wireline revenue.  We continue to expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voice over IP customers to cause Wireline-adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year of 2011.
Our full year adjusted OIBDA outlook is unchanged from what we communicated on our first quarter earnings call. We continue to expect for the full year that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid subscribers will benefit adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by the negative impacts of entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in Wireline cable voice over IP revenues, and higher Wireless cost of service, driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly competitive handset pricing environment.
As a result, we expect for the full year 2011, adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat compared to 2010, excluding the incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200 million and $250 million. As a reminder, seasonality generally drives higher third quarter cost of service expenses, including roaming and service and repair. In addition, we also expect typical seasonal increases for postpaid churn in the third quarter of this year.
Now moving onto Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $5.2 billion, including $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $900 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver. Our next note and low maturities totaling $2.25 billion are due in March of 2012. Going forward, we plan to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach, allowing for repayment of debt, investing in capital expenditures and future growth.
Our accrued capital expenditures, excluding capitalize interest, were $640 million in the second quarter compared to $555 million in the first quarter, and $437 million in the second quarter of 2010. The sequential and year-over-year increase in capital investment was primarily driven by higher data capacity spend. We continue to expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest, driven largely by CDMA capacity and Network Vision. We generated $267 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. This was up from the $178 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower cash interest payments and pension contributions, changes to certain vendor payment schedules, and a $90 million prepayment received from LightSquared for spectrum hosting, offset by a decline in OIBDA, higher capital spending and increased device and accessory inventory.  Additionally, we received $200 million from LightSquared early in the third quarter for a total of $290 million received year-to-date. We made pension contributions of $12 million in the second quarter and early in the third quarter, and we intend to make a similar contribution in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the second quarter, our device and accessory inventory balance increased by over $400 million. Over 60% of this increase resulted from 5 of the new devices we added to our handset lineup during the quarter as we build inventory prior to handset launches.  Approximately 1/3 of the increase in those new device inventories resulted from the HTC EVO 3D, which we launched near the end of the quarter, and was one of Sprint's best-selling devices for first weekend sales. The remaining increase in inventory was associated with devices we felt could add delivery issues relating to the global parts shortage. We expect by the end of the fourth quarter our ending inventory balance to be more consistent with prior quarters.
We previously communicated that we expected rebanding spent in 2011 to be similar to the same level spent in 2010, which was approximately $450 million. We now expect 2011 rebanding spend of $300 million to $350 million due to additional time needed by public safety licensees to complete their reconfigurations.  
Looking ahead and consistent with our previous forecast, the company expects to generate positive free cash flow for 2011 and for the second through the fourth quarter of 2011. For the third quarter, we expect that free cash flow will be negative due to higher CapEx, interest payments and a decline in accounts payable.  In the second quarter, the accounts payable balance increased resulting from device purchases near the end of the quarter, and it's expected to return to a normal lower level in the third quarter. We expect free cash flow to be positive in the fourth quarter.
Now moving onto Slide 15. The Network Vision project progressed well through the second quarter, working with our 3 vendors, Alcatel-Lucent, Samsung and Ericsson. We reached a number of milestones, including the successful completion of 1x voice calls and 1x data and SMS transmissions in both the 800 and 19 megahertz bands, as well as EVDO in 1900.  We have started zoning and permitting work on over 20,000 sites, and expect to complete deployment on a small number of those cell sites by the end of the fourth quarter. As we stated on our first quarter earnings call, we will continue to conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field, and we expect to begin initial deployment in 8 of the largest Metro markets, following successful testing in early fourth quarter. 
We are in the process of renegotiating our master agreements for cell site leases with the major tower companies in connection with Network Vision, and have executed agreements with 3 of those tower companies, including amendments to important contracts with Crown Castle, impacting over 10,000 of Sprint's cell sites.
These agreements establish uniform rates for deploying all Network Vision sites rather than negotiating tower contracts on a site-by-site basis. This provides a high degree of cost predictability to Sprint as our network evolves and grows. The lease renegotiations completed through June 30, 2011, resulted in an incremental increase to future lease commitments related to cell sites totaling $2.3 billion. Once the migration of existing iDEN customers to a single network platform under Network Vision is complete, we expect our cell and switch site lease commitments to decline.
For the second quarter, we recorded additional noncash rent expense of $10 million as a result of these new agreements. Our expectation of the cost and benefits related to Network Vision, excluding spectrum hosting, are unchanged since the program was initially announced. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets and also to deploy spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides Sprint the opportunity to offer 4G services that were not available in the past.
As Dan mentioned, we will hold the meeting in New York on October 7, in which we will outline our plans to leverage this innovative architecture to enable our 4G strategy. We plan to discuss our technology and spectrum roadmap, including the potential for additional spectrum hosting.
Now turning to Slide 16. As Dan mentioned, consistent with our Network Vision plan, we have entered into a 15-year agreement with LightSquared that includes spectrum hosting, 4G wholesale and 3G roaming services. This agreement leverages our core investment in Network Vision to provide flexibility and access to spectrum that we may choose to use in the future. Obviously, this agreement is also a benefit to LightSquared as a result of avoiding having to build a greenfield network. From Sprint's perspective, as a result of the work we expect to do for LightSquared during the 8-year initial performance period under the contract, we expect to receive approximately $9 billion of cash. We also expect to receive LTE and satellite purchase credits, which are currently estimated to be valued at approximately $4.5 billion. We expect to receive the benefits of the cash and the credits over an 11-year period as a result of the staggered bill, and assuming we use 100% of the credits earned. 
This $13.5 billion is expected to be recorded in revenue over the 11-year period. The OIBDA and margin impact is expected to be positive and is one of the ways we may improve our margins. It is also expected to be free cash flow accretive over the same 11-year period. This transaction has no current impact on Clearwire. We will continue to operate under our existing wholesale agreement with Clearwire, which includes 4G purchase commitments through 2012 and at our option, could continue to wholesale arrangement indefinitely.  Sprint may have discussions with other spectrum owners regarding spectrum hosting. Any future agreements could provide Sprint additional 4G capacity to further improve our margin, while allowing a spectrum partner to reduce cost and time-to-market to deploy their own 4G services.
The LightSquared arrangement contains contingencies related to the resolution of interference issues with LightSquared spectrum, including the right of Sprint to terminate the agreement if certain conditions are not met by the end of 2011. If Sprint exercises its termination right, only those payments received from LightSquared that have not been contractually earned, including amounts not expended or contractually committed to support hosting services, will be required to be refunded to LightSquared. During the term of the arrangement, Sprint has the option to purchase up to 50% of the expected 4G LTE capacity. In the event the arrangement is terminated for LightSquared's material breach, nonpayment or insolvency, Sprint maintains a second lien on certain of LightSquared's spectrum-related assets.
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011. Today, we reconfirmed our forecast for 2011 as provided in the forecast section of our first quarter 2011 earnings release, dated April 28, 2011. The company expects net postpaid subscriber additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total net wireless subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. We expect full year capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $3 billion. In addition, the company expects to generate positive free cash flow for 2011 and for the second to the fourth quarters of 2011. 
In conclusion, in the second quarter, we continue to build momentum in several key metrics, but we are particularly pleased with the growth in Wireless Service revenue. After the revenue decline the company experienced a few years ago, reporting a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in Wireless Service revenue is encouraging. We look forward to sharing more on our strategic network and operation plans in October. I'll now turn the call back over to Yijing for Q&A."

So we felt confident in reaffirming our -- as you mentioned earlier, our previous guidance with respect to being postpaid net add positive for the year based upon the way we exited the quarter. And they were based upon actions we took in the quarter. The one thing that's kind of changing in terms of, we'll call it, the economics of our industry, is that with the advent of smartphones, actually, customer lifetime value per customer is going up, is improving. Because as you know, there's 4 elements to drive the profitability of a customer, and the most important 2 are churn and ARPU. Those are both improving, but the subsidy expense and the cost of service, the expenses are higher. So in essence, it's slightly, if you will, the customer financials have a little more risk in them. But they have more long-term benefits. So the cost of, if you will, of adding new customers early on is higher. So as we mentioned, we took some actions in the quarter that -- and we had some new devices launched, let's say, later in the quarter. In this quarter, the bigger, by the way, the largest increase in cost or subsidy cost really had to do with changing, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, changing from a mail-in rebate to an instant rebate. That is much more consistent with the simplicity that we're trying to provide our customers, and there was basically a cost to do that. So that's really -- I think I hope I have answered your question. That is the relationship to, we'll call it, our guidance for the year that we saw improving performance through the second quarter, particularly, and we had a pretty strong June. June was our best month of the year. So that's why we felt we were exiting Q2 more strongly, and it was as a result of some of the actions that we took. And the largest and most significant was going to the instant rebates."

Fortunately or unfortunately in our industry, there's been a trend over the last few years, where iconic devices are becoming a more important element of the overall considerations that a customer goes through. There's clearly price value, network quality, retail experience, care experience, they're all important. But the device is becoming a larger and larger piece of that. So that's why we put so much focus in the last couple of years on strengthening the device portfolio, and you're right to point out that the iPhone historically for AT&T and for the past roughly quarter and a half has been an important part of Verizon's arsenal. It's both important for gross adds and for churn. I think, we, like our competitors, upgrade a substantial percentage of our customers each quarter. And it's an important retention tool to have the device that your existing customers want, as well as if you have particularly an iconic device that might be only yours or exclusive, it can help drive gross adds. So it's a crucial part of your marketing element for both acquisition and retention. And you will see them both improve or both deteriorate based upon the strength of your overall device lineup, particularly we'll call them, iconic devices."

Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning.For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO,",804,"Thank you, Brenda. Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release, and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our loss per share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the second quarter were $0.28 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.25 in the year ago period. The current period loss per share includes $0.20 in equity losses of unconsolidated investments and other. Net of the effect have increased the valuation allowance. Loss per share increased sequentially due to higher equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as well as higher net tax expense. We recorded a net tax expense of $99 million in 2Q '11, including a $52 million expense, resulting from cumulative effects on changes in Michigan's corporate income tax law enacted in the second quarter.
For the full year 2011, we now expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million to $250 million, which is higher than our previously communicated expectation of $200 million, due to the Michigan charge I just discussed. Also, please keep in mind that Clearwire second quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. As a result, the amount reflected for Sprint's share of Clearwire's results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, is an estimate, and based upon the finalization of Clearwire's results may need to be revised if our estimate materially differs from Clearwire's actual results. Changes in our estimate, if any, would affect the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire, net loss and basic and diluted loss per common share, but would have no effect on Sprint's operating income, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA or consolidated statement of cash flows.
The carrying value of Sprint's investment in Clearwire as of June 30, 2011, was approximately $2.1 billion. Clearwire's stock price is subject to significant volatility, and currently their estimated fair value based on their quoted first share value is below Sprint's per share carrying value. Although we have determined that the excess of our book value over the estimated fair value of our investment is the result of a temporary decline, there is significant risk that the estimated value of our investment in Clearwire does not improve. And accordingly, we could face significant non-cash charges up to the full amount of our net carrying value. Similar to the first quarter, we recognize the capitalized interest of approximately $100 million related to certain previously unutilized spectrum licenses, which we intend to deploy as part of Network Vision. We continue to expect full year capitalized interest related to these spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, the successful testing and deployment of Network Vision is expected to result in accelerated depreciation expense, primarily associated with iDEN-related assets due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful life of certain long-lived assets, and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations.  As of June 30, 2011, the remaining net carrying value of iDEN-related assets was approximately $4 billion, with a composite estimate useful life of 4.5 years, resulting in depreciation expense of approximately $800 million annually.
Successful completion of Network Vision earlier than the end of 2015 would result in an acceleration of these depreciation costs. Assuming the completion of successful testing of push-to-talk and finalization of a migration plan for push-to-talk customers, accelerated depreciation could begin in late 2011 or early 2012. 
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."
417206,137257329,147997,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report once again we've made progress with respect to each of our 3 key objectives: improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash. If you would turn to Slide",1710,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report once again we've made progress with respect to each of our 3 key objectives: improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash. 
If you would turn to Slide 4, the customer experience has steadily improved for 3.5 years. In the quarter, the American Customer Satisfaction Index or ACSI not only had Sprint tied for the top spot in the industry for overall satisfaction, but Sprint was the most improved U.S. company across all industries over the past 3 years. I'm also pleased to report Sprint's 14th consecutive quarter of improved customer care satisfaction. Our top and bottom box customer satisfaction results were all-time bests.
Turning to Slide 5. In addition, Vocalabs rated Sprint's call satisfaction best in the industry, and yet another very well-known independent research firm also rated overall satisfaction with Sprint-branded services best ever and data satisfaction unbeaten in the industry. The customer experience is an important factor for churn, and postpaid churn reached 1.75%, an all-time Sprint record. Sprint's best 5 quarters for churn in history have been the last 5. Prepaid churn also reached its lowest level in almost 6 years. The number of calls per customer to customer care in the quarter, once a glaring Sprint weak spot, achieved an all-time best in the quarter, and is now among the best-in-class in the industry. We strive to provide a customer experience second to none.
Please turn to Slide 6, if you will. Perhaps, the best indicator of brand strength is subscriber performance. Driven by improvements in churn, we achieved $1.1 million net adds in the second quarter, an improvement of $1 million from last year's second quarter, and this was our third consecutive quarter with over $1 million total net new subscribers. The Sprint brand was net add positive for the seventh consecutive quarter, and net port positive for the fifth straight quarter, which means more customers switched to Sprint-branded postpaid services from our competitors than switched from Sprint to our competitors.  Growth in the Sprint brand was not enough to offset losses with the Nextel brand this quarter, but we achieved year-over-year postpaid net add improvement for the eighth consecutive quarter. To be net add positive for all of 2011, an objective we still maintain, Sprint will need to improve year-over-year net add performance by 855,000 versus last year.  Through two quarters, we're 2/3 of the way there. Key second quarter third-party measures of brand health like first brand preference and most want to investigate, reached best ever levels. And like last year, we again showed the most year-over-year improvement among major carriers in our net promoter score.
We launched a number of new devices in the quarter, including the HTC EVO 3D, the industry's first 3D phone and the HTC View, America's first 4G tablet. We added several Motorola devices to our portfolio. These devices included the Motorola Xoom tablet; the Motorola XPRT, Sprint's first Android world phone that offers enterprise-level security features; the Motorola Titanium, which combines push-to-talk and Android on an iDEN network; and the Motorola PHOTON 4G, our first international 4G smartphone, which will be available next week. 76% of Sprint-branded devices sold in the quarter were smartphones, bringing the smartphone percentage of our Sprint branded or CDMA customer base to 58%. Our 4G momentum continues as we sold $1.7 million 4G devices in the quarter, our highest quarterly number ever. 
Moving to prepaid in Slide 7. Driven by our best churn performance in nearly 6 years, we had 674,000 prepaid net adds, our second best second quarter, which benefited from -- second quarter of 2009, which benefited from the relaunch of Boost, and that ends in our best. The Boost brand received yet another lift with today's announcement by J.D. Power and Associates for the #1 ranking in customer care for non-contract Wireless Services. 
If you turn to Slide 8, in addition to being known for simplicity and value, the Sprint brand is increasingly being associated with sustainability. It was a privilege last week to share the stage with EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson, to discuss Sprint's industry-leading reuse and recycling practices.  Also in the quarter, the Samsung Replenish was awarded UL Environment's first ever Platinum level certification for a mobile device. And for the second year in a row, Sprint received the Sustainability Leadership Award from the International Electronics Recycling Conference and Expo. ForestEthics evaluated paper-use practices across 3 major industries, and the evaluation included Sprint, Verizon and AT&T. No company in any industry was given higher than a C+ except for one, Sprint, which was awarded a solid A.
Moving to Slide 9. With respect to our final priority, cash, we generated positive free cash flow of $267 million in the second quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we also generated positive operating income. Wireless Service revenue increased sequentially and year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, driven by the largest year-over-year improvement in postpaid ARPU in over 7 years. Postpaid Service revenue grew sequentially for the third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted OIBDA was down sequentially as the benefits of better postpaid ARPU and prepaid subscriber growth were offset by higher cost of service and postpaid subsidy expense, mainly attributable to going from mail-in rebates to instant rebates to simplify the customer experience, but also partly due to a higher mix of smartphones, especially 4G devices. June though, was by far our best postpaid net subscriber month of 2011, so we believe these investments and the customer experience and in our competitive position will pay off in the long run. Joe will discuss our financials in more detail.
Please turn to Slide 10. Sprint continues to differentiate itself with customers and with wireless ecosystem partners because of our unique adoption of an open strategy. We launched the Samsung Nexus S 4G in the quarter, the first 4G device with an embedded NFC chip. This enables Google Wallet, a mobile capability currently offered only by Sprint, rather than push our customers toward a carrier-controlled mobile payments platform, we want to provide our customers with choice, whether it be Google Wallet, Sprint Wallet or American Express' Serve digital wallet platform. Sprint ID is uniquely open, in that it allows a third-party like ESPN, Youdagames or MTV to shape the user interface. Sprint shows its openness yet again by being the only wireless carrier to provide Google Voice, launched in the quarter, which lets the end-user and a third-party rather than the carrier create a calling and voice mail experience. Sprint is taking the concept of openness even further by introducing the innovative concept of spectrum hosting, which today's announcement of our agreement with LightSquared shows. 
Our first priority is the customer experience. Therefore, our 4G strategy began with our Network Vision plan to enhance our customers' network experience including coverage, quality and speed improvements through the deployment of new multi-mode network technology that supports both 3G and 4G, utilizing multiple spectrum bands.  
Our second priority is to maximize the utilization of and return on our existing assets and investments. This means optimizing the use of our existing 1.9 and 800 spectrum as part of the Network Vision deployment. It also meant negotiating a new wholesale agreement with our existing 4G partner, Clearwire, that ensures we can provide our customers with high-quality 4G service. And also, that we would be supporting Clearwire by committing to purchase and resale services through at least the end of 2012.
Today, we are announcing the next piece of the plan. Sprint will further leverage its core investment in Network Vision by entering into a spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared, where Sprint will build and operate a 4G LTE network and deploy the 1.6 megahertz spectrum owned by LightSquared. This spectrum hosting leverages the Network Vision platform, while it improves Sprint's cash flow. Sprint will receive cash payments, and also receive wholesale purchase credits worth a total of approximately $13.5 billion if Sprint chooses to resell capacity generated by the LightSquared spectrum.  The OIBDA margin impact is expected to be positive and is one of the ways we will improve our margins. Now some of you are aware that LightSquared has made a proposal to the SEC to resolve concerns about potential GPS interference. As a provider of GPS-based services ourselves, Sprint wants this issue to be resolved, and we will not turn on the network until this issue is resolved. 
So in conclusion, we continue to oppose AT&T's proposed takeover of T-Mobile U.S.A. Sprint has been the most visible leader of those that oppose the proposed takeover, but opposition is beginning to  come from all corners. Just last week, Senator Kohl, Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, sent a strong letter urging the takeover be blocked. Subcommittee member, Senator Franken, sent a letter opposing the merger this week. 
In addition, other key members of Congress like Representatives Markey, Conyers and Eshoo are making their voices heard along with state attorneys general, consumer groups and antitrust experts, influential business editors and columnists, competitors and most importantly, tens of thousands of customers and consumers. There have already been more comments filed at the SEC largely in opposition to the proposed acquisition than with any other transaction ever appealed by the agency. The California PUC has likewise opened investigation to explore the impact of the deal on its constituents, and several other PUCs are reviewing the transaction.
The big 2 have grown their collective postpaid market share and industry dominance every year since Sprint began keeping market share records in 2004, and we don't expect 2011 to slow down this problematic trend. We intend to continue to ensure that the dangers of this takeover and the negative impact it will have on our industry continue to be heard. The spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared provides one more piece to our network evolution plan. We will meet with the investment community in New York on October 7 to describe this network evolution plan in more detail, and the additional time between now and then will allow us to complete more pieces to our plan. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Joe?"
417206,137257329,147997,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I want to start the call by thanking the Sprint team for their hard-working and execution during the second quarter in a very tough, competitive environment. If you move onto Slide 11, I would like to begin by",2651,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I want to start the call by thanking the Sprint team for their hard-working and execution during the second quarter in a very tough, competitive environment. 
If you move onto Slide 11, I would like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the second quarter. Today, consolidated revenues grew by 4% compared to the year ago period, primarily due to higher Wireless Service and equipment revenues, partially offset by lower Wireline revenues. Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues were flat, as growth in Wireless Service revenues were offset by lower Wireline revenues. Wireless Service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, improved by almost 5% as compared to the year ago period, and by approximately 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2011.
The year-over-year sequential and sequential improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU, and growth in net prepaid subscribers, partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers. Postpaid ARPU improved sequentially to $57, and grew by nearly $2 as compared to the second quarter of 2010. This was the largest quarterly year-over-year increase in over 7 years. Strong smartphone sales and the related $10 premium data add-on charge continued to drive sequential postpaid ARPU growth in the second quarter, and we expect the $10 add-on charge will lead to additional postpaid ARPU improvement in the second half of this year.  Prepaid ARPU declined sequentially due primarily to a higher mix of relatively low ARPU assurance customers. 
Looking forward, and as we stated previously, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cause overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short term. We are also focused on improving revenue by growing the subscriber base. We are very pleased to have added over 1  million net wireless customers in the second quarter and nearly 4 million over the last 4 quarters, representing an 8% increase in the size of the total subscriber base as compared to the second quarter of last year.
It is also important to note that we added more than 1.4 million Sprint-branded postpaid customers over the past year. As Dan mentioned and shown on Slide 12, we faced a number of competitive headwinds that became more pronounced in the second quarter. This includes the first full quarter both major competitors offered the iPhone, aggressive pricing on the iPhone, as well as a variety of other handsets. We continue to be encouraged by the improvements we are seeing in key brand and customer-service metrics, and we feel that our standing in the marketplace continues to progress and momentum is with us.  
A key contributor to our improvement in postpaid subscriber performance has been the popularity of the HTC EVO line of handsets. We launched the latest marquee HTC EVO device, the 3D, late in the second quarter. And although we didn't have the benefit of a full quarter sales of the HTC EVO 3D, we are pleased with the early sales results.  At the same time, the HTC EVO, the nation's first 4G phone, continues to be the best-selling device in our history. As we look to the second half of the year, we recognize the importance that device selection has on our ability to attract and retain quality customers, and we will remain focused on providing a strong lineup, including the highly anticipated Motorola PHOTON, which will be available next week.  In 2011, we continue to expect Wireless Service revenues to grow, Wireline revenues to decline and total consolidated net operating revenues to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving onto Slide 13. Consolidated Adjusted OIBDA declined $200 million sequentially, and $187 million year-over-year to slightly over $1.3 billion for the second quarter. This includes the estimated incremental impact of approximately $120 million from customer acquisition and retention expenditures to remain competitive in the marketplace and $73 million related to the speeds and settlements, including the $18 million settlement with Clearwire and ongoing Network Vision expenses of approximately $24 million.  As Network Vision expenses continue to grow, we plan to start reporting these costs separately, so that investors can track the progress of Network Vision and the operating business separately. 
During the second quarter, we took a series of actions to compete in the marketplace to minimize market share loss, which had an impact on our Adjusted OIBDA results. In the second quarter, we saw price reductions on the original HTC EVO and a full quarter of instant rebates, which put pressure on our postpaid net subsidy rate. We felt this incremental investment of approximately $120 million was necessary, and helped mitigate the subscriber impact from competitor actions, given the highly competitive environment of the second quarter.
Total net subsidy remained relatively flat sequentially as lower overall prepaid subsidy was offset by higher average subsidy rate for postpaid handsets. Wireless cost of service increased sequentially, primarily due to increased data volume, primarily related to 4G, higher service and repair costs and Network Vision-related costs. Higher service and repair costs were related to increased mix of smartphones in the subscriber base, which on average, have a higher replacement cost as well as fewer refurbished HTC EVO devices available for replacements.
Selling, general and administrative costs were flat sequentially, as lower sales and marketing cost were offset by higher bad debt. Wireline-adjusted OIBDA declined sequentially as expected, primarily due to lower revenue, resulting from the migration of wholesale cable voice over IP subscribers off of the Sprint's Wireline platform. Cost reductions partially offset some of the sequential decline in Wireline revenue.  We continue to expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voice over IP customers to cause Wireline-adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year of 2011.
Our full year adjusted OIBDA outlook is unchanged from what we communicated on our first quarter earnings call. We continue to expect for the full year that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid subscribers will benefit adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by the negative impacts of entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in Wireline cable voice over IP revenues, and higher Wireless cost of service, driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly competitive handset pricing environment.
As a result, we expect for the full year 2011, adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat compared to 2010, excluding the incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200 million and $250 million. As a reminder, seasonality generally drives higher third quarter cost of service expenses, including roaming and service and repair. In addition, we also expect typical seasonal increases for postpaid churn in the third quarter of this year.
Now moving onto Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $5.2 billion, including $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $900 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver. Our next note and low maturities totaling $2.25 billion are due in March of 2012. Going forward, we plan to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach, allowing for repayment of debt, investing in capital expenditures and future growth.
Our accrued capital expenditures, excluding capitalize interest, were $640 million in the second quarter compared to $555 million in the first quarter, and $437 million in the second quarter of 2010. The sequential and year-over-year increase in capital investment was primarily driven by higher data capacity spend. We continue to expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest, driven largely by CDMA capacity and Network Vision. We generated $267 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. This was up from the $178 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower cash interest payments and pension contributions, changes to certain vendor payment schedules, and a $90 million prepayment received from LightSquared for spectrum hosting, offset by a decline in OIBDA, higher capital spending and increased device and accessory inventory.  Additionally, we received $200 million from LightSquared early in the third quarter for a total of $290 million received year-to-date. We made pension contributions of $12 million in the second quarter and early in the third quarter, and we intend to make a similar contribution in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the second quarter, our device and accessory inventory balance increased by over $400 million. Over 60% of this increase resulted from 5 of the new devices we added to our handset lineup during the quarter as we build inventory prior to handset launches.  Approximately 1/3 of the increase in those new device inventories resulted from the HTC EVO 3D, which we launched near the end of the quarter, and was one of Sprint's best-selling devices for first weekend sales. The remaining increase in inventory was associated with devices we felt could add delivery issues relating to the global parts shortage. We expect by the end of the fourth quarter our ending inventory balance to be more consistent with prior quarters.
We previously communicated that we expected rebanding spent in 2011 to be similar to the same level spent in 2010, which was approximately $450 million. We now expect 2011 rebanding spend of $300 million to $350 million due to additional time needed by public safety licensees to complete their reconfigurations.  
Looking ahead and consistent with our previous forecast, the company expects to generate positive free cash flow for 2011 and for the second through the fourth quarter of 2011. For the third quarter, we expect that free cash flow will be negative due to higher CapEx, interest payments and a decline in accounts payable.  In the second quarter, the accounts payable balance increased resulting from device purchases near the end of the quarter, and it's expected to return to a normal lower level in the third quarter. We expect free cash flow to be positive in the fourth quarter.
Now moving onto Slide 15. The Network Vision project progressed well through the second quarter, working with our 3 vendors, Alcatel-Lucent, Samsung and Ericsson. We reached a number of milestones, including the successful completion of 1x voice calls and 1x data and SMS transmissions in both the 800 and 19 megahertz bands, as well as EVDO in 1900.  We have started zoning and permitting work on over 20,000 sites, and expect to complete deployment on a small number of those cell sites by the end of the fourth quarter. As we stated on our first quarter earnings call, we will continue to conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field, and we expect to begin initial deployment in 8 of the largest Metro markets, following successful testing in early fourth quarter. 
We are in the process of renegotiating our master agreements for cell site leases with the major tower companies in connection with Network Vision, and have executed agreements with 3 of those tower companies, including amendments to important contracts with Crown Castle, impacting over 10,000 of Sprint's cell sites.
These agreements establish uniform rates for deploying all Network Vision sites rather than negotiating tower contracts on a site-by-site basis. This provides a high degree of cost predictability to Sprint as our network evolves and grows. The lease renegotiations completed through June 30, 2011, resulted in an incremental increase to future lease commitments related to cell sites totaling $2.3 billion. Once the migration of existing iDEN customers to a single network platform under Network Vision is complete, we expect our cell and switch site lease commitments to decline.
For the second quarter, we recorded additional noncash rent expense of $10 million as a result of these new agreements. Our expectation of the cost and benefits related to Network Vision, excluding spectrum hosting, are unchanged since the program was initially announced. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets and also to deploy spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides Sprint the opportunity to offer 4G services that were not available in the past.
As Dan mentioned, we will hold the meeting in New York on October 7, in which we will outline our plans to leverage this innovative architecture to enable our 4G strategy. We plan to discuss our technology and spectrum roadmap, including the potential for additional spectrum hosting.
Now turning to Slide 16. As Dan mentioned, consistent with our Network Vision plan, we have entered into a 15-year agreement with LightSquared that includes spectrum hosting, 4G wholesale and 3G roaming services. This agreement leverages our core investment in Network Vision to provide flexibility and access to spectrum that we may choose to use in the future. Obviously, this agreement is also a benefit to LightSquared as a result of avoiding having to build a greenfield network. From Sprint's perspective, as a result of the work we expect to do for LightSquared during the 8-year initial performance period under the contract, we expect to receive approximately $9 billion of cash. We also expect to receive LTE and satellite purchase credits, which are currently estimated to be valued at approximately $4.5 billion. We expect to receive the benefits of the cash and the credits over an 11-year period as a result of the staggered bill, and assuming we use 100% of the credits earned. 
This $13.5 billion is expected to be recorded in revenue over the 11-year period. The OIBDA and margin impact is expected to be positive and is one of the ways we may improve our margins. It is also expected to be free cash flow accretive over the same 11-year period. This transaction has no current impact on Clearwire. We will continue to operate under our existing wholesale agreement with Clearwire, which includes 4G purchase commitments through 2012 and at our option, could continue to wholesale arrangement indefinitely.  Sprint may have discussions with other spectrum owners regarding spectrum hosting. Any future agreements could provide Sprint additional 4G capacity to further improve our margin, while allowing a spectrum partner to reduce cost and time-to-market to deploy their own 4G services.
The LightSquared arrangement contains contingencies related to the resolution of interference issues with LightSquared spectrum, including the right of Sprint to terminate the agreement if certain conditions are not met by the end of 2011. If Sprint exercises its termination right, only those payments received from LightSquared that have not been contractually earned, including amounts not expended or contractually committed to support hosting services, will be required to be refunded to LightSquared. During the term of the arrangement, Sprint has the option to purchase up to 50% of the expected 4G LTE capacity. In the event the arrangement is terminated for LightSquared's material breach, nonpayment or insolvency, Sprint maintains a second lien on certain of LightSquared's spectrum-related assets.
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011. Today, we reconfirmed our forecast for 2011 as provided in the forecast section of our first quarter 2011 earnings release, dated April 28, 2011. The company expects net postpaid subscriber additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total net wireless subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. We expect full year capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $3 billion. In addition, the company expects to generate positive free cash flow for 2011 and for the second to the fourth quarters of 2011. 
In conclusion, in the second quarter, we continue to build momentum in several key metrics, but we are particularly pleased with the growth in Wireless Service revenue. After the revenue decline the company experienced a few years ago, reporting a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in Wireless Service revenue is encouraging. We look forward to sharing more on our strategic network and operation plans in October. I'll now turn the call back over to Yijing for Q&A."

So we felt confident in reaffirming our -- as you mentioned earlier, our previous guidance with respect to being postpaid net add positive for the year based upon the way we exited the quarter. And they were based upon actions we took in the quarter. The one thing that's kind of changing in terms of, we'll call it, the economics of our industry, is that with the advent of smartphones, actually, customer lifetime value per customer is going up, is improving. Because as you know, there's 4 elements to drive the profitability of a customer, and the most important 2 are churn and ARPU. Those are both improving, but the subsidy expense and the cost of service, the expenses are higher. So in essence, it's slightly, if you will, the customer financials have a little more risk in them. But they have more long-term benefits. So the cost of, if you will, of adding new customers early on is higher. So as we mentioned, we took some actions in the quarter that -- and we had some new devices launched, let's say, later in the quarter. In this quarter, the bigger, by the way, the largest increase in cost or subsidy cost really had to do with changing, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, changing from a mail-in rebate to an instant rebate. That is much more consistent with the simplicity that we're trying to provide our customers, and there was basically a cost to do that. So that's really -- I think I hope I have answered your question. That is the relationship to, we'll call it, our guidance for the year that we saw improving performance through the second quarter, particularly, and we had a pretty strong June. June was our best month of the year. So that's why we felt we were exiting Q2 more strongly, and it was as a result of some of the actions that we took. And the largest and most significant was going to the instant rebates."

First, on Network Vision, some of the recent tower agreements, obviously, coming together, you put out the release yesterday with Crown Castle. I'm just wondering, what flexibility do you have in these agreements as it relates to spectrum hosting? Is this included in these agreements? And specifically, the LightSquared deal has spectrum contingencies built in before you move forward. Just wondering if that means you secured the tower agreements to be able to do this when you get comfort around the spectrum, or if that's another step you'll have to take through subsequently? And then quickly on Prepaid, good quarter in what is usually a tough seasonal period. Just wondering if you could help shed a little light on that.

Fortunately or unfortunately in our industry, there's been a trend over the last few years, where iconic devices are becoming a more important element of the overall considerations that a customer goes through. There's clearly price value, network quality, retail experience, care experience, they're all important. But the device is becoming a larger and larger piece of that. So that's why we put so much focus in the last couple of years on strengthening the device portfolio, and you're right to point out that the iPhone historically for AT&T and for the past roughly quarter and a half has been an important part of Verizon's arsenal. It's both important for gross adds and for churn. I think, we, like our competitors, upgrade a substantial percentage of our customers each quarter. And it's an important retention tool to have the device that your existing customers want, as well as if you have particularly an iconic device that might be only yours or exclusive, it can help drive gross adds. So it's a crucial part of your marketing element for both acquisition and retention. And you will see them both improve or both deteriorate based upon the strength of your overall device lineup, particularly we'll call them, iconic devices."

For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and, when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011.
In addition, we are in the process of finalizing our 2012 budget. As a result, we will not be providing formal guidance beyond 2011, however, we will be covering some illustrative 2012 impacts to help discuss liquidity expectations, and et cetera. We will provide 2012 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move now to earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the third quarter were $0.10, compared to $0.28 in the second quarter and $0.30 in the year-ago period. The loss per share decreased as compared to the second quarter, partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. 
In addition, loss per share decreased sequentially due to lower equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as well as lower net tax expense. 
The current period loss per share includes $0.09 in equity losses of unconsolidated investments and other, net of the effect of increased devaluation allowance. 
During the second and third quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2010, there were no adjustments made to OIBDA. As a result, we will refer to adjusted OIBDA as OIBDA throughout our call this morning. 
We recorded a net tax expense of $12 million in 3Q '11. As a reminder, 2Q '11 included a onetime $52 million expense resulting from the cumulative effect of changes in Michigan's corporate income tax law enacted in the second quarter. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million to $250 million. Also please keep in mind that Clearwire's third quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. Please refer to the press release in our form 10-Q for additional details.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."
417206,141544923,177964,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I will organize my remarks as usual around our 3 key priorities, the customer experience, the brand and cash. Beginning with the customer experience. Earlier this year, we mentioned we had reached at least",2254,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I will organize my remarks as usual around our 3 key priorities, the customer experience, the brand and cash. 
Beginning with the customer experience. Earlier this year, we mentioned we had reached at least a tie for first place in the customer satisfaction ratings among major wireless carriers by well respected independent evaluators like Consumer Reports and American Customer Satisfaction Index. We went from last to first in a short period of time. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I am pleased that in this third quarter, we received 3 more awards from highly regarded J.D. Power and Associates for the purchase experience for the Sprint brand and for both customer service performance and for the purchase experience for Boost. Customer satisfaction is also reflected in churn. Prepaid churn achieved its best level in 6 years and postpaid churn was best ever for third quarter. Best 6 quarters of postpaid churn in our company's history have been the last 6 quarters.
Sequentially, churn did increase driven primarily by an increase in voluntary churn due in part to a tougher U.S. economic climate. Voluntary churn, the part in churn driven by customer satisfaction brand improved significantly year-over-year. 
Moving on to the brand in Slide 6, we continue to make progress with our key brand health metrics. Most one investigate, Purchase Consideration, positive brand momentum and first brand preference, each achieved all-time bests in the third quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 7. As I have discussed with you in the past, the most tangible evidence of brand improvement is subscriber performance and a strong brand is especially critical to generating gross ads or attracting new customers. As this chart depicts, Sprint's gross ads have been declining steadily since late 2005. The brand had weakened enough that gross ads dropped for 13 or 14 quarters, downward momentum being strong enough to blow right through seasonality, dropping by over $2 million postpaid gross ads per quarter. 
We had bottomed in the second quarter of 2009 and we've been building momentum ever since. Driven by brand health, we estimate our share of postpaid gross ads increased by 170 basis points versus the previous quarter. #1 reason customers leave Sprint or churn is no iPhone and we believe the #1 reason new customers don't try Sprint has been no iPhone. Our early results of selling the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S have confirmed the iPhone's ability to attract new customers. When hopes to see from a device is a high percentage of gross ads, new customers and new revenue to Sprint. In time we have been selling this device is very short, but early results indicate the iPhone is breaking the previous Sprint record held by the EVO in terms of the percentage of device buyers who are growth ads or new to Sprint in the weeks following the launch. 
We believe 2 weeks in the market is not enough time to constantly estimate expected gross ad percentages, but we plan to provide you with that estimate after the full fourth quarter results are in. The early indications are extremely encouraging.
I'll discuss the iPhone's economic impact shortly, as will Joe. The high gross ad percentage translates to revenue growth and provides an even more compelling reason for Sprint to carry the device. 
Please turn to Slide 8. In terms of overall subscriber performance, we generated almost $1.3 million net ads, highest number in 5.5five years. It represents our fourth quarter in a row of over $1 million net ads ad our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. 
Slide 9 shows year-over-year postpaid net ad improvement or decline. As many of you know, Sprint's largest decline was from 2005 to 2006, but we began improving sequentially beginning in 2009. 
For the third quarter of 2011, our postpaid net ads improved sequentially and also improved year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter. 
In terms of the year-over-year improvement needed to be net ad positive for calendar year 2011, 654,000 you see on this chart shows that we're more than three quarters of the way to the goal of 855,000, which we need through 3 quarters.
If you would please turn to Slide 10. Further proof of the strengthening of the Sprint brand has been the continuing strong performance of Sprint branded services. As 
you can see from the chart, in terms of annual subscriber growth, the Sprint brand is the fastest-growing major postpaid brand in America. Sprint brand net ads grew sequentially and were positive for the eighth consecutive quarter. The Sprint brand was net port positive for the sixth consecutive quarter, meaning more customers are switching from competitors to the Sprint brand than vice versa. 
Sprint's longest such streak ever. Being good stewards of the environment is an important element of our brand. Please turn to Slide 11. If you haven't seen the current release in News Week, we have an article on America's 25 greenest companies. We're the only telecommunications or wireless company on the list, moving up to the #3 spot from #6 last year. 
We have also recently been named the Dow Jones sustainability Index North America and to the Worldwide funds climate and savers program, only the 20th company named to this elite program since 1999.
Moving onto our cash priority, which Joe will cover in more detail in his remarks, perhaps a strong settlement of Q3 performance was financial. 
Please turn to Slide 12. This quarter, we had the largest year-over-year improvement in postpaid ARPU this century and the highest sequential improvement in 6 years. 
Year-over-year improvement in CDMA ARPU also set an all-time record. 
Turning to Slide 13, as a result of postpaid ARPU growth and prepaid subscriber growth, total operating revenues were up year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. Total service revenues and wireless service revenues saw the largest year-to-year percentage increases since 2006, driving the best third quarter OIBDA improvement percentage since the third quarter of 2005, which was the first time that Nextel's OIBDA was added in. 
Otherwise, the third quarter sequential OIBDA percentage improvement could of been our best in 11 years.
We average $1.4 billion in OIBDA per quarter in the first half of 2011, the same number we achieved this quarter and without the iPhone we would have expected a similar number in this year's fourth quarter. 
Our bottom line performance has benefited from a number of steps we have taken recently, which also put us in a position to maximize customer lifetime value with the iPhone. 
You may have noticed by now that I mentioned independent customer satisfaction recognition but I have mentioned sequential improvement in Customer Care Satisfaction. I had been able to report that improvement for 14 quarters in a row. Every quarter since I've been here, it was quite a streak. I can't report a 15 consecutive of improvement because of a number of financial prudent steps we have taken recently, not all of which are popular with customers. 
Earlier this year, we increased the monthly rate for our unlimited mobile to mobile tax and data plans by $10 per month for new customers and for upgrades. This has been the largest driver of our ARPU improvement. 
In the third quarter, we increased the number of fees including upgrade fees and early termination fees. We've also been increasing our efforts to enforce our network usage terms and conditions. 
We've also eliminated the premier loyalty program and with it, the associate early upgrade provisions. You've seen this effect, a fewer upgrades last quarter. 
All of these changes have been put into the market in a short period of time, making a 15 consecutive quarter of Customer Care Satisfaction survey improvement, much of a challenge.
Part of the reason to make these changes in areas like upgrade policy and early termination fees was to prepare for the potential launch of and maximize the profitability of the iPhone. We recently attended the movie Money Ball with my youngest son, and I couldn't help but be reminded of Sprint's situation. The Oakland Ace think Sprint for trying to compete and win with a fraction of the financial resources of its deep-pocketed adversaries, the Yankees and the Red Sox, AT&T and Verizon. Knowing that's in eye with one of the high payroll teams signed superstar, but in Sprint's version of the movie, Dan Hesse played by Brad Pitt look-alike and Joe Euteneuer played by Jonah Hill had done detailed statistics analyses that a particular player Isaac's phone, better known as iPhone versus A-Rod, not only deliver the runs on the field to win the game, but also help draw the crowd and fill the seats in their high fixed costs stadium. iPhone has an expensive contract, but is worth every penny.
Turning to Slide 14, this is a depiction of single customer profitability. What we call customer lifetime value. Dollars of the y-axis, x-axis, green line represents total costs. On day 1, the carrier invests in subscriber acquisition cost also known as CPGA, largest component of which is the phone's subsidy. Over time a number of customer support costs are incurred the most significant being network usage. 
Building to the Slide #15, we've added the revenue line The slope of which is ARPU, a higher ARPU means you reach break even sooner. After the break even date, the carriers starts to make money. The vertical line on the right depicts customer life or the inverse of churn. The Further of this line is to the right the better, the shaded triangle is the customer lifetime value which is the area between your revenue and cost lines and between the break even date and churn date. 
This is a real chart representing a top-selling Sprint postpaid smartphone today. If this were a typical prepaid device chart, we hit break even sooner because of the lower CPGA the customer lifetime value is generally lower than postpaid, primarily because churn is usually much higher therefore customer life is shorter.
Turning to Slide 16. We superimposed our expected economics for iPhone. For confidentiality reasons, we have taken the legends off the axes, but these graphs are true to scale. These are genuine internal Sprint charts plotted using actual numbers and projections. We expect the customer lifetime value of an iPhone customer to be at least 50%, yes, at least 50% greater in a typical smartphone user, driven primarily by more efficient use of our network and lower churn. 
In addition, not reflected in this chart is the upside of more new revenues to Sprint, new fans to offset the fixed cost of our stadium if you will because we expect the iPhone to generate a significantly higher number of new users to Sprint. Joe has a chart which depicts the net present value for Sprint of carrying the iPhone. We expect the improved customer lifetime value I have just described to contribute $6 billion to $6.8 billion, and new gross ads to contribute another $1 billion to $1.2 billion for a total net present value benefit of $7 billion to $8 billion over the life of the customers, which choose the iPhone during the 4 years of our agreement with Apple.
There is a misperception that our launch of iPhone will increase the load on Sprint's 3G network and require us to spend more 3G capital. The reverse is true. iPhone users are expected to use significantly less 3G that a typical user of a dual-mode 3G, 4G device. Even adjusting for more total new customers being added to the network, we believe will put less load on our 3G network than they would have, if we did not carry the iPhone. 
We are pleased to announce that we have signed a non-binding cooperation agreement with Clearwire to work together on the technical specifications of a Clearwire LTE network and to ensure a superb customer experience to Sprint customers on the Clearwire LTE network. The cooperation extends to the design and operations of the network and ensure seamless handoffs and service layer control that meets Sprint's customer experience requirements, cover the cell site selection and timing of site builds and involves working with OEMs to design devices and to include certain chipsets in devices. 
As you should each understand, it was necessary to reach this agreement in order to clear the way to begin the negotiations of commercial terms under which Sprint may utilize and pay for access to the Clearwire LTE network. A definitive agreement will allow Sprint to meet its objective to further improve the customer experience and to manage its fixed network costs by offloading some 4G usage from its own LTE network on to the Clearwire LTE network and thereby benefit from Clearwire's large spectrum portfolio on a resale basis. 
Those discussions are on going and the terms resulting from those discussions, if any, will be disclosed only at such time that a definitive and binding agreement has been reached by the parties. 
So in conclusion, strong ARPU growth and wireless subscriber gains drove a strong year-over-year and sequential improvement in adjusted OIBDA. 
This quarter, we received more accolades for the improvements we've made in the customer experience and our brand continues to strengthen as measured by brand metrics and by subscriber growth. 
We believe the investments we're making in Network Vision and in the iPhone will be very beneficial for Sprint's customers and for our shareholders over the long-term. 
Our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will now discuss our financial picture in more detail."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to start by apologizing to everyone on the call for not having provided enough information and clarity on October 7. On hindsight, there were things we could've done to bet",2856,"Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to start by apologizing to everyone on the call for not having provided enough information and clarity on October 7. On hindsight, there were things we could've done to better address concerns. We believe you'll find today's call to be a demonstration of our willingness to continue to provide wholesome concise disclosures. 
On today's call, I will discuss our third quarter results, update our forecast and provide additional detail on liquidity, financing, Network Vision and the iPhone.
I'd like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the third quarter. Total consolidated net operating revenues grew by $181 million or 2% year-over-year, primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of net prepaid subscribers, partially offset by lower wireline revenues and lower wireless equipment revenues. 
Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues remained relatively flat at $8.3 billion as growth in wireless service revenues was offset by lower equipment and wireline revenues. 
Now let's discuss wireless service revenues on Slide 17. Third quarter wireless service revenues, which includes retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, improved by $465 million or 7% year-over-year and by $138 million or 2% sequentially. 
Year-over-year and sequential improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and growth in net prepaid subscribers.
Postpaid ARPU improved by nearly $3 or 5% year-over-year, and $1 dollar or 2% sequentially to $58. This was the largest quarterly sequential increase in 6 years. 
Our $10 premium data add-on charge, along with other fee increase including a $1 for 14% increase in our handset protection plan drove the sequential postpaid ARPU growth in the third quarter. We expect the $10 premium data add-on charge to result in additional postpaid ARPU improvement in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Prepaid ARPU declined approximately 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Prepaid ARPU performance was stable across the individual brands and the sequential decline was primarily due to a higher mix of assurance customers. 
Looking forward, as we stated previously, shifts and the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cost overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate.
Switching to wireless expense trends on Slide 18. Total net wireless subsidy expense increased $92 million or 9% year-over-year, and increased $12 million or 1% sequentially. 
The sequential increase based on customer activations was driven by a lower postpaid subscriber upgrade volume of 8%, offset by higher postpaid gross customer additions of 12% and an increase in the average subsidy rate for postpaid devices of 3%. 
The elimination of the premier loyalty program contributed to the decline in the upgrade volume.
Wireless cost of service increased $195 million or 9% year-over-year. And $95 million or 4% sequentially. The sequential change in wireless cost of service includes $55 million or 58% that relates to smartphone subscriber growth and seasonal increases in roaming, service and repair and network site utilities. 
An additional $35 million or 37% is driven by network related expenses, including Network Vision. The higher service and repair costs were related to the increased mix of smartphones and third quarter seasonality. 
Wireless selling, general and administrative cost increased $29 million or 1% year-over-year and improved $81 million or 4% sequentially. The sequential improvement was a result of our planned marketing reduction in the third quarter, partially offset by higher bad debt, primarily associated with an increase in our reserve for doubtful accounts as a result of increases in our aging buckets combined with higher average write off per account.
Now let's move to consolidated OIBDA on Slide 19. Consolidated OIBDA margin increased 10 basis points year-over-year and approximately 100 basis points sequentially to 18.2%. 
Consolidated OIBDA increased $63 million or 5% year-over-year and $88 million or 7% sequentially. 
A slightly over $1.4 billion for the third quarter. Sequentially, OIBDA improved primarily due to higher postpaid and prepaid wireless service revenues and reduced marketing expenses, partially offset by higher wireless cost service. 
In the third quarter, our OIBDA results included $30 million of operating expenses related to Network Vision. We now expect the full year operating expense impact of Network Vision to be between $100 million and $150 million, which is down from our prior estimates of between $200 million and $250 million. 
Wireline OIBDA declined $87 million or 32% year-over-year and by $26 million or 12% sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue resulting from the continued migration of wholesale cable voice over IP customers off of Sprint's wireline platform. We continue to expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voice over IP customers to cause wireline OIBDA to declined by approximately $150 million for the full year 2011.
Before we discuss our third quarter liquidity, I wanted to provide an update on our revolving credit facility. We are pleased to announce the expansion of our credit facility by $150 million. 
In addition, we are now seeing an amendment modifying the debt to OIBDA covenant ratio to adjust for the subsidy impact of the iPhone. The amendment provides an exclusion of net subsidy costs up to $2.7 billion during the next 6 quarters. We are very pleased with the vote of confidence with our bank group in providing us this amendment and the increase in our revolver. 
Let's move on to cash and liquidity on Slide 20. We ended the third quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $5 billion, including about $4 billion in cash and $1 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolver. 
Our next note in loan maturities totaling $2.25 billion are due in March of 2012. After maturities in the first quarter of 2012, our next note maturity of $300 million occurs in May of 2013, followed by a $1.5 billion maturity in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Include capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest of $103 million and including $115 million of Network Vision capital were $760 million the third quarter and compared to $640 million in the second quarter and $462 million in the third quarter of 2010. We continue to expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalize interest and spectrum spend related to re-banding, driven largely by CDMA capacity.
We now expect re-banding spend for the calendar year 2011 to be between $250 million and $300 million as public safety licensees continue to need additional time to work through the right configurations, which is down from our previous estimate between $300 million and $350 million. As of September 30, 2011, we have approximately $500 million to $800 million of re-banding work still remaining. 
Now let's discuss free cash flow on Slide 21. Free cash flow was a negative $273 million for the quarter, compared to a positive $384 million for the third quarter of 2010 and a positive $267 million for the second quarter of 2011. While quarterly OIBDA was relatively stable year-over-year and sequentially, free cash flow was reduced by quarter year-over-year increases and capital expenditures of $328 million, as well as year-over-year and sequential increases in working capital of $483 million and $697 million, respectively, partially offset by LightSquared prepayments. The quarterly year-over-year change in working capital is primarily associated with increased inventory balances related the second quarter handset purchases in anticipation of part shortage later Internet eh year and reductions in accounts payable. The quarterly sequential change in working capital is primarily associated with the reduction in accounts payable of $847 million, of which, $700 million was related to payments associated with second quarter inventory purchases, partially offset by reduced inventory purchases during the quarter. 
In addition, third quarter also included higher cash interest payments of $90 million as a result of timing and higher capital expenditures of $59 million.
Now let's move to a discussion of the iPhone on Slide 22. As Dan discussed, we believe the iPhone will be value accretive for Sprint. 
In addition, we believe that the iPhone will strengthen our competitive position. We expect iPhone customers to be among our most profitable as the higher upfront acquisition costs are expected to be offset by longer customer tenure and lower support costs, including data efficiency. 
I want to share some additional specifics about the iPhone and our estimate for what it means to our business. Initially, we expect the cost for gross addition for an iPhone customer to be nearly 40% higher than the average non-iPhone customer, roughly $200, driven entirely by the cost of the device. 
As depicted in the top graph, it is anticipated that the total net present value of iPhone customers we bring on during the 4-year term of the agreement is expected to be $7 billion to $8 million. 
Think of the total net present value in 2 large categories. The incremental new gross ads to the iPhone will allow us to generate, which represents 15% of the NPV and the remaining 85% of the NPV results from the higher profitability of an iPhone subscriber as a result of expected lower churn, more efficient use of the network and overall lower support costs. 
As you can see on the bottom graph, iPhone OIBDA begins improving in 2013 and continues to build momentum through 2015 and the benefits exceed the incremental acquisition cost of new customers. 
As a result of the popularity of this device, we anticipate the iPhone could be 20% to 40% of our postpaid gross additions and upgrades. The upfront costs are estimated to impact 2012 and 2013 OIBDA by $900 million to $1.2 billion, but are quickly recovered as we expect iPhone customers to generate approximately 20% higher monthly margins than our other smartphone customers. We have a 4-year agreement with Apple that is subject to a confidentiality agreement. Our ultimate spend with Apple will depend on many variables, including anticipated rate of future subscriber growth, number of different devices offered and the cost of devices offered. We anticipate our performing the current contract minimum commitment of $15.5 billion for the iPhone over the 4-year period.
Now let's move onto Network Vision on Slide 23. We're excited about the opportunity created by the acceleration of Network Vision deployment and the ability to begin recognizing the financial and operational benefits sooner rather than later. I've provided the breakout of grace benefits and gross cost related to Network Vision. From 2011 to 2014, gross expected benefit is approximately $4 billion, of which 40% is a result of cost savings from the iDEN network and 50% comes from expected reduction of 3G and 4G roaming expenses and backhaul. 
In calculating the full 7-year benefit that we presented on October 7, the estimated 3G and 4G roaming costs, assuming a compounded annual growth rate for subscribers of approximately 7% to 8% and increasing usage per subscriber. 
In addition, we estimated the decommissioning of over 25,000 iDEN sites. In looking at the gross operating cost as a result of Network Vision from 2011 to 2014, over 90% of these costs are from the following 2 items. 60% comes from migration efforts and incremental churn related to the iDEN subscriber base and 40% from an increase in expenses related to cell sites such as rent entitlements for additional equipment on the towers, excess and backhaul as we switch from the T1s to ethernet fiber. 
As you can see in 2014, cumulative gross benefits exceeded cumulative gross cost associated with Network Vision. The operating expense reduction from Network Vision are expected to generate between 400 and 600 basis points of OIBDA margin improvement by 2014. 
We expect Network Vision to generate a total net benefit of $10 billion to $11 billion over 7 years with a projected NPV of approximately $6 billion. 
Let's move on to Slide 24. The purpose of this slide is to illustrate our estimated financing needs over the next couple of years. Let me start by discussing exactly what is represented on the charts. Each of the bars represent the incremental cash impact for Network Vision and iPhone, including both capital and operating expenses net of benefits. The dotted line illustrates an assumed targeted cash level. The black lines on the chart represent the estimated ending cash balance as a result of the incremental cash impact from Network Vision and the iPhone. Additionally, the black lines include scheduled debt maturities and assume of da range of potential cash generation from our core business, excluding Network Vision and the iPhone. 
Way to think about cash generation from our work core business for purposes of the slide is that the bottom black line assumes stable core OIBDA levels as we exit Q3. While the top line represents potential opportunities that exist in our core business to expand our operating margins and grow cash flow. 
If you assume that these margin opportunities for both revenue and expense generate an OIBDA that had a compounded annual growth rate of 10% starting in 2012, we would've achieved the top black line. Our externally reported OIBDA will be the net result of core business performance, net of the iPhone and Network Vision, all of which will be different than what is illustrated here today. As we get more operating results with the iPhone and start rolling out Network Vision, we'll provide better information. As mentioned earlier, we are in the process of completing our 2012 budgeting process, which we will include evaluating those core business opportunities and the development of our operational plan.
In looking at 2012, we expect the cost related to Network Vision and the iPhone to impact cash by roughly $5.5 billion, partially offset by the benefits generated for Network Vision and the iPhone of $1.1 billion, where we expect positive growth. 
Taking into account these impacts and the potential cash generation from our core business along with our scheduled debt maturity in March of $2.25 billion, cash shortage in 2012 ranges between $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion. 
For 2013, we expect the combined iPhone and Network Vision costs to be $5.7 billion and the benefits to be $4.3 billion. As depicted by the black line, this results in a cumulative cash shortage of $3.2 billion to $5 billion after growth in cash generation from the core business and scheduled debt maturities of $1.8 billion.
As discussed earlier, in 2014, we expect Network Vision benefits to exceed costs by $3.4 billion, while the net iPhone costs will exceed benefits by less than $400 million. 
Combined, we expect cash accretion of approximately $3 billion in 2014 for Network Vision and the iPhone. 
In 2015, the benefits outweigh the cost for both Network Vision and the iPhone, resulting in greater cash accretion, which is approximately $4.7 billion. So what I want you to take away from the slide is that we estimate the peak of our cash shortfall to occur in 2013 and to be between $3.2 billion and $5 billion. 
As a result, if you assume a targeted cash balance of $2 billion, we would project financing needs to range between $5 billion and $7 billion. 
To adjust our projected financing needs during the next couple of years, we expect to refinance our $4 billion of upcoming debt maturities through October 2013 to the public debt markets and raise incremental vendor financing of approximately $1 billion to $3 billion to cover a portion of Network Vision costs. 
Now let me update our forecast. We expect net postpaid subscriber additions for the full year 2011 to improve total net wireless subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. The company expects full year capital expenditures in 2011 excluding capitalized interest to be approximately $3 billion. 
In addition, the company expects free cash flow between negative $200 million and a positive $100 million for 2011, subject to the performance of the iPhone. 
Sequentially, from the third to the fourth quarter, we expect growth in the volume retail wireless growth ads and upgrades driven by the availability of the iPhone, normal industry seasonality for the fourth quarter and continued success of our already compelling and industry-leading unlimited plan offerings. We expect the combination of both increased volume and rate impacts associated with iPhone to result in a reduction in fourth quarter OIBDA of between $500 million $700 million. The more often customers choose Sprint as their iPhone carrier and the more inventory that is available, the greater the OIBDA impact. 
In addition, we expect total Network Vision expense of $16 million in fourth quarter. This results in OIBDA in the range of $600 million and $800 million and a margin of less than 10% for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Remember, we are just beginning our operational experience with the deployment of the iPhone and our flexible technical platform of Network Vision. This will allow us to achieve future growth over time. We plan to provide a forecast for 2012, including OIBDA on our fourth quarter earnings call. I want to take the time to thank all of you for your support and your constructive suggestions over the past few weeks. We will continue to make progress to improve clarity of our disclosures. 
Thank you, and now let me turn back the call to Yijing."

It may sound simple to you and me, but it's really a fairly complex to make sure that networks work well together, particularly that there's an architecture so there's a seamless handoff because what we are intending to do with Network Vision and also with thinking of Clearwire as part of that list group of assets that we have in terms of different spectrum bands, we want our network to be able to seamlessly hand off very quickly based upon the most efficient low-cost best coverage, best capacity alternative we have for any particular call. But if let's say we have calls moving from 2.5 gigahertz to the 1.9 GHz band or to the 800 megahertz frequencies, we want that to be very seamless.

What we talked about on the seventh is that our own spectrum resources that we just basically used our on would take us into 2014, of course, and assumed the continuation if you will the existing agreements with Clearwire. What we said was that if LightSquared and our numbers did not include or assumed that LightSquared capacity would be used, but if we were to -- if they would get the FCC approval and if they were to get financing and if this was to move forward, it would probably add another years worth of capacity growth on to our network. Clearwire if we were to reach agreement with Clearwire, again we have not yet, but the MOU I've described today lay the foundation to do that would add additional years plural to that capacity as well. So really, nothing has changed. We just make progress and again if LightSquared comes online, that gives us another potential use of capacity, but we are making very good progress, we believe on the technical front with Clearwire and I leave it at that there's Part II I think for Steve."

Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us this morning.
For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and, when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011.
In addition, we are in the process of finalizing our 2012 budget. As a result, we will not be providing formal guidance beyond 2011. However, we will be covering some illustrative 2012 impacts to help discuss liquidity expectations, and et cetera. We will provide 2012 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move now to earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the third quarter were $0.10 compared to the $0.28 in the second quarter and $0.30 in the year ago period. The loss per share decreased as compared to the second quarter, partly due to driver that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. 
In addition, loss per share decreased sequentially due to lower equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as well as lower net tax expense. 
The current period loss per share includes $0.09 in equity losses of unconsolidated investments and other, net of the effect of increased devaluation allowance. 
During the second and third quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2010, there were no adjustments made to OIBDA. As a result, we will refer to adjusted OIBDA as OIBDA throughout our call this morning. 
We recorded a net tax expense of $12 million in 3Q '11. As a reminder, 2Q '11 included a one-time $52 million expense resulting from the cumulative effect of changes in Michigan's corporate income tax law enacted in the second quarter. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million to $250 million. Also please keep in mind that Clearwire's third quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. Please refer to the press release in our form 10-Q for additional detail.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."
417206,141544923,178179,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I will organize my remarks as usual around our 3 key priorities, the customer experience, the brand and cash. Beginning with the customer experience. Earlier this year, we mentioned we had reached at least",2259,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I will organize my remarks as usual around our 3 key priorities, the customer experience, the brand and cash. 
Beginning with the customer experience. Earlier this year, we mentioned we had reached at least a tie for first place in the customer satisfaction ratings among major wireless carriers by well-respected independent evaluators like Consumer Reports and The American Customer Satisfaction Index. We went from last to first in a short period of time. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I am pleased that in this third quarter, we received 3 more awards from highly regarded J.D. Power and Associates for the purchase experience for the Sprint brand and for both customer service performance and for the purchase experience for Boost. Customer satisfaction is also reflected in churn. Prepaid churn achieved its best level in 6 years and postpaid churn was best ever for third quarter. Best 6 quarters of postpaid churn in our company's history have been the last 6 quarters.
Sequentially, churn did increase, driven primarily by an increase in involuntary churn due in part to a tougher U.S. economic climate. Voluntary churn, the part of churn driven by customer satisfaction brand, improved significantly year-over-year. 
Moving on to the brand in Slide 6. We continue to make progress with our key Brand Health metrics: Most want to investigate, Purchase Consideration, positive brand momentum, and first brand preference, each achieved all-time bests in the third quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 7. As I have discussed with you in the past, the most tangible evidence of brand improvement is subscriber performance and a strong brand is especially critical to generating gross adds or attracting new customers. As this chart depicts, Sprint's gross adds had been declining steadily since late 2005. The brand had weakened enough that gross adds dropped for 13 of 14 quarters, downward momentum being strong enough to blow right through seasonality, dropping by over 2 million postpaid gross adds per quarter. 
We had bottomed in the second quarter of 2009 and we've been building momentum ever since. Driven by brand health, we estimate our share of postpaid gross adds increased by 170 basis points versus the previous quarter. Number one reason customers leave Sprint or churn is no iPhone, and we believe the #1 reason new customers don't try Sprint has been no iPhone. 
Our early results of selling the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S have confirmed the iPhone's ability to attract new customers. What one hopes to see from a device is a high percentage of gross adds, new customers and new revenue to Sprint. The time we have been selling this device is very short, but early results indicate the iPhone is breaking the previous Sprint record held by the EVO in terms of the percentage of device buyers who are gross adds or new to Sprint in the weeks following the launch. 
We believe 2 weeks in the market is not enough time to constantly estimate expected gross add percentages, but we plan to provide you with that estimate after the full fourth quarter results are in. The early indications are extremely encouraging.
I'll discuss the iPhone's economic impact shortly, as will Joe. The high gross add percentage translates to revenue growth and provides an even more compelling reason for Sprint to carry the device. 
Please turn to Slide 8. In terms of overall subscriber performance, we generated almost 1.3 million net adds, the highest number in 5.5 years. It represents our fourth quarter in a row of over 1 million net adds and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. 
Slide 9 shows year-over-year postpaid net add improvement or decline. As many of you know, Sprint's largest decline was from 2005 to 2006, but we began improving sequentially beginning in 2009. 
For the third quarter of 2011, our postpaid net adds improved sequentially and also improved year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter. 
In terms of the year-over-year improvement needed to be net add positive for calendar year 2011, 654,000 you see on this chart shows that we're more than 3/4 of the way to the goal of 855,000, which we need through 3 quarters.
If you would please turn to Slide 10. Further proof of the strengthening of the Sprint brand has been the continuing strong performance of Sprint branded services. As you can see from the chart, in terms of annual subscriber growth, the Sprint brand is the fastest-growing major postpaid brand in America. Sprint brand net adds grew sequentially and were positive for the eighth consecutive quarter. The Sprint brand was net port positive for the sixth consecutive quarter, meaning more customers are switching from competitors to the Sprint brand than vice versa, Sprint's longest such streak ever. Being good stewards of the environment is an important element of our brand. 
Please turn to Slide 11. If you haven't seen the current release in Newsweek, we have an article on America's 25 greenest companies. We're the only telecommunications or wireless company on the list, moving up to the #3 spot from #6 last year. 
We've also recently been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America and to the World Wildlife Fund's Climate Savers Program, only the 28th company named to this elite program since 1999.
Moving onto our cash priority, which Joe will cover in more details in his remarks, perhaps the strongest element of Q3 performance was financial.
Please turn to Slide 12. This quarter, we had the largest year-over-year improvement in postpaid ARPU this century and the highest sequential improvement in 6 years.  Year-over-year improvement in CDMA ARPU also set an all-time record. 
Turning to Slide 13, as a result of postpaid ARPU growth and prepaid subscriber growth, total operating revenues were up year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. Total service revenues and wireless service revenues saw the largest year-to-year percentage increases since 2006, driving the best third quarter OIBDA improvement percentage since the third quarter of 2005, which was the first time that Nextel's OIBDA was added in.  Otherwise, the third quarter sequential OIBDA percentage improvement could have been our best in 11 years.
We average $1.4 billion in OIBDA per quarter in the first half of 2011, the same number we achieved this quarter and without the iPhone, we would have expected a similar number in this year's fourth quarter. 
Our bottom line performance has benefited from a number of steps we have taken recently, which also put us in a position to maximize customer lifetime value with the iPhone. 
You may have noticed by now that I mentioned independent customer satisfaction recognition but I have not mentioned sequential improvement in Customer Care Satisfaction. I had been able to report that improvement for 14 quarters in a row. Every quarter since I've been here, it was quite a streak. I can't report a 15 consecutive quarter of improvement because of a number of financially prudent steps we have taken recently, not all of which are popular with customers. 
Earlier this year, we increased the monthly rate for our unlimited mobile-to-mobile tax and data plans by $10 per month for new customers and for upgrades. This has been the largest driver of our ARPU improvement. 
In the third quarter, we increased the number of fees including upgrade fees and early termination fees. We've also been increasing our efforts to enforce our network usage terms and conditions. 
We've also eliminated the Premier Loyalty Program and with it, the associated early upgrade provisions. You've seen this effect, a fewer upgrades last quarter. 
All of these changes have been put into the market in a short period of time, making a 15th consecutive quarter of Customer Care Satisfaction survey improvement too much of a challenge.
Part of the reason to make these changes in areas like upgrade policy and early termination fees was to prepare for the potential launch of and maximize the profitability of the iPhone. We recently attended the movie Moneyball with my youngest son, and I couldn't help but be reminded of Sprint's situation. The Oakland A's, think Sprint, for trying to compete and win with a fraction of the financial resources of its deep-pocketed adversaries, the Yankees and the Red Sox, think AT&T and Verizon. Knowing that's in eye with one of these high payroll teams signs a superstar. But in Sprint's version of the movie, Dan Hesse, played by Brad Pitt, look-alike, and Joe Euteneuer, played by Jonah Hill, I won't say anything, had done detail statistical analyses that a particular player, Isaac phone, [ph] better known as iPhone, versus A-Rod, not only deliver the runs on the field to win the game but also help draw the crowd and fill the seats in their high-fixed costs stadium. iPhone has an expensive contract but is worth every penny.
Turning to Slide 14, this is a depiction of single customer profitability, what we call customer lifetime value. Dollars of the y-axis; time, the x-axis. Green line represents total costs. On day 1, the carrier invests in subscriber acquisition costs also known as CPGA, largest component of which is the phone's subsidy. And over time a number of customer support costs are incurred, the most significant being network usage. 
Building to Slide #15, we've added the revenue line The slope of which is ARPU. A higher ARPU means you reach breakeven sooner. After the breakeven date, the carriers starts to make money. The vertical line on the right depicts customer life or the inverse of churn. Further this line is to the right, the better. The shaded triangle is the customer lifetime value, which is the area between your revenue and cost lines in between the breakeven date and churn date. 
This is a real chart representing a top-selling Sprint postpaid smartphone today. If this were a typical prepaid device chart, we hit breakeven sooner because of the lower CPGA. The customer lifetime value is generally lower than postpaid, primarily because churn is usually much higher, therefore customer life is shorter.
Turning to Slide 16. We've superimposed our expected economics for the iPhone. For confidentiality reasons, we have taken the legends off the axis, but these graphs are true to scale. These are genuine internal Sprint charts plotted using actual numbers and projections. We expect the customer lifetime value of an iPhone customer to be at least 50%, yes, at least 50% greater in a typical smartphone user, driven primarily by more efficient use of our network and lower churn. 
In addition, not reflected in this chart, is the upside of more new revenue to Sprint, new fans to offset the fixed cost of our stadium, if you will, because we expect the iPhone to generate a significantly higher number of new users to Sprint. Joe has a chart which depicts the net present value for Sprint of carrying the iPhone. We expect the improved customer lifetime value I have just described to contribute $6 billion to $6.8 billion and new gross adds to contribute another $1 billion to $1.2 billion for a total net present value benefit of $7 billion to $8 billion over the life of the customers, which choose the iPhone during the 4 years of our agreement with Apple.
There is a misperception that our launch of the iPhone will increase the load on Sprint's 3G network and require us to spend more 3G capital. The reverse is true. iPhone users are expected to use significantly less 3G than a typical user of a dual-mode 3G, 4G device. Even adjusting for more total new customers being added to the network, we believe will put less load on our 3G network than they would have if we did not carry the iPhone. 
We're pleased to announce that we have signed a non-binding cooperation agreement with Clearwire to work together on the technical specifications of the Clearwire LTE network and to ensure a superb customer experience to Sprint customers on the Clearwire LTE network. The cooperation extends to the design and operations of the network and ensure seamless handoffs and service layer control that meets Sprint's customer experience requirements, cover the cell site selection and timing of site builds and involves working with OEMs to design devices and to include certain chipsets in devices. 
As you should each understand, it was necessary to reach this agreement in order to clear the way to begin the negotiations of commercial terms under which Sprint may utilize and pay for access to the Clearwire LTE network. A definitive agreement will allow Sprint to meet its objective to further improve the customer experience and to manage its fixed network costs by offloading some 4G usage from its own LTE network on to the Clearwire LTE network and thereby benefit from Clearwire's large spectrum portfolio on a resale basis. 
Those discussions are ongoing and the terms resulting from those discussions, if any, will be disclosed only at such time that a definitive and binding agreement has been reached by the parties. 
So in conclusion, strong ARPU growth and wireless subscriber gains drove a strong year-over-year and sequential improvement in adjusted OIBDA. This quarter, we received more accolades for the improvements we've made in the customer experience and our brand continues to strengthen as measured by brand metrics and by subscriber growth. 
We believe the investments we're making in Network Vision and in the iPhone will be very beneficial for Sprint's customers and for our shareholders over the long term. 
Our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will now discuss our financial picture in more detail."

I want to start by apologizing to everyone on the call for not having provided enough information and clarity on October 7. On hindsight, there were things we could've done to better address our concerns. We believe you will find today's call to be a demonstration of our willingness to continue to provide wholesome concise disclosures. 
On today's call, I will discuss our third quarter results, update our forecast and provide additional detail on liquidity, financing, Network Vision and the iPhone.
I'd like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the third quarter. Total consolidated net operating revenues grew by $181 million, or 2%, year-over-year, primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of net prepaid subscribers partially offset by lower wireline revenues and lower wireless equipment revenues. 
Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues remain relatively flat at $8.3 billion as growth in wireless service revenues was offset by lower equipment and wireline revenues. 
Now let's discuss wireless service revenues on Slide 17. Third quarter wireless service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, improved by $465 million, or 7% year-over-year, and by $138 million, or 2%, sequentially. Year-over-year and sequential improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and growth in net prepaid subscribers.
Postpaid ARPU improved by nearly $3, or 5%, year-over-year, and $1, or 2%, sequentially to $58. This was the largest quarterly sequential increase in 6 years. 
Our $10 premium data add-on charge, along with other fee increases including a $1 for 14% increase in our handset protection plan drove this sequential postpaid ARPU growth in the third quarter. We expect the $10 premium data add-on charge to result in additional postpaid ARPU improvement in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Prepaid ARPU declined approximately 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Prepaid ARPU performance was stable across the individual brands and the sequential decline was primarily due to a higher mix of assurance customers. 
Looking forward, as we stated previously, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cost overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate.
Switching to wireless expense trends on Slide 18. Total net wireless subsidy expense increased $92 million, or 9%, year-over-year, and increased $12 million, or 1%, sequentially. 
The sequential increase based on customer activations was driven by a lower postpaid subscriber upgrade volume of 8%, offset by higher postpaid gross customer additions of 12% and an increase in the average subsidy rate for postpaid devices of 3%. 
The elimination of the Premier Loyalty Program contributed to the decline in the upgrade volume.
Wireless cost of service increased $195 million, or 9%, year-over-year and $95 million, or 4%, sequentially. The sequential change in wireless cost of service includes $55 million, or 58%, that relates to smartphone subscriber growth and seasonal increases in roaming, service and repair and network site utilities. 
An additional $35 million, or 37%, is driven by network related expenses, including Network Vision. The higher service and repair costs were related to the increased mix of smartphones and third quarter seasonality. 
Wireless selling, general and administrative cost increased $29 million, or 1%, year-over-year and improved $81 million, or 4%, sequentially. Sequential improvement was a result of our planned marketing reduction in the third quarter, partially offset by higher bad debt, primarily associated with an increase in our reserve for doubtful accounts as a result of increases in our aging buckets combined with higher average write-off per account.
Now let's move to consolidated OIBDA on Slide 19. Consolidated OIBDA margin increased 10 basis points year-over-year and approximately 100 basis points sequentially to 18.2%. Consolidated OIBDA increased $63 million, or 5%, year-over-year and $88 million, or 7%, sequentially, slightly over $1.4 billion for the third quarter. Sequentially, OIBDA improved primarily due to higher postpaid and prepaid wireless service revenues and reduced marketing expenses, partially offset by higher wireless cost of service. 
In the third quarter, our OIBDA results included $30 million of operating expenses related to Network Vision. We now expect the full year operating expense impact of Network Vision to be between $100 million and $150 million, which is down from our prior estimates of between $200 million and $250 million. 
Wireline OIBDA declined $87 million, or 32%, year-over-year and by $26 million, or 12%, sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue resulting from the continued migration of wholesale cable voice over IP customers off of Sprint's wireline platform. We continue to expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voice over IP customers to cause wireline OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year 2011.
Before we discuss our third quarter liquidity, I wanted to provide an update on our revolving credit facility. We are pleased to announce the expansion of our credit facility by $150 million. 
In addition, we are now seeing an amendment modifying the debt to OIBDA covenant ratio to adjust for the subsidy impact of the iPhone. The amendment provides an exclusion of net subsidy costs up to $2.7 billion during the next 6 quarters. We are very pleased with the vote of confidence from our bank group in providing us this amendment and the increase in our revolver. 
Let's move on to cash and liquidity on Slide 20. We ended the third quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $5 billion, including about $4 billion in cash and $1 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolver. Our next note in loan maturities totaling $2.25 billion are due in March of 2012. After maturities in the first quarter of 2012, our next note maturity of $300 million occurs in May of 2013, followed by a $1.5 billion maturity in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Accrued capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest of $103 million and including $115 million of Network Vision capital, were $760 million the third quarter and compared to $640 million in the second quarter and $462 million in the third quarter of 2010. We continue to expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest and spectrum spend related to rebanding, driven largely by CDMA capacity.
We now expect rebanding spend for the calendar year 2011 to be between $250 million and $300 million as public safety licensees continue to need additional time to work through the right configurations, which is down from our previous estimate between $300 million and $350 million. As of September 30, 2011, we have approximately $500 million to $800 million of rebanding work still remaining. 
Now let's discuss free cash flow on Slide 21. Free cash flow was a negative $273 million for the quarter compared to a positive $384 million for the third quarter of 2010 and a positive $267 million for the second quarter of 2011. While quarterly OIBDA was relatively stable year-over-year and sequentially, free cash flow was reduced by quarter year-over-year increases in capital expenditures of $328 million, as well as year-over-year and sequential increases in working capital of $483 million and $697 million, respectively, partially offset by LightSquared prepayments. The quarterly year-over-year change in working capital is primarily associated with increased inventory balances related to second quarter handset purchases in anticipation of a part shortage later in the year and reductions in accounts payable. The quarterly sequential change in working capital is primarily associated with the reduction in accounts payable of $847 million, of which $700 million was related to payments associated with second quarter inventory purchases, partially offset by reduced inventory purchases during the quarter. 
In addition, third quarter also included higher cash interest payments of $90 million as a result of timing and higher capital expenditures of $59 million.
Now let's move to a discussion of the iPhone on Slide 22. As Dan discussed, we believe the iPhone will be value accretive for Sprint. 
In addition, we believe that the iPhone will strengthen our competitive position. We expect iPhone customers to be among our most profitable as the higher upfront acquisition costs are expected to be offset by longer customer tenure and lower support costs, including data efficiency. 
I want to share some additional specifics about the iPhone and our estimate for what it means to our business. Initially, we expect the cost for gross addition for an iPhone customer to be nearly 40% higher than the average non-iPhone customer, roughly $200 driven entirely by the cost into the device.  As depicted in the top graph, it is anticipated that the total net present value of iPhone customers we bring on during the 4-year term of the agreement is expected to be $7 billion to $8 million. 
Think of the total net present value in 2 large categories. The incremental new gross adds to the iPhone will allow us to generate, which represents 15% of the NPV, and the remaining 85% of the NPV results from the higher profitability of an iPhone subscriber as a result of expected lower churn, more efficient use of the network and overall lower support costs. 
As you can see in the bottom graph, iPhone OIBDA begins improving in 2013 and continues to build momentum through 2015, and the benefits exceed the incremental acquisition cost of new customers. 
As a result of the popularity of this device, we anticipate the iPhone could be 20% to 40% of our postpaid gross additions and upgrades. The upfront costs are estimated to impact 2012 and 2013 OIBDA by $900 million to $1.2 billion each, but are quickly recovered as we expect iPhone customers to generate approximately 20% higher monthly margins than our other smartphone customers. We have a 4-year agreement with Apple that is subject to a confidentiality agreement. Our ultimate spend with Apple will depend on many variables, including anticipated rate of future subscriber growth, number of different devices offered and the cost of devices offered. We anticipate outperforming the current contract minimum commitment of $15.5 billion for the iPhone over the 4-year period.
Now let's move on to Network Vision on Slide 23. We're excited about the opportunity created by the acceleration of Network Vision deployment and the ability to begin recognizing the financial and operational benefits sooner rather than later. I've provided the breakout of gross benefits and gross cost related to Network Vision. From 2011 to 2014, gross expected benefit is approximately $4 billion, of which 40% is a result of cost savings from the iDEN network, and 50% comes from expected reduction of 3G and 4G roaming expenses and backhaul. 
In calculating the full 7-year benefit that we presented on October 7, the estimated 3G and 4G roaming costs, assuming a compounded annual growth rate for subscribers of approximately 7% to 8% and increasing the usage per subscriber. 
In addition, we estimated the decommissioning of over 25,000 iDEN sites. In looking at the gross operating cost as a result of the Network Vision from 2011 to 2014, over 90% of these costs are from the following 2 items: 50% comes from migration efforts and incremental churn related to the iDEN subscriber base; and 40% from an increase in expenses related to cell sites, such as rent entitlements for additional equipment on the towers, excess and backhaul as we switch from the T1s to ethernet fiber. 
As you can see in 2014, cumulative gross benefits exceeded cumulative gross cost associated with Network Vision. The operating expense reductions from Network Vision are expected to generate between 400 and 600 basis points of OIBDA margin improvement by 2014. 
We expect Network Vision to generate a total net benefit of $10 billion to $11 billion over 7 years with a projected NPV of approximately $6 billion. 
Let's move on to Slide 24. The purpose of this slide is to illustrate our estimated financing needs over the next couple of years. Let me start by discussing exactly what is represented on the chart. Each of the bars represent the incremental cash impact for Network Vision and iPhone, including both capital and operating expenses net of benefits. The dotted line illustrates an assumed targeted cash level. The black lines on the chart represent the estimated ending cash balance as a result of the incremental cash impact from Network Vision and the iPhone. Additionally, the black lines include scheduled debt maturities and assume of range of potential cash generation from our core business, excluding Network Vision and the iPhone. 
A way to think about cash generation from our core business for purposes of this slide is that the bottom black line assumes stable core OIBDA levels as we exit Q3. While the top line represents potential opportunities that exist in our core business to expand our operating margins and grow cash flow. 
If you assume that these margin opportunities for both revenue and expense generate an OIBDA that had a compounded annual growth rate of 10% starting in 2012, we would achieve the top black line. Our externally reported OIBDA will be the net result of core business performance, net of the iPhone and Network Vision, all of which will be different than what is illustrated here today. As we get more operating results with the iPhone and start rolling out Network Vision, we'll provide better information. As mentioned earlier, we are in the process of completing our 2012 budgeting process, which we will include evaluating those core business opportunities and the development of our operational plan.
In looking at 2012, we expect the cost related to Network Vision and the iPhone to impact cash by roughly $5.5 billion, partially offset by the benefits generated from Network Vision and the iPhone of $1.1 billion, where we expect positive growth. 
Taking into account these impacts and the potential cash generation from our core business along with our scheduled debt maturity in March of $2.25 billion, cash shortage in 2012 ranges between $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion. 
For 2013, we expect the combined iPhone and Network Vision costs to be $5.7 billion and the benefits to be $4.3 billion. As depicted by the black line, this results in a cumulative cash shortage of $3.2 billion to $5 billion after growth in cash generation from the core business and scheduled debt maturities of $1.8 billion.
As discussed earlier, in 2014, we expect Network Vision benefits to exceed costs by $3.4 billion, while the net iPhone costs will exceed benefits by less than $400 million. 
Combined, we expect cash accretion of approximately $3 billion in 2014 from Network Vision and the iPhone. 
In 2015, the benefits outweigh the cost for both Network Vision and the iPhone, resulting in greater cash accretion, which is approximately $4.7 billion. So what I want you to take away from the slide is that we estimate the peak of our cash shortfall to occur in 2013 and to be between $3.2 billion and $5 billion. 
As a result, if you assume a targeted cash balance of $2 billion, we would project financing needs to range between $5 billion and $7 billion. 
To adjust our projected financing needs during the next couple of years, we expect to refinance our $4 billion of upcoming debt maturities through October 2013 to the public debt markets and raise incremental vendor financing of approximately $1 billion to $3 billion to cover a portion of Network Vision costs. 
Now let me update our forecast. We expect net postpaid subscriber additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total net wireless subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. The company expects full year capital expenditures in 2011 excluding capitalized interest to be approximately $3 billion. 
In addition, the company expects free cash flow between negative $200 million and a positive $100 million for 2011 subject to the performance of the iPhone. 
Sequentially, from the third to the fourth quarter, we expect growth in the volume of retail wireless gross adds and upgrades driven by the availability of the iPhone, normal industry seasonality for the fourth quarter and continued success of our already compelling device line-up and industry-leading unlimited plan offerings. We expect the combination of both increased volume and rate impacts associated with the iPhone to result in a reduction in fourth quarter OIBDA of between $500 million and $700 million. The more often customers choose Sprint as their iPhone carrier and the more inventory that is available, the greater the OIBDA impact. 
In addition, we expect total Network Vision expense of $16 million in fourth quarter. This results in OIBDA in the range of $600 million to $800 million and a margin of less than 10% for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Remember, we are just beginning our operational experience with the deployment of the iPhone and our flexible technical platform of Network Vision. This will allow us to achieve future growth over time. We plan to provide a forecast for 2012, including OIBDA on our fourth quarter earnings call. I want to take the time to thank all of you for your support and your constructive suggestions over the past few weeks. We will continue to make progress to improve clarity of our disclosures. 
Thank you, and now let me turn the call back over to Yijing."

It may sound simple to you and me, but it's really fairly complex to make sure that networks work well together, particularly that there's an architecture so there's a seamless handoff because what we are intending to do with Network Vision and also with thinking of Clearwire as a part of that list of -- group of assets that we have in terms of different spectrum bands, we want our network to be able to seamlessly hand off very quickly based upon the most efficient low-cost best coverage, best capacity alternative we have for any particular call. But if, let's say, if calls moving from the 2.5 gigahertz to the 1.9 gigahertz or to the 800 megahertz frequencies, we want that to be very seamless. So this was really the technical teams, the network teams of Clearwire and Sprint, working through all the technical details to make sure we both really felt we had a good technical plan, and that is now the foundation that we needed that we can begin to discuss, if you will, the commercial agreement going forward."

What we said was that if LightSquared and our numbers did not include or assume that LightSquared capacity would be used, but if we were to -- if they were to get FCC approval and if they were to get financing and if this was to move forward, it would probably add another year's worth of capacity growth on to our network. Clearwire, if we were to reach agreement with Clearwire, again we have not yet, but the MOU that I've described today lays that foundation to do that, would add additional years plural to that capacity as well. So really, nothing has changed. We just make progress. And again, if LightSquared comes online, that gives us another potential use of capacity.

When I look at that $600 million drag to EBITDA in 4Q, it seems like either the volumes you're anticipating are extremely large, well above the $1 million that I think that most people had in their models or there must be some other costs in addition to just subsidy costs, significant other cost that are going in there and I'm wondering if you can give us more color on that and let us know whether any of it is one-time in nature?"

For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and, when filed, Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011.
In addition, we are in the process of finalizing our 2012 budget. As a result, we will not be providing formal guidance beyond 2011. However, we will be covering some illustrative 2012 impacts to help discuss liquidity expectations and et cetera. We will provide 2012 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move onto earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the third quarter were $0.10 compared to the $0.28 in the second quarter and $0.30 in the year ago period. The loss per share decreased as compared to the second quarter, partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on in the call. 
In addition, loss per share decreased sequentially due to lower equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as well as lower net tax expense. 
The current period loss per share includes $0.09 in equity losses of unconsolidated investments and other, net of the effect of increased devaluation allowance. 
During the second and third quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2010, there were no adjustments made to OIBDA. As a result, we will refer to adjusted OIBDA as OIBDA throughout our call this morning. 
We recorded a net tax expense of $12 million in 3Q '11. As a reminder, 2Q '11 included a one-time $52 million expense resulting from the cumulative effect of changes in Michigan's corporate income tax law enacted in the second quarter. 
For the full year 2011, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million to $250 million. Also please keep in mind that Clearwire's third quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. Please refer to the press release in our Form 10-Q for additional detail.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."
417206,141544923,178389,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2011",2011-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I’ll organize my remarks as usual around our 3 key priorities: the customer experience, the brand and cash. Beginning with the customer experience. Earlier this year, we mentioned we had reached at least",2269,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I’ll organize my remarks as usual around our 3 key priorities: the customer experience, the brand and cash. 
Beginning with the customer experience. Earlier this year, we mentioned we had reached at least a tie for first place in the customer satisfaction ratings among major wireless carriers by well-respected independent evaluators like Consumer Reports and The American Customer Satisfaction Index. We went from last to first in a short period of time. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I am pleased that in this third quarter, we received 3 more awards from highly regarded J.D. Power and Associates for the purchase experience for the Sprint brand and for both customer service performance and for the purchase experience for Boost. Customer satisfaction is also reflected in churn. Prepaid churn achieved its best level in 6 years and postpaid churn was best ever for third quarter. The best 6 quarters of postpaid churn in our company's history have been the last 6 quarters.
Sequentially, churn did increase, driven primarily by an increase in involuntary churn due in part to a tougher U.S. economic climate. Voluntary churn, the part of churn driven by customer satisfaction and brand, improved significantly year-over-year. 
Moving onto the brand in Slide 6. We continue to make progress with our key Brand Health metrics: Most want to investigate, Purchase Consideration, positive brand momentum, and first brand preference, each achieved all-time bests in the third quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 7. As I have discussed with you in the past, the most tangible evidence of brand improvement is subscriber performance and a strong brand is especially critical to generating gross adds or attracting new customers. As this chart depicts, Sprint's gross adds had been declining steadily since late 2005. The brand had weakened enough that gross adds dropped for 13 of 14 quarters, the downward momentum being strong enough to blow right through seasonality, dropping by over 2 million postpaid gross adds per quarter. 
We hit bottom in the second quarter of 2009 and we've been building momentum ever since. Driven by brand health, we estimate our share of postpaid gross adds increased by 170 basis points versus the previous quarter. The number one reason customers leave Sprint or churn is no iPhone, and we believe the #1 reason new customers don't try Sprint has been no iPhone. 
Our early results of selling the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S have confirmed the iPhone's ability to attract new customers. What one hopes to see from a device is a high percentage of gross adds, new customers and new revenue to Sprint. The time we have been selling this device is very short, but early results indicate the iPhone is breaking the previous Sprint record held by the EVO in terms of the percentage of device buyers who are gross adds or new to Sprint in the weeks following the launch. 
We believe 2 weeks in the market is not enough time to constantly estimate expected gross add percentages, but we plan to provide you with that estimate after the full fourth quarter results are in. But early indications are extremely encouraging.
I'll discuss the iPhone's economic impact shortly, as will Joe. But a high gross add percentage translates to revenue growth and provides an even more compelling reason for Sprint to carry the device. 
Please turn to Slide 8. In terms of overall subscriber performance, we generated almost 1.3 million net adds, the highest number in 5.5 years. It represents our fourth quarter in a row of over 1 million net adds and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. 
Slide 9 shows year-over-year postpaid net add improvement or decline. As many of you know, Sprint's largest decline was from 2005 to 2006, but we began improving sequentially beginning in 2009. 
For the third quarter of 2011, our postpaid net adds improved sequentially and also improved year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter. 
In terms of the year-over-year improvement needed to be net add positive for calendar year 2011, the 654,000 you see on this chart shows that we're more than 3/4 of the way to the goal of 855,000, which we need through 3 quarters.
If you would please turn to Slide 10. Further proof of the strengthening of the Sprint brand has been the continuing strong performance of Sprint branded services. As you can see from the chart, in terms of annual subscriber growth, the Sprint brand is the fastest-growing major postpaid brand in America. Sprint brand net adds grew sequentially and were positive for the eighth consecutive quarter. The Sprint brand was net port positive for the sixth consecutive quarter, meaning more customers are switching from competitors to the Sprint brand than vice versa, Sprint's longest such streak ever. Being good stewards of the environment is an important element of our brand. 
Please turn to Slide 11. If you haven't seen the current release in Newsweek, they have an article on America's 25 greenest companies. We're the only telecommunications or wireless company on the list, moving up to the #3 spot from #6 last year. 
We have also recently been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America and to the World Wildlife Fund's Climate Savers Program, only the 28th company named to this elite program since 1999.
Moving onto our cash priority, which Joe will cover in more details in his remarks, perhaps the strongest element of Q3 performance was financial.
Please turn to Slide 12. This quarter, we had the largest year-over-year improvement in postpaid ARPU this century and the highest sequential improvement in 6 years.  Year-over-year improvement in CDMA ARPU also set an all-time record. 
Turning to Slide 13, as a result of postpaid ARPU growth and prepaid subscriber growth, total operating revenues were up year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. Total service revenues and wireless service revenues saw the largest year-to-year percentage increases since 2006, driving the best third quarter OIBDA improvement percentage since the third quarter of 2005, which was the first time that Nextel's OIBDA was added in.  Otherwise, the third quarter sequential OIBDA percentage improvement would have been our best in 11 years.
We averaged $1.4 billion in OIBDA per quarter in the first half of 2011, the same number we achieved this quarter and without the iPhone, we would have expected a similar number in this year's fourth quarter. 
Our bottom line performance has benefited from a number of steps we have taken recently, which also put us in a position to maximize customer lifetime value with the iPhone. 
You may have noticed by now that I mentioned independent customer satisfaction recognition but I have not mentioned sequential improvement in Customer Care Satisfaction. I had been able to report that improvement for 14 quarters in a row. Every quarter since I've been here, it was quite a streak. I can't report a 15th consecutive quarter of improvement because of a number of financially prudent steps we have taken recently, not all of which are popular with customers. 
Earlier this year, we increased the monthly rate for our unlimited mobile-to-mobile text and data plans by $10 per month for new customers and for upgrades. This has been the largest driver of our ARPU improvement. 
In the third quarter, we increased the number of fees including upgrade fees and early termination fees. We have also been increasing our efforts to enforce our network usage terms and conditions. 
We have also eliminated the Premier Loyalty Program and with it, the associated early upgrade provisions. You've seen this effect with fewer upgrades last quarter. 
All of these changes have been put into the market in a short period of time, making a 15th consecutive quarter of Customer Care Satisfaction survey improvement too much of a challenge.
Part of the reason to make these changes in areas like upgrade policy and early termination fees was to prepare for the potential launch of and maximize the profitability of the iPhone. I recently attended the movie Moneyball with my youngest son, and I couldn't help but be reminded of Sprint's situation. The Oakland A's, think Sprint, for trying to compete and win with a fraction of the financial resources of its deep-pocketed adversaries, the Yankees and the Red Sox, think AT&T and Verizon. No one bats an eye with one of these high payroll teams signs a superstar. But in Sprint's version of the movie, Dan Hesse, played by Brad Pitt look-alike, and Joe Euteneuer, played by Jonah Hill, I won't say anything, had done detailed statistical analyses that a particular player, Isaac Phone, better known as iPhone, versus A-Rod, will not only deliver the runs on the field to win the game but also help draw the crowd and fill the seats in their high-fixed costs stadium. iPhone has an expensive contract but he’s worth every penny.
Turning to Slide 14, this is a depiction of single customer profitability, what we call customer lifetime value. Dollars are the y-axis; time, the x-axis. The green line represents total costs. On day 1, the carrier invests in subscriber acquisition costs also known as CPGA, the largest component of which is the phone's subsidy. Then over time, a number of customer support costs are incurred, the most significant being network usage. 
Building to Slide #15, we've added the revenue line, the slope of which is ARPU. A higher ARPU means you reach breakeven sooner. After the breakeven date, the carrier starts to make money. The vertical line on the right depicts customer life or the inverse of churn. The further this line is to the right, the better. The shaded triangle is the customer lifetime value, which is the area between your revenue and cost lines in between the breakeven date and churn date. 
This is a real chart representing a top-selling Sprint postpaid smartphone today. If this were a typical prepaid device chart, you’d hit breakeven sooner because of the lower CPGA. But customer lifetime value is generally lower than postpaid, primarily because churn is usually much higher, therefore customer life is shorter.
Turning to Slide 16. We've superimposed our expected economics for the iPhone. For confidentiality reasons, we have taken the legends off the axes, but these graphs are true to scale. These are genuine internal Sprint charts plotted using actual numbers and projections. We expect the customer lifetime value of an iPhone customer to be at least 50%, yes, at least 50% greater than a typical smartphone user, driven primarily by more efficient use of our network and lower churn. 
In addition, not reflected in this chart is the upside of more new revenue to Sprint, new fans to offset the fixed costs of our stadium, if you will, because we expect the iPhone to generate a significantly higher number of new users to Sprint. Joe has a chart which depicts the net present value for Sprint of carrying the iPhone. We expect the improved customer lifetime value I have just described to contribute $6 billion to $6.8 billion and new gross adds to contribute another $1 billion to $1.2 billion for a total net present value benefit of $7 billion to $8 billion over the life of the customers which choose the iPhone during the 4 years of our agreement with Apple.
There is a misperception that our launch of the iPhone will increase the load on Sprint's 3G network and require us to spend more 3G capital. The reverse is true. iPhone users are expected to use significantly less 3G than the typical user of a dual-mode 3G, 4G device. Even adjusting for more total new customers being added to the network, we believe will put less load on our 3G network than they would have if we did not carry the iPhone. 
We're pleased to announce that we have signed a non-binding cooperation agreement with Clearwire to work together on the technical specifications of the Clearwire LTE network and to ensure a superb customer experience for Sprint customers on the Clearwire LTE network. The cooperation extends to the design and operations of the network and ensure seamless handoffs in service layer control that meets Sprint's customer experience requirements, cover the cell site selection and timing of site builds and involves working with OEMs to design devices and to include certain chipsets in devices. 
As you should each understand, it was necessary to reach this agreement in order to clear the way to begin the negotiations of commercial terms under which Sprint may utilize and pay for access to the Clearwire LTE network. A definitive agreement would allow Sprint to meet its objective to further improve the customer experience and to manage its fixed network costs by offloading some 4G usage from its own LTE network onto the Clearwire LTE network and thereby benefit from Clearwire's large spectrum portfolio on a resale basis. 
Those discussions are ongoing and the terms resulting from those discussions, if any, will be disclosed only at such time that a definitive and binding agreement has been reached by the parties. 
So in conclusion, strong ARPU growth and wireless subscriber gains drove a strong year-over-year and sequential improvement in adjusted OIBDA. This quarter, we received more accolades for the improvements we've made in the customer experience and our brand continues to strengthen as measured by brand metrics and by subscriber growth. 
We believe the investments we're making in Network Vision and in the iPhone will be very beneficial for Sprint's customers and for our shareholders over the long term. 
Our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will now discuss our financial picture in more detail."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to start by apologizing to everyone on the call for not having provided enough information and clarity on October 7. On hindsight, there were things we could've done to bet",2867,"Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to start by apologizing to everyone on the call for not having provided enough information and clarity on October 7. On hindsight, there were things we could've done to better address marked concerns. We believe you will find today's call to be a demonstration of our willingness to continue to provide fulsome, concise disclosures. 
On today's call, I will discuss our third quarter results, update our forecast and provide additional detail on liquidity, financing, Network Vision and the iPhone.
Like to begin by discussing revenue performance for the third quarter. Total consolidated net operating revenues grew by $181 million, or 2%, year-over-year, primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of net prepaid subscribers, partially offset by lower wireline revenues and lower wireless equipment revenues. 
Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues remained relatively flat at $8.3 billion as growth in wireless service revenues was offset by lower equipment and wireline revenues. 
Now let's discuss wireless service revenues on Slide 17. Third quarter wireless service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, improved by $465 million, or 7% year-over-year, and by $138 million, or 2%, sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and growth in net prepaid subscribers.
Postpaid ARPU improved by nearly $3, or 5%, year-over-year, and $1, or 2%, sequentially to $58. This was the largest quarterly sequential increase in 6 years. 
Our $10 premium data add-on charge, along with other fee increases including $1 for a 14% increase in our handset protection plan drove this sequential postpaid ARPU growth in the third quarter. We expect the $10 premium data add-on charge to result in additional postpaid ARPU improvement in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Prepaid ARPU declined approximately 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Prepaid ARPU performance was stable across the individual brands and the sequential decline was primarily due to a higher mix of assurance customers. 
Looking forward, as we stated previously, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can cause overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate.
Switching to wireless expense trends on Slide 18. Total net wireless subsidy expense increased $92 million, or 9%, year-over-year, and increased $12 million, or 1%, sequentially. 
The sequential increase based on customer activations was driven by a lower postpaid subscriber upgrade volume of 8%, offset by higher postpaid gross customer additions of 12% and an increase in the average subsidy rate for postpaid devices of 3%. 
The elimination of the Premier Loyalty Program contributed to the decline in the upgrade volume.
Wireless cost of service increased $195 million, or 9%, year-over-year and $95 million, or 4%, sequentially. The sequential change in wireless cost of service includes $55 million, or 58%, that relates to smartphone subscriber growth and seasonal increases in roaming, service and repair and network site utilities. 
An additional $35 million, or 37%, is driven by network related expenses, including Network Vision. The higher service and repair costs were related to the increased mix of smartphones and third quarter seasonality. 
Wireless selling, general and administrative cost increased $29 million, or 1%, year-over-year and improved $81 million, or 4%, sequentially. The sequential improvement was a result of our planned marketing reduction in the third quarter, partially offset by higher bad debt, primarily associated with an increase in our reserve for doubtful accounts as a result of increases in our aging buckets combined with higher average write-off per account.
Now let's move to consolidated OIBDA on Slide 19. Consolidated OIBDA margin increased 10 basis points year-over-year and approximately 100 basis points sequentially to 18.2%. Consolidated OIBDA increased $63 million, or 5%, year-over-year and $88 million, or 7%, sequentially, to slightly over $1.4 billion for the third quarter. Sequentially, OIBDA improved primarily due to higher postpaid and prepaid wireless service revenues and reduced marketing expenses, partially offset by higher wireless cost of service. 
In the third quarter, our OIBDA results include $30 million of operating expenses related to Network Vision. We now expect the full year operating expense impact of Network Vision to be between $100 million and $150 million, which is down from our prior estimates of between $200 million and $250 million. 
Wireline OIBDA declined $87 million, or 32%, year-over-year and by $26 million, or 12%, sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue resulting from the continued migration of wholesale cable voice over IP customers off of Sprint's wireline platform. We continue to expect the full year 2011 impact of the migration of cable voice over IP customers to cause wireline OIBDA to decline by approximately $150 million for the full year 2011.
Before we discuss our third quarter liquidity, I wanted to provide an update on our revolving credit facility. We are pleased to announce the expansion of our credit facility by $150 million. 
In addition, we are now seeing an amendment modifying the debt to OIBDA covenant ratio to adjust for the subsidy impact of the iPhone. The amendment provides an exclusion of net subsidy costs up to $2.7 billion during the next 6 quarters. We are very pleased with the vote of confidence from our bank group in providing us this amendment and the increase in our revolver. 
Let's move on to cash and liquidity on Slide 20. We ended the third quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $5 billion, including about $4 billion in cash and $1 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolver. Our next note and loan maturities totaling $2.25 billion are due in March of 2012. After maturities in the first quarter of 2012, our next note maturity of $300 million occurs in May of 2013, followed by a $1.5 billion maturity in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Accrued capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest of $103 million and including $115 million of Network Vision capital, were $760 million in the third quarter and compared to $640 million in the second quarter and $462 million in the third quarter of 2010. We continue to expect that full year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest and spectrum spend related to rebanding, driven largely by CDMA capacity.
We now expect rebanding spend for the calendar year 2011 to be between $250 million and $300 million as public safety licensees continue to need additional time to work through their rate configurations, which is down from our previous estimate between $300 million and $350 million. As of September 30, 2011, we have approximately $500 million to $800 million of rebanding work still remaining. 
Now let's discuss free cash flow on Slide 21. Free cash flow was a negative $273 million for the quarter compared to a positive $384 million for the third quarter of 2010 and a positive $267 million for the second quarter of 2011. While quarterly OIBDA was relatively stable year-over-year and sequentially, free cash flow was reduced by quarter year-over-year increases in capital expenditures of $328 million, as well as year-over-year and sequential increases in working capital of $483 million and $697 million, respectively, partially offset by LightSquared prepayments. The quarterly year-over-year change in working capital is primarily associated with increased inventory balances related to second quarter handset purchases in anticipation of a parts shortage later in the year and reductions in accounts payable. The quarterly sequential change in working capital is primarily associated with the reduction in accounts payable of $847 million, of which $700 million was related to payments associated with second quarter inventory purchases, partially offset by reduced inventory purchases during the quarter. 
In addition, third quarter also included higher cash interest payments of $90 million as a result of timing and higher capital expenditures of $59 million.
Now let's move to a discussion of the iPhone on Slide 22. As Dan discussed, we believe the iPhone will be value accretive for Sprint. 
In addition, we believe that the iPhone will strengthen our competitive position. We expect iPhone customers to be among our most profitable as the higher upfront acquisition costs are expected to be offset by longer customer tenure and lower support costs, including data efficiency. 
I want to share some additional specifics about the iPhone and our estimate for what it means to our business. Initially, we expect the cost per gross addition for an iPhone customer to be nearly 40% higher than the average non-iPhone customer, roughly $200 driven entirely by the cost of the device.  As depicted in the top graph, it is anticipated that the total net present value of iPhone customers we bring on during the 4-year term of the agreement is expected to be $7 billion to $8 million. 
Think of the total net present value in 2 large categories. The incremental new gross adds that the iPhone will allow us to generate, which represents 15% of the NPV, and the remaining 85% of the NPV results from the higher profitability of an iPhone subscriber as a result of expected lower churn, more efficient use of the network and overall lower support costs. 
As you can see in the bottom graph, iPhone OIBDA begins improving in 2013 and continues to build momentum through 2015, when the benefits exceed the incremental acquisition cost of new customers. 
As a result of the popularity of this device, we anticipate the iPhone could be 20% to 40% of our postpaid gross additions and upgrades. The upfront costs are estimated to impact 2012 and 2013 OIBDA by $900 million to $1.2 billion each, but are quickly recovered as we expect iPhone customers to generate approximately 20% higher monthly margins than our other smartphone customers. We have a 4-year agreement with Apple that is subject to a confidentiality agreement. Our ultimate spend with Apple will depend on many variables, including anticipated rate of future subscriber growth, number of different devices offered and the cost of devices offered. We anticipate outperforming the current contract minimum commitment of $15.5 billion for the iPhone over the 4-year period.
Now let's move onto Network Vision on Slide 23. We're excited about the opportunity created by the acceleration of Network Vision deployment and the ability to begin recognizing the financial and operational benefits sooner rather than later. I've provided the breakout of gross benefits and gross costs related to Network Vision. From 2011 to 2014, gross expected benefit is approximately $4 billion, of which 40% is a result of cost savings from the iDEN network, and 50% comes from expected reduction of 3G and 4G roaming expenses and backhaul. 
In calculating the full 7-year benefit that we presented on October 7, we estimated 3G and 4G roaming costs, assuming a compounded annual growth rate for subscribers of approximately 7% to 8% and increasing usage per subscriber. 
In addition, we estimated the decommissioning of over 25,000 iDEN sites. In looking at the gross operating cost as a result of the Network Vision from 2011 to 2014, over 90% of these costs are from the following 2 items: 50% comes from migration efforts and incremental churn related to the iDEN subscriber base; and 40% from an increase in expenses related to cell sites, such as rent entitlements for additional equipment on the towers, access and backhaul as we switch from the T1s to Ethernet fiber. 
As you can see in 2014, cumulative gross benefits exceeded cumulative gross cost associated with Network Vision. The operating expense reductions from Network Vision are expected to generate between 400 and 600 basis points of OIBDA margin improvement by 2014. 
We expect Network Vision to generate a total net benefit of $10 billion to $11 billion over 7 years with a projected NPV of approximately $6 billion. 
Let's move on to Slide 24. The purpose of this slide is to illustrate our estimated financing needs over the next couple of years. Let me start by discussing exactly what is represented on the chart. Each of the bars represent the incremental cash impact for Network Vision and iPhone, including both capital and operating expenses net of benefits. The dotted line illustrates an assumed targeted cash level. The black lines on the chart represent the estimated ending cash balance as a result of the incremental cash impact from Network Vision and the iPhone. Additionally, the black lines include scheduled debt maturities and assume a range of potential cash generation from our core business, excluding Network Vision and the iPhone. 
The way to think about cash generation from our core business for purposes of this slide is that the bottom black line assumes stable core OIBDA levels as we exit Q3. While the top line represents potential opportunities that exist in our core business to expand our operating margins and grow cash flow. 
If you assume that these margin opportunities for both revenue and expense generate an OIBDA that had a compounded annual growth rate of 10% starting in 2012, you would achieve the top black line. Our externally reported OIBDA will be the net result of core business performance, net of the iPhone and Network Vision, all of which will be different than what is illustrated here today. As we get more operating results with the iPhone and start rolling out Network Vision, we'll provide better information. As mentioned earlier, we are in the process of completing our 2012 budgeting process, which we will include evaluating those core business opportunities and the development of our operational plan.
In looking at 2012, we expect the costs related to Network Vision and the iPhone to impact cash by roughly $5.5 billion, partially offset by the benefits generated from Network Vision and the iPhone of $1.1 billion, where we expect positive growth. 
Taking into account these impacts and the potential cash generation from our core business along with our scheduled debt maturity in March of $2.25 billion, the cash shortage in 2012 ranges between $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion. 
For 2013, we expect the combined iPhone and Network Vision costs to be $5.7 billion and the benefits to be $4.3 billion. As depicted by the black line, this results in a cumulative cash shortage of $3.2 billion to $5 billion after growth in cash generation from the core business and scheduled debt maturities of $1.8 billion.
As discussed earlier, in 2014, we expect Network Vision benefits to exceed costs by $3.4 billion, while the net iPhone costs will exceed benefits by less than $400 million. 
Combined, we expect cash accretion of approximately $3 billion in 2014 from Network Vision and the iPhone. 
In 2015, the benefits outweigh the costs for both Network Vision and the iPhone, resulting in greater cash accretion, which is approximately $4.7 billion. So what I want you to take away from this slide is that we estimate the peak of our cash shortfall to occur in 2013 and to be between $3.2 billion and $5 billion. 
As a result, if you assume a targeted cash balance of $2 billion, we would project financing needs to range between $5 billion and $7 billion. 
To adjust our projected financing needs during the next couple of years, we expect to refinance our $4 billion of upcoming debt maturities through October 2013 through the public debt markets and raise incremental vendor financing of approximately $1 billion to $3 billion to cover a portion of Network Vision costs. 
Now let me update our forecast. We expect net postpaid subscriber additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total net wireless subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to 2010. The company expects full year capital expenditures in 2011 excluding capitalized interest to be approximately $3 billion. 
In addition, the company expects free cash flow between negative $200 million and a positive $100 million for 2011 subject to the performance of the iPhone. 
Sequentially, from the third to the fourth quarter, we expect growth in the volume of retail wireless gross adds and upgrades driven by the availability of the iPhone, normal industry seasonality for the fourth quarter and continued success of our already compelling device line-up and industry-leading unlimited plan offerings. We expect the combination of both increased volume and rate impacts associated with the iPhone to result in a reduction in fourth quarter OIBDA of between $500 million and $700 million. The more often customers choose Sprint as their iPhone carrier and the more inventory that is available, the greater the OIBDA impact. 
In addition, we expect total Network Vision expense of $60 million in fourth quarter. This results in OIBDA in the range of $600 million to $800 million and a margin of less than 10% for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Remember, we are just beginning our operational experience with the deployment of the iPhone and our flexible technical platform of Network Vision. These will allow us to achieve future growth over time. We plan to provide a forecast for 2012, including OIBDA on our fourth quarter earnings call. I want to take the time to thank all of you for your support and your constructive suggestions over the past few weeks. We will continue to make progress to improve clarity of our disclosures. 
Thank you, and now let me turn the call back over to Yijing."

It may sound simple to you and me, but it's really fairly complex to make sure that networks work well together, particularly that there's an architecture so there's a seamless handoff. Because what we are intending to do with Network Vision and also with thinking of Clearwire as a part of that list of -- group of assets that we have in terms of different spectrum bands, we want our network to be able to seamlessly hand off very quickly based upon the most efficient low-cost best coverage, best capacity alternative we have for any particular call. But if, let's say, if a call’s moving from the 2.5 gigahertz to the 1.9 gigahertz or to the 800 megahertz frequencies, we want that to be very seamless. So this was really the technical teams, the network teams of Clearwire and Sprint, working through all the technical details to make sure we both really felt we had a good technical plan, and that is now the foundation that we needed that we can begin to discuss, if you will, the commercial agreement going forward."

Secondly, as you look at your iPhone guidance for dilution, if you look at the $1.9 billion in upgrades and handset sales with commissions, right now, you spend about $4.5 billion on subsidies. Is that $1.9 billion for 2012, is that all incremental to what the current subsidy and commission picture is or some of that potentially cannibalistic, i.e., there is some share shift so it's not purely incremental? And then just one other thing, if I could please, it looks like on the Vision operating expenses, if you total up the chart over the multiyear period that you provided, the OpEx looks higher than what you originally guided when you originally put together the Vision program.

What we talked about on the 7th is that our own spectrum resources, if we just basically used our own would take us into 2014, of course, and assumed the continuation of, if you will, the existing agreements with Clearwire. What we said was that if LightSquared and our numbers did not include or assume that LightSquared capacity would be used, but if we were to -- if they were to get FCC approval and if they were to get financing and if this was to move forward, it would probably add another year's worth of capacity growth onto our network. Clearwire, if we were to reach agreement with Clearwire, again we have not yet, but the MOU that I've described today lays that foundation to do that, would add additional years plural to that capacity as well. So really, nothing has changed. We just make progress. And again, if LightSquared comes online, that gives us another potential use of capacity. But we're making very good progress, we believe, on the technical front with Clearwire and I'll leave it at that. There's a part 2, I think, for Steve."
