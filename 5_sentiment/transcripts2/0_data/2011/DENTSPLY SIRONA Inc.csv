Thank you for joining us on our year end conference call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and COO; and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. O",1179,"Thank you, Clay and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our year end conference call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and COO; and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. On today's call, each of us will have some prepared statements and following those remarks, we'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.
Before we get started, it's important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings.
The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And a recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our Web site. 
This morning, we are pleased to announce record performance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2010. For the fourth quarter, sales XPM were up 0.3% with constant currency growth of 2.5% and negative currency headwinds of 2.2%. The constant currency growth was comprised of 1.7% internal growth and 0.8% growth from acquisitions. 
I think it's important to note when you look at the internal growth for the quarter, that in the third quarter conference call we commented that we thought the price increase pre-buy ahead of our October 1 price increase has probably move half a point out of the fourth quarter and into the third quarter. And on this call, we can confirm it was probably half a point or maybe just above that. 
This quarter caps the full year of 2010 where we had sales growth, XPM of 2.1% with constant currency growth of 2.6% and currency a negative of 0.5%. The constant currency growth for the full year was comprised of internal growth of 2.1% and acquisition growth of 0.5%. 
Based on the market data we have available to us today, these results put us at maybe the high end of what we believe the global dental consumable market grew in 2010. We'd say the feel of the market is better today than when we entered 2010 and is showing signs of gradually accelerating. However, the market has not yet returned to the historical growth pattern that we saw before the recession.
The fourth quarter geographic and internal growth XPM was plus 0.6% in the U.S., plus 1.0% in Europe and plus 4.5% for the rest of the world. In the quarter, there was a notable improvement in the U.S. We've also benefited from positive internal growth in consumables and specialties and our non-dental segment, while lab was slightly negative. 
For the full year internal growth was plus 0.1% or just barely positive in the U.S., plus 2.9% in Europe and plus 4.1% for the rest of the world. Internal growth for the full year kind of mirrored the pattern that I just described for the fourth quarter with positive internal growth in consumables, specialties and non-dental and a slight decline in prosthetics.
Earnings for the fourth quarter were helped by gross margins that improved 70 basis points versus the prior year. That's measured on a sales XPM basis, while SG&A was higher as a percent of sales this quarter, performance was actually better than it may appear from this raw comparison as it was one of our best quarters over the past 10 to 12 quarters. However, we were coming up against a very low SG&A comparison from the last quarter of last year where expenses were very low. In fact that was one of the lowest ratios that we had had on record in the past decade.
We signaled this throughout the year starting on our call in February 2010 that the comparison in the backhalf of the year on SG&A would be difficult and in fact, that's what we see emerging here. Probably a more meaningful comparison might be expenses sequentially which were 100 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2010 and 60 basis points lower than the full year average for 2010.
Overall, on a non-GAAP EPS basis we reported a record of $0.51 a share for the fourth quarter. That's a 6.3% improvement over the prior year, which was also a record. For the full year, non-GAAP EPS was $1.90. Again, that's also a record and that compares to $1.84 in 2010, a 3.3% improvement. 
During 2010, we completed seven business development transactions composed of primarily traditional acquisitions but also investments in new technologies and minority investments. And at last quarter of the year, we completed two transactions, including a minority investment in DIO in South Korea, which is a low cost in plant producer focused primarily on the emerging markets. 
In addition, we entered into a strategic relationship with GlaxoSmithKline regarding dual branding and development of products to address tooth sensitivity in the professional market. That's in combination with their leading Sensodyne brand that's sold over the counter. 
  Lastly, we also signed two additional transactions near the end of the year. One of which closed in January. I'd say these are small investments and no need to adjust your models for these at this point. I would say that M&A remains our top priority for cash deployment. We had a number of possibilities we're working on but it's too early to give any guidance on timing or magnitude of those transactions at this time.
  We believe the global dental market has retuned to pre-recession levels in absolute amounts although it's not growing at the pre-recession rate. We see some very positive signs emerging in certain countries with some improvement in the U.S. Select developed markets in Europe and many parts of the developing world where we see acceleration of activity. 
Looking ahead, we have a wave of new products coming to market. Many as we speak. We look forward to the opportunity to show and hit the market with these products first at the Chicago mid-winter show in late February and then at the International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany in late March. And Chris will describe these products more in his prepared remarks this morning. 
We're expecting a continued slow improvement in the market in 2011 and believe we should be able to perform better than the global consumables market. In part due to this pipeline of new products we have coming to market here early in the year. 
As we look towards performance in 2011, we expect internal growth to continue to accelerate off the 2010 rate, although we probably will not be able to return to strong mid single-digit growth at this stage. 
In addition, subject to some stability in currency rates which have been quite voluble throughout the year we expect non-GAAP EPS to improve 5% to 10% next year putting us in the $2.08 range, which was also disclosed in our press release this morning.
  That completes my prepared remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to Chris.

On the new product front, innovation continues to be a key growth strategy for us. We entered 2011 with a strong new product pipeline, including several key initiatives across the different franchises. It should provide significant new product news and momentum as (inaudible) here. 
Starting with the restorative franchise, this quarter we're launching the new ChemFil rock advanced glass-ionomer restorative. This unique patented formulation provides superior mechanical properties and a simplified placement process both of which are important for isomers which are often used in clinical situations that need speed of care or lower cost care, such as in young children, geriatric patients and emergency cases. ChemFil rock utilized advanced chemistry that delivers higher strength and improve fracture toughness over leading brands in the market today. And comes in a convenient delivery capsule to facilitate the clinical placement.   
The clinical technique with this product has been simplified with a fewer number of steps compared to key competitive options, including the lack of needing a cavity varnish or final coating on the restoration. Unlike most other products we introduce in the restorative area, this entry into the glass isomer category represents little cannibalization risk for us. We're real excited about the market potential both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. 
In the endodontic area we will be launching our latest unique file and motor combination later this quarter in Europe. And likely by early in the second quarter in the U.S. This systems truly unique and offers a range of benefits to the clinician. It's patented reciprocating movement reduces the potential for file separation or breakage as the file has less stress during the root canal procedure. 
In addition, the clinical technique is simpler. The unique motion and innovative design make it possible to shape most canals with just one instrument or file compared to three or four that are required to clean and shape the canal today. This means no time is wasted for the clinician changing instruments, which reduces the amount of time it takes to shape a canal by up to 40%.
We will be marketing the system utilizing two different designs under the brand names WaveOne and Rexopra [ph]. We're real excited about the innovation and really believe this represents the next generation in endodontic systems. 
We have several other key new products coming to market as we move through the year and I'll look to provide some additional insight on some of our significant innovation efforts on subsequent quarterly calls. 
I'd like to also touch briefly this morning on a recently announced collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. This agreement involves co-branding of products containing NovaMin, which is a patent protected calcium, phosphate technology, which has been proven to relieve tooth sensitivity. By combining dense light Nupro products, which contain the NovaMin technology with GSK Sensodyne brand. We'll be providing a complete treatment solution of both in office and at home care regimens for patients suffering from dental hypersensitivity which affects a significant portion of the population today.       
  
The co-branding effort will initially result in NUPRO Sensodyne Professional prophy paste and also in Sensodyne NUPRO Professional 5000 part for million-fluoride toothpaste. These products will be launched in the U.S. later this month during the Chicago mid-winter meeting and in Europe at the upcoming IDS show in Cologne, Germany in late March. 
We're very excited about the collaboration with GSK and look forward to the marketing impact of the combination of two very strong brand names, as well as the additional awareness and interest in NovaMin that will be generated as a result. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results for the quarter and the year in greater detail.

As Bret noted, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 were flat with the fourth quarter of 2009 and net sales, excluding precious metal content increased 0.3% in the quarter with internal growth a positive 1.7%. Net sales for the full year were $2.2 billion, an increase of 2.9% over last year, while net sales ex-precious metals were $2 billion, an increase of 2.1% for the year. 
The 2010 geographic mix of sales without precious metal content was as follows: The U.S. represents 37% of our total sales. Europe was 40% and the rest of the world was 23%. 
Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 55.2% of sales ex-precious metals or an increase of 0.7 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross margins were positively impacted this quarter from price increases which were somewhat offset by both FX impacts and product mix as we went up against easier comps in last years fourth quarter. 
Full year gross margins were flat with last year at 55.6% percent of sales ex-precious metals content. And the price increases for the year were offset by FX impact and (inaudible) product line mix in a few areas. 
SG&A expenses were $186.4 million or 35.8% of sales ex-precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2010 versus 34.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009. SG&A expenses were up against a very tough comparison against last year in the quarter. However, the percent of sales they showed sequential improvement of a full percentage point. These expenses increased as new investments were made in certain businesses over the last year to support our future growth and also upcoming new product launches. Total year SG&A was $738.9 million or 36.4% of sales ex-precious metals in 2010 versus 36.1% in 2009. 
Operating margins were 16.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating margins were 18.3% on sales ex-precious metals in the fourth quarter. Operating margins ex-precious metals on a non-GAAP basis though, excluding restructuring acquisition related costs and other charges in both periods were 19.5% for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to 20.1% in the fourth quarter last year. 
Full year operating margins were 18.7% on sales ex-precious metals in 2010 and 19.2% in 2009. Operating margins on sales ex-precious metals on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring, acquisition related costs and other charges were 19.4% in 2010 compared to 19.7% last year. 
Net interest and other expense in the fourth quarter was $4.8 million or $0.8 million higher than last years fourth quarter. Interest expense was about a million dollars higher in the quarter than last year and net interest and other expense for the full year was $22.6 million or an expense increase of $4.7 million for the year. Net interest expense was $20.8 million in 2010 compared to net interest expense of $16.9 million in 2009 or an increase of $3.9 million. 
The low interest rates on invested cash and our investments and acquisitions and stock repurchases caused net interest expense to increase during the year. The impact of foreign exchange transaction losses and other items in 2010 was an expense of $1.8 million versus an expense of $1 million in 2009 or an expense increase of $0.8 million. 
The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.9% compared to 23.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. However, the operational tax rate in these periods were 23.4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 26.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The 2010 full year tax rate of 24.9% included an operational rate of 24.8% compared to the 26.1% in 2009.
Equity and Net loss attributable to unconsolidated affiliated company is a new line and reflects our investment in DIO. The loss shown is solely the result of the increased market value of the convertible bond as their stock prices increased since our investment announcement. This bond gets marked to market and the change in value runs through their P&L on a quarterly basis. Any gain or loss from that change in value is being treated as a non-GAAP item by us. The opposite impact of that valuation change is reflected in our financials but is run through OCI until we convert. At which time it will run through our P&L but will also be treated as a non-GAAP adjustment. 
To better understand and follow some of the following comments you can look at the tables included in our press release which reconciles performance from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP to unadjusted non-GAAP performance. 
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $67.8 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared to $74.8 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an adjusted basis, earnings excluding restructuring, acquisition related costs and other related items in tax adjustments in both periods, which constitute a non-GAAP measure were $73.7 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $72.6 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 6.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in 2010 for the full year was $265.7 million or $1.82 per diluted share. Net income for 2009 was $274.3 million or $1.83 per diluted share. Net income for comparability analysis on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the reconciling items in the press release for the years ending 2010 and 2009 were $277.9 million and $275.7 million respectively. This represents earnings of $1.90 per diluted share for 2010 compared to $1.84 in 2009, an increase of 3.3% for the year.  
And looking at cash flow and some balance sheet items, our operating cash flow was $362 million for the year. Capital expenditures were $44 million for the year with depreciation and amortization for the year totaling $67 million. 
Inventory days ended the year at 100 for 2010 and that compares to the 99 days at the end of last year, or at the end of 2009. Receivable days ended 2010 at 54 days compared to 59 days at the end of the third quarter of 2010 and 55 days at the end of 2009. 
We're pleased with the improvement in both collection efforts and improved liquidity that we're seeing from our customers which have helped us to make some progress again in this area. The balance sheet remains very strong even with our acquisitions and stock repurchases. The year ended with $540 million in cash and short-term investments with total debt of $612 million at the end of 2010. 
Dentsply repurchased 6.7 million shares for $224 million in 2010. Based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 22 million shares of treasury stock we still have approximately a million shares available for repurchase. We continue to monitor the markets liquidity and our investment needs in making these decisions. 
Economic news continues to impact currency volatility however, in 2011. Currency translation impacts at current foreign exchange rates should have a slightly positive sales and earnings impact on us for the year. we believe, as global economic conditions continue to improve in 2011, the global dental market should also be able to show some additional improvement. 
As Bret stated, our guidance for earnings in 2011 is in the range of $2 to $2.08 per diluted share. This excludes restructuring and other costs, acquisition related expenses and income tax related adjustments. We are confident in our market position and will work to achieve above market growth in our market as we continue to make investments to support our business in 2011 and beyond. 
That concludes our prepared remarks and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.

For the fourth quarter, we've seen very limited disclosures so far. We've got a couple of disclosures that will come up the next 45 days from the distributors, which will be good data points.

Our policy on the guidance is that we take into account any share authorizations that we have available today but not additional share authorizations in the guidance. Our priorities for cash deployment are reinvestment in the company and new technologies, et cetera. 
First, business development activity. Second, to the extent that we can execute on those and third, share repurchases and fourth, dividends and growth of the dividends. And I think those priorities remain in place to the extent that we, to the extent that in past years where we haven't been able to execute acquisitions, we've been more aggressive on share repurchases. 
I think that policies probably in place although I don't think you can count on share repurchase beyond the current authorization. But while the priorities for our share repurchases remain in place, we do think the dental market will accelerate a little bit in 2011. We think that interest rates will probably move up a little bit in 2011. 
We're sitting on $540 million of cash that's earning virtually nothing right now or a very low rate of return. And it's possible of course, we'd like to deploy that cash in more productive ways.

One is that when we spoke to the price increases October 1, we moved one large segment of our business from a January 1 price increase to an October 1 price increase in 2010. And thus this impacted the price increases as disproportionately larger in Europe than it is in the rest of the world on this one particular quarter.
A second issue is in Germany. And I think this is what you were alluding to kind of early in the quarter in October there were announcements made by many of the regions in Germany that they had fully depleted their reimbursement budget for dental. And thus they suspended the dental reimbursement for the remainder of the calendar year. That, I think had a modest effect or somewhat of an effect in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at 2011, we're reasonably optimistic about Germany, excuse me about Europe, that it can continue to grow kind of inline with what it did in 2011, excuse me 2010. I don't think we're going to see perhaps as much an economic pickup in Europe because Europe grew in 2010 and looks pretty stable at this point. But I believe our markets should be stable to improving in Europe for 2011 and in particular, we saw recovery in the CIS region in 2010. We think that's going to continue.

Before we get started, I’d like to officially welcome Derek to our team as Vice President of Investor Relations. Many of you know Derek who is many years following dental companies, including DENTSPLY on the sell side, and we are very pleased to have him join us. He has significant experience in our markets and I think will be a significant addition to our team.
Moving to the results, this morning we are very pleased to announce record results for our first quarter 2011. As noted in our release, we delivered improved sales growth rates and much improved earnings performance. In fact, this is the best growth that we’ve seen since before the recession began in 2008.
From a revenue perspective, we recorded total sales ex-precious metal of 6%, and that was driven by constant currency growth of 4.6%. The 4.6% was comprised of internal growth of 3.8% and 0.8% growth from acquisitions. In addition, we also benefited from currency this quarter. This is a welcome relief as the euro and other currencies gained strength against the dollar during the quarter, and that added 1.4% to our sales growth ex-PM.
Our 3.8% internal growth does reflect the negative impact from the events in Japan in the quarter. However, it was modest, less than 0.5 percentage point. Absent that single event, we believe we would have reported internal growth in the low 4% range.
Geographic internal growth was plus 1.1% in the US, plus 4.1% in Europe, and plus 8.4% for the rest of the world. The US growth was aided by double-digit growth in implants and solid growth in consumables, and was negatively impacted by the supply outage for orthodontic product source from Japan, as we quickly put our customers on allocation following the March 11th quake and tsunami.
On an adjusted basis, including adjusting for the impact of the supply issue in Japan, internal growth in the US would have been closer to 2%. Internal growth in Europe continued to be strong at 4.1%. And in fact, this may be understated is the key tradeshow for the new product launches in Europe was the International Dental Show, which was held the last week of the quarter in Cologne, Germany.
We had a very strong presence in the show, including numerous new product launches with most orders, the majority of the orders being shipped the first week of April. We also saw a very strong reception for our base products, our existing product lines during the show, and I’ve asked Chris to comment on this further in a moment.
In rest of world, as I mentioned, we grew 8.4% on an internal growth basis. We had very strong growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, and Canada. And as expected, due to the circumstances, we are slightly negative in Japan. Overall, we believe the consumable dental market made considerable progress towards returning to what we would view as more normal growth rates as we enter 2011.
Although the market growth may not have returned completely to the pre-recession levels, they are clearly trending in that direction at present. This is obviously very good news for the industry, for the market, and for DENTSPLY, and we are hopeful that these trends will continue.
Our product line growth was led by the specialty group and chair-side consumables, which were both up mid-single digits on an internal growth basis. The strongest growth was in implants, which had positive double-digit constant currency growth and was just under double digits on an internal growth basis. But we also saw substantially improved growth rates in our chair-side consumables and our endodontics driven in part by new product introductions.
As we commented on prior calls, we presently have a very full new product pipeline, which is scheduled for launch this year. And we are just beginning to enjoy a very positive market reception from these new product opportunities. In lab, our sales trend was negative in the quarter. That was due in part to a substantial decline in the use of precious metal alloys in Europe, with gold prices reaching record highs during the quarter.
We also have several new products coming to market in prosthetics later this year, including a new cobalt chrome product that will be taken to market in connection with our partnership with Sirona. It will be milled on the Sirona installed base in lab. In addition to that product, we have several other material offerings that will also be launched throughout the year and early into 2012. And I think it is fair to say that we are quite enthusiastic about the new opportunities we have in the prosthetics market at present.
With regard to earnings, we also saw an acceleration of earnings growth, up 17.1% on a GAAP reported basis and up 11.4% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, the events in Japan in early March and then continuing to the rest of the quarter did have a negative impact on earnings, but it was only modest in this quarter. Bill, of course, will have additional comments on the results, but from an overall perspective, I think it is fair to say we are very pleased with the results at the start of the year in 2011 and particularly pleased with our team’s execution on bringing several new products to market, and all this despite the headwind that we faced in Japan.
With respect to the situation in Japan, our sales of products in the country comprised about 4% of our total sales ex-PM. As expected, we saw the market slow following the events of March 11th and expect there will be a considerable continuing impact of this disaster for some times in the local market. I think that’s particularly true in the northern part of the country, but also may be true in the heavily discretionary procedures at least until some state of normalcy returns.
Regarding our supply chain, as we noted in our release on March 15th, we do have one key supplier that’s located in the evacuation zone. With respect to this supplier, they are commencing limited production at alternative sites at present, but expect it will be sometime before they can relocate the full operations and recommence supply of the full range of products and quantities to fully meet with demand.
We move forward to begin sourcing alternative products from numerous other suppliers, which will commence as early as next month, as well as through own production on a limited basis, and we also have implemented plans to reduce the cost structure of this business in the interim. All these actions taken together will provide some mitigation of the impact on our results. However, the extent of the mitigation is not completely clear and is subject to numerous variables.
Accordingly, as noted in the release this morning, we estimate the downside risk of $0.12 to $0.17 per share due to the events in Japan. And accordingly, we are reestablishing our full year earnings guidance for 2011 at a range of $1.86 per share to $1.98 per diluted share. I think it is important to note that our results in Q1 exceeded our internal targets for the quarter.
So there is a possibility that the remainder of our business will continue to outperform, particularly as we bring new product offerings to market, which may help to mitigate these impacts further. Outside the results, we completed one small acquisition in the quarter. We acquired the remaining minority interests in another business, and we also signed a third transaction to acquire a minority interest in a third company during the quarter.
Reinvestment in the company and acquisitions remains our top priorities for cash deployment. In addition, we did repurchase approximately 2 million shares during the quarter. And in March, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 12 million shares to repurchase. We have very strong balance sheet, strong cash balances, and to the extent we are not able to put that money to work on acquisitions, you should expect to see us use this authorization over time.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I’d like to now turn the call over to Chris for further insights on our new product pipeline as well as early results from the tradeshow activity. Chris?

And good morning, everyone. As Bret mentioned, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing across our businesses associated with our innovation efforts and also the exceptional level of interest in our products at the recent trade events. I’d like to take a few moments and provide some additional perspective in both areas.
I commented in our fourth quarter call in February that we were entering the year with a particularly strong new product pipeline. Consistent with those comments, we introduced over 20 new products in the first quarter alone, well above our typical run rate. These launches stand our broad range of portfolios, including chair-side consumables, specialties and prosthetics.
And in general, I would characterize market reaction is very positive, as we at this point are already in a back order situation on several of these products. Importantly, we still have a disproportionate number of new product launches scheduled for the remainder of the year, including several this quarter. Further reinforcing that our innovation efforts across the company are alive and well, and also that the impact of not reducing R&D investment during the economic downturn is paying dividends for us as the markets recover.
We are particularly pleased with customer reaction to our most impactful launches in the quarter. On the chair-side business, dentists have responded very favorably to the new ChemFil Rock advanced glass ionomer restorative with its superior mechanical properties and simplified placement process. You may recall that this is basically our first significant entrance into the estimated $100 million global glass ionomer category and represents minimal cannibalization risk for us.
Also in the chair-side area, we are very pleased with the reaction to our Cavitron Focused Spray slimLINE 1000 Insert, which continues to emphasize the value of improved sub-gingival access, and it significantly exceeded our initial expectations in terms of customer acceptance. In the endodontic area, we introduced the reciprocating file system in Europe during the first quarter and anticipate launching this product in the US later this quarter.
You may recall that this system reduces the potential for file separation or breakage and results in a much simpler clinical technique that reduces the time to shake the canal by up to 40%. Combined with the new GuttaCore obturation system launched late last year and the QMix 2in1 irrigating solution that we introduced in the first quarter, we believe these initiatives serve to define the next generation in endodontic therapy.
Finally, in the lab portfolio, we continue to expand our applications of our ceramic platforms by broadening our Ceramco PFZ or Porcelain fused to Zirconia line to include a wider range of shade options for the dental technicians. As Bret mentioned, we are also finalizing plans to introduce the unique milled cobalt chrome disk that will be available for customers who have Sirona Cerec in lab machine, providing the first significant expansion of milled CAD/CAM solutions into the growing non-precious metal segment.
We showed this product to the IDS, and we were extremely pleased with customer reaction to it. We estimate market introduction later in the second half of the year. We are also very pleased with the level of customer interest in our products of the various key tradeshows held during the first quarter. Our consumables businesses posted sales gains from the Chicago midwinter show in February and the Hinman meeting in Atlanta in March of almost 70% and 150% respectively compared to prior year shows.
At last month’s International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany, the largest dental show in the world, our European business has posted similarly strong results with respect to the new product introductions, consistent with surpassing our launch target by wide margins. We attribute these strong results to a more optimistic dentist customer base as well as the high level of interest in the clinical benefits provided by our new product launches. As I mentioned, we are similarly excited about the portfolio of launches yet to come this year, including several this quarter, and I look forward to providing you additional updates regarding our innovation efforts on subsequent calls.
I’d now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail. Bill?

Building on Bret’s comments earlier on the revenue side, the geographic breakdown was 35.8% in the US for us in the quarter, 42.4% in Europe, and 21.8% in the rest of world. Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the first quarter of 2011 were 56.9% compared to 56.7% for the first quarter of 2010. The rate was positively impacted in the quarter compared to the same period last year, as we realized the benefits of improved pricing and also benefited from improved product mix from new products and stronger specialty business growth.
FX continued to negatively impact gross profit margin by approximately a full percentage point and manufacturing costs were higher for some of the higher material cost, including metal prices and some polymers. SG&A expenses were $200.8 million or 38.1% of sales ex precious metals in the first quarter of 2011 versus 37.8% in the first - in the prior year’s first quarter.
These expenses were higher as a percent of sales primarily due to additional investments made to support our new product launches and also higher expenses supporting International Dental Show, which occurs every two years. Of the nearly $13 million increase in SG&A, over $3.5 million was from the impact of FX movements and acquisitions.
Operational margins for the quarter were 17.3% compared to 16.4% in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins based on sales, excluding precious metals, were 18.7% compared to 18.0% last year in the same period. And operating margins based on sales, excluding precious metals, for comparative purposes, excluding recent acquisition related activities and restructuring and other costs in both periods, would have been 18.8% in the first quarter of 2011 and 18.0% in the first quarter of 2010.
Net interest and other expense in the first quarter was $4.6 million compared to net interest and other expense of $5.9 million last year in the first quarter. This reduction in expense resulted primarily from both higher net interest income associated with the interest income of the DIO convertible bond held by the company and also lower foreign exchange transaction losses in the period. The corporate tax rate in the quarter of approximately 25.0% to 25.5% is relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2010, and we expect this to be a reasonable assumption for an operational tax rate for 2011.
Equity and net loss attributable to unconsolidated affiliated company reflects our investment in non-consolidated businesses. The loss shown is solely the result of the increased market value of the convertible bond we hold in deal. This bond gets mark-to-market in each quarter, and in a period when their stock price has increased as it has this period, it results in a loss on their financial statements. And we pick up our 16% interest of such loss.
Any gain or loss from that change in value is being treated as a non-GAAP item by us. The opposite impact of that valuation change is reflected in our financials, however it is run through OCI and not our income statement until we convert the bonds, at which time it will be run through our P&L but will also be flagged as a non-GAAP adjustment at that time.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the first quarter of 2011 was $69.1 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to $0.41 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the first quarter on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other costs, recent acquisition-related activities, and income tax related adjustments, was $70. 6 million or $0.49 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $65.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010, an 11.4% improvement in EPS.
Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2011 was approximately $44 million compared to $37 million in the same period last year. The cash flow in the first quarter of 2011 was higher than last year due primarily to the increase in earnings and lower tax payments, offset somewhat by a greater increase in accounts receivables and sales were stronger in the quarter compared to last year.
Capital expenditures were $12 million in the first quarter, with depreciation and amortization at $17.9 million in the period. Inventory days were 110 at the end of the first quarter of 2011 compared to 102 at the end of the first quarter last year and 103 days at the end of 2010. Nearly half of the increase was a result of exchange rates and the balance was inventory builds for new product launches. Receivable days were 60 days at the end of the first quarter in 2011 compared to 59 days at the end of the first quarter in 2010 and 54 days at the end of 2010.
At the end of the first quarter of 2011, we had $575 million in cash and short-term investments. Total debt was $664 million, also at the end of the first quarter. During the first quarter, we have repurchased approximately 2 million shares or $74 million of stock. Based on the company’s recent increase in its authorization, which allows us to maintain up to 34 million shares of treasury stock, we now have approximately 12 million shares available for repurchase, although our top priority for using our balance sheet strength is primarily synergistic acquisitions.
Finally, as Bret noted, we are very pleased with our strong start to the year. Obviously, the events in Japan are having a negative impact on us this year. And given what we know at this time, we believe this is in the range of $0.12 to $0.17 per share. Including this impact, our 2011 guidance for earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis is $1.86 to $1.98.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support. And we’d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.

One is with respect to our original supplier, our current main supplier, we sort from them approximately 4,800 SKUs. Their production site is or was in the evacuation zone. They have now abandoned that site and they are moving to alternative sites for production. But this is going to entail ordering new equipment, bringing it and installing it and validating it and then trying to ramp it up to full production volume. So the success or the speed of doing that is a little bit uncertain at this time although the equipment is on order.
The second variable is we are going to begin sourcing next month new products from numerous sources, and we will be constructing a portfolio of offerings to our customers, which we will begin to show at the AAO meeting two weeks from now in Chicago. Those products will then go out into the hands of our sales force and will begin to ramp up sales with those to try to mitigate the ramp-down of the existing inventory we have from the original supplier. And then thirdly, the main - the other main variable is, once the existing supplier comes back up, what’s the ramp-up time and recapturing - we have very little customers, but we’re going to have to go back out and recapture share from some of our competitors during the recovery period.

So market share loss is kind of a funny thing to try to define. Some of the products we get from our supplier are quite unique, and they are very technique sensitive. So we’re not going to have exact replications of some of those SKUs. So this will be a process whereby we’re rolling out new products to our customers, trying to teach them the technique on the new customers, and some of them might convert back to the old products after this crisis has abated and some of them may not. So I think that’s something that’s very hard to predict and with any certainty at least at this time.

I don’t think it’s a avalanche yet in that direction, but there is certainly a trend in that direction and that was evident in really the very strong increases we saw in our tradeshow performance in all three tradeshows, which Chris mentioned. So I think that trend may be occurring. Certainly the implant market has picked up from where it was. We saw that strongly in our results, growing almost double digits on internal growth basis. And we saw that in many of our competitors’ results as well that have been out over the last week or so. So I do think there is a shift - it might be slight at the moment, but there is a shift back towards the more premium products, high performance products at this point.

From an EPS perspective, I mean, the guidance that we give, you know the additional authorization that we have recently put in place, which is about 12 million shares. I think that it’s fair to assume that we have commitment to ultimately use the strength of our balance sheet further as we are moving forward here. How much or how little of that affects on the share repurchases, we really don’t comment on that until the period that we’re actually doing it. But I think that it’s fair to say that there is at least some expectation that there will be some share buyback. And I think that from an FX perspective, within the quarter itself, the bottom line impact was actually virtually neutral. It was just less than 0.5%.
I think moving forward, the different - a different impact. I think based on where rates have currently gone just recently, I mean, the euro is like at $1.47, I think the Swiss is out there around at $1.14, $1.15. Those are very strong currencies relative to the dollar at this point. I think if those rates continue, that we could see a slight benefit for us as we move through the year. I think our rates that we’ve got at least at this point are probably more, in kind of the $1.40-ish kind of range for the euro and maybe right around kind of the 1.00 - you know, just south of maybe the $1.10 level on the Swiss.

Thank you for joining us on our call. This morning we’re very pleased to announce record results for our second quarter of 2011. As noted in our release this morning, we experienced higher total sales growth",1319,"Thank you Derek, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call. This morning we’re very pleased to announce record results for our second quarter of 2011. As noted in our release this morning, we experienced higher total sales growth rates and improved earnings performance in the quarter even in a phase of the headwinds that we’re facing from our supply disruption in orthodontics.
From a revenue perspective, we recorded total sales growth ex-precious metals of 8.7% which is the highest growth rate that we’ve had since the Q4 of 2009. Our constant currency growth was approximately 1% that includes approximately 0.1% from internal growth and the remainder from acquisitions. These figures are inclusive of our Japanese and orthodontics businesses. If we look at our internal growth excluding sales in the Japanese markets and orthodontics, the internal growth rate was 3.4% and constant currency growth was over 4%.
This reinforces our belief that the global dental market continue to slowly improve and while still not back to the long-term potential of the market, it’s certainly moving in the right direction. Currency provided a welcome relief this quarter as you know, offsetting the headwinds from Japan and orthodontics as both the euro and the Swiss franc gained strength over the dollar versus the prior year quarter to add 7.8% from currency overall. Geographic internal growth was negative 0.9% in the U.S., negative 0.8% in Europe and plus 2.3% in the rest of the world. And of course these growth rates include or reflect the decline in the orthodontics business which was down more than 20% in our key markets.
That was offset by positive internal growth across the rest of our business from the aggregate in particular endodontics and restoratives which were quite strong and our non-dental business which also continues to recover. Excluding orthodontics and Japan, our internal sales growth rate was approximately 2% in both U.S. and Europe and was about 9% outside the United States. Just a quick note on Europe, the growth rate ex-ortho and ex-Japan here slowed from about 4% in the first quarter to about 2% this quarter. Looking at the calendar, I think there is a couple of reasons while there may have been some acceleration into the first quarter at the expense of Q2 here.
The first is the timing of the Eastern Holidays which impacted Q1 more last year and Q2 and its entirety this year. Also the IDS which is the largest dental show in the world was held in the last week of March in Germany. We had a very strong performance at that show and now we believe we may have borrowed a little bit of sales from Q2 and put that into Q1 as result of that show performance. Accordingly at this point, we think it’s more meaningful to look at the first half growth rate of around 3% figure versus the second quarter.
In the rest of world, we had very strong growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East and Canada and as expected during the circumstances we were negative in Japan. Overall, we believe the consumable dental markets are stable and slowly progressing towards more normal growth rates. We continue to be very pleased with our performance here including the introduction of numerous new products and the launch results we have from those so far this year.
With regard to earnings, we’re very pleased with the record results we had for Q2. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis grew 6.1% to $0.52 from $0.49 a year ago and grew 10% from a non-GAAP basis to $0.55 from $.50 a year ago. There are several moving parts in these numbers and of course Bill Jellison will give you more of the details. Just a few highlights here though. First is that we had a $0.03 per share reduction in earnings versus the prior year quarter due to our businesses that were impacted by the circumstances in Japan, mainly our Japanese subsidiaries and also our global orthodontics business.
Chris will give you more insights into the status of our contingency plans however I’d like to note as we did in our first quarter call. And this negative impact will grow in the third quarter perhaps by double the impact in Q2 or more before starting to recover late in the year and early next year. So as you look at the next quarter, we expect that impact to increase. Also in the quarter, we had a stronger improvement in our tax rate, Bill will speak to this further but this is an ongoing improvement that should benefit us for several years.
I think the point here is that the negative impacts from the events in Japan were essentially offset by the positive impacts from the tax rate at least in this quarter. I think it’s fair to say that we’re very pleased with results particularly our team’s execution on bringing several new products in the market and also our progress implementing the recovery plans for orthodontics. Outside the financial results, as you know we recently announced the agreement to acquire Astra Tech AB from AstraZeneca. At this time we filed all the necessary regulatory filings and we received clearance thus far from Germany. So we’re still waiting clearance in the U.S. and in two other markets and we continue to believe this transaction will close before year-end.
As noted in our earlier release, we’re excited about this opportunity as it’s expected to increase our sales base globally by about 25%. It will double our implant business globally. It will increase our presence in digital industry and we will also be gaining access to another category of medical devices represented by primarily by urology. We believe this transaction will allow us to bring improved alternatives to our customers and also deliver improved opportunities for our stakeholders.
In addition to Astra Tech, I would note that we’ve completed three other transactions this year, two in Europe and one in the United States. Generally speaking, these are smaller companies, however we are excited about a technology company that we acquired here in the United States called AMD Lasers. This was acquired late in the second quarter and its one of the leading laser companies in the United States for using dental surgery. And it gives us access to a category that we had not previously participated in.
One quick comment on cash flow is in cash deployment. We did continue to deliver strong cash flow generation in the quarter and I think we’ve demonstrated that throughout market cycles. This year, we’ve grown our operating cash flow at close to 10%. Currently our balance sheet is essentially debt free on a net-debt basis. With the Astra Tech transaction, of course we’ll continue our reinvestment in company through R&D, sales force expansion, etcetera. However debt reduction becomes a higher priority in the near term as we expect to rapidly de-lever the balance sheet following this transaction.
This seems like an opportune time to increase our debt with borrowing cost that are currently quite low and to more efficiently use our cash outside the United States. On earnings guidance for the year, you saw in the release that we’re increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full-year from a $1.86 to $1.98 which we had established in April to new full-year guidance of $1.92 to $2.00. This guidance reflects our views on the continued strong operating performance including the improvement of tax rate. Current foreign currency exchange rates, our current thinking on the orthodontics supply situation and it excludes any impacts from the Astra Tech acquisition.
So that concludes my prepared marks. I’d now like to turn the call over to Chris, who will give us some further insights on operational changes related to orthodontics business in Japan and also comment on our new product pipeline. Chris?

I’m going to take the next few moments and revise in deeper insights into our progress on the orthodontic front as well as an update on our progress of our new products. As you will recall, we commented on our first quarter call in April, about the impact of Japanese natural disaster on our global orthodontics business.
For the second quarter the impact is pretty much as we expected, as we were able to service customers well into the quarter through our pre-existing stock positions. And then we saw the negative impact worsen noticeably later in the quarter as our inventories were completed. On a positive note we’ve moved forward with our alternative sourcing initiatives and began receiving products from other suppliers in June [ph], marketed under the Resolve brand name, these products addressed the non self-ligating portion of our portfolio.
We assumed the very early days of introducing these products in establishing the Resolve brand. However we’re pleased with the initial customer assessments regarding this product offering in the past. On an even more positive note, we’ve also just received some initial self-ligating product shipments from our Japanese manufacturer that were produced at their new manufacturing site outside of the impacted region in Japan. You will recall that we are not able to source our self-ligating line from alternative suppliers as these products are highly specialized and exactly the product is not available from other sources.
Although these initial volumes that we received in this point are limited, and it does not noticeably change our near-term visibility of re-supply. We are encouraged by the development and see as a very positive sign that adds confidence to our previous estimate of being able to resume full supply early next year. In terms of the impact on our P&L as I mentioned earlier, the second quarter impact was pretty much as we had anticipated, looking forward to the third and fourth quarters, we do see the negative impact increasing further is expected likely to level double the Q2 effect as we are no longer - but we no longer had the pre-existing stock levels to support our customers.
While the alternatively sourced products and that smaller initial shipment from our Japan suppliers are helpful, we continue to believe that the impact of the supply situation will not go into Q3 and likely have a similar effect in Q4 depending on how quickly we’re going to return to market. We do anticipate the sales trends will improve once our Japanese supplier is able to develop additional capacity, particularly with respect for our self-ligation product line.
Before moving off ortho I would like to emphasize a point that we had made on the first quarter call. We are committed in the orthodontics arena for the long-term and we are viewing the current supply situation caused by the events in Japan through that lens. While we’ve implemented some restructuring initiatives to address our cost structure on the business, we’ve taken special care to ensuring that we’ve got the right organization in place to lead us back to above - strong above market growth as our supply situation improves.
And that while we’ve taken some actions to impress our fixed cost structure, we have retained a disproportionate amount of our infrastructure as we view that this is necessary to return the business to market position overtime. Moving beyond ortho, I commented on our last couple of quarterly calls about our excitement with what we view as a particularly large particularly strong new product pipeline. Consistent with those comments, we’re pleased to introduce several important new brands in the second quarter in addition to the Resolve line of orthodontic practice and accessories that I commented on earlier.
I’ll comment on just two of these this morning. First in the endodontics area, we continued to expand our introduction of the reciprocating file and motor system with the expansion to the U.S. market late in the second quarter. We’re extremely pleased with customer reaction to this mission globally and despite significantly expanding our manufacturing capacity, we remained challenged in the short-term to support the full-level of customer demand.
These systems are marketed under the Wave One and Reciproc brand names and help to reduce the potential for file separation or breakage while also delivering a much simpler clinical technique that reduces the time to shape the canal by up to 40%. Also in the second quarter, our European prosthetics business introduced the new Cercon HT or highly translucent Zirconia that represents the next generation of aesthetics for the Zirconia platform combining the outstanding translucent - with the proven stability of the Cercon base, it can be used for fully contoured crowns and bridges even in the posterior region.
Further testing is shown even less wear on opposing teeth than traditional porcelains used in metal in glass-ceramic restorations. We anticipate introduction in the U.S. before year-end once we receive regulatory approval. In addition to the new products introduced in the second quarter, we remain very pleased with customer acceptance to the innovations we launched earlier in the year. And particularly, we’re very pleased with our early reactions of the two other major introductions in the endodontics franchise namely the Gutted Core [ph] Obturation System and the Qmix 3in1 irrigating solution. The other was the reciprocating file and motor system these products really have begun to define the next generation of root canal therapy.
We’re also very pleased with the market acceptance of the ChemFil rock advanced glass-ionomer restorative with the superior mechanical properties and simple file placement process. Our early assessment is that this product will help us to gain a solid foothold in glass-ionomer category with minimal cannibalization risk to our existing restorative product lines. Finally looking forward, I would comment on the R&D portfolio, in terms of the pipeline remains strong and I look forward to providing you with additional updates on these new launches as in other upcoming introductions as we move forward to future quarterly calls.
And I would like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail.

First our geographic mix of sales ex-precious metals in the second of 2011 included the U.S. at 35%, Europe represented 42% and the rest of world was 23% of sales. Our sales mix has shifted somewhat for the OUS business due in part to the weakening of the dollar and the loss on business within the orthodontic area.
As you know, the weaker dollar in the second quarter which benefited our top line growth by 7.8%, our earnings per share are also benefiting from the translation benefits of a weaker dollar but are being partially offset by higher transaction related impacts as we sell many products produced in Europe to other parts of the world. This is negatively impacting our gross profit margin rates in the period. The sales and earnings impacts are consistent with potential impacts laid out in our investor relations presentation and a current exchange rates we expect the top and bottom line impacts will continue to be positive for the rest of the year. However, they would probably run slightly lower than those experienced in the second quarter.
Growth profit margins as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the second quarter of 2011 were 55.8% compared to 55.4% for the second quarter of 2010. When compared to the same period last year, we were positively impacted by improved pricing and favorable impacts from the integration of acquisitions which were partially offset by negative impacts of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the gross margin rate in the quarter was approximately 20 basis points. SG&A expenses were $211 million or 37.4% of sales ex-precious metals in the second quarter of 2011 versus 35.2% in the prior year second quarter. These expenses were higher than those in last year’s second quarter when measured as a percent of sales as we have maintained our investment in the orthodontic business, despite the recent decline in sales volumes from the disruption of supply.
This will continue to result in higher SG&A rates throughout the year and will impact us hardest in the third and fourth quarter of the year as volumes decline in orthodontics, well lately be more significant in those periods. We are also investing around key product launch this year to support new product growth and have this impact the SG&A ratio would have been around 36% on sales ex-precious metals. Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 17.2% compared to 20.2% last year in the same period. Operating margins based on the sales excluding precious metals for comparative purposes excluding acquisition related activities and restructuring and other costs in both periods would have been 18.5% in the second quarter of 2011 and 20.3% in 2010.
These rates were also negatively impacted this year as we are supporting our orthodontic business despite decline in sales from the lack of product supply in this category. While we are beginning to see some supply begin to come back in this area, we do not expect to see real improvements until products supply is returned to normal which we believe may not occur until the first half of 2012. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect the impacts of the orthodontic product supply constrains will have a greater negative impact on the sales, operating margin rates and earnings per share as we experience the full impact of the supply chain disruption and the process of supporting this business through the rebuilding process.
As Bret noted, the impact from the Japanese disaster in Q2 was a negative $0.03 per share. This impact will likely be closer to a negative $0.06 to $0.07 per share in both the third and fourth quarters of this year before it begins to improve. Net interest and other expenses in the second quarter was $4.6 million compared to $6.6 million last year in the second quarter. This reduction in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest income associated with higher interest income and credit risk adjustment on the outstanding derivatives, which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non-GAAP earnings per share. It was slightly benefited by higher interest income on our cash balances as rates have increased slightly from last year.
The corporate cash rate in the second quarter of 2011 was approximately 18.8% and year-to-date is now 22.4%. This is a nice reduction from last year and is a result of two items. First, we are benefiting from a more favorable geographic mix, as our U.S. based income has been reduced due to the impacts of a weaker dollar and the negative impacts of our supply outage of orthodontic products. We expect this impact to gradually go away as our sales and earnings in this business are rebuilt over the next few years. We are also benefiting from the recently announced acquisition of Astra Tech. With this acquisition we will be able to more effectively deploy our cash flow as a result much less cash will be repatriated to the U.S., which will result in a lower average tax rate in 2011 similar to our year-to-date rate of 22% to 23%. And for several years moving forward based on the current tax laws.
The announced acquisition of Astra Tech allows us to efficiently utilize not only our current cash balances but also our future foreign cash flows. Equity and net income attributable to unconsolidated affiliated company reflects our investment in non-consolidated businesses. The income shown is primarily the result of the increased work and value of the convertible bond we hold in deal. This bond is fair value adjusted each quarter. Any gain or loss from that change in value is being treated as a non-GAAP item by us. The opposite impact of that valuation change is reflected in our financials. However, it is run through OCI, not our income statement until we convert the bonds, at which time it will run through our P&L but we will also flag that item as a non-GAAP adjustment.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the second quarter of 2011 was $74.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared to $72.4 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non-GAAP basis was $78.5 million or $0.55 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $73.9 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. Cash flow from operating activities in the first half of 2011 was $165 million compared to $150 million in the same period last year, a 10% increase. Capital expenditures were $25 million in the first half of the year with depreciation and amortization at around $37 million.
Capital expenditures are currently expected to be in the $60 million to $70 million range for the year. Inventory days were 110 at the end of the second quarter of 2011 compared to 110 days at the end of the first quarter and 103 days at the end of last year. Approximately six of those days however is just the result of our higher FX impacts. We do not - we do some expect some additional improvement in the inventory levels by end of the year and really in fourth quarter. Accounts receivable days were 60 days at the end of the second quarter of 2011 compared to 57 days at the end of the second quarter in 2010.
At the end of the second quarter of 2011, we had $672 million in cash and short term investments. Total debt was $663 million at the end of the second quarter. Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $80 million of our stock or approximately $2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $36. Based on the company’s authorization remain up to 34 million shares of primary stock, we now have approximately 12 billion shares available for repurchase.
However as we have recently announced in our intent to acquire Astra Tech, we are now planning on repurchasing additional shares until we make some reasonable reductions in the debt used to complete that transaction. Finally, based on our performance in the first half, our gradual improvement in our underlying markets, continued benefits of a weak dollar and our current assessment of our orthodontic contingency plan, we are adjusting our 2011 full-year earnings per diluted share guidance to $1.92 to $2.00 on a non-GAAP basis excluding certain adjustments. This guidance also excludes a potential impact from our recently announced plans to acquire Astra Tech.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support. And we’d be glad to answer any questions that you may at this time.

But with respect to product supply, yes, we’ve gotten a trickle of supply I’ll call it, too small shipments one on the non self-ligating product and recently we got actually a small shipment of the self-ligating product. The Japanese supplier is up and running on a very limited basis. They had some equipment installed and approved for export business to us. We shouldn’t assume though that because we have this small trickle supply that they’ve got all the equipment in place validated and ready to go and all the labor trained, because of course they had to do - they were having to replace some of their labor on this location. So this is going to be an ongoing process.
We do think - we’ll stiff back to see this continue to improve although I don’t think it will be linear. And this is one of those times that we’ll have to give you an update when we had the third quarter call. At this point, I think it’s reasonable to assume we will have limited supply in the back half of the year, not nearly the supply we had in the second quarter of course, because we had full inventories coming into the second quarter which was now completed. So I think this is going to be more of a process than an event of slow rebuilding of the capacity.

Some of our customers of course don’t buy the self-ligating, they only buy the other series of products. I think with those customers, we’ve got a strong position and we’re probably we’ll keep that market share. With respect to one - customers that we’re primarily using self-ligating that we’re not able to try self-ligating, I think you’ll see a shift we called this temporary to one of the suppliers. And then of course, there is customers out there that have a mix and I wouldn’t expect us to lose all those customers that have a mix between self-ligating and the more traditional twin brackets, I think that we’re going to be able to compete at least in those with those orthodontics in the near term.
The other way I am thinking about it is that we start to get some supply back, of course we’ll be back in those offices with some limited offerings. And I think we need to keep in mind that the reason I used our brackets is because they like them best. So that’s going to play I think favorable for us as we go to rebuilt our market share here. My only other comment is I kind of alluded to in the commentary is that of course we haven’t taken out the sales and marketing infrastructure this business that we were fully maintaining that. We’re maintaining the relationships with the orthodontics. We’re in their offices, with the alternative offerings.
And I think that will help in recovery of the business and demonstrate self-commitments in longer term.

They’ve shut down and that affect we’ll see our customers shut down. That effect was mainly in the March last year.
Also we didn’t have IDS in March last year. We had it in this year. So that probably pulled some business out of it growing into March. And then sequentially we saw the quarter the operating performance improved throughout the rest of the quarter. And so if you looked at May and June you see much more normal ratios and growth rates compared to what we saw in April.
So I don’t think we like music, we’re just talking about one quarter or another quarter I think that’s what happened in the second quarter. As far as the overall business in Europe, we don’t see a dramatic change or what we seeing for the last we’ll say 18 months, the business appears to be solid. Of course it varies by country. Some of the countries in southern Europe where we’ve got severe budget problems I think are having a much harder time and those in Northern Europe. But I guess I would conclude it by saying, although we had this impact on our results in April, we don’t see those will change outside of that impact.

Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. This morning we are very pleased to announce record sales for our third quarter of 2011. As noted in the release and as Derek mentioned, our results in this per",1562,"Thank you, Derek and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. This morning we are very pleased to announce record sales for our third quarter of 2011. As noted in the release and as Derek mentioned, our results in this period of course are heavily influenced by the Astra Tech acquisition, including a number of non-recurring items and also the impact of the product outage in our orthodontics business. Accordingly throughout the call, we’ll provide you with insights into what our results would have been without the guidance.
  We’ll also update you on how we see the global dental market developing at this point then provide with some updates on both the Astra Tech integration and a status of our orthodontics recovery plans.
First, from a revenue perspective, we recorded revenue, which was a record revenue for our third quarter of $619.8 million as reported in $563.8 million ex-precious metals. Total sales growth [XPM] increased 14% has the strongest growth rate that we’ve seen since second quarter of 2008. Our constant currency growth was a positive 9.6% in the quarter including a negative internal growth of 1.1%. However, as you know, that’s heavily influenced by the product supply outage in our orthodontics business. And our acquisition growth in the period was 10.7% reflecting the Astra Tech acquisition for one month as well as five other smaller transactions that we completed in the last year. (Inaudible) growth rate of course are inclusive of our Japanese and our orthodontics business, both of which are heavily impacted by the natural disaster that occurred in Japan at March. If you look at the internal growth excluding the sales in the Japanese market and orthodontics the internal growth rate was positive 3.6% for the quarter and constant currency growth was over 15% for the quarter.
Our internal growth benefitted from mid single digit growth in both the tier side consumable category and also our specialty products and of course that exclude the orthodontics products and that was offset by a slight negative internal growth number from the prosthetics group.
Our currency translation was also positive in the quarter; it added 4.4% of sales. Total growth through nine months is 9.5% including constant currency growth of 5.0%. Internal growth through nine months is a positive 0.9% and a plus 0.39% excluding orthodontics and our sales industry in Japan.
For geographic internal growth, I want to give it you both as reported for the quarter and then also separately without orthodontics and the effects from the market in Japan. So as reported, internal growth was a negative 2.3% for the US, negative 3.8% for Europe, and a positive 5.3% for the rest of the world. Again, that’s heavily impacted by the supply outage in orthodontics. So excluding orthodontics and our sales in Japan, internal growth for the quarter was a positive 3.2% in the US, a positive 0.3% in Europe, and a positive 10.8% for rest of the world. And in Derek’s opening remarks he commented that there is some supplemental information available at our website, which includes the internal growth both with and without the orthodontics and Japanese effect.
Looking at these results again, ex-ortho and Japan there are couple of I think, obvious implications. First, the US market has clearly improved at least from our perspective it has. We saw a good growth year-over-year in consumables and specialty again, excluding orthodontics of course, and lab was also positive.
In Europe, it’s also clear that the market there overall has slowed a bit, however, it’s important to note that the extend varies quite a bit by region and product class. Our results in Europe were impacted by more than a four-percentage point by the decline in precious metal alloys, the market decline in precious metal alloys, as volumes in that market have declined substantially on record gold prices. Also I suspect it’s not surprising that there continues to be some rough market dynamics in Southern Europe, but conditions in Northern Countries seem much more stable.
Given the economic turmoil we see in the southern regions of Europe, we believe there is some continued risk of slowness in that region for the rest of the year and we’ve reflected that in our updated guidance that we’re providing today.
With respect to the rest of the world, our 10.8% internal growth again, ex-ortho in Japan for the quarter and 10.6% year-to-date reflects continue strong opportunities in many dental markets throughout the world. We are seeing good growth rates in the Pacific Rim, Latin America, Middle East and Australia. So these are pretty diverse markets of course, but to us this in 2011, many of these are moving in the right direction.
Overall, despite some doom and gloom talk about the global economy, the industry continues to chuck along as it has in the past, pretty resistant to economic fluctuations.
As far as our own results are concerned, we continue to be pleased with what we see as above market growth overall, and again ex-orthodontic outage. And we’re particularly happy with the performance of our new product pipeline. Like, I’d say customer reaction to the range of new products we’ve launched this year across various of our strategic business units has been really positive.
With regard to earnings, we’re pleased with the results, which were slightly better than what we had expected. Our earnings per share on a GAAP basis were down slightly, but this is a pretty messy quarter with the impacts from the acquisition and the orthodontic supply headwind and several other items of note of course.
Bill is going to provide you with some details on these items whilst a bridge to our non-GAAP results probably brief here. But overall on a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $0.46 per share that’s essentially the same as last year, but this is after a $0.04 to $0.05 per share reduction from the orthodontics business and the business in Japan. So those businesses would have been flat with the prior year our non-GAAP earnings would have been up approximately 10% for the quarter.
Regarding the orthodontics recovery plan, Chris is going to speak to this in more detail in a minute. But I think in general, it’s important to note that it feels like we’re getting very close to an inflection point in this business. I think the earnings drag the next quarter maybe a little higher than in the third quarter, but we expect to see sequential improvement in results as we enter next year. We’ll have some tough year-over-year comparisons for the next with say, two to three quarters, but we believe this unit will become a source of earnings growth again in the back half of next year as we recapture market share.
We’re also very happy to have closed the Astra Tech transaction earlier than we had previously thought possible. Our two teams are working very closely together on integration and prioritizing our opportunities. I think its also fare to say that having now spent close to two months in the integration, we’re enthusiastic about the opportunity and likewise, we’re very comfortable with the assumptions we made in the transaction including the accretion numbers that we had provided to you previously.
We remain confident, this transaction will be accretive even in 2011 without substantial synergies and of course, we expect the earnings growth to accelerate there after.
In our reported results we of course include all of Astra Tech acquisition growth, but had we reflected their organic growth in September the one month that we own them of course, it would have been accretive to the growth rates that we’re reporting to you today. Overall, I’d say on the Astra Tech, acquisition is going very well at this point.
Lastly, on earnings guidance, this quarter we’re reflecting guidance excluding the amortization of purchase intangibles from acquisitions as Derek had noted. For all of our acquisitions prior to July 1, 2011 this amounts to about a penny per share per quarter or about $0.04 per year. So, given that this was not in our prior guidance of $1.92 to $2 per share for all 2011, you should think of that prior guidance is now being $0.04 higher or $1.96 the $2.04 per share for all 2011. And today of course, we’re increasing that guidance to $2.01 to $2.07 per share for the full year reflecting, I think a number of factors. These include on the positive side accretion from the Astra Tech acquisition, growth prospects for the remainder of the year in the US and the rest of world regions, and slightly less of a drag that we previously expected from the orthodontics and Japanese business for the full year.
On the negative side, we can now see the conditions in Europe will likely be a bit slower, and the effects of currency are likely to be much less positive in the fourth quarter than what we’ve seen thus far for the year.
But overall, we’re pleased to be increasing the guidance by $0.05 on the low end and $0.03 on the high end for all 2011.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I’d like to now turn the call over to Chris who is going to provide us with an update on the orthodontic recovery plan and also the Astra Tech integration. Chris?

I’m going to take few moments as Bret mentioned and try to provide some deeper insights into our progress on the orthodontics front as well as an update on the integration efforts relative to Astra Tech.
With respect to orthodontics, we’re receiving increased shipments from our key Japanese supplier. Although, I should note that this improvement continues to be gradual. You may recall that I mentioned on our last call that we’ve just received an initial shipment of self-ligating product from our supplier. We are now generally receiving weekly shipments of both self-ligating and non self-ligating products although with levels well below our requirements and our historical levels. We’re basically at this point receiving more frequent, but still only partial shipments.
Our suppliers are continuing to make efforts to expand capacity and we continue to anticipate return to full availability across the various product lines sometime during the first half of next year.
To attempt to help bridge the gap on the non-proprietary products that we received from them, we are continuing in the interim to market alternatively source product received from other suppliers, marketed under the resolved brand name. We’re currently allocating available product from our Japanese supplier by geographic region and by product line, as we want to ensure we can meet as higher percentage of demand as possible in an individual market for specific brands.
As we entered the fourth quarter, I think we are in better shape than three months ago. As we entered Q3, we are basically close to a complete product outage from our Japanese supplier. Now, we’re receiving consistent albeit incomplete shipments and that we expect this to gradually improve as we move forward.
Excluding the impact of a particularly tough comparison this coming quarter, we believe should begin to see sequential improvements in the business. Due to the stronger prior year period results, the sequential improvement will like to be masked in the fourth quarter, but should be more evident moving forward from there.
So to summarize, I think we’re making the gradual sequential progress that we anticipated previously recognizing that this will be a multiyear recovery effort to get back to the market share that we enjoyed prior to the Japanese natural disaster.
Before moving off of ortho, I’d like to take a moment and publically comment our orthodontics team for their dedication to help our customers through this difficult period. Their professionalism and focus have been exemplary and reinforce our commitment to ensure that we keep the right organization in place to lead us back to strong above market growth as the supply situation improves, recognizing that this does create negative short term impact on our operating margin.
I’d now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts. We continue to be very impressed with the caliber of the Astra Tech team, as well as very pleased with the similarities between the cultures of our two companies. Their commitment, innovation and clinical reference (inaudible) really appears are own. And these similarities will certainly pay dividends for us as we move forward.
With respect to the integration process, we have initiated a joint integration team with dedicated resources from both DENTSPLY and Astra Tech with the support of external consulting resources all focused on maximizing the value of transaction. Their efforts are focused on identifying and implementing the optimal structures and processes to maximize the value of both the dental and the healthcare businesses, achieve our sales and operating synergy objectives, and not much larger implant business to further increase market share in the premium implants moving forward.
I would characterize the approach of the Astra Tech and DENTSPLY teams in this process as both very engaged and highly collaborative, and the process has a lot of positive energy focused on the significant opportunities created by the transaction. Our assessment is that these opportunities before us are even more compelling than what we anticipated through due diligence particularly with respect to the aggregate natural implant and digital dentistry portfolios.
I will also add that we are pleased with the business performance of both the Astra Tech and our own implant business during this initial integration period as the teams are capably juggling the demands on the ongoing business for the additional focus on integration activities.
While we have not yet seen announcements of Q3 results from some of our public implant competitors, both the Astra Tech and [free event] implant platforms grew upper mid single digits organically during the third quarter indicating that both implant portfolios are continuing to gain market share.
The urology business also continues to perform well with steady growth behind the new compact LoFric catheter in particular.
I look forward to providing additional updates as to our integration efforts on future quarterly calls. So I now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail.

Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter, but I’d like to add a couple of additional comments. First our geographic mix of sales ex-precious metals in the third quarter of 2011 included the US at 36%, Europe represented 40% and the rest of world was 24% of sales.
Our rest of the world is now nearly 25% of our total sales, these regions continue to gain importance as they’re growth is expected to continue to outperform US and European markets. Our sales mix will shift a few points more once Astra Tech is fully included for the entire period as its sales are obviously more heavily weighted within Europe.
Despite the recent strengthening of the dollar within the quarter, we’re still benefited from a slightly weaker dollar year-over-year in the third quarter, benefitting our top line growth by 4.4%.
Our earnings per share also benefited from the translation benefits of a weaker dollar, but are being partially offset by higher transaction related impacts, as we sell many products produced in Europe to other parts of the world, but this is negatively impacting our gross profit margins within the period.
The acquisition of Astra Tech does increase the volatility changes in FX rates that have on our sales and earnings on as more of our sales and our production is now located outside of the US. We are most impacted on sales by changes in the euro and our purchases and cost structures are most impacted by the Euro, Swiss Franc, Swedish krona, and also the Japanese yen. We will be utilizing additional systematic cash flow hedges on certain transactions in the future to help minimize the volatility that these FX fluctuations may otherwise have on our business. And at current exchange rates, we expect the fourth quarter impact of exchange to be closer to neutral on our bottom line than the positive impact we’ve had in the first few quarters.
As Derek mentioned and as you can see in our earnings release, the quarter included a number of items, which impacted our results, which we have identified as non-GAAP adjustments. Most of the following comments exclude the impacts of those items.
Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales, ex-precious metal content in the third quarter of 2011 were 55.9% compared to 55.7% for the third quarter of 2010. When compared to the same period last year, we were positively impacted by improved pricing and product mix as we benefit from stronger gross margins in the Astra Tech business. However, these benefits were nearly offset by negative impacts of foreign exchange movements.
The negative impact of foreign exchange rates on the gross margin rate in the quarter was approximately 80 basis points. So on a constant currency basis, gross margins were up nearly 4-percentage point on an adjusted basis. The Astra Tech is expected to have a positive mix impact on gross margin rates over the next year as this business again is consolidated into the company’s results.
Our SG&A included approximately $13 million of acquisition and integration expenses and the other adjustments. Absentees cost, SG&A on an adjusted basis would have been $218 million or approximately 38.7% of sales ex-precious metals, within the third quarter, versus 36.6% in the prior year’s third quarter. Both the impacts from supporting our ortho business during the supply outage and the addition of recent acquisitions will have a negative impact on this percentage rate until this time next year when these items are fully reflected in both years.
Astra Tech, which now runs with much higher SG&A expenses than our base business is expected to have a greater negative mix impact on SG&A expenses as a percent of sales over the next year as this business again is fully consolidated into the company’s results. With out the impacts of ortho and the Japan situation and our acquisition expenses, we would have been about flat as a percentage of sales in the period on an adjusted basis.
Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis were 17.2% compared to 19.2% last year in the same period. These rates were negatively impacted this year from the costs incurred supporting the infrastructure of our orthodontic business, impacts of FX movements, and from the combination and higher expense levels of recent acquisitions.
Astra Tech is also expected to have a negative mix impact on operating income rates over the next year as its business is consolidated into the company’s results and as their current operating performance is below DENTSPLY’s operating income levels as a percentage of sales. We expect that this impact will be mitigated over time as we realize the benefits of synergies of the combined businesses.
As Bret noted, our Japanese natural disaster have negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 in the third quarter. This impact will likely be approximately $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of this year as it was a stronger quarter for our ortho business last year.
It is expected to begin to show sequential signs of improvement as we finish up the year and also enter into next year. Even with sequential improvement though, we expect this business will have a negative impact on results in the first half of next year measured on a year-over-year basis.
Net interest and other expense in the third quarter on a reported basis was $20.8 million compared to $5.3 million last year in the third quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from net interest expense associated with the acquisition of Astra Tech, and approximately $12 million of expenses associated with the closing of that transaction, which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non-GAAP EPS. We were also slightly benefited by higher interest income as rates have increased slightly from last year.
During the quarter, we had a successful closing of our acquisition of Astra Tech and the financing associated with that transaction. The transaction was financed with approximately $650 million of cash and approximately $1.2 billion of additional debt, primarily financed by issuing public debt with maturities ranging from 2 years to 10 years at an all in average cost of approximately 3.6%.
Our reported tax rate for the quarter is not really meaningful as there are significant tax adjustments that we removed from our non-GAAP numbers. The most notable of this is a $47 million tax benefit that is being recognized based on the expected recovery of net operating tax loss carry forwards that we will now likely recover as a consequence of the Astra Tech acquisition.
On an adjusted basis excluding tax adjustments, our operating tax rate for this quarter was 23.8% and year-to-date is now 23%.
The tax rate continues to have a slightly favorable impact compared to last year and is the result of two items. First, we are benefiting from a more favorable geographic mix as our US based income has been reduced due to the impacts of a weaker dollar and the negative impacts of our supply outage of orthodontic products. We expect this impact will gradually go away as our sales and earnings in this business are rebuilt over the next few years.
We are also benefiting from our recent acquisition of Astra Tech. With this acquisition, we will be able to more effectively deploy our cash flow and as a result, much less cash will be taxed when repatriated to the US, which is resulting in a lower average tax rate in 2011. We also believe this rate will be reasonable when looking toward next year based on current tax loss. The announced acquisition of Astra Tech allows us to efficiently utilize not only our current cash balances, but also our future foreign cash flows.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the third quarter of 2011 on an as reported basis was $60.6 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $63.7 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non-GAAP basis was $66.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in 2011, compared to $66.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010.
Our supplemental material provides a more detailed bridge of the adjustments that are highlighted in both our quarter as well as our nine-month or year-to-date numbers.
As Bret noted, the current year number is reduced by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share due to the supply outage in orthodontics, absent that, we would have shown some nice earnings growth within this quarter.
Cash flow from operating activities in the first nine months of 2011 was $246 million compared to $249 million in the same period last year. But keep in mind; we had a number of payments in the quarter for acquisitions, financing related costs, legal settlements and other items of approximately $40 million, which negatively impacted operating cash flows within this period.
Capital expenditures were $45 million in the first nine months of the year with depreciation and amortization now at about $64 million.
Inventory days were 104 at the end of the third quarter of 2011 compared to 106 days at the end of the third quarter and 103 days at the end of last year. These levels now reflect the addition of Astra Tech inventory as well.
Accounts receivable days were 60 days including a slightly higher days from Astra Tech at the end of the third quarter of 2011, compared to 59 days at the end of the third quarter in 2010. At the end of the third quarter of 2011, we had $82 million in cash and short-term investments and our total debt was $1.84 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $80 million of our stock or approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $36. Based on the company’s authorization to remain up to $34 million of treasury shares, we have now approximately 12 million shares available for repurchase. However, as we’ve now completed our acquisition of Astra Tech, our preference will be working to pay some this debt down, before we utilize the remaining authorization although, we will more likely continue to offset our options.
Finally as Bret stated, we are pleased to be increasing our earnings guidance for 2011. As you recall, our previous earnings guidance was $1.92 to $2 per share on an adjusted basis. As we are now identifying all the amortization of purchased intangibles on a non-GAAP item, we wanted to clearly point out that amortization from transactions completed before July 1 of 2011 would add $0.04 to our previous guidance making our prior guidance on a comparable basis $1.96 to $2.04. As we look toward year-end, we’re comfortable raising our guidance for earnings on an adjusted basis to $2.01 to $2.07 per diluted share. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support and we’d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.

We generally generate significant amounts in both operating cash flow as well as free cash flow. Our expectation for that cash flow moving forward here and the primary focus on that will ultimately be for debt repayment. So as we get to kind of the back end of next year, we would be expecting to have paid down a nice piece of the debt already I mean, probably really for the next two years that’s our primary focus.
That does not mean that we might not have some tuck in acquisitions that we still do within kind of that first two years, but if we did, I would expect that those would be relatively small. So you can expect to use the majority of kind of the free cash flow side for debt repayment at least in the first couple of years. So, roughly a good kind of probably rule of thumb is maybe in the $250 million range possibly plus a little bit depending on what availability we’ve got to do that pay down.

We’ve been able to look at the assumptions we made and in our view they were very solid even now that we have more information and in fact, that was one of the reasons that we were positive about the accretion number in 2011.

We commented on that this year was pretty much a heavy year for us in innovation and it was no doubt in terms of the timing of the introductions probably more front loaded than back loaded. That said, we introduced some new products in the third quarter, I didn’t highlight those in my comments, but one that which I would highlight would be on the preventive business the RDH Freedom Cordless Prophy handpiece that is a significant improvement versus the coated handpiece that hygienist typically for prophies. So, I mean there is a number of new product launches still in the third and fourth quarters that we look to bring into market, but I would characterize that as more normal levels.
In terms of MTM, I'm not going to comment specifically on timing in terms of the US launch, because again it is depending on regulatory approval and that’s not something we can predict really easily. What I would say is that we are now just launching it in Canada. So obviously, we’ll look at that as a test market to try to optimize our launch programs if you were moving forward.
In terms of the Sensodyne collaboration, we’re work with them on a number of fronts. I would say, that there are some areas with that, that we’ve been pleased with in terms of the results and some areas that have been a bit more challenging, really not going to get into a lot more specifics in that, but I would say that, again, I think we’re certainly better for the collaboration as a result.

I hope you all had a chance to review our press release and supplemental materials, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release and these materials are available for downloading on our website, www.dentsply.com, in the Investor Relations area.
Before we get started, it is important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And a recording of this call, in its entirety, will be available on our website.
As you can see in the release, our results for this quarter reflect the Astra Tech acquisition and include a number of nonrecurring items and a substantial increase in noncash amortization of acquired intangibles. In an effort to provide clarity from the distortion of some of these items, our comments on this call focus on results, including certain adjustments, which are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You’ll note that our forward-looking earnings guidance also reflects results excluding all of the related amortization charges. This information is also highlighted in the supplemental material we’ve provided on our website.
With that, I’d like to now turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise. Bret?"

Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. This morning, we are very pleased to announce record sales for our third quarter of 2011. As noted in the release and as Derek mentioned, our results in this",1573,"Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. This morning, we are very pleased to announce record sales for our third quarter of 2011. As noted in the release and as Derek mentioned, our results in this period, of course, are heavily influenced by the Astra Tech acquisition including a number of nonrecurring items and also the impact of the product outage in our orthodontics business. Accordingly throughout the call, we’ll provide you with insights into what our results would have been without these items.
We’ll also update you on how we see the global dental market developing at this point and provide you with some updates on both the Astra Tech integration and the status of our orthodontics recovery plans.
First, from a revenue perspective, we recorded revenue, which was a record revenue for our third quarter of $619.8 million as reported and $563.8 million ex-precious metals. Total sales growth x PM increased 14%. That's the strongest growth rate that we’ve seen since second quarter of 2008. Our constant currency growth was a positive 9.6% in the quarter, including a negative internal growth of 1.1%. However, as you know, that’s heavily influenced by the product supply outage in our orthodontics business. And our acquisition growth in the period was 10.7%, reflecting the Astra Tech acquisition for 1 month as well as 5 other smaller transactions that we completed in the last year. These growth rate, of course, are inclusive of our Japanese and our orthodontics business, both of which are heavily impacted by the natural disaster that occurred in Japan in March. If you look at the internal growth excluding the sales in the Japanese market and orthodontics, the internal growth rate was positive 3.6% for the quarter and constant-currency growth was over 15% for the quarter.
Our internal growth benefited from mid-single-digit growth in both the chairside consumable category and also our specialty products and of course that excludes the orthodontics products, and that was offset by a slight negative internal growth number from the prosthetics group.
Currency translation was also positive in the quarter. It added 4.4% to sales. 
Total growth through 9 months is now 9.5%, including constant-currency growth of 5.0%. Internal growth through 9 months is a positive 0.9% and plus 0.39%, excluding orthodontics and our sales into Japan.
For geographic internal growth, I want to give it to you both as reported for the quarter and then also separately without orthodontics and the effects from the market in Japan. So as reported, internal growth was a negative 2.3% for the U.S., a negative 3.8% for Europe and a positive 5.3% for the rest of the world. Again, that’s heavily impacted by the supply outage in orthodontics. So excluding orthodontics and our sales in Japan, internal growth for the quarter was a positive 3.2% in the U.S., a positive 0.3% in Europe and a positive 10.8% for rest of the world. 
And in Derek’s opening remarks, he commented that there is some supplemental information available at our website, which includes the internal growth both with and without the orthodontics and Japanese effect.
Looking at these results again, x ortho and Japan, there are couple of, I think, obvious implications. First, the U.S. market has clearly improved. At least from our perspective, it has. We saw a good growth year-over-year in consumables and specialty, again excluding orthodontics, of course. And lab was also positive.
In Europe, it’s also clear that the market there overall has slowed a bit. However, it’s important to note that the extent varies quite a bit by region and product class. Our results in Europe were impacted by more than a full percentage point by the decline in precious metal alloys -- the market decline in precious metal alloys as volumes in that market have declined substantially on record-high gold prices. Also, I suspect it’s not surprising that there continues to be some rough market dynamics in Southern Europe, but conditions in the northern countries seem much more stable.
Given the economic turmoil we see in the southern regions of Europe, we believe there is some continued risk of slowness in that region for the rest of the year and we’ve reflected that in our updated guidance that we’re providing today.
With respect to the rest of the world, our 10.8% internal growth, again x ortho and Japan for the quarter and 10.6% year-to-date, reflects continued strong opportunities in many dental markets throughout the world. We're seeing good growth rates in the Pacific Rim, Latin America, Middle East and Australia. So these are pretty diverse markets, of course, but to us this, in 2011, many of these are moving in the right direction.
Overall, despite some doom and gloom talk about the global economy, dentistry continues to chug along as it has in the past, pretty resistant to economic fluctuations.
As far as our own results are concerned, we continue to be pleased with what we see as above-market growth overall, again x orthodontic outage. And we’re particularly happy with the performance of our new product pipeline. I’d say customer reaction to the range of new products we’ve launched this year across various of our strategic business units has been really positive.
With regard to earnings, we’re pleased with the results, which were slightly better than what we had expected. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis were down slightly, but this is a pretty messy quarter with the impacts from the acquisition and the orthodontic supply headwind and several other items of note, of course.
Bill is going to provide you with some details on these items as well as a bridge to our non-GAAP results, so I'll be brief here. But overall, on a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $0.46 per share. That’s essentially the same as last year, but this is after a $0.04 to $0.05 per share reduction from the orthodontics business and the business in Japan. So if those businesses would have been flat with the prior year, our non-GAAP earnings would have been up approximately 10% for the quarter.
Regarding the orthodontics recovery plan, Chris is going to speak to this in more detail in a minute. But I think, in general, it’s important to note that it feels like we’re getting very close to an inflection point in this business. I think the earnings drag the next quarter may be a little higher than in the third quarter, but we expect to see sequential improvement in results as we enter next year. We’ll have some tough year-over-year comparisons for the next, let's say, 2 to 3 quarters, but we believe this unit will become a source of earnings growth again in the back half of the year -- back half of next year as we recapture market share.
We're also very happy to have closed the Astra Tech transaction earlier than we had previously thought possible. Our 2 teams are working very closely together on integration and prioritizing our opportunities. I think it's also fair to say that having now spent close to 2 months in the integration, we’re very enthusiastic about the opportunity. And likewise, we’re very comfortable with the assumptions we made in the transaction including the accretion numbers that we have provided to you previously.
We remain confident this transaction will be accretive even in 2011 without substantial synergies, and of course we expect the earnings growth to accelerate thereafter.
In our reported results, we, of course, include all of Astra Tech in acquisition growth. But had we reflected their organic growth in September, the one month that we own them, of course, it would have been accretive to the growth rates that we’re reporting to you today. Overall, I’d say on the Astra Tech acquisition, it's going very well at this point.
Lastly, on earnings guidance, this quarter we’re reflecting guidance excluding the amortization of purchased intangibles from acquisitions as Derek had noted. For all of our acquisitions prior to July 1, 2011, this amounts to about a $0.01 per share per quarter or about $0.04 per year. So given that this was not in our prior guidance of $1.92 to $2 per share for all 2011, you should think of that prior guidance as now being $0.04 higher or $1.96 to $2.04 per share for all of 2011. 
And today of course, we’re increasing that guidance to $2.01 to $2.07 per share for the full year reflecting, I think, a number of factors. These include, on the positive side, accretion from the Astra Tech acquisition, growth prospects for the remainder of the year in the U.S. and the rest of world regions and slightly less of a drag that we'd previously expected from the orthodontics and Japanese business for the full year.
On the negative side, we can now see the conditions in Europe will likely be a bit slower and the effects of currency are likely to be much less positive in the fourth quarter than what we’ve seen thus far for the year.
But overall, we’re pleased to be increasing the guidance by $0.05 on the low end and $0.03 on the high end for all of 2011.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I’d like to now turn the call over to Chris who's going to provide us with an update on the orthodontics recovery plan and also the Astra Tech integration. Chris?"

Good morning everyone. I’m going to take few moments, as Bret mentioned, and try to provide some deeper insights into our progress on the orthodontics front as well as an update on the integration efforts relative to Astra Tech.
With respect to orthodontics, we’re receiving increased shipments from our key Japanese supplier although I should note that this improvement continues to be gradual. You may recall that I mentioned on our last call that we’ve just received an initial shipment of self-ligating product from our supplier. We are now generally receiving weekly shipments of both self-ligating and nonself-ligating products although with levels well below our requirements and our historical levels. We’re basically, at this point, receiving more frequent, but still only partial shipments. Our suppliers are continuing to make efforts to expand capacity, and we continue to anticipate return to full availability across the various product lines sometime during the first half of next year. To attempt to help bridge the gap on the nonproprietary products that we receive from them, we are continuing in the interim to market alternatively sourced product received from other suppliers, marketed under the Resolve brand name. We’re currently allocating available product from our Japanese supplier by geographic region and by product line, as we want to ensure we can meet as high a percentage of demand as possible in an individual market for specific brands.
As we enter the fourth quarter, I think we are in better shape than 3 months ago. As we entered Q3, we're basically close to a complete product outage from our Japanese supplier. Now, we’re receiving consistent, albeit incomplete shipments, and we expect this to gradually improve as we move forward.
Excluding the impact of a particularly tough comparison this coming quarter, we believe we should begin to see sequential improvements in the business. Due to the stronger prior year period results, the sequential improvement will likely be masked in the fourth quarter, but should be more evident moving forward from there.
So to summarize, I think we’re making a gradual sequential progress that we anticipated previously, recognizing that this will be a multiyear recovery effort to get back the market share that we enjoyed prior to the Japanese natural disaster.
Before moving off of ortho, I’d like to take a moment and publically commend our orthodontics team for their dedication to help our customers through this difficult period. Their professionalism and focus have been exemplary and reinforce our commitment to ensure that we keep the right organization in place to lead us back to strong above-market growth as the supply situation improves, recognizing that this does create a negative short-term impact on operating margin.
I’d now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts. We continue to be very impressed with the caliber of the Astra Tech team as well as very pleased with the similarities between the cultures of our 2 companies. Their commitment to innovation and to clinical reference, for instance, really mirrors our own and these similarities will certainly pay dividends for us as we move forward.
With respect to the integration process, we have initiated a joint integration team with dedicated resources from both DENTSPLY and Astra Tech with the support of external consulting resources, all focused on maximizing the value of the transaction. Their efforts are focused on identifying and implementing the optimal structures and processes to maximize the value of both the dental and the health care businesses, achieve our sales and operating synergy objectives and position the now much larger implant business to further increase market share in the premium implant segment moving forward.
I would characterize the approach of both the Astra Tech and DENTSPLY teams in this process as both very engaged and highly collaborative, and the process has a lot of positive energy focused on the significant opportunities created by the transaction. Our assessment is that these opportunities before us are even more compelling than what we anticipated through due diligence, particularly with respect to the aggregate dental implant and digital dentistry portfolios.
I will also add that we are pleased with the business performance of both the Astra Tech and our own implant business during this initial integration period as the teams are capably juggling the demands of the ongoing business for the additional focus on integration activities.
While we have not yet seen announcements of Q3 results from some of our public implant competitors, both the Astra Tech and Friadent implant platforms grew upper mid-single digits organically during the third quarter, indicating that both implant portfolios are continuing to gain market share.
The urology business also continues to perform well with steady growth behind the new compact LoFric catheter in particular.
I look forward to providing additional updates as to our integration efforts on future quarterly calls. 
So I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail."
27504,141402431,208507,"DENTSPLY International Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter, but I’d like to add a couple of additional comments. First, our geographic mix of sales x precious metals in the third quarter of 2011 included the U.S. a",1847,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter, but I’d like to add a couple of additional comments. First, our geographic mix of sales x precious metals in the third quarter of 2011 included the U.S. at 36%, Europe represented 40% and the rest of the world was 24% of sales. Our rest of the world is now nearly 25% of our total sales. These regions continue to gain importance as their growth is expected to continue to outperform U.S. and European markets. Our sales mix will shift a few points more once Astra Tech is fully included for the entire period as its sales are obviously more heavily weighted within Europe.
Despite the recent strengthening of the dollar within the quarter, we still benefited from a slightly weaker dollar year-over-year in the third quarter, benefiting our top line growth by 4.4%.
Our earnings per share also benefited from the translation benefits of a weaker dollar, but are being partially offset by higher transaction-related impacts as we sell many products produced in Europe to other parts of the world, but this is negatively impacting our gross profit margins within the period.
The acquisition of Astra Tech does increase the volatility changes in FX rates have on our sales and earnings as more of our sales and our production is now located outside of the U.S. We are most impacted on sales by changes in the euro and our purchases and cost structures are most impacted by the euro, Swiss franc, Swedish krona and also the Japanese yen. We will be utilizing additional systematic cash flow hedges on certain transactions in the future to help minimize the volatility that these FX fluctuations may otherwise have on our business. And at current exchange rates, we expect the fourth quarter impact of exchange to be closer to neutral on our bottom line than the positive impact we have had in the first few quarters.
As Derek mentioned, and as you can see in our earnings release, the quarter included a number of items, which impacted our results which we have identified as non-GAAP adjustments. Most of the following comments exclude the impacts of those items.
Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales, x precious metal content in the third quarter of 2011 were 55.9% compared to 55.7% for the third quarter of 2010. When compared to the same period last year, we were positively impacted by improved pricing and product mix as we benefit from stronger gross margins in the Astra Tech business. However, these benefits were nearly offset by negative impacts of foreign exchange movements. The negative impact of foreign exchange rates on the gross margin rate in the quarter was approximately 80 basis points. So on a constant-currency basis, gross margins were up nearly a full percentage point at an adjusted basis. Astra Tech is expected to have a positive mix impact on gross margin rates over the next year as this business again is consolidated into the company’s results.
Our SG&A included approximately $13 million of acquisition and integration expenses and other adjustments. Absent these costs, SG&A on an adjusted basis would have been $218 million or approximately 38.7% of sales x precious metals within the third quarter versus 36.6% in the prior year’s third quarter. Both the impacts from supporting our ortho business during the supply outage and the addition of recent acquisitions will have a negative impact on this percentage rate until this time next year when these items are fully reflected in both years.
Astra Tech, which now runs with much higher SG&A expenses than our base business is expected to have a greater negative mix impact on SG&A expenses as a percent of sales over the next year as this business again is fully consolidated into the company’s results. With out the impacts of ortho and the Japan situation and our acquisition expenses, we would have been about flat as a percentage of sales in the period on an adjusted basis.
Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis were 17.2%, compared to 19.2% last year in the same period. These rates were negatively impacted this year from the costs incurred supporting the infrastructure of our orthodontic business, impacts of FX movements and from the combination and higher expense levels of recent acquisitions.
Astra Tech is also expected to have a negative mix impact on operating income rates over the next year as its business is consolidated into the company’s results and as their current operating performance is below DENTSPLY’s operating income levels as a percentage of sales. We expect that this impact will be mitigated over time as we realize the benefits of synergies of the combined businesses.
As Bret noted, our Japanese natural disaster had negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 in the third quarter. This impact will likely be approximately $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of this year as it was a stronger quarter for our ortho business last year. It is expected to begin to show sequential signs of improvement as we finish up the year and also enter into next year. Even with sequential improvement, though, we expect this business will have a negative impact on results in the first half of next year measured on a year-over-year basis.
Net interest and other expense in the third quarter on a reported basis was $20.8 million compared to $5.3 million last year in the third quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from net interest expense associated with the acquisition of Astra Tech and approximately $12 million of expenses associated with the closing of that transaction, which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non-GAAP EPS. We were also slightly benefited by higher interest income as rates have increased slightly from last year.
During the quarter, we had a successful closing of our acquisition of Astra Tech and the financing associated with that transaction. The transaction was financed with approximately $650 million of cash and approximately $1.2 billion of additional debt, primarily financed by issuing public debt with maturities ranging from 2 years to 10 years at an all-in average cost of approximately 3.6%.
Our reported tax rate for the quarter is not really meaningful as there are significant tax adjustments that we removed from our non-GAAP numbers. The most notable of this is a $47 million tax benefit that is being recognized based on the expected recovery of net operating tax loss carryforwards that we will now likely recover as a consequence of the Astra Tech acquisition. On an adjusted basis, excluding tax adjustments, our operating tax rate for this quarter was 23.8% and year-to-date is now 23%.
The tax rate continues to have a slightly favorable impact compared to last year and is the result of 2 items: First, we are benefiting from a more favorable geographic mix as our U.S.-based income has been reduced due to the impacts of a weaker dollar and the negative impacts of our supply outage of orthodontic products. We expect this impact will gradually go away as our sales and earnings in this business are rebuilt over the next few years. We are also benefiting from our recent acquisition of Astra Tech. With this acquisition, we will be able to more effectively deploy our cash flow, and as a result, much less cash will be taxed when repatriated to the U.S., which is resulting in a lower average tax rate in 2011. We also believe this rate will be reasonable when looking toward next year based on current tax loss. The announced acquisition of Astra Tech allows us to efficiently utilize not only our current cash balances, but also our future foreign cash flows.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the third quarter of 2011 on an as-reported basis was $60.6 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $63.7 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non-GAAP basis was $66.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in 2011, compared to $66.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010.
Our supplemental material provides a more detailed bridge of the adjustments that are highlighted in both our quarter as well as our 9-month or year-to-date numbers.
As Bret noted, the current year number is reduced by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share due to the supply outage in orthodontics. Absent that, we would have shown some nice earnings growth within this quarter.
Cash flow from operating activities in the first 9 months of 2011 was $246 million compared to $249 million in the same period last year. But keep in mind, we had a number of payments in the quarter for acquisitions, financing-related costs, legal settlements and other items of approximately $40 million, which negatively impacted operating cash flows within this period.
Capital expenditures were $45 million in the first  months of the year with depreciation and amortization now at about $64 million.
Inventory days were 104 at the end of the third quarter of 2011 compared to 106 days at the end of the third quarter and 103 days at the end of last year. These levels now reflect the addition of Astra Tech inventory as well.
Accounts receivable days were 60 days including a slightly higher days from Astra Tech at the end of the third quarter of 2011, compared to 59 days at the end of the third quarter in 2010. At the end of the third quarter of 2011, we had $82 million in cash and short-term investments. And our total debt was $1.84 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $80 million of our stock or approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $36. Based on the company’s authorization to main up to $34 million of treasury shares, we have now approximately 12 million shares available for repurchase. However, as we have now completed our acquisition of Astra Tech, our preference will be working to pay some of this debt down before we utilize the remaining authorization although we will more likely continue to offset our options.
Finally as Bret stated, we are pleased to be increasing our earnings guidance for 2011. As you recall, our previous earnings guidance was $1.92 to $2 per share on an adjusted basis. As we are now identifying all the amortization of purchased intangibles on a non-GAAP item, we wanted to clearly point out that amortization from transactions completed before July 1 of 2011 would add $0.04 to our previous guidance, making our prior guidance on a comparable basis $1.96 to $2.04. As we look toward year end, we are comfortable raising our guidance for earnings on an adjusted basis to $2.01 to $2.07 per diluted share. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support, and we’d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time."

Bill, this -- you might have clarified this with your last comment, but I guess I might even ask you to parse it a little bit more. I mean essentially even after all the moving parts, you’re raising guidance by about $0.04. It looks like currency probably moved a little bit against you since the last time you updated us, then you closed the acquisition early. So is there a way to maybe even parse the $0.04 in terms of what’s coming from the accretion from Astra Tech? What if anything moved against you from FX? And what’s attributable to call it core DENTSPLY business model?"

So obviously that has -- is more of a headwind in relationship to kind of what maybe we've previously expected in July. But I'd say the other categories really across-the-board that Bret pointed out, both the broader-based markets with our base business performance, the performance within our ortho business that it's probably a little bit better than what we had expected in July, but right at the midpoint of kind of what we originally expected at the beginning of this year when the earthquake first happened. And I think that he also clearly stated that we’re confident that we will have accretion from at least the acquisition this year."

That does not mean that we might not have some tuck-in acquisitions that we still do within kind of that first 2 years. But if we did, I would expect that those would be relatively small. So you can expect to use the majority of kind of the free cash flow side for debt repayment at least in the first couple of years.

In terms of MTM, I'm not going to comment specifically on timing in terms of the U.S. launch because again that is depending on regulatory approval, and that’s not something we can predict really easily.

Each of us will have some prepared remarks, and then we’ll be glad to answer any questions that you may have. 
I hope you all had a chance to review our press release and supplemental materials, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release and these materials are available for downloading on our website, www.dentsply.com, in the Investor Relations area.
Before we get started, it is important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And a recording of this call, in its entirety, will be available on our website.
As you can see in the release, our results for this quarter reflect the Astra Tech acquisition and include a number of nonrecurring items and a substantial increase in noncash amortization of acquired intangibles. In an effort to provide clarity from the distortion of some of these items, our comments on this call focus on results, including certain adjustments, which are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You’ll note that our forward-looking earnings guidance also reflects results excluding all of the related amortization charges. This information is also highlighted in the supplemental material we’ve provided on our website.
With that, I’d like to now turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise. Bret?"

Total sales growth x PM increased 14%. That's the strongest growth rate that we’ve seen since second quarter of 2008. Our constant currency growth was a positive 9.6% in the quarter, including a negative internal growth of 1.1%. However, as you know, that’s heavily influenced by the product supply outage in our orthodontics business. And our acquisition growth in the period was 10.7%, reflecting the Astra Tech acquisition for 1 month as well as 5 other smaller transactions that we completed in the last year. These growth rate, of course, are inclusive of our Japanese and our orthodontics business, both of which are heavily impacted by the natural disaster that occurred in Japan in March. If you look at the internal growth excluding the sales in the Japanese market and orthodontics, the internal growth rate was positive 3.6% for the quarter and constant-currency growth was over 15% for the quarter.
Our internal growth benefited from mid-single-digit growth in both the chairside consumable category and also our specialty products and of course that excludes the orthodontics products, and that was offset by a slight negative internal growth number from the prosthetics group. Currency translation was also positive in the quarter. It added 4.4% to sales. Total growth through 9 months is now 9.5%, including constant-currency growth of 5.0%. Internal growth through 9 months is a positive 0.9% and plus 0.39%, excluding orthodontics and our sales into Japan.
For geographic internal growth, I want to give it to you both as reported for the quarter and then also separately without orthodontics and the effects from the market in Japan. So as reported, internal growth was a negative 2.3% for the U.S., a negative 3.8% for Europe and a positive 5.3% for the rest of the world. Again, that’s heavily impacted by the supply outage in orthodontics. So excluding orthodontics and our sales in Japan, internal growth for the quarter was a positive 3.2% in the U.S., a positive 0.3% in Europe and a positive 10.8% for rest of the world. 
And in Derek’s opening remarks, he commented that there is some supplemental information available at our website, which includes the internal growth both with and without the orthodontics and Japanese effect.
Looking at these results again, x ortho and Japan, there are couple of, I think, obvious implications. First, the U.S. market has clearly improved. At least from our perspective, it has. We saw a good growth year-over-year in consumables and specialty, again excluding orthodontics, of course. And lab was also positive.
In Europe, it’s also clear that the market there overall has slowed a bit. However, it’s important to note that the extent varies quite a bit by region and product class. Our results in Europe were impacted by more than a full percentage point by the decline in precious metal alloys -- the market decline in precious metal alloys as volumes in that market have declined substantially on record-high gold prices. Also, I suspect it’s not surprising that there continues to be some rough market dynamics in Southern Europe, but conditions in the northern countries seem much more stable.
Given the economic turmoil we see in the southern regions of Europe, we believe there is some continued risk of slowness in that region for the rest of the year and we’ve reflected that in our updated guidance that we’re providing today.
With respect to the rest of the world, our 10.8% internal growth, again x ortho and Japan for the quarter and 10.6% year-to-date, reflects continued strong opportunities in many dental markets throughout the world. We're seeing good growth rates in the Pacific Rim, Latin America, Middle East and Australia. So these are pretty diverse markets, of course, but to us this, in 2011, many of these are moving in the right direction.
Overall, despite some doom and gloom talk about the global economy, dentistry continues to chug along as it has in the past, pretty resistant to economic fluctuations.
As far as our own results are concerned, we continue to be pleased with what we see as above-market growth overall, again x orthodontic outage. And we’re particularly happy with the performance of our new product pipeline. I’d say customer reaction to the range of new products we’ve launched this year across various of our strategic business units has been really positive.
With regard to earnings, we’re pleased with the results, which were slightly better than what we had expected. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis were down slightly, but this is a pretty messy quarter with the impacts from the acquisition and the orthodontic supply headwind and several other items of note, of course.
Bill is going to provide you with some details on these items as well as a bridge to our non-GAAP results, so I'll be brief here. But overall, on a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $0.46 per share. That’s essentially the same as last year, but this is after a $0.04 to $0.05 per share reduction from the orthodontics business and the business in Japan. So if those businesses would have been flat with the prior year, our non-GAAP earnings would have been up approximately 10% for the quarter.
Regarding the orthodontics recovery plan, Chris is going to speak to this in more detail in a minute. But I think, in general, it’s important to note that it feels like we’re getting very close to an inflection point in this business. I think the earnings drag the next quarter may be a little higher than in the third quarter, but we expect to see sequential improvement in results as we enter next year. We’ll have some tough year-over-year comparisons for the next, let's say, 2 to 3 quarters, but we believe this unit will become a source of earnings growth again in the back half of the year -- back half of next year as we recapture market share.
We're also very happy to have closed the Astra Tech transaction earlier than we had previously thought possible. Our 2 teams are working very closely together on integration and prioritizing our opportunities. I think it's also fair to say that having now spent close to 2 months in the integration, we’re very enthusiastic about the opportunity. And likewise, we’re very comfortable with the assumptions we made in the transaction including the accretion numbers that we have provided to you previously.
We remain confident this transaction will be accretive even in 2011 without substantial synergies, and of course we expect the earnings growth to accelerate thereafter.
In our reported results, we, of course, include all of Astra Tech in acquisition growth. But had we reflected their organic growth in September, the one month that we own them, of course, it would have been accretive to the growth rates that we’re reporting to you today. Overall, I’d say on the Astra Tech acquisition, it's going very well at this point.
Lastly, on earnings guidance, this quarter we’re reflecting guidance excluding the amortization of purchased intangibles from acquisitions as Derek had noted. For all of our acquisitions prior to July 1, 2011, this amounts to about a $0.01 per share per quarter or about $0.04 per year. So given that this was not in our prior guidance of $1.92 to $2 per share for all 2011, you should think of that prior guidance as now being $0.04 higher or $1.96 to $2.04 per share for all of 2011. 
And today of course, we’re increasing that guidance to $2.01 to $2.07 per share for the full year reflecting, I think, a number of factors. These include, on the positive side, accretion from the Astra Tech acquisition, growth prospects for the remainder of the year in the U.S. and the rest of world regions and slightly less of a drag that we'd previously expected from the orthodontics and Japanese business for the full year.
On the negative side, we can now see the conditions in Europe will likely be a bit slower and the effects of currency are likely to be much less positive in the fourth quarter than what we’ve seen thus far for the year. But overall, we’re pleased to be increasing the guidance by $0.05 on the low end and $0.03 on the high end for all of 2011.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I’d like to now turn the call over to Chris who's going to provide us with an update on the orthodontics recovery plan and also the Astra Tech integration. Chris?"

Good morning everyone. I’m going to take few moments, as Bret mentioned, and try to provide some deeper insights into our progress on the orthodontics front as well as an update on the integration efforts relative to Astra Tech.
With respect to orthodontics, we’re receiving increased shipments from our key Japanese supplier although I should note that this improvement continues to be gradual. You may recall that I mentioned on our last call that we’ve just received an initial shipment of self-ligating product from our supplier. We are now generally receiving weekly shipments of both self-ligating and nonself-ligating products although with levels well below our requirements and our historical levels. We’re basically, at this point, receiving more frequent, but still only partial shipments. Our suppliers are continuing to make efforts to expand capacity, and we continue to anticipate return to full availability across the various product lines sometime during the first half of next year. To attempt to help bridge the gap on the nonproprietary products that we receive from them, we are continuing in the interim to market alternatively sourced product received from other suppliers, marketed under the Resolve brand name. We’re currently allocating available product from our Japanese supplier by geographic region and by product line, as we want to ensure we can meet as high a percentage of demand as possible in an individual market for specific brands.
As we enter the fourth quarter, I think we are in better shape than 3 months ago. As we entered Q3, we're basically close to a complete product outage from our Japanese supplier. Now, we’re receiving consistent, albeit incomplete shipments, and we expect this to gradually improve as we move forward.
Excluding the impact of a particularly tough comparison this coming quarter, we believe we should begin to see sequential improvements in the business. Due to the stronger prior year period results, the sequential improvement will likely be masked in the fourth quarter, but should be more evident moving forward from there.
So to summarize, I think we’re making a gradual sequential progress that we anticipated previously, recognizing that this will be a multiyear recovery effort to get back the market share that we enjoyed prior to the Japanese natural disaster.
Before moving off of ortho, I’d like to take a moment and publically commend our orthodontics team for their dedication to help our customers through this difficult period. Their professionalism and focus have been exemplary and reinforce our commitment to ensure that we keep the right organization in place to lead us back to strong above-market growth as the supply situation improves, recognizing that this does create a negative short-term impact on operating margin.
I’d now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts. We continue to be very impressed with the caliber of the Astra Tech team as well as very pleased with the similarities between the cultures of our 2 companies. Their commitment to innovation and to clinical reference, for instance, really mirrors our own and these similarities will certainly pay dividends for us as we move forward.
With respect to the integration process, we have initiated a joint integration team with dedicated resources from both DENTSPLY and Astra Tech with the support of external consulting resources, all focused on maximizing the value of the transaction. Their efforts are focused on identifying and implementing the optimal structures and processes to maximize the value of both the dental and the health care businesses, achieve our sales and operating synergy objectives and position the now much larger implant business to further increase market share in the premium implant segment moving forward.
I would characterize the approach of both the Astra Tech and DENTSPLY teams in this process as both very engaged and highly collaborative, and the process has a lot of positive energy focused on the significant opportunities created by the transaction. Our assessment is that these opportunities before us are even more compelling than what we anticipated through due diligence, particularly with respect to the aggregate dental implant and digital dentistry portfolios.
I will also add that we are pleased with the business performance of both the Astra Tech and our own implant business during this initial integration period as the teams are capably juggling the demands of the ongoing business for the additional focus on integration activities.
While we have not yet seen announcements of Q3 results from some of our public implant competitors, both the Astra Tech and Friadent implant platforms grew upper mid-single digits organically during the third quarter, indicating that both implant portfolios are continuing to gain market share.
The urology business also continues to perform well with steady growth behind the new compact LoFric catheter in particular. I look forward to providing additional updates as to our integration efforts on future quarterly calls. 
So I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail."
27504,141402431,279430,"DENTSPLY International Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter, but I’d like to add a couple of additional comments. First, our geographic mix of sales x precious metals in the third quarter of 2011 included the U.S. a",1846,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter, but I’d like to add a couple of additional comments. First, our geographic mix of sales x precious metals in the third quarter of 2011 included the U.S. at 36%, Europe represented 40% and the rest of the world was 24% of sales. Our rest of the world is now nearly 25% of our total sales. These regions continue to gain importance as their growth is expected to continue to outperform U.S. and European markets. Our sales mix will shift a few points more once Astra Tech is fully included for the entire period as its sales are obviously more heavily weighted within Europe.
Despite the recent strengthening of the dollar within the quarter, we still benefited from a slightly weaker dollar year-over-year in the third quarter, benefiting our top line growth by 4.4%.
Our earnings per share also benefited from the translation benefits of a weaker dollar, but are being partially offset by higher transaction-related impacts as we sell many products produced in Europe to other parts of the world, but this is negatively impacting our gross profit margins within the period.
The acquisition of Astra Tech does increase the volatility changes in FX rates have on our sales and earnings as more of our sales and our production is now located outside of the U.S. We are most impacted on sales by changes in the euro and our purchases and cost structures are most impacted by the euro, Swiss franc, Swedish krona and also the Japanese yen. We will be utilizing additional systematic cash flow hedges on certain transactions in the future to help minimize the volatility that these FX fluctuations may otherwise have on our business. And at current exchange rates, we expect the fourth quarter impact of exchange to be closer to neutral on our bottom line than the positive impact we have had in the first few quarters.
As Derek mentioned, and as you can see in our earnings release, the quarter included a number of items, which impacted our results which we have identified as non-GAAP adjustments. Most of the following comments exclude the impacts of those items.
Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales, x precious metal content in the third quarter of 2011 were 55.9% compared to 55.7% for the third quarter of 2010. When compared to the same period last year, we were positively impacted by improved pricing and product mix as we benefit from stronger gross margins in the Astra Tech business. However, these benefits were nearly offset by negative impacts of foreign exchange movements. The negative impact of foreign exchange rates on the gross margin rate in the quarter was approximately 80 basis points. So on a constant-currency basis, gross margins were up nearly a full percentage point at an adjusted basis. Astra Tech is expected to have a positive mix impact on gross margin rates over the next year as this business again is consolidated into the company’s results.
Our SG&A included approximately $13 million of acquisition and integration expenses and other adjustments. Absent these costs, SG&A on an adjusted basis would have been $218 million or approximately 38.7% of sales x precious metals within the third quarter versus 36.6% in the prior year’s third quarter. Both the impacts from supporting our ortho business during the supply outage and the addition of recent acquisitions will have a negative impact on this percentage rate until this time next year when these items are fully reflected in both years.
Astra Tech, which now runs with much higher SG&A expenses than our base business is expected to have a greater negative mix impact on SG&A expenses as a percent of sales over the next year as this business again is fully consolidated into the company’s results. Without the impacts of ortho and the Japan situation and our acquisition expenses, we would have been about flat as a percentage of sales in the period on an adjusted basis.
Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis were 17.2%, compared to 19.2% last year in the same period. These rates were negatively impacted this year from the costs incurred supporting the infrastructure of our orthodontic business, impacts of FX movements and from the combination and higher expense levels of recent acquisitions.
Astra Tech is also expected to have a negative mix impact on operating income rates over the next year as its business is consolidated into the company’s results and as their current operating performance is below DENTSPLY’s operating income levels as a percentage of sales. We expect that this impact will be mitigated over time as we realize the benefits of synergies of the combined businesses.
As Bret noted, our Japanese natural disaster had negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 in the third quarter. This impact will likely be approximately $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of this year as it was a stronger quarter for our ortho business last year. It is expected to begin to show sequential signs of improvement as we finish up the year and also enter into next year. Even with sequential improvement, though, we expect this business will have a negative impact on results in the first half of next year measured on a year-over-year basis.
Net interest and other expense in the third quarter on a reported basis was $20.8 million compared to $5.3 million last year in the third quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from net interest expense associated with the acquisition of Astra Tech and approximately $12 million of expenses associated with the closing of that transaction, which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non-GAAP EPS. We were also slightly benefited by higher interest income as rates have increased slightly from last year.
During the quarter, we had a successful closing of our acquisition of Astra Tech and the financing associated with that transaction. The transaction was financed with approximately $650 million of cash and approximately $1.2 billion of additional debt, primarily financed by issuing public debt with maturities ranging from 2 years to 10 years at an all-in average cost of approximately 3.6%.
Our reported tax rate for the quarter is not really meaningful as there are significant tax adjustments that we removed from our non-GAAP numbers. The most notable of this is a $47 million tax benefit that is being recognized based on the expected recovery of net operating tax loss carryforwards that we will now likely recover as a consequence of the Astra Tech acquisition. On an adjusted basis, excluding tax adjustments, our operating tax rate for this quarter was 23.8% and year-to-date is now 23%.
The tax rate continues to have a slightly favorable impact compared to last year and is the result of 2 items: First, we are benefiting from a more favorable geographic mix as our U.S.-based income has been reduced due to the impacts of a weaker dollar and the negative impacts of our supply outage of orthodontic products. We expect this impact will gradually go away as our sales and earnings in this business are rebuilt over the next few years. We are also benefiting from our recent acquisition of Astra Tech. With this acquisition, we will be able to more effectively deploy our cash flow, and as a result, much less cash will be taxed when repatriated to the U.S., which is resulting in a lower average tax rate in 2011. We also believe this rate will be reasonable when looking toward next year based on current tax loss. The announced acquisition of Astra Tech allows us to efficiently utilize not only our current cash balances, but also our future foreign cash flows.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the third quarter of 2011 on an as-reported basis was $60.6 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $63.7 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non-GAAP basis was $66.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in 2011, compared to $66.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010.
Our supplemental material provides a more detailed bridge of the adjustments that are highlighted in both our quarter as well as our 9-month or year-to-date numbers.
As Bret noted, the current year number is reduced by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share due to the supply outage in orthodontics. Absent that, we would have shown some nice earnings growth within this quarter.
Cash flow from operating activities in the first 9 months of 2011 was $246 million compared to $249 million in the same period last year. But keep in mind, we had a number of payments in the quarter for acquisitions, financing-related costs, legal settlements and other items of approximately $40 million, which negatively impacted operating cash flows within this period.
Capital expenditures were $45 million in the first  months of the year with depreciation and amortization now at about $64 million.
Inventory days were 104 at the end of the third quarter of 2011 compared to 106 days at the end of the third quarter and 103 days at the end of last year. These levels now reflect the addition of Astra Tech inventory as well.
Accounts receivable days were 60 days including a slightly higher days from Astra Tech at the end of the third quarter of 2011, compared to 59 days at the end of the third quarter in 2010. At the end of the third quarter of 2011, we had $82 million in cash and short-term investments. And our total debt was $1.84 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $80 million of our stock or approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $36. Based on the company’s authorization to main up to $34 million of treasury shares, we have now approximately 12 million shares available for repurchase. However, as we have now completed our acquisition of Astra Tech, our preference will be working to pay some of this debt down before we utilize the remaining authorization although we will more likely continue to offset our options.
Finally as Bret stated, we are pleased to be increasing our earnings guidance for 2011. As you recall, our previous earnings guidance was $1.92 to $2 per share on an adjusted basis. As we are now identifying all the amortization of purchased intangibles on a non-GAAP item, we wanted to clearly point out that amortization from transactions completed before July 1 of 2011 would add $0.04 to our previous guidance, making our prior guidance on a comparable basis $1.96 to $2.04. As we look toward year end, we are comfortable raising our guidance for earnings on an adjusted basis to $2.01 to $2.07 per diluted share. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support, and we’d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time."

You've previously guided to the first 12 months being $0.12 to $0.17 accretive. Obviously, Europe has slowed here a bit. Dental implant market, plus or minus, may have changed a bit. But you also eliminated an intercompany loan hedge and you’ve got the Swiss now pegged at the euro that might help the manufacturing costs on dental implants in Switzerland. So just wondering how you’re conceptually thinking about that $0.12 to $0.17 guidance. Will you update that number or at least qualitatively talk around it?"

That does not mean that we might not have some tuck-in acquisitions that we still do within kind of that first 2 years. But if we did, I would expect that those would be relatively small. So you can expect to use the majority of kind of the free cash flow side for debt repayment at least in the first couple of years.

The flip side of that is that the overhead structure of their current business is obviously well above DENTSPLY’s levels, so our SG&A-related side is going to be higher and it'll obviously be driving -- that impact will obviously be nearly 3x the impact within the fourth quarter. But as far as specific expectations beyond, that we aren’t really giving any additional guidance."
