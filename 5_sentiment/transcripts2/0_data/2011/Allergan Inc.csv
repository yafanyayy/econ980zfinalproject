Allergan is in a strong position as we enter 2011 with the record number of R&D approvals in 2010 both from FDA and regulatory agencies around the world, coupled with a modest recovery of most maj",2289,"Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Allergan is in a strong position as we enter 2011 with the record number of R&D approvals in 2010 both from FDA and regulatory agencies around the world, coupled with a modest recovery of most major economies and the return of almost all of our cash pay markets to above prerecession levels, and finally, the worst of the impact to generics on our U.S. Ophthalmology business behind us, with all those factors we're looking ahead at several years of strong revenue growth.
Regarding our outlook for sales as laid out in our press release, we're forecasting growth in the range of between 4% and 8%. Regarding earnings, we're looking to a range of 12% to 14% for non-GAAP EPS. Even after we've absorbed approximately $100 million of incremental costs from U.S. healthcare reform and European price cuts and increased rebates. Especially looking at R&D, you'll notice from our forecast that we have made the strategic decision to strongly increase our investment as we reload our pipeline with the goal of assuring Allergan's long-term growth objectives. Our risk is also clear that we'll be leveraging SG&A spend particularly in developed markets.
Now reviewing the results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Sales increased versus the fourth quarter of 2009 by 6.9% in dollars, reflecting some impact of the weak euro and by 7.4% in local currencies. For the full year, sales growth over 2009 was 8.4% in dollars and 7.5% in local currencies. Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $0.88, marking a 12.8% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2009 and at the top end of the expectations provided at the time of our last earnings call. Earnings were driven by strong sales growth particularly outside the U.S. where we enjoyed midteens sales growth, with high teens or better sales growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada, and even double-digit growth in several European countries. Performance was boosted by gross margin expansion for both the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments. For the full year, diluted EPS of $3.16 increased 13.7% over 2009 after we increased R&D investment, and on the non-GAAP basis by 13%, this is R&D spend, to $662 million. In line with common practice with consumer brands, we are able to leverage direct to consumer spending for individual products in post launch years. And 2010, we spent $171 million versus $185 million in 2009.
Before covering the performance of the businesses, I'd like to comment on our partnership with Matt Pharmaceuticals to co-promote in the United States. This product is a great fit with our portfolio with Lavin ex being likely indicated for acute migraine and Botox approved for chronic migraine offering headache specialists with a continual care. Timing after the establishment of Botox for chronic migraine looks ideal and the partnership leverages our investment into our sales and marketing infrastructure. Allergan and Map will be virtually the only companies actively marketing branded products in the headache market. 
Now looking at the products. Regarding Botox performance, growth in the fourth quarter versus prior year was 11.1% in dollars and 11.2% in local currencies, marking an acceleration versus full year sales growth of 8.4% in dollars and 7.1% in local currencies. For the full year, as stated in our press release, sales of BOTOX Cosmetic increased 11% over 2009, showing both economic recovery and our ability to sustain only a marginal loss to our high worldwide market share.
BOTOX therapeutic increased 6% over 2009, with Botox maintaining or even marginally gaining world share. Obviously, with the mid October approval of Botox for chronic migraine in the U.S., there was only a small incremental contribution to sales in the fourth quarter. On a global basis, we estimate in Q3, the last period for which we have market data, the Botox enjoyed 75% market share, down only two percentage points from Q3 of 2009. In the Aesthetic market segment, Dysport procedure share in the U.S. seems to have stagnated at around 17% to 18% since April, but of course, value share being lower. In Europe, Mertz and Galderma have made small market share gains with their launches of and Azzalure. In the Therapeutic market segment, Dysprt and have gained only marginal share in the U.S. even with sampling and Xeomin something a little share in Canada.
Regarding chronic migraine, we are pleased to report that there is great physician interest in the headache community. Our sales force is fully deployed, with one group focused in movement disorders and the other on chronic migraine. We're commercializing a 200 unit trial and recommend purchase of this SKU for chronic migraine. We've made very strong progress securing coverage for Botox for chronic migraine in the critical area of commercial managed care formularies, as well as Medicare formularies. Typical policy at managed care organizations is to provide proof of failure on two prior medications, making the prior authorization process quite smooth. At this point, we're putting greater emphasis on hands-on training for physicians as this is now the greater reg limit step for sales build.
Moving on to Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 6.6% in dollars and 7.4% in local currencies over Q4 of '09. For the full year, growth was 7.7% in dollars and 7.0% in local currencies. Noteworthy was the straw LUMIGAN and Danforth fourth quarter year-over-year performance of 17.4% growth in local currencies. In the fourth quarter, there was a disparity in care performance with low growth in the U.S. offset by high international growth as we managed through the impact of the authorized generic of Alpha Gannett .15% in generics of ACULAR. Our data provider, SDI shows Allergan in the fourth quarter growing year-over-year in the U.S., 2.3% in the market growing very healthily at 14.2% in acquisition dollars.
Outside the U.S., we enjoyed double-digit growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia. In the U.S., we're very pleased that we're positioned for better growth in 2011. LUMIGAN .01% has started very strongly with an share last weekly data already at 24% of the overall LUMIGAN franchise after its launch just before the American Academy of Ophthalmology in October. As has been the experience in Europe and Canada, ophthalmologists appreciates the comfortable efficacy to the original LUMIGAN, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates. LUMIGAN 0.1% enjoys comparable managed-care formulary status to the original LUMIGAN and we are well positioned prior to the arrival of generics.
In market RESTASIS in the fourth quarter grew strongly year-over-year in acquisition dollars of 14%. x factory sales growth worldwide was lower driving only 7.1% lower due to an increase in channel inventory during the fourth quarter of 2009. COMBIGAN grew 35% in acquisition dollars, offsetting most of the decline in ALPHAGAN sales. Regarding generics, we're pleased that branded ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN continued to hold over 70% share of trailing prescriptions of Vermont and products. The impact of generics in the ACULAR and ACUVAIL franchises has unfortunately been substantial as we had little ttime to transition to our improved ACUVAIL product. For 2011, we are excited to launch plastic gas, a product with a strong antiallergy profile and we'r ealso benefiting for impairment Jay Cohen for TX.
Canada enjoyed a spectacular quarter due to strong performance of LUMIGAN and ALPHAGAN where generic ALPHAGAN was on backorder and also the launch of RESTASIS. Due to the strong uptick of LUMIGAN 0.1% and its reimbursement on all provincial formularies, we announced on Jan 1 that the original LUMIGAN product will be discontinued across Canada. In Europe, double-digit sales growth was driven by LUMIGAN 0.1%, Danforth, our Artificial Tears line and strong uptick of Oz index especially in Germany. Allergan is also benefiting from market share gains in both glaucoma and tears across the European Union.
Regarding facial aesthetics, we continued to enjoyed strong growth. In the fourth quarter, sales year-over-year increased 22.6% in dollars and 23.3% in local currencies, and for the full year, 30.1% in dollars and 28.5% in local currencies. Allergan is growing strongly in every operating region in the world and based on our analysis, is gaining share in every region, thanks to the introduction of innovative products. Market growth is being stimulated by the new lidocaine containing products and the success of JUVÉDERM alumna outside the U.S. where there is a great interest in the use of fillers for volumizing especially the mid-face area.
We're locally permitted we have also invested in JUVEDERM direct to consumer advertising. Regarding skin care, sales decreased in the fourth quarter versus prior year by 9.8% in dollars and 9.9% in local currencies. Obviously, the major reason for the reduction is the decline in LATISSE sales year-over-year by 33% which requires some explanation. Analyzing our x factory sales both direct to physician and to wholesalers, it is clear with the benefit of post- pop analysis that there was a stocking effect in Q4 2009 in doctors offices. This accounts for about half of the decline. And other contributor to the sales decline is our heavy sampling campaigns in the fourth quarter. From early October to mid-December, we offered a $100 rebate in cash for LATISSE after receiving a BOTOX Cosmetic for JUVÉDERM treatment.
The sampling campaigns were strategic as we know from our consumer market research, the patients have a high degree of loyalty once they've initiated use of the product LATISSE. We're quite encouraged by recent improvements in usage and aptitude surveys regarding perceptions regarding safety of LATISSE and also intention to purchase.
On a positive note, LATISSE was the fourth largest medical aesthetics product and value in the U.S. have had an estimated half a million customers. Even more than JUVÉDERM at the end of its second year of commercialization. In 2011, much management attention is focused on the growth of LATISSE and also our hair growth pipeline. In Canada, LATISSE, which was recently launched, has enjoyed strong uptake and has garnered quickly wide distribution of physicians offices. Regarding other products, principally medical dermatology,x factory sales increased 5%. This understates fourth quarter year-over-year acquisition dollar growth reported by SDI of 39% for and 17% for TAZORAC. For breast aesthetics, Q4 sales increased year-over-year 8.9% in dollars and 10.3% in local currency. Broadly in line with growth for the full year of 11.0% in dollars and 11.1% in local currencies. In the U.S., we continued to see a gradual pickup in the mix towards silicone gel implants.
For the first three quartersof  2010, the last period for which we have market data available, we believe that we have gained some worldwide market share. We are pleased with our performance in Korea and Australia where we have taken over direct selling operations. Regarding last week's advisory from the U.S. FDA, regarding the extremely rare occurrence of anaplastic large-scale lymphomas in breast implant patients, we're gauging customer reaction carefully. We're knowledgeable about all occurrences reported worldwide, both in Allergan implants, as well as those of competitors. In early 2010, as some reports occurred, we already assembled a panel of the most preeminent experts in rare cancers and epidemiology, presenting them with all the facts that were available as patient health and safety are always our highest priority.
Our intention is to publish the findings in an appropriate medical journal. At this stage, we do not expect a major impact on our sales in 2011, which is reflected in our outlook for worldwide sales. Regarding the obesity intervention product line. Sales in the fourth quarter year-over-year declined 9.9% in dollars and 9.8% to local currencies. For the full year versus 2009, sales declined 5.8% in dollars and 7.0% to local currencies. In the U.S., we continued to suffer from the apparent correlation of this market with high unemployment rates. We estimate that the Cash Pay segment of the market declined 26% in 2010 to about 10% of the overall market, whereas the reimbursed market for all bariatric procedures declined 3%. Within this reimbursed market, the market declined 4% and procedures declined 3%, as sleeve gastrectomy grew on a small base.
Regarding LAP-BAND share within the band market, we're now entering a timeframe where our share year-over-year is stable. In Q4, we estimate our share at 73%. Outside the U.S., Australia had a particular poor Q4 which we as ascribe to economic conditions and consumer credit conditions as we do not believe that we lost market share. In Europe, Latin America and Canada, we continued to enjoy modest growth. For 2011, we look forward to receiving FDA approval, the lower body mass index indication, improving managed care access, disseminating exciting health economics data on LAP-BAND.
Commenting urology, Q4 sales decreased 7.1% in dollars as we absorb the impact of generics to the original Sankar product and the longer growth in the GP channel after termination of the copromotion agreement with . SANCTURA XR, our latest generation product, however, continues to grow strongly. Q4 acquisition dollar growth was 21%. We remain excited about the strength of our emerging urology pipeline, led by Botox for neurogenic activity which was filed with the FDA, as well as EMEA and health Canada in Q4. Finally, you may have seen from our 8-K this morning announcing the retirement of our two longest-serving directors, Gavin Herbert and Landon Schafer. Gavin Herbert was our company founder, has served Allergan's board for 60 years, building the company in giant steps in his more than 30 years as CEO. Leonard Schaeffer has served the board with excellence since 1993. I wish to thank them both for their high standards, their counsel and making available a profound knowledge of the healthcare industry. I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards will provide detailed comments on our financials."

During the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong sales operating results as we are again able to overachieve our sales expectations despite headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare ref",1092,"Thank you, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong sales operating results as we are again able to overachieve our sales expectations despite headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare reform, Europe pricing pressures and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15 and ACULAR brands. Allergan's diversified base of business and thoughtful directed approach to reinvest back into the business enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results at the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.88, marking a 12.8% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. Excluding the effects of the R&D tax credit cathc-up, non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter approximated 8%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter EPS for 2010 was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit caused by the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2010. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. For the full year of 2010, Allergan delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.16 despite the various switching points described above and continuing competition in the neuromodulator market. The strong full year result was above the high-end of our initial range of expectations provided in February 2010 of $3.09 to $3.15. Our strong commitment to the long term future of our company and to our shareholders is evident in this result as we're able to both invest strongly into the growth drivers of the business and pass stronger earnings performance onto our shareholders in the form of greater EPS performance. Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q4 2010 gross margin of 85.8% increased 110 basis points when compared to Q4 of 2009. And Allergan once again saw a sequential quarterly improvement in both its Pharmaceutical and Medical Device margins. This continuing positive trend, gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs with a very substantial contribution coming from our breast product line given our changeover to lower cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica, favorable volume -based manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions and the lower royalty expense. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product mix sales ratio for the fourth quarter was 40% totataling $517 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2009 were 41.7% and $503 million respectively. we are recognizing the benefits of leverage in many of our business while continuing to have the latitude to make meaningful investments and investments which are focused on projects that we believe will yield the greatest financial returns. You can expect this approach and method to continue during 2011 and we should continue to make progress towards further leveraging this ratio.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.5% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $200 million and increasing spend of approximately $515 million over the fourth quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the level of spend for the third quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and increase funding of projects which continue to advance to our pipeline. Allergan's consistent commitment to investment with our R&D process has proven to be a productive one in promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipeline. Excluding the effect of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's fourth quarter operating income ration increased by 260 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Continuing enhancements to gross margins and enhanced leverage within the SG&A category are the primary drivers of this improvement. These favorable results are reflective of the company's continued application of a disciplined and selective approach, centered on maximizing return while maintaining appropriate future focus investment levels. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 46 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 115 days. Excluding fourth quarter payments to the DOJ of approximately $594 million, Allergan generated operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $185 million in the quarter and $955 million for the full year of 2010. This compares to $1,018,000,000 generated for the same period in 2009.
At the end of the fourth quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.7 billion and $535 million, respectively Please recall that there is a potential that some of this cash balance may be utilized to retire of convertible debt which is quotable and callable in April of 2011.
For the first quarter 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,170,000,000 to $1,220,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73. Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates the product net sales in the range of $5,020,000,000 and $5,220,000,000. And our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.54 and $3.60, which represents growth of between 12% and 14%. As we have previously communicated, our 2011 expectations include approximately $100 million of pretax equivalent headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare reform and Europe pricing pressures. Given our substantial investment in R&D plan for 2011 as we continue to execute against our strategy to consistently reload our pipeline, as well as our ability to fully absorb the headwinds just mentioned, our strong expectations with respect to operating performance and earning growth rate for the year is really reflective of our resolute focus on execution and our very well-positioned business model. For your information, expectations for for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.
With respect to 2011 capital expenditures, we project CapEx of between $160 million and $180 million for the full year. Regarding 2011 cash flow, we expect to generate operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $900 million. We have assumed a moderate levels of share repurchase activity of approximately four million shares in 2011. With our repurchase objectives limited to only stock option-based compensation programs.
Our solid results during the fourth quarter and full year of 2010 is another testament to the value of the depth and breadth of Allergan's diversified lines of business. We will strive to continue to build on our momentum and effectively execute our business strategies, further strengthening Allergan as a leader in our selective specialty markets. We look forward to our new opportunities emerging for Allergan in 2011.

As I also stated and I really wanted to get that information out, somewhat differently than what we thought when we started, we were more concerned about getting reimbursement in place and then worrying about training. Secondly, I would now reverse that order in terms of reimbursement has gone really well with many of the leading plans that others look to adopting policy quite quickly. And now, as I stated in my opening remarks, it's all about getting hands-on training organized.

We like that idea of course, know the benefit of history, we did well, but we didn't become number one. And really, our weak point was hyperemia.hence, why this product is, what I think we hope, if you lie, first time around.

Clearly, U.S. market growth and procedures as well into the double digits, so very healthy situation so I think than coming back into the therapeutic side as we've always pointed out, therapeutic moves much slower. This is kind of a large ship moving because just the time it takes for training and so it's very clear there's a huge interest in the market, there is an unmet medical need and I've always indicated that the shape of the launch curve will be flatter one versus a very steep one just because of the time it takes to learn how to do it. And then incorporate BOTOX into a regular clinic on a regular basis. So I remain extremely excited about all aspects of BOTOX. Then on LAP-BAND, I think the way to think about a potential of FDA approval because, of course, they have a number of months to follow through on guidance and hopefully they normally do. So in round numbers, that is roughly half a year. And I think, again, the effect of an approval will be quite slow and I think if anything, it'll be very useful for us in our conversations with Managed Care not only to get coverage of greater than 30 body mass index with one, but especially to get better conditions for greater than 35 body mass index because, of course, where policies for that, yet we have even greater coverage from the FDA, that becomes a rather tough place to just put in in insurance blocks so I think that is the real benefit in the first couple of years of our dramatically larger eligible population."

And, Scott Whitcup and his team have done a fantastic job last year was just tremendous and, of course, you can hear from Scott's remarks we're kind of loading the cabin up again with lots of exciting things. Setting the other side of the divide, of course is then SG&A And we're doing our best always to control G&A spend on the right things. Clearly, this year, we're having to spend more in compliance which is in line with all of conference is in this industry. But given our new obligations, we really have to step it up in terms of spend beyond just attention. And then I made remarks about having built out some very substantial sales structures over the last 10 years in the developed countries and we are reaching a point where we can now not completely stop that, but the increases will be pretty marginal. And therefore, will be something of leverage and of course when we look at emerging markets to put it in context, of course, 100 reps in Eastern Europe or Asia don't cost 100 reps cost in Germany or the United States or Canada, right? So I would say things are good and you've seen also over the years we've had a very good track record on gross margin. Again, throughput through put through a very small number of plants really works. And we plan to make it go that way. So you should expect an upward trend. But if we go all the way to net, not in some huge steps, gradual."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Allergan is in a strong position as we enter 2011. With a record number of R&D approvals in 2010, both from FDA and regulatory agencies around the world coupled with a modest recovery of most major economies and the return of almost all of our cash pay markets to above prerecession levels, and finally, the worst of the impact to generics on our U.S. Ophthalmology business behind us, with all those factors we're looking ahead at several years of strong revenue growth.
Regarding our outlook for sales, as laid out in our press release, we're forecasting growth in a range of between 4% and 8%. Regarding earnings, we're looking to a range of 12% to 14% for non-GAAP EPS, even after we've absorbed approximately $100 million of incremental costs from U.S. healthcare reform and European price cuts and increased rebates. Especially looking at R&D, you will notice from our forecast that we have made the strategic decision to strongly increase our investment as we reload our pipeline with the goal of assuring Allergan's long-term growth objectives. However, it is also clear that we'll be leveraging SG&A spend, particularly in developed markets.
Now reviewing the results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Sales increased versus the fourth quarter of 2009 by 6.9% in dollars, reflecting some impact of the weak euro and by 7.4% in local currencies. For the full year, sales growth over 2009 was 8.4% in dollars and 7.5% in local currencies. Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $0.88, marking a 12.8% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2009 and at the top end of the expectations provided at the time of our last earnings call. 
Earnings were driven by strong sales growth, particularly outside the U.S. where we enjoyed mid-teens sales growth, with high teens or better sales growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada, and even double-digit growth in several European countries. Performance was boosted by gross margin expansion for both the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments. 
For the full year, diluted EPS of $3.16 increased 13.7% over 2009 after we increased R&D investment, and on a non-GAAP basis by 13%, this is R&D spend, to $662 million. In line with common practice with consumer brands, we were able to leverage direct-to-consumer spending for individual products in post-launch years. In 2010, we spent $171 million versus $185 million in 2009.
Before covering the performance of the businesses, I'd like to comment on our partnership with MAP Pharmaceuticals to co-promote LEVADEX in the United States. This product is a great fit with our portfolio, with LEVADEX being likely indicated for acute migraine and BOTOX approved for chronic migraine offering headache specialists with a continuum of care. Timing after the establishment of BOTOX for chronic migraine looks ideal and the partnership leverages our investment into our sales and marketing infrastructure. Allergan and MAP will be virtually the only companies actively marketing branded products in the headache market. 
Now looking at the products. Regarding BOTOX performance, growth in the fourth quarter versus prior year was 11.1% in dollars and 11.2% in local currencies, marking an acceleration versus full year sales growth of 8.4% in dollars and 7.1% in local currencies. For the full year, as stated in our press release, sales of BOTOX Cosmetic increased 11% over 2009, showing both economic recovery and our ability to sustain only a marginal loss to our high worldwide market share.
BOTOX therapeutic increased 6% over 2009, with BOTOX maintaining or even marginally gaining world share. Obviously, with the mid-October approval of BOTOX for chronic migraine in the U.S., there was only a small incremental contribution to sales in the fourth quarter. On a global basis, we estimate in Q3, the last period for which we have market data that BOTOX enjoyed 77% market share, down only two percentage points from Q3 of 2009. In the Aesthetic Market segment, Dysport procedure share in the U.S. seems to have stagnated at around 17% to 18% since April with of course value share being lower. In Europe, Merz and Galderma have made small market share gains with their launches of Bocouture and Azzalure. In the Therapeutic Market segment, Dysport and Xeomin have gained only marginal share in the U.S., even with sampling and Xeomin garnered little share in Canada.
Regarding chronic migraine, we are pleased to report that there is great physician interest in the headache community. Our sales force is fully deployed, with one group focused on movement disorders and the other on chronic migraine. We're commercializing a 200 unit vial and recommend purchase of this SKU for chronic migraine. We've made very strong progress securing coverage for BOTOX for chronic migraine in the critical area of commercial managed care formularies, as well as Medicare formularies. Typical policy at managed care organizations is to provide proof of failure on two prior medications, making the prior authorization process quite smooth. At this point, we're putting greater emphasis on hands-on training for physicians as this is now the greater rate limit step for sales build.
Moving on to Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 6.6% in dollars and 7.4% in local currencies over Q4 of '09. For the full year, growth was 7.7% in dollars and 7.0% in local currencies. Noteworthy was the strong LUMIGAN and GANFORT fourth quarter year-over-year performance, a 17.7% growth in local currencies. In the fourth quarter, there was a disparity in eye care performance with low growth in the U.S. offset by high international growth as we manage through the impact of the authorized generic of ALPHAGAN 0.15% and generics of ACULAR. Our data provider, SDI VONA, shows Allergan in the fourth quarter growing year-over-year in the U.S. 2.3% in a market growing very healthily at 14.2% in acquisition dollars. 
Outside the U.S., we enjoy double-digit growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia. In the U.S., we're very pleased that we're positioned for better growth in 2011. LUMIGAN 0.01% has started very strongly with NRx share the last week weekly update already at 24% of the overall LUMIGAN franchise after its launch just before the American Academy of Ophthalmology in October. As it has been the experience in Europe and Canada, ophthalmologists appreciate the comparable efficacy to the original LUMIGAN, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates. LUMIGAN 0.01% enjoys comparable managed care formulary status to the original LUMIGAN and we're well positioned prior to the arrival of Xalatan generics.
In market, RESTASIS in the fourth quarter grew strongly year-over-year in acquisition dollars of 14%. x factory sales growth worldwide was lower, growing only 7.1% due to an increase in channel inventory during the fourth quarter of 2009. COMBIGAN grew 35% in acquisition dollars, offsetting most of the decline in ALPHAGAN sales. Regarding generics, we're pleased that branded ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN continued to hold over 70% share of trailing prescriptions of all brimonidine-containing products. The impact of generics on the ACULAR and ACUVAIL franchise has unfortunately been substantial as we had little time to transition to our improved ACUVAIL product. For 2011, we're excited to launch LASTACAFT, a product with a strong anti-allergy profile and we're also benefiting for a permanent J-Code for OZURDEX.
Canada enjoyed a spectacular quarter due to strong performance of LUMIGAN and ALPHAGAN, where generic ALPHAGAN was on back order and also the launch of RESTASIS. Due to the strong uptake of LUMIGAN 0.01% and its reimbursement on all provincial formularies, we announced in Jan 1 that the original LUMIGAN product will be discontinued across Canada. In Europe, double-digit sales growth was driven by LUMIGAN 0.01%, GANFORT, our Artificial Tears line and strong uptake of OZURDEX, especially in Germany. Allergan is also benefiting from market share gains in both glaucoma and tears across the European Union.
Regarding facial aesthetics, we continued to enjoy strong growth. In the fourth quarter, sales year-over-year increased 22.6% in dollars and 23.3% in local currencies and for the full year 30.1% in dollars and 28.5% in local currencies. Allergan is growing strongly in every operating region in the world and based on our analysis is gaining share in every region, thanks to the introduction of innovative products. Market growth is being stimulated by the new lidocaine-containing products and the success of JUVÉDERM VOLUMA outside the U.S. where there is great interest in the use of fillers for volumizing, especially the mid-face area. We're locally permitted. We have also invested in JUVÉDERM direct-to-consumer advertising. 
Regarding skin care, sales decreased in the fourth quarter versus prior year by 9.8% in dollars and 9.9% in local currencies. Obviously, the major reason for the reduction is the decline in LATISSE sales year-over-year by 33%, which requires some explanation. Analyzing our x factory sales, both direct-to-physician and to wholesalers, it is clear with the benefit of post-hoc analysis that there was a stocking effect in Q4 2009 in doctor's offices. This accounts for about half of the decline. 
Another contributor to the sales decline is our heavy sampling campaigns in the fourth quarter. From early October to mid-December, we offered a $100 rebate in cash for LATISSE after receiving a BOTOX Cosmetic or JUVÉDERM treatment. The sampling campaigns were strategic as we know from our consumer market research, the patients have a high degree of loyalty once they have initiated use of the product LATISSE. We're quite encouraged by recent improvements in usage and aptitude surveys regarding perceptions, regarding safety of LATISSE and also intention to purchase.
On a positive note, LATISSE was the fourth largest medical aesthetics product in value in the U.S. and had an estimated half a million customers, even more than JUVÉDERM at the end of its second year of commercialization. In 2011, much management's attention is focused on the growth of LATISSE and also our hair growth pipeline. In Canada, LATISSE, which was recently launched, has enjoyed strong uptake and has garnered quickly wide distribution in physicians' offices. Regarding other products, principally medical dermatology, x factory sales increased 5%. This understates fourth quarter year-over-year acquisition dollar growth reported by SDI VONA of 39% for ACZONE and 17% for TAZORAC. For breast aesthetics, Q4 sales increased year-over-year 8.9% in dollars and 10.3% in local currency, broadly in line with growth for the full year of 11.0% in dollars and 11.1% in local currencies. In the U.S., we continue to see a gradual pickup in the mix towards silicone gel implants. 
For the first three quarters of 2010, the last period for which we have market data available, we believe that we have gained some worldwide market share. We're pleased with our performance in Korea and Australia where we have taken over direct selling operations. Regarding last week's advisory from the U.S. FDA, regarding the extremely rare occurrence of anaplastic large-cell lymphomas in breast implant patients, we're gauging customer reaction carefully. We're knowledgeable about all occurrences reported worldwide, both in Allergan implants, as well as those of competitors. In early 2010, as some reports occurred, we already assembled a panel of the most preeminent experts in rare cancers and epidemiology, presenting them with all the facts that were available as patient health and safety are always our highest priority. Our intention is to publish the findings in an appropriate medical journal. At this stage, we do not expect a major impact on our sales in 2011, which is reflected in our outlook for worldwide sales. 
Regarding the obesity intervention product line, sales in the fourth quarter year-over-year declined 9.9% in dollars and 9.8% in local currencies. For the full year versus 2009, sales declined 5.8% in dollars and 7.0% in local currencies. In the U.S., we continue to suffer from the apparent correlation of this market with high unemployment rates. We estimate that the Cash Pay segment of the market declined 26% in 2010 to about 10% of the overall market, whereas the reimbursed market for all bariatric procedures declined 3%. Within this reimbursed market, the band market declined 4% and stapling procedures declined 3% as sleeve gastrectomy grew on a small base. Regarding LAP-BAND share within the band market, we're now entering a time frame where our share year-over-year is stable. 
In Q4, we estimate our share at 73%. Outside the U.S., Australia had a particular poor Q4, which we ascribe to economic conditions and consumer credit conditions as we do not believe that we lost market share. In Europe, Latin America and Canada, we continued to enjoy modest growth. For 2011, we look forward to receiving FDA approval for the lower body mass index indication, improving managed care access, disseminating exciting health economics data on LAP-BAND.
Commenting urology, Q4 sales decreased 7.1% in dollars as we absorbed the impact of generics with original SANCTURA product and no longer have growth in the GP channel after termination of the co-promotion agreement with NovaQuest. SANCTURA XR, our latest generation product, however, continues to grow strongly. Q4 acquisition dollar growth was 21%. We remain excited about the strength of our emerging urology pipeline, led by BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity, which was filed with the FDA, as well as EMEA and Health Canada in Q4. 
Finally, you may have seen from our 8-K this morning announcing the retirement of our two longest-serving directors, Gavin Herbert and Leonard Schaeffer. Gavin Herbert is our company founder. He has served Allergan's board for 60 years, building the company in giant steps in his more than 30 years as CEO. Leonard Schaeffer has served the board with excellence since 1993. I wish to thank them both for their high standards, their wise counsel and making available their profound knowledge of the healthcare industry. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will provide detailed comments on our financials."
249205,118084009,98277,"Allergan Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong sales, operating results as we are again able to over achieve our sales expectations despite headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare r",1095,"Thank you, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong sales, operating results as we are again able to over achieve our sales expectations despite headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare reform, Europe pricing pressures, and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15 and ACULAR brands. Allergan's diversified base of business and thoughtful directed approach to reinvest back into the business enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results at the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.88, marking a 12.8% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. Excluding the effects of the R&D tax credit catch-up, non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter approximated 8%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter EPS for 2010 was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit caused by the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2010. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. 
For the full year of 2010, Allergan delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.16 despite the various friction points described above and continuing competition in the neuromodulator market. The strong full year result was above the high end of our initial range of expectations provided in February 2010 of $3.09 to $3.15. Our strong commitment to the long-term future of our company and to our shareholders is evident in this result as we're able to both invest strongly into the growth drivers of the business and pass stronger earnings performance on to our shareholders in the form of greater EPS performance. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q4 2010 gross margin of 85.8% increased 110 basis points when compared to Q4 2009 and Allergan once again saw a sequential quarterly improvement in both its Pharmaceutical and Medical Device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard cost with the very substantial contribution coming from our breast product line, given our changeover to lower cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica, favorable volume-based manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions and lower royalty expense. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the fourth quarter was 40% totaling $517 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2009 were 41.7% and $503 million, respectively. We are recognizing the benefits of leveraging many of our businesses while continuing to have the latitude to make meaningful investments and investments which are focused on projects that we believe will yield the greatest financial returns. You can expect this approach and method to continue during 2011 and we should continue to make progress towards further leveraging this ratio.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.5% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $200 million, an increase in spend of approximately $15 million over the fourth quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the level of spends of the third quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and increase funding of projects, which continue to advance for our pipeline. Allergan's consistent commitment to investment with our R&D process has proven to be a productive one and has resulted in promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipelines. 
Excluding the effect of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's fourth quarter operating income ratio increased by 260 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Continuing enhancements to gross margins and enhanced leverage within the SG&A category are the primary drivers of this improvement. These favorable results are reflective of the company's continued application of a disciplined and selective approach centered on maximizing return, while maintaining appropriate future focused investment levels. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 46 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 115 days. Excluding fourth quarter payments to the DOJ of approximately $594 million, Allergan generated operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $185 million in the quarter and $955 million for the full year of 2010. This compares to $1,018,000,000 generated for the same period in 2009.
At the end of the fourth quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.7 billion and $535 million, respectively. Please recall that there is a potential that some of this cash balance may be utilized to retire our existing convertible debt, which is puttable and callable on April of 2011.
For the first quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,170,000,000 to $1,220,000,000, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73. Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,020,000,000 and $5,220,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.54 and $3.60, which represents growth of between 12% and 14%. 
As we have previously communicated, our 2011 expectations include approximately $100 million of pretax equivalent headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare reform and Europe pricing pressures. Given our substantial investment in R&D plan for 2011 as we continue to execute against our strategy to consistently reload our pipeline, as well as our ability to fully absorb the headwinds just mentioned, our strong expectations with respect to operating performance and earnings growth rate for the year is really reflective of our resolute focus on execution and our very well-positioned business model. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.
With respect to 2011 capital expenditures, we project CapEx of between $160 million and $180 million for the full year. Regarding 2011 cash flow, we expect to generate operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $900 million. We have assumed moderate levels of share repurchase activity of approximately 4 million shares in 2011, with our repurchase objectives limited to only match expected employee stock option-based compensation programs.
Our solid results during the fourth quarter and full year of 2010 is another testament to the value of the depth and breadth of Allergan's diversified lines of business. We will strive to continue to build on our momentum and effectively execute our business strategies, further strengthening Allergan as a leader in our selected specialty markets. We look forward to our new opportunities emerging for Allergan in 2011.

To give you a sense, we wish to double the number of injectors this year based off the baseline. Another really key fact is, and this has been reported in some of the surveys that naturally pre-approval use was basically paid for out-of-pocket in the main. And so actual use was much closer to about 100 units per patient in practice.

BOTOX continues to be a big investment, so we've got big Phase III urology trial still in progress with idiopathic overactive bladder and our targeted toxin did well through Phase I and is into Phase II in two indications, one, for overactive bladder and two, for postherpetic neuralgia.

So the first will be in the European Congress in Vienna, you'll see the first Phase III data and then the American Conference later, you'll see the second Phase III, I believe that's in Washington. Idiopathic data probably rolls out next year, so our new entrée with BOTOX into urology will rollout with the data this year and next year. And then the targeted toxin probably will be next year. If the targeted toxin shows good efficacy and safety, not only is that a major product for pain, but it opens up a platform for discovery because we can target other diseases with the targeted toxin. So I'd say, those are the big ones and then end of next year, of course, everyone, especially us. Men with less hair or women with thinning hair, those programs are fully resourced, but hair growth unfortunately is a little bit slow, so you have to wait and that will be probably end of next year that we'll get a readout, end of this year, early next year before we start getting a readout on hair growth."

As I also stated, and I really wanted to get that information out, somewhat differently than what we thought when we started, we were more concerned about getting reimbursement in place and then worrying about training secondly. I would now reverse that order in terms of reimbursement has gone really well with many of the leading plans that others look to adopting policy quite quickly.

This is clearly LUMIGAN combined in one drop with timolol. And then coming to LUMIGAN 0.01, you could probably hear from my remarks, we're really excited about that product. It has a really differentiated clinical profile. The way I've kind of thought about it more and more is stepping back almost 10 years ago when we launched the original LUMIGAN, some of the Allergan enthusiasts thought that we were going to kind of move out Xalatan and become rapidly the world market leader. We like that idea. Of course, now with the benefit of history, we did well but we didn't become number one. And really our weak point was hyperemia, and hence why this product I think is what we'd hope for, if you lie, first time around. And with this differentiated profile, we're in a very good spot and that's reflected already in managed care formulary positions for this year and we're already beginning to start conversations for formularies in 2012, and based on the commentaries we received, clearly there's no contracts yet signed. Things are going very well and hence why we feel rather confident that we will work our way through the arrival of latanoprost or Xalatan generics. On the other question, priority review, what should we say? No comment, yes."

I think the other factor, of course is, if you like, the benefits of all the new product flow coming on. Something you're clearly all trying to model is what is the shape of the launch curve for BOTOX for chronic migraine. And obviously, we internally have a view on that. Although we too are not, what I call, complete tooth fairies. We can't predict with complete accuracy, but the real point there is as all these products pass their first year of launch, this is where you should really see the power coming on.

You can see it from our press release where we stated year-over-year our sales were up 11%, and I thought somebody would ask me the question, so as you haven't yet, I'll answer my own. Clearly, U.S. market growth and procedures is well into the double digits, so very healthy situation. So I think then coming back on the therapeutic side, as we've always pointed out, therapeutic moves much slower. This is kind of a large ship moving because just with the time it takes for training and so it's very clear there's huge interest in the market, there's an unmet medical need, and I've always indicated that the shape of the launch curve will be flatter one versus a very steep one, just because of the time it takes to learn how to do it, and then they incorporate BOTOX into a regular clinic on a regular basis. So I remain extremely excited about all aspects of BOTOX. Then on LAP-BAND, I think the way to think about a potential FDA approval because, of course, they have a number of months to follow through on guidance and hopefully they normally do. So in round numbers, that is roughly half a year. And I think, again, the effect of an approval will be quite slow and I think, if anything, it will be very useful for us in our conversations with managed care not only to get coverage of greater than 30 body mass index with one comorbidity, but especially to get better conditions for greater than 35 body mass index because, of course, where policy is poor for that, yet we have even greater coverage from the FDA. That becomes a rather tough place to just put in insurance blocks. So I think that is the real benefit in the first couple of years of our dramatically larger eligible population."

In terms of, let's call it reimbursement, we have a separate group of people who assist with reimbursement. We also have a third-party that assists with reimbursement. And in fact, some of these physicians, of course, are used to using BOTOX in their institutions and thanks to movement disorders.

So first of all, clearly, with the timing where we assume full cycle for an OAB, any sales effect will be the very margin for the whole company. So that's clear. Of course, the second thing is we already have a sales force because of SANCTURA. So at the margin we'd I'm sure expand that, but this is something that even if you had a perfect radar in the sky, you would scarcely be able to find it or notice it, because it's so marginal. And of course, happily given the other things we did in the last few years in terms of co-operations, we have the partnership with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals for apaziquone, we have the partnership with Serenity for the nocturia product. So actually, Allergan already has one of the most interesting urology pipelines, including large pharma companies. So this is one of the next major things we're going to get done in the next, call it, three, four, five years."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Allergan is in a strong position as we enter 2011. With a record number of R&D approvals in 2010, both from FDA and regulatory agencies around the world coupled with a modest recovery of most major economies and the return of almost all of our cash pay markets to above prerecession levels, and finally, the worst of the impact to generics on our U.S. Ophthalmology business behind us, with all those factors we're looking ahead at several years of strong revenue growth.
Regarding our outlook for sales, as laid out in our press release, we're forecasting growth in a range of between 4% and 8%. Regarding earnings, we're looking to a range of 12% to 14% for non-GAAP EPS, even after we've absorbed approximately $100 million of incremental costs from U.S. healthcare reform and European price cuts and increased rebates. Especially looking at R&D, you will notice from our forecast that we have made the strategic decision to strongly increase our investment as we reload our pipeline with the goal of assuring Allergan's long-term growth objectives. However, it is also clear that we'll be leveraging SG&A spend, particularly in developed markets.
Now reviewing the results of the fourth quarter and the full year. Sales increased versus the fourth quarter of 2009 by 6.9% in dollars, reflecting some impact of the weak euro and by 7.4% in local currencies. For the full year, sales growth over 2009 was 8.4% in dollars and 7.5% in local currencies. Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $0.88, marking a 12.8% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2009 and at the top end of the expectations provided at the time of our last earnings call. 
Earnings were driven by strong sales growth, particularly outside the U.S. where we enjoyed mid-teens sales growth, with high teens or better sales growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada, and even double-digit growth in several European countries. Performance was boosted by gross margin expansion for both the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments. 
For the full year, diluted EPS of $3.16 increased 13.7% over 2009 after we increased R&D investment, and on a non-GAAP basis by 13%, this is R&D spend, to $662 million. In line with common practice with consumer brands, we were able to leverage direct-to-consumer spending for individual products in post-launch years. In 2010, we spent $171 million versus $185 million in 2009.
Before covering the performance of the businesses, I'd like to comment on our partnership with MAP Pharmaceuticals to co-promote LEVADEX in the United States. This product is a great fit with our portfolio, with LEVADEX being likely indicated for acute migraine and BOTOX approved for chronic migraine offering headache specialists with a continuum of care. Timing after the establishment of BOTOX for chronic migraine looks ideal and the partnership leverages our investment into our sales and marketing infrastructure. Allergan and MAP will be virtually the only companies actively marketing branded products in the headache market. 
Now looking at the products. Regarding BOTOX performance, growth in the fourth quarter versus prior year was 11.1% in dollars and 11.2% in local currencies, marking an acceleration versus full-year sales growth of 8.4% in dollars and 7.1% in local currencies. For the full year, as stated in our press release, sales of BOTOX Cosmetic increased 11% over 2009, showing both economic recovery and our ability to sustain only a marginal loss to our high worldwide market share.
BOTOX therapeutic increased 6% over 2009, with BOTOX maintaining or even marginally gaining world share. Obviously, with the mid-October approval of BOTOX for chronic migraine in the U.S., there was only a small incremental contribution to sales in the fourth quarter. On a global basis, we estimate in Q3, the last period for which we have market data, that BOTOX enjoyed 77% market share, down only two percentage points from Q3 of 2009. In the Aesthetic Market segment, Dysport procedure share in the U.S. seems to have stagnated at around 17% to 18% since April with of course value share being lower. In Europe, Merz and Galderma have made small market share gains with their launches of Bocouture and Azzalure. In the Therapeutic Market segment, Dysport and Xeomin have gained only marginal share in the U.S., even with sampling and Xeomin has garnered little share in Canada.
Regarding chronic migraine, we are pleased to report that there is great physician interest in the headache community. Our sales force is fully deployed, with one group focused on movement disorders and the other on chronic migraine. We're commercializing a 200-unit vial and recommend purchase of this SKU for chronic migraine. We've made very strong progress securing coverage for BOTOX for chronic migraine in the critical area of commercial managed care formularies, as well as Medicare formularies. Typical policy at managed care organizations is to provide proof of failure on two prior medications, making the prior authorization process quite smooth. At this point, we're putting greater emphasis on hands-on training for physicians as this is now the greater rate limit step for sales build.
Moving on to Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 6.6% in dollars and 7.4% in local currencies over Q4 of '09. For the full year, growth was 7.7% in dollars and 7.0% in local currencies. Noteworthy was the strong LUMIGAN and GANFORT fourth quarter year-over-year performance, a 17.7% growth in local currencies. In the fourth quarter, there was a disparity in eye care performance with low growth in the U.S. offset by high international growth as we manage through the impact of the authorized generic of ALPHAGAN 0.15% and generics of ACULAR. Our data provider, SDI VONA, shows Allergan in the fourth quarter growing year-over-year in the U.S. 2.3% in a market growing very healthily at 14.2% in acquisition dollars. 
Outside the U.S., we enjoy double-digit growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia. In the U.S., we're very pleased that we're positioned for better growth in 2011. LUMIGAN 0.01% has started very strongly with NRx share at the last week of data already at 24% of the overall LUMIGAN franchise after its launch just before the American Academy of Ophthalmology in October. As it has been the experience in Europe and Canada, ophthalmologists appreciate the comparable efficacy to the original LUMIGAN, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates. LUMIGAN 0.01% enjoys comparable managed care formulary status to the original LUMIGAN and we're well positioned prior to the arrival of Xalatan generics.
In market, RESTASIS in the fourth quarter grew strongly year-over-year in acquisition dollars at 14%. x factory sales growth worldwide was lower, growing only 7.1% due to an increase in channel inventory during the fourth quarter of 2009. COMBIGAN grew 35% in acquisition dollars, offsetting most of the decline in ALPHAGAN sales. Regarding generics, we're pleased that branded ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN continued to hold over 70% share of trailing prescriptions of all brimonidine-containing products. The impact of generics on the ACULAR and ACUVAIL franchise has unfortunately been substantial as we had little time to transition to our improved ACUVAIL product. For 2011, we're excited to launch LASTACAFT, a product with a strong anti-allergy profile and we're also benefiting from a permanent J-Code for OZURDEX.
Canada enjoyed a spectacular quarter due to strong performance of LUMIGAN and ALPHAGAN, where generic ALPHAGAN was on back order and also the launch of RESTASIS. Due to the strong uptake of LUMIGAN 0.01% and its reimbursement on all provincial formularies, we announced in Jan 1 that the original LUMIGAN product will be discontinued across Canada. In Europe, double-digit sales growth was driven by LUMIGAN 0.01%, GANFORT, our Artificial Tears line and strong uptake of OZURDEX, especially in Germany. Allergan is also benefiting from market share gains in both glaucoma and tears across the European Union.
Regarding facial aesthetics, we continued to enjoy strong growth. In the fourth quarter, sales year-over-year increased 22.6% in dollars and 23.3% in local currencies and for the full year 30.1% in dollars and 28.5% in local currencies. Allergan is growing strongly in every operating region in the world and based on our analysis is gaining share in every region, thanks to the introduction of innovative products. Market growth is being stimulated by the new lidocaine-containing products and the success of JUVÉDERM VOLUMA outside the U.S. where there is great interest in the use of fillers for volumizing, especially the mid-face area. Where locally permitted, we have also invested in JUVÉDERM direct-to-consumer advertising. 
Regarding skin care, sales decreased in the fourth quarter versus prior year by 9.8% in dollars and 9.9% in local currencies. Obviously, the major reason for the reduction is the decline in LATISSE sales year-over-year by 33%, which requires some explanation. Analyzing our x factory sales, both direct-to-physician and to wholesalers, it is clear with the benefit of post-hoc analysis that there was a stocking effect in Q4 2009 in doctor's offices. This accounts for about half of the decline. 
Another contributor to the sales decline is our heavy sampling campaigns in the fourth quarter. From early October to mid-December, we offered a $100 rebate in cash for LATISSE after receiving a BOTOX Cosmetic or JUVÉDERM treatment. The sampling campaigns were strategic as we know from our consumer market research, the patients have a high degree of loyalty once they have initiated use of the product LATISSE. We're quite encouraged by recent improvements in usage and aptitude surveys regarding perceptions, regarding safety of LATISSE and also intention to purchase.
On a positive note, LATISSE was the fourth largest medical aesthetics product in value in the U.S. and had an estimated half a million customers, even more than JUVÉDERM at the end of its second year of commercialization. In 2011, much management attention is focused on the growth of LATISSE and also our hair growth pipeline. In Canada, LATISSE, which was recently launched, has enjoyed strong uptake and has garnered quickly wide distribution in physicians' offices. Regarding other products, principally medical dermatology, x factory sales increased 5%. This understates fourth quarter year-over-year acquisition dollar growth reported by SDI VONA of 39% for ACZONE and 17% for TAZORAC. For breast aesthetics, Q4 sales increased year-over-year 8.9% in dollars and 10.3% in local currency, broadly in line with growth for the full year of 11.0% in dollars and 11.1% in local currencies. In the U.S., we continue to see a gradual pickup in the mix towards silicone gel implants. 
For the first three quarters of 2010, the last period for which we have market data available, we believe that we have gained some worldwide market share. We're pleased with our performance in Korea and Australia where we have taken over direct selling operations. Regarding last week's advisory from the U.S. FDA, regarding the extremely rare occurrence of anaplastic large-cell lymphomas in breast implant patients, we're gauging customer reaction carefully. We're knowledgeable about all occurrences reported worldwide, both in Allergan implants, as well as those of competitors. In early 2010, as some reports occurred, we already assembled a panel of the most preeminent experts in rare cancers and epidemiology, presenting them with all the facts that were available as patient health and safety are always our highest priority. Our intention is to publish the findings in an appropriate medical journal. At this stage, we do not expect a major impact on our sales in 2011, which is reflected in our outlook for worldwide sales. 
Regarding the obesity intervention product line, sales in the fourth quarter year-over-year declined 9.9% in dollars and 9.8% in local currencies. For the full year versus 2009, sales declined 5.8% in dollars and 7.0% in local currencies. In the U.S., we continue to suffer from the apparent correlation of this market with high unemployment rates. We estimate that the Cash Pay segment of the market declined 26% in 2010 to about 10% of the overall market, whereas the reimbursed market for all bariatric procedures declined 3%. Within this reimbursed market, the band market declined 4% and stapling procedures declined 3% as sleeve gastrectomy grew on a small base. Regarding LAP-BAND share within the band market, we're now entering a time frame where our share year-over-year is stable. 
In Q4, we estimate our share at 73%. Outside the U.S., Australia had a particular poor Q4, which we ascribe to economic conditions and consumer credit conditions as we do not believe that we lost market share. In Europe, Latin America and Canada, we continued to enjoy modest growth. For 2011, we look forward to receiving FDA approval for the lower body mass index indication, improving managed care access, disseminating exciting health economics data on LAP-BAND.
Commenting urology, Q4 sales decreased 7.1% in dollars as we absorbed the impact of generics with original SANCTURA product and no longer have growth in the GP channel after termination of the co-promotion agreement with NovaQuest. SANCTURA XR, our latest generation product, however, continues to grow strongly. Q4 acquisition dollar growth was 21%. We remain excited about the strength of our emerging urology pipeline, led by BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity, which was filed with the FDA, as well as EMEA and Health Canada in Q4. 
Finally, you may have seen from our 8-K of this morning announcing the retirement of our two longest-serving directors, Gavin Herbert and Leonard Schaeffer. Gavin Herbert was our company founder. He has served Allergan's board for 60 years, building the company in giant steps in his more than 30 years as CEO. Leonard Schaeffer has served the board with excellence since 1993. I wish to thank them both for their high standards, their wise counsel and making available their profound knowledge of the healthcare industry. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will provide detailed comments on our financials."
249205,118084009,98415,"Allergan Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong sales, operating results as we are again able to overachieve our sales expectations despite headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare re",1093,"Thank you, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong sales, operating results as we are again able to overachieve our sales expectations despite headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare reform, Europe pricing pressures, and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15 and ACULAR brands. Allergan's diversified base of business and thoughtful directed approach to reinvest back into the business enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results at the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.88, marking a 12.8% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. Excluding the effects of the R&D tax credit catch-up, non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter approximated 8%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter EPS for 2010 was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit caused by the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2010. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. 
For the full year of 2010, Allergan delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.16 despite the various friction points described above and continuing competition in the neuromodulator market. The strong full-year result was above the high end of our initial range of expectations provided in February 2010 of $3.09 to $3.15. Our strong commitment to the long-term future of our company and to our shareholders is evident in this result as we're able to both invest strongly into the growth drivers of the business and pass stronger earnings performance on to our shareholders in the form of greater EPS performance. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q4 2010 gross margin of 85.8% increased 110 basis points when compared to Q4 2009 and Allergan once again saw a sequential quarterly improvement in both its Pharmaceutical and Medical Device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard cost with the very substantial contribution coming from our breast product line, given our changeover to lower cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica, favorable volume-based manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions and lower royalty expense. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the fourth quarter was 40% totaling $517 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2009 were 41.7% and $503 million, respectively. We are recognizing the benefits of leveraging many of our businesses while continuing to have the latitude to make meaningful investments and investments which are focused on projects that we believe will yield the greatest financial returns. You can expect this approach and method to continue during 2011 and we should continue to make progress towards further leveraging this ratio.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.5% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $200 million, an increase in spend of approximately $15 million over the fourth quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the level of spends of the third quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and increase funding of projects, which continue to advance for our pipeline. Allergan's consistent commitment to investment within our R&D process has proven to be a productive one and has resulted in promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipelines. 
Excluding the effect of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's fourth quarter operating income ratio increased by 260 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Continuing enhancements to gross margins and enhanced leverage within the SG&A category are the primary drivers of this improvement. These favorable results are reflective of the company's continued application of a disciplined and selective approach centered on maximizing return, while maintaining appropriate future focused investment levels. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 46 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 115 days. Excluding fourth quarter payments to the DOJ of approximately $594 million, Allergan generated operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $185 million in the quarter and $955 million for the full year of 2010. This compares to $1,018,000,000 generated for the same period in 2009.
At the end of the fourth quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.7 billion and $535 million, respectively. Please recall that there is a potential that some of this cash balance may be utilized to retire our existing convertible debt, which is puttable and callable on April of 2011.
For the first quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,170,000,000 to $1,220,000,000, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73. Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,020,000,000 and $5,220,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.54 and $3.60, which represents growth of between 12% and 14%. 
As we have previously communicated, our 2011 expectations include approximately $100 million of pretax equivalent headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare reform and Europe pricing pressures. Given our substantial investment in R&D planned for 2011 as we continue to execute against our strategy to consistently reload our pipeline, as well as our ability to fully absorb the headwinds just mentioned, our strong expectations with respect to operating performance and earnings growth rate for the year is really reflective of our resolute focus on execution and our very well-positioned business model. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.
With respect to 2011 capital expenditures, we project CapEx of between $160 million and $180 million for the full year.

To give you a sense, we wish to double the number of injectors this year based off the baseline. Another really key fact is, and this has been reported in some of the surveys that naturally pre-approval use was basically paid for out-of-pocket in the main. And so actual use was much closer to about 100 units per patient in practice. Clearly, the label is 155 units and our goal is to get existing users of the product up to the labeled dose very quickly because that's where we have the clinical data set and that's what the label states."

BOTOX continues to be a big investment, so we've got big Phase III urology trial still in progress with idiopathic overactive bladder and our targeted toxin did well through Phase I and is into Phase II in two indications, one, for overactive bladder and two, for postherpetic neuralgia. And then the third measure is on the aesthetic side. So we've got a number of things both pharmacologically and on the device side and in aesthetics as well. So those are the major areas of focus."

So the first will be in the European Congress in Vienna, you'll see the first Phase III data and then the American Conference later, you'll see the second Phase III, I believe that's in Washington. Idiopathic data probably rolls out next year, so our new entrée with BOTOX into urology will roll out with the data this year and next year. And then the targeted toxin probably will be next year. If the targeted toxin shows good efficacy and safety, not only is that a major product for pain, but it opens up a platform for discovery because we can target other diseases with the targeted toxin. So I'd say, those are the big ones and then end of next year, of course, everyone, especially us. Men with less hair or women with thinning hair, those programs are fully resourced, but hair growth unfortunately is a little bit slow, so you have to wait and that will be probably end of next year that we'll get a readout, end of this year, early next year before we start getting a readout on hair growth."

I've given you the answer exactly. But let me come the other way. Clearly, within the neurology community, there are people who specialize in headaches or migraine, others say in epilepsy, it's the same as ophthalmology. There's people who do a little bit of everything and then there's sub-specialists. So the way we think about this is probably overall a neurology community of the order of 10,000 and down the road a subset of that may be half or 2/3 could become highly regular users of BOTOX. As I also stated, and I really wanted to get that information out, somewhat differently than what we thought when we started, we were more concerned about getting reimbursement in place and then worrying about training secondly. I would now reverse that order in terms of reimbursement has gone really well with many of the leading plans that others look to adopting policy quite quickly. And now, as I stated in my opening remarks, it's all about getting hands-on training organized. I think earlier, one of the other questioners asked about neurologists versus others, and I admitted inadvertently to answer the question, all our training is focused on neurologists.

It has a really differentiated clinical profile. The way I've kind of thought about it more and more is stepping back almost 10 years ago when we launched the original LUMIGAN, some of the Allergan enthusiasts thought that we were going to kind of move out Xalatan and become rapidly the world market leader. We like that idea. Of course, now with the benefit of history, we did well but we didn't become number one. And really our weak point was hyperemia, and hence why this product I think is what we'd hope for, if you like, first time around. And with this differentiated profile, we're in a very good spot and that's reflected already in managed care formulary positions for this year and we're already beginning to start conversations for formularies in 2012, and based on the commentaries we received, clearly there's no contracts yet signed. Things are going very well and hence why we feel rather confident that we will work our way through the arrival of latanoprost or Xalatan generics.

So I know you're not going to break out the sales by area and how much headache will be, but it implies that either the therapeutic area non-headache or the cosmetic do worse than they did this year and headache takes up some of the slack or that headache just doesn't show up. So can you address that and for LAP-BAND as well, why if you get the new guidelines would it be down year-over-year?"

Certainly, if I address -- first of all, let me go to the aesthetic side, the markets are performing quite nicely. You can see it from our press release where we stated year-over-year our sales were up 11%, and I thought somebody would ask me the question, so as you haven't yet, I'll answer my own. Clearly, U.S. market growth and procedures is well into the double digits, so very healthy situation. So I think then coming back on the therapeutic side, as we've always pointed out, therapeutic moves much slower. This is kind of a large ship moving because just with the time it takes for training and so it's very clear there's huge interest in the market, there's an unmet medical need, and I've always indicated that the shape of the launch curve will be flatter one versus a very steep one, just because of the time it takes to learn how to do it, and then they incorporate BOTOX into a regular clinic on a regular basis. So I remain extremely excited about all aspects of BOTOX. Then on LAP-BAND, I think the way to think about a potential FDA approval because, of course, they have a number of months to follow through on guidance and hopefully they normally do. So in round numbers, that is roughly half a year. And I think, again, the effect of an approval will be quite slow and I think, if anything, it will be very useful for us in our conversations with managed care not only to get coverage of greater than 30 body mass index with one comorbidity, but especially to get better conditions for greater than 35 body mass index because, of course, where policy is poor for that, yet we have even greater coverage from the FDA. That becomes a rather tough place to just put in insurance blocks. So I think that is the real benefit in the first couple of years of our dramatically larger eligible population."

The spirit is strong but sometimes action is weak. So we know that from really almost 20 years of experience across all of our different indications. In terms of, let's call it reimbursement, we have a separate group of people who assist with reimbursement. We also have a third-party that assists with reimbursement. And in fact, some of these physicians, of course, are used to using BOTOX in their institutions and thanks to movement disorders. So there is some experience of protocol, how to order, how to mix and so on. And in terms of dating, we haven't changed anything because for years we've had extended dating very well understanding that it takes time for managed care organizations actually to cut the checks and therefore, we need to try and broadly match that period so that we're not expecting the physicians to be funding, if you like, Allergan.

I think even further behind that because we got to build this large franchise in steps and blocks and not get ahead of ourselves, at some point then we have to think how do we access the top end of the general practitioners, and fortunately, there was accumulation there. So they are a subset of general practitioners that do a lot, which is a much better answer than many tens of thousands doing very little, which would be almost impossible for a company like Allergan to address.

Allergan is off to a strong start for 2011 with growth driven by a wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. Our cash pay markets appear to be in an upswing and",1983,"Great, thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
Allergan is off to a strong start for 2011 with growth driven by a wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. Our cash pay markets appear to be in an upswing and for our reimbursed pharmaceuticals, we have good initial sales contributions from the many products approved in 2010. Finally, sales are benefiting from the weak dollar versus almost global currencies. 
Reviewing results for the first quarter. Sales increased the first quarter of 2010 by 13.3% in dollars and by 12.2% in local currencies. Operating performance was strong with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77, marking an increase of 18.5% versus the first quarter of 2010 and well above expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call.  All of our operating regions, North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, enjoyed double-digit great sales growth in local currencies with Latin America growing 32% in U.S. dollars. 
Regarding regulatory approvals, we continued to make strong progress in many countries around the world. BOTOX for chronic migraine was approved in the quarter in Australian, Brazil, Chile and Hong Kong and Korea and is awaiting action at the European Medicines Agency. Several of those markets now wait government pricing approval regarding their public programs. 
OZURDEX received a positive opinion in the European Union for the additional indication of uveitis. OZURDEX was furher approved for various indication in Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Korea, Hong Kong and New Zealand. Other products approvals will be commented in my reports on the individual businesses. Additionally, we'll be taking our businesses direct in South Africa from July 1 of this year.
Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX enjoyed good growth in the first quarter, increasing 10.1% in dollars and 8.7% in local currencies versus prior year, with good growth stemming from both therapeutic and the business. In the U.S., we continued to make good progress with the launch of the chronic migraine indication. There is considerable position interest in the neurologic community and about 2,000 physicians have been trained since approval both through web-based and injection training. About 2/3 of commercial lines now have policy coverage for BOTOX, with the commercial market accounting for about 2/3 of migraine prescriptions. I would however wish to remind you that our experience for the last 20 years with BOTOX that adoption of therapeutic users of BOTOX is always a long cycle.
Assuming future FDA approval of LEVADEX, a product partnered with MAP Pharmaceuticals, it is clear that Allegan will be in a strong strategic position with the ideal combination of products for of chronic migraine on the one hand and medication on the other hand for migraine. Regarding our proven specificity in the U.S., we are now experiencing double-digit year-over-year growth in focused accounts in academic medical centers. In the U.S. therapeutic market, this have only gained marginal share even with some capture share in Canada. 
Regarding BOTOX Cosmetic, we are pleased that the U.S. market seems to be growing around the mid-teens in units. With a flattening of this procedure share of around 17%, we are poised for May onwards when we cross the anniversary of our market share loss last year to start fully enjoying the rewards of an expanding market, that is, prior to potential U.S. entry of Cosmetic. The European market, despite economic challenges, seems also a bit to be enjoying low double-digit growth. Market conditions in Latin America and Asia-Pacific are buoyant. Even with limited market loss in Europe with the entry of new neuromodulator competitors, we estimate that in Q4 that we enjoyed approximately worldwide 80% market share of the total neuromodulator market or 1% higher than in Q4 of 2009 despite the new competition.
Moving on to ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. Sales increased an encouraging 15.6% in dollars and 14.7% in local currencies, with double-digit performance in North America and Latin America and Asia-Pacific, with Europe, Africa Middle East growing in excess of 20%, thanks to the effect of direct selling operations in Turkey and Poland, a strong start to OZURDEX sales as well strong growth of LUMIGAN and our artificial tears line led by. OZURDEX was launched in Spain with reimbursement in April. The global ophthalmic market continues to grow briskly as also demonstrated by Alcon's report in their first quarter sales growth of 16% in constant currencies, double-digit performance to both glaucoma and artificial tears. We're pleased that Allergan U.S. has returned to growth, after having suffered the effects of citation of ALPHAGAN P 0.1% and also ACULAR. This does reflect the much improved growth of the ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN franchise of 5.8% in local currencies, with COMBIGAN growing strongly especially in the U.S. and ALPHAGAN being broadly flat around the world. 
The LUMIGAN and GANFORT franchise grew 18% to local currencies. Wherever launched outside the U.S., GANFORT is performing strongly against competitors. It is considered by many ophthalmologists as maximum medical therapy in one convenient drop. In the U.S., LUMIGAN 0.1% is enjoying rapid uptake especially by leaders and high prescribing glaucoma specialists, enjoying an NRx share in the latest week of 35% of overall LUMIGAN prescriptions.
In the 5 weeks since the launch of generic, we have observed 88% generics citation rate of latanoprost. Given excellent formulary coverage for both LUMIGAN 0.01% and original LUMIGAN, we've seen very little impact on the LUMIGAN franchise. Many ophthalmologists expressed concern about the quality of ophthalmic generics. As has been the early experience in Canada and Europe, U.S. ophthalmologists appreciate the comparable efficacy of LUMIGAN 0.1% to the original, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates. LUMIGAN 0.1% was launched during the quarter in Italy and Austria and in April in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Belgium. 
continues to strong rate, with 21% growth in dollars and local currencies. And with the generics citation of, it's about the largest single prescriptional ophthalmic pharmaceutical in the United States.
Regarding facial aesthetics, Q1 was a spectacular quarter with 48.5% growth in dollars and 47.0% in local currencies with extremely high-growth in every operating region. It would seem that the market is growing very strongly worldwide with more consumers entering the market, given the comfort of the latest generation of containing acid products and more syringes being used per face. At the leading medical conventions around the world, there are increasing numbers of papers and symposia on the use of thermal fillers, especially for volumizing which is addressed by JUVÉDERM VOLUMA where available. Additionally, we believe that Allergan is steadily gaining share given our innovative range of products across our facial portfolio and our distribution strength in almost all markets around the globe.
In the quarter, strong growth in the U.S. was posted by the selling to physician offices of a consumer-directed promotion combining purchases of BOTOX Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM. In Europe, we benefited not only from VOLUMA but also the launch of JUVÉDERM and JUVÉDERM Smile as well as advertising in the U.K. France and Germany. Of the margin, European region sales were boosted by new launches in the Middle East and the Balkans as well as direct selling in Poland. Additionally, JUVÉDERM XC and VOLUMA were launched in the Philippines.
Regarding skin care, sales enjoyed good growth at 16.0% in dollars and 15.8% in local currencies, sales enjoyed a rebound, growing 34% in dollars as well as in local currencies. Part of the strong performance is attributable to the sell-in of promotional offers to physicians as well as a bonus program for consumers that is in the U.S. Consumer research conducted at the end of last year pointed to the need, strong need to stimulate initial purchase as consumer satisfaction, having used the product, is high. Our investment in DTC with Claire Danes as spokesperson for LATISSE is producing strong brand awareness. Outside the U.S., we have experienced good uptake of LATISSE from Canada. In Brazil, we have only sampled the product in the quarter, pre full commercialization and the initiates with sales in April. In Mexico, the Ministry Of Health approved ETC. In Asia, LATISSE was launched in April in Hong Kong and Singapore. In the U.S., we were encouraged that the FDA recently addressed the first warning letter to a company commercializing a supposed product containing active pharmaceutical ingredient.
Regarding sales of other skin care products, ACZONE increased strongly with acquisition dollars to support sales reported by SDI VONA accelerating at 43%. ACZONE is today one of the principal acne products in the U.S. market. In Q1, we outlined some facts on pharmaceuticals in Canada, as we have many other priorities in the Canadian market and given our very strong presence in Canadian dermatology.
X Factor sales of TAZORAC declined in the quarter due to higher rebates and channel inventory change, but in-market sales and acquisition dollars increased double-digit. For breast aesthetics, Q1 sales increased 8.0% in dollars and 7.1% in local currencies, with particularly strong growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. In the U.S., we benefited from the continuing trend of the market to higher-priced silicon gel implants as well as good uptake from our range of tissue expanders with. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q1 sales decreased 14.9% in dollars and 16.0% in local currencies. Overall, bariatric procedures in the U.S. market, per our market research declined 12% in the first quarter year-over-year, with the reimbursed market declining less severely than the cash pay market, which now accounts for less than 6% of procedures, much of this attributable to unemployment rates.  In March, it appears that the market may have recovered after relief for January and February, but we're cautious of course regarding short-term data points. 
Within bariatrics, increased its share of the market from 6% to year ago to 15% in Q1, with share being taken almost equally from and bypass. In Q1, accounted for about 48% of the total market. And within the band category, LAP-BAND share increased by 5 basis points versus a year ago to about 73%. Overseas, we also had a very poor culture for LAP-BAND in our key Australian market. Sales of our balloons increased modestly overseas with strong gains in Brazil offset by a decline in strain, given the local weak economy. In the U.S., we continue to suffer from lack of access for patients of LAP-BAND, even if coverage in principle is available to members of commercial insured -- insurance funds. High co-pays and necessary to demonstrate failure and medically supervised exercise programs are real barriers, which we're addressing through our managed markets organization. 
We also intend to leverage our recent FDA approval for lower Body Mass Index with payers. Furthermore, we also announced the discontinuation of the Easy Band system required in the EndoArt acquisition in Switzerland and close our facility over there. Very high barriers established by the FDA for all bariatric devices since the time of the acquisition in 2007 had led to a considerable delay in timing of U.S. product approval, which of course accounted for a major part of global sales in our plan. That development, coupled with engineering challenges, contributed to a poor economic result and hence, the need for a tough decision to determine -- terminate this program. We remain committed to bring the product to market in the U.S.
Commenting neurology. Sales decreased 2.9% as we absorbed the impact in generics of our overall -- of our original SANCTURA product. In terms of acquisition dollars as reported by SDI for the first quarter, overall SANCTURA sales declined 5.4% given the impact of generics. On the original SANCTURA product, offset by strong gains for SANCTURA XR, which is slowly gaining market share in the neurology channel.  The next catalyst for the neurology business is the anticipated approval of BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity by the FDA later this year. 
I'll now pass it over to Jeff Edwards, who will provide comments on our financials."

The first quarter of 2011 represented a very nice start to the year for Allergan, despite previously discussed headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan was able to overachieve our sales and EPS expectations due to quality and line execution by strong, competitive positions in diversified business. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.77, marking an 18.5% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Allergan was able to deliver the strong first-line quarter earnings performance even as we continued to reinvest in the future growth drivers of the business across the commercial portfolio and our R&D pipeline. A reconciliation of all of these adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2011 gross margin of 85.4% increased 80 basis points when compared to Q1 2010, driven by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix and better net royalty dynamics. As we have previously communicated, we expect gross margins to be relatively constant throughout 2011.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.6% totaling $534 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010  were 42.3% and $468 million respectively. We continued to implement targeted investments to further support our future growth and support of the launch of many products approved in 2010. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.8% of product net sales for the quarter totaling $198 million, an increase in spend of approximately $18 million over the first quarter of 2010 and sequentially similar to the level of spend for the fourth quarter of 2010. We continued to fund new projects and increase funding of projects advancing through the pipeline. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days while consolidated Allergan inventories on hand was 119 days. In the first quarter, operating cash flow after capital expenditure was approximately $121 million. It is worth noting that the cash flow was affected by the $60 million up-front payment to MAP Pharmaceuticals related to our collaboration within the United States for the LEVADEX. At the end of our first quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments  and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.8 billion and $566 million, respectively. As a reminder, we have recently called our convertible note, which resulted in the use of approximately $750 million to $800 million of our cash in the second quarter of 2011.
For the second quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,310,000,000 to $1,360,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.95. Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates net sales in the range of $5,050,000,000 and $5,250,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $3.56 and $3.62, which represents growth of between 13% and 15%. 
As we have previously communicated, our 2011 expectations include approximately $100 million of pretax equivalent headwinds relating primarily to U.S. healthcare reform and pricing pressures. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

I don't think at this stage I want to tell you exactly what our end stage number is. But this is already a good stepping stone given that things take time. And I always refer to you back to the fact that the adoption cycle of therapeutics is always long-haul, and this is not new with migraine. It was that way years ago with the movement disorders whether it's cervical or it's where we have greater experience, specificity if I look to Europe in particular. So always long cycle and when we laid down these plans, we have very clear building blocks of what we wanted to do 6 months and 12 months and the end of year to end of year 3, end of year 4 and we're very much on that curve Of training."

When I came 30 years ago, we divested South Africa. At the time it didn't have critical mass. Now it does, and we're able to repurchase it for a fairly reasonable sum. So when I look at increases, I'm really looking at qualitative improvements. An area that we're spending more or more effort is medical affairs, so that we prepare for the launches of products that we expect out of the R&D pipeline and we will also continue to invest within DTC.

But say, 3, 4, 5 years post-launch, how big were those geographies? So I certainly agree with you, the opportunity x U.S. is also substantial. Clearly when you think about the list of countries I mentioned where we've got approval during the quarter, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong and Korea, that's all great. Now of course the next thing I did try to point out is from approval date to reimbursement date is a difference. as you think of sales in Australia with PVS system depends on certainly when the book, so to speak, is done. But it can be anywhere between 6 to 12 months, depending on just where you fall into the cycle. Obviously the country that we continue to pursue in with this is Canada. And there are too you see from approval to effective provincial formulary coverage can be anywhere from 3 months to 2 years. the other big ones that we're waiting for is Europe. U.K. is the only one so far, and I kind of made a comment awaiting European Medicines Agency. But again, word of caution. Once we get the approval, which we hope we will, then there's a delay effect until you actually have coverage in practice. And then further complicating things of course, every country has different delivery of healthcare systems. so the U.K. has a very restricted system, very slow based on referral to a very limited number of specialty headache centers. Obviously we're selling and marketing to those. And other countries like Germany are much broader based. so luckily, we've been in these markets for a very long time. So it's not all new news to us. I'm sure thing there will be the odd thing, like all products, will surprise us. But we're, I think, in good preparation to address these opportunities. Brazil, if I go to Latin America, clearly there's going to be a lot about private insurance market because in practice, most of those markets are paid out of pocket and then the drug clearly and the treatment is expensive."

Typically, it would be to obtain, it could be one of the antiepileptics used off-label, So there's very clear a migration of other things before people would go to this. I think what's very interesting when I went to the American Academy of Neurology to hear what were the physicians talking about in practice. And of course, not everybody is an immediate responder. Some people take longer, sometimes even 2 or 3 injection cycles. So I think this is really what I call learning in practice, when you actually have a product on the market and physicians are capable of telling you what is their real life experience, their real life patient feedback from thousands of patients. So I think things are going fine. In terms of awareness, I would say clearly post-launch, we had hundreds of million of media impressions by the press. But of course, people have short memories and need to be reminded, and so we're working very strongly to make sure that the plans understand all the details. There is patient advocacy groups are also well informed about what it is. And clearly, we're very anxious to point out the differences in those between cosmetic indication and this. And then we're just going to work our way downstream until we feel we've got everything in place when would be the appropriate time to actually go to the consumer direct."

The number I remember is typically $2,000 is kind of like a good rule of thumb. So you keep people out of the emergency room apart from making their lives better. That's a great thing. I think managed care has been actually quite unconcerned about this because of the blocks they've put in, the very appropriate ones of demonstration of failure on other medications. And so they don't really see a tidal wave of costs coming to their direction, and hence, why I think we've done very well not just because of good management work but getting to 2/3 coverage of commercial lives this quickly in a mere, let's call it 6 months since approval, is pretty good.

Now of course, one of the things you've got to be careful of is the outpost versus comparison. Because when we add Turkey and Poland, those are markets that we were present but were represented through our distributor partners. And so day 1 when we bring those people on, we had a lot if headcount and that we also add a differential in the number of people. If we look at 2010, roughly 15% of our worldwide sales were in emerging markets. And clearly in the next 5 years or so, this could go as high as maybe 25% or 30%. What I think is really great for Allergan though in contrast to not, we're trying to throw stones at others. some of the big companies that are start for growth in the U.S. or Western Europe, we have really good growth in those markets because of the states of our markets and the state of our vitality, [ph] if you like, of our newness product approvals. And so I disregard emerging markets as yet another great booster engine on what we're trying to do. Also I should say on headcount add, very clearly adding in R&D because I would say somewhat directly, Scott Whitcup can't spend money in R&D, in my humble view, with our people because we don't just go to CROs bluntly.

Allergan is off to a strong start for 2011, with growth driven by a wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. Our cash pay markets appear to be in an upswing. An",2034,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
Allergan is off to a strong start for 2011, with growth driven by a wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. Our cash pay markets appear to be in an upswing. And for our reimbursed pharmaceuticals, we have good initial sales contributions from the many products approved in 2010. Finally, sales are benefiting from the weak dollar versus almost all global currencies. 
Reviewing the results for the first quarter. Sales increased versus the first quarter of 2010 by 13.3% in dollars and by 12.2% in local currencies. Operating performance was strong with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77, marking an increase of 18.5% versus the first quarter of 2010 and well above expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call.  All of our operating regions, North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, enjoyed double-digit great sales growth in local currencies, with Latin America growing 32% in U.S. dollars. 
Regarding regulatory approvals, we continued to make strong progress in many countries around the world. BOTOX for chronic migraine was approved during the quarter in Australian, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong and Korea and is awaiting action at the European Medicines Agency. Several of those markets now wait government pricing approval regarding their public programs. 
OZURDEX received a positive opinion in the European Union for the additional indication of uveitis. OZURDEX was further approved for various indications in Switzerland, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Korea, Hong Kong and New Zealand. Other products approvals will be commented in my reports on the individual businesses. Additionally, we'll be taking our businesses direct in South Africa from July 1 of this year.
Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX enjoyed good growth in the first quarter, increasing 10.1% in dollars and 8.7% in local currencies versus prior year, with good growth stemming from both the therapeutic and aesthetic businesses. In the U.S., we continued to make good progress with the launch of the chronic migraine indication. There was considerable physician interest in the neurology community and about 2,000 physicians have been trained since approval, both through web-based and live injection training. About 2/3 of commercial lines now have policy coverage for BOTOX, with the commercial market accounting for about 2/3 of migraine prescriptions. I would, however, wish to remind you that our experience for the last 20 years with BOTOX and the adoption of therapeutic uses of BOTOX is always a long cycle.
Assuming future FDA approval of LEVADEX, the product partnered with MAP Pharmaceuticals, it is clear that Allegan will be in a strong strategic position with the ideal combination of products with prophylaxis of chronic migraine on the one hand and an abortive medication on the other hand for migraine. Regarding upper limb spasticity in the U.S., we are now experiencing double-digit year-over-year growth in focused accounts in academic medical centers. In the U.S. therapeutic market, Dysport and Xeomin have only gained marginal share even with sampling and Xeomin has captured little share in Canada. 
Regarding BOTOX Cosmetic, we are pleased that the U.S. market seems to be growing around the mid-teens in units. With the flattening of Dysport procedure share at around 17%, we are poised from April and May onwards, when we cross the anniversary of our market share loss last year, to start fully enjoying the rewards of an expanding market, that is, prior to the potential U.S. entry of Xeomin cosmetic. The European market, despite economic challenges, seems also a bit to be enjoying low double-digit growth. Market conditions in Latin America and Asia Pacific are buoyant. Even with limited market share loss in Europe with the entry of new neuromodulator competitors, we estimate that in Q4, that we enjoyed approximately worldwide 80% market share of the total neuromodulator market and 1% higher than in Q4 of 2009 despite the new competition.
Moving on to Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased an encouraging 15.6% in dollars and 14.7% in local currencies, with double-digit performance in North America and Latin America and Asia Pacific, with Europe, Africa and Middle East growing and excess of 20%, thanks to the effect of direct selling operations in Turkey and Poland, a strong start to OZURDEX sales, as well as strong growth of LUMIGAN, GANFORT and our Artificial Tears line led by Optive. OZURDEX was launched in Spain with reimbursement in April. The global ophthalmic market continues to grow briskly, as also demonstrated by Alcon's report in their first quarter sales growth of 16% in constant currencies, double-digit performance to both glaucoma and artificial tears. We're pleased that Allergan U.S. has returned to growth after having suffered the effects of genericization of ALPHAGAN P 0.15% and also ACULAR. This is reflected in much improved growth of the ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN franchise of 5.8% in local currencies, with COMBIGAN growing strongly, especially in the U.S., and ALPHAGAN being broadly flat around the world. 
The LUMIGAN and GANFORT franchise grew 18% to local currencies. Wherever launched outside the U.S., GANFORT is performing strongly against [indiscernible] competitors. It is considered by many ophthalmologists as maximum medical therapy in one convenient drop. In the U.S., LUMIGAN 0.1% is enjoying rapid uptake, especially by thought leaders and high-prescribing glaucoma specialists, enjoying an NRx share in the latest week of 35% of overall LUMIGAN prescriptions.
In the 5 weeks since the launch of generic Xalatan, we have observed an 88% genericization rate of latanoprost. Given the excellent formulary coverage for both LUMIGAN 0.01% and original LUMIGAN, we've seen very little impact on the LUMIGAN franchise. Many ophthalmologists expressed concern about the quality of ophthalmic generics. As has been the early experience in Canada and Europe, U.S. ophthalmologists appreciate the comparable efficacy of LUMIGAN 0.1% to the original, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates. LUMIGAN 0.1% was launched during the quarter in Italy and Austria and in April in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Belgium. 
RESTASIS continues to expand with strong rate, with 21% growth in dollars and local currencies. And with the genericization of Xalatan, it's about to become the largest single-prescription ophthalmic pharmaceutical in the United States.
Regarding facial aesthetics, Q1 was a spectacular quarter with 48.5% growth in dollars and 47.0% in local currencies with extremely high growth in every operating region. It would seem that the dermal filler market is growing very strongly worldwide with more consumers entering the market given the comfort of the latest generation of lidocaine-containing hyaluronic acid products and more syringes being used per face. At the leading medical conventions around the world, there are increasing numbers of papers and symposia on the use of dermal fillers, especially for volumizing, which is addressed by JUVÉDERM VOLUMA where available. Additionally, we believe that Allergan is steadily gaining share given our innovative range of products across our facial portfolio and our distribution strength in almost all markets around the globe.
In the quarter, strong growth in the U.S. was posted by the selling to physician offices of a consumer-directed promotion, combining purchases of BOTOX Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM. In Europe, we benefited not only from VOLUMA, but also the launches of JUVÉDERM Hydrate and JUVÉDERM Smile, as well as DTC advertising in the U.K., France and Germany. Of the margin, European region sales were boosted by new launches in the Middle East and the Balkans [ph], as well as direct selling in Turkey and Poland. Additionally, JUVÉDERM XC and VOLUMA were launched in the Philippines.
Regarding skin care, sales enjoy good growth at 16.0% in dollars and 15.8% in local currencies. LATISSE sales enjoyed a rebound, growing 34% in dollars, as well as in local currencies. Part of the strong performance is attributable to the sell-in of promotional offers to physicians, as well as a bonus program for consumers that is in the U.S. Consumer research conducted at the end of last year pointed to the need, strong need, to stimulate initial purchase as consumer satisfaction, having used the product, is high. Our investment in DTC with Claire Danes as spokesperson for LATISSE is producing strong brand awareness. Outside the U.S., we have experienced good uptake of LATISSE in Canada. In Brazil, we have only sampled the product in the quarter, pre-full commercialization and initiate it's sales in April. In Mexico, the Ministry Of Health approved DTC. In Asia, LATISSE was launched in April in Hong Kong and Singapore. In the U.S., we were encouraged that the FDA recently addressed the first warning letter to a company commercializing a supposed lash growth product containing active pharmaceutical ingredient.
Regarding sales of other skin care products, ACZONE increased strongly with acquisition dollars to support sales reported by SDI VONA accelerating at 43%. ACZONE is today one of the principal acne products in the U.S. market. In Q1, we outlined some facts on the Valeant Pharmaceuticals in Canada, as we have many other priorities in the Canadian market and given Valeant's strong presence in Canadian dermatology.
x Factor sales of TAZORAC declined in the quarter due to higher rebates and channel inventory change, but in-market sales and acquisition dollars increased double-digit. For breast aesthetics, Q1 sales increased 8.0% in dollars and 7.1% in local currencies, with particularly strong growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. In the U.S., we benefited from the continuing trend of the market to higher-priced silicon gel implants, as well as good uptake for our latest range of tissue expanders [indiscernible]. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q1 sales decreased 14.9% in dollars and 16.0% in local currencies. Overall, bariatric procedures in the U.S. market per our market research declined 12% in the first quarter year-over-year, with the reimbursed market declining less severely than the cash pay market, which now accounts for less than 6% of procedures, much of this attributable to unemployment rates.  In March, it appears that the market may have recovered after relief for January and February, but we're cautious of course regarding short-term data points. 
Within bariatrics, sleeve gastrectomy increased its share of the market from 6% a year ago to 15% in Q1, with share being taken almost equally from bands and bypass. In Q1, bands accounted for about 48% of the total market. And within the band category, LAP-BAND share increased by 5 basis points versus a year ago to about 73%. Overseas, we also had a very poor culture for LAP-BAND in our key Australian market. Sales of our ORBERA Balloons increased modestly overseas, with strong gains in Brazil offset by a decline in strain given the local weak economy. In the U.S., we continue to suffer from lack of access for patients to LAP-BAND even if coverage in principle is available to members of commercial insurance funds. High co-pays and necessity to demonstrate failure and medically supervised exercise programs are real barriers, which we're addressing through our managed markets organization. 
We also intend to leverage our recent FDA approval for lower body mass index with payers. Furthermore, we also announced the discontinuation of the Easy Band system required in the EndoArt acquisition in Switzerland and close our facility over there. Very high barriers established by the FDA for all new bariatric devices since the time of the acquisition in 2007. [indiscernible] had led to a considerable delay in timing of U.S. product approval, which of course accounted for a major part of global sales in our plan. That development, coupled with engineering challenges, contributed to a poor economic result and hence, the need for a tough decision to terminate this program. We, however, remain committed to bring the ORBERA product to market in the U.S.
Commenting urology. Sales decreased 2.9% as we absorbed the impact in generics of our overall -- of our original SANCTURA product. In terms of acquisition dollars as reported by SDI for the first quarter, overall SANCTURA sales declined 5.4% given the impact of generics on the original SANCTURA product, offset by strong gains for SANCTURA XR, which is slowly gaining market share in the urology channel.  The next catalyst for the urology business is the anticipated approval of BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity by the FDA later this year. 
I'll now pass it over to Jeff Edwards, who will provide comments on our financials."

The first quarter of 2011 represented a very nice start to the year for Allergan despite previously discussed headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan was able to overachieve our sales and EPS expectations due to quality and line execution by strong, competitive positions in diversified business. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.77, marking an 18.5% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Allergan was able to deliver the strong first-line quarter earnings performance even as we continued to reinvest into the future growth drivers of the business across the commercial portfolio and our R&D pipeline. A reconciliation of all of these adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2011 gross margin of 85.4% increased 80 basis points when compared to Q1 2010, driven by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix and better net royalty dynamics. As we have previously communicated, we expect gross margins to be relatively constant throughout 2011.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.6%, totaling $534 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 42.3% and $468 million, respectively. We continued to implement targeted investments to further support our future growth and support the launch of many products approved in 2010. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.8% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $198 million, an increase in spend of approximately $18 million over the first quarter of 2010 and sequentially similar to the level of spend for the fourth quarter of 2010. We continued to fund new projects and increase funding of projects advancing through the pipeline. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 119 days. In the first quarter, operating cash flow after capital expenditure was approximately $121 million. It is worth noting that the cash flow was affected by the $60 million up-front payment to MAP Pharmaceuticals relating to our collaboration within the United States for the LEVADEX. At the end of our first quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.8 billion and $566 million, respectively. As a reminder, we have recently called our convertible note, which resulted in the use of approximately $750 million to $800 million of our cash in the second quarter of 2011.
For the second quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,310,000,000 to $1,360,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.95. Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates net sales in the range of $5,050,000,000 and $5,250,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $3.56 and $3.62, which represents growth of between 13% and 15%. 
As we have previously communicated, our 2011 expectations include approximately $100 million of pretax equivalent headwinds relating primarily to U.S. healthcare reform and pricing pressures. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

And clearly, getting the lower BMI is another tool to putting greater pressure for access at the level of managed care plans.

Now that we not only have our BOTOX platforms, thanks Sherell [ph], we have Serenity. We have our collaboration Apaziquone with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.

And so that is the case in neurology and of course it could be applied to [indiscernible] as well. Whether it's how do you inject something better or indeed, I think there is some interesting developments even in ophthalmology in terms of medical device. Although clearly, we don't want to be in mainline things like interocular lenses so we've been there, done that, and are very happy about what we did almost 10 years ago."

Clearly, we spent a lot of time on that because we look at analogs from all the other migraine medications to get an indication of what was their experience in terms of what percentage of their overall sales once the products were up and running, because of course short-term, you got to be careful. But you'd say 3 or 4, 5 years post-launch, how big were those geographies? So I certainly agree with you, the opportunity x U.S. is also substantial. Clearly, when you think about the list of countries I mentioned, where we've got approval during the quarter, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong and Korea, that's all great. Now of course the next thing I did try and point out is, from approval date to reimbursement date is a difference. If you think of, say, Australia with the PBS system, it depends on exactly when the book, so to speak, is done. But it can be anywhere between 6 to 12 months, depending on just where you fall into the cycle. Obviously, a country that we continue to pursue in with this is Canada. And there are too, you see, from approval to effective provincial formulary coverage can be anywhere from 3 months to 2 years.  Clearly,  the other big one that we're waiting for is Europe. U.K. is the only one so far, and I kind of make the comment waiting action at the European Medicines Agency. But again, word of caution, once we get the approval, which we hope we will, then there's a delay effect until you actually have coverage in practice. And then further complicating things of course, every country has different delivery of healthcare systems and so -- the U.K. is a very restrictive system, very slow based on referral to a very limited number of specialty headache centers. Obviously, we're selling and marketing to those. And then other countries like Germany are much broader-based. So luckily, we've been in these markets for a very long time. So it's not all new news to us. I'm sure thing there will be the odd thing, like all products will surprise us. But we're, I think, in a good preparation to address these opportunities. Brazil, if I go to Latin America, clearly, there is going to be a lot about private insurance market initially because in practice, most of those markets are paid out-of-the-pocket and then the drug clearly, and the treatment is expensive."

Well first of all, just to clarify, when I talked about what insurance is particularly put in place is that the demonstration that they failed on 2 or 3 other prescriptions. Typically, it would be to triptane, it could be one of the antiepileptics used-off label. So there's a very clear migration treillage of other things before people would go to this. I think what's very interesting when I went to the American Academy of Neurology to hear what were the physicians talking about in practice. And of course, not everybody is an immediate responder. Some people take longer, sometimes even 2 or 3 injection cycles. So I think this is really what I call learning in practice, when you actually have a product on the market and physicians that are capable of telling you what is their real-life experience, their real-life patient feedback from the thousands of patients. So I think things are going fine. In terms of awareness, I would say clearly at post-launch, we had hundreds of millions of media impressions by the press. But of course, people have short memories and need to be reminded, and so we're working very strongly to make sure that the plans understand all the details. There is the patient advocacy groups are also well informed about what it is. And clearly, we're very anxious to point out the differences in those between the famous cosmetic indication on this and then, we're just going to work our way down the stream until we feel we've got everything in place.

The number I remember is typically $2,000 is kind of like a good set of rule of thumb. So you keep people out of the emergency room apart from making their lives better, that's a great thing. I think managed care has been actually quite unconcerned about this because of the blocks they've put in, the very appropriate ones, of demonstration of failure on other medications. And so they don't really see a tidal wave of costs coming their direction. And hence, why I think we've done very well not just because of good management work but getting to 2/3 coverage of commercial lives this quickly in a mere, let's call it 6 months, since approval is pretty good. And of course now, our job is how do we actually deliver smooth experiences. Because again, plans saying, ""yes, we've got it approved "" to getting it actually approved through every single insurance certification is a journey.

Now of course, one of the things you've got to be careful of is the apples-versus-orange comparison. Because when we add Turkey and Poland, those were markets that we were present but were represented through our distributor partners. And so day 1, when we bring those people on, we had a load of headcount and that we also add a differential in the number of people. If we look at 2010, roughly 15% of our worldwide sales were in emerging markets. And clearly in the next 5 years or so, this could go as high as maybe 25% or 30%. What I think is really great for Allergan though, in contrast to, and I'm not trying to throw stones at others, some of the big companies that are star for growth in the U.S. or Western Europe. We have really good growth in those markets because of the states of our markets and the state of our vitality, if you like, of our newness of product approvals. And so I disregard emerging markets as yet another great booster engine on what we're trying to do. Also, I should say on headcount add, very clearly adding in R&D because I will say somewhat directly, Scott Whitcup can't spend money in R&D, in my humble view, with our people because we don't just go to CROs bluntly. We do really good economic analysis in terms of what we want to do internally and create that internal expertise and what we want to do externally, because of the rise and fall of studies and peak loading, which is why the pharmaceutical industry has CROs as partners."

We hit all of our primary end points and we believe the product is well tolerated. So if you look at benefit-risk for these patients who failed other therapies, I would think there's compelling arguments to approve the product. Clearly, we will only talk about the neurogenic detrusor overactivity approval when we talk to physicians. There is some use in patients who failed other therapies, but that's why we've done these studies for idiopathic. Those studies are well under way, and we think that the big use in that indication will be when we get approval."

249205,129551361,122462,"Allergan Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Allergan, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Allergan is off to a strong start for 2011, with growth driven by a wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. Our cash pay markets appear to be in an upswing. An",2033,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
Allergan is off to a strong start for 2011, with growth driven by a wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. Our cash pay markets appear to be in an upswing. And for our reimbursed pharmaceuticals, we have good initial sales contributions from the many products approved in 2010. Finally, sales are benefiting from the weak dollar versus almost all global currencies. 
Reviewing the results for the first quarter. Sales increased versus the first quarter of 2010 by 13.3% in dollars and by 12.2% in local currencies. Operating performance was strong with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77, marking an increase of 18.5% versus the first quarter of 2010 and well above expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call.  All of our operating regions, North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, enjoyed double-digit sales growth in local currencies, with Latin America growing 32% in U.S. dollars. 
Regarding regulatory approvals, we continued to make strong progress in many countries around the world. BOTOX for chronic migraine was approved during the quarter in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong and Korea and is awaiting action at the European Medicines Agency. Several of those markets now await government pricing approval regarding their public programs. 
OZURDEX received a positive opinion in the European Union for the additional indication of uveitis. OZURDEX was further approved for various indications in Switzerland, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Korea, Hong Kong and New Zealand. Other products approvals will be commented in my reports on the individual businesses. Additionally, we'll be taking our businesses direct in South Africa from July 1 of this year.
Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX enjoyed good growth in the first quarter, increasing 10.1% in dollars and 8.7% in local currencies versus prior year, with good growth stemming from both the therapeutic and aesthetic businesses. In the U.S., we continued to make good progress with the launch of the chronic migraine indication. There was considerable physician interest in the neurology community and about 2,000 physicians have been trained since approval, both through web-based and live injection training. About 2/3 of commercial lines now have policy coverage for BOTOX, with the commercial market accounting for about 2/3 of migraine prescriptions. I would, however, wish to remind you that our experience of the last 20 years with BOTOX and the adoption of therapeutic uses of BOTOX is always a long cycle.
Assuming future FDA approval of LEVADEX, the product partnered with MAP Pharmaceuticals, it is clear that Allergan will be in a strong strategic position with the ideal combination of products with prophylaxis of chronic migraine on the one hand and an abortive medication on the other hand for migraine. Regarding upper limb spasticity in the U.S., we are now experiencing double-digit year-over-year growth in focused accounts in academic medical centers. In the U.S. therapeutic market, Dysport and Xeomin have only gained marginal share even with sampling and Xeomin has captured little share in Canada. 
Regarding BOTOX Cosmetic, we are pleased that the U.S. market seems to be growing around the mid-teens in units. With the flattening of Dysport procedure share around 17%, we are poised from April and May onwards, when we cross the anniversary of our market share loss last year, to start fully enjoying the rewards of an expanding market, that is, prior to the potential U.S. entry of Xeomin cosmetic. The European market, despite economic challenges, seems also a bit to be enjoying low double-digit growth. Market conditions in Latin America and Asia Pacific are buoyant. Even with limited market share loss in Europe with the entry of new neuromodulator competitors, we estimate that in Q4, that we enjoyed approximately worldwide 80% market share of the total neuromodulator market and 1% higher than in Q4 of 2009 despite the new competition.
Moving on to Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased an encouraging 15.6% in dollars and 14.7% in local currencies, with double-digit performance in North America and Latin America and Asia Pacific, with Europe, Africa and Middle East growing in excess of 20%, thanks to the effect of direct selling operations in Turkey and Poland, a strong start to OZURDEX sales, as well as strong growth of LUMIGAN, GANFORT and our Artificial Tears line led by Optive. OZURDEX was launched in Spain with reimbursement in April. The global ophthalmic market continues to grow briskly, as also demonstrated by Alcon's report in their first quarter sales growth of 16% in constant currencies, double-digit performance in both glaucoma and artificial tears. We're pleased that Allergan U.S. has returned to growth after having suffered the effects of genericization of ALPHAGAN P 0.15% and also ACULAR. This is reflected in much improved growth of the ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN franchise of 5.8% in local currencies, with COMBIGAN growing strongly, especially in the U.S., and ALPHAGAN being broadly flat around the world. 
The LUMIGAN and GANFORT franchise grew 18% in local currencies. Wherever launched outside the U.S., GANFORT is performing strongly against its category competitors. It is considered by many ophthalmologists as maximum medical therapy in one convenient drop. In the U.S., LUMIGAN 0.1% is enjoying rapid uptake, especially by thought leaders and high-prescribing glaucoma specialists, enjoying an NRx share in the latest week of 35% of overall LUMIGAN prescriptions.
In the 5 weeks since the launch of generic Xalatan, we have observed an 88% genericization rate of latanoprost. Given the excellent formulary coverage for both LUMIGAN 0.01% and original LUMIGAN, we've seen very little impact on the LUMIGAN franchise. Many ophthalmologists expressed concern about the quality of ophthalmic generics. As has been the early experience in Canada and Europe, U.S. ophthalmologists appreciate the comparable efficacy of LUMIGAN 0.1% to the original, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates. LUMIGAN 0.1% was launched during the quarter in Italy and Austria and in April in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Belgium. 
RESTASIS continues to expand strongly, with 21% growth in dollars and local currencies. And with the genericization of Xalatan, it's about to become the largest single-prescription ophthalmic pharmaceutical in the United States.
Regarding facial aesthetics, Q1 was a spectacular quarter with 48.5% growth in dollars and 47.0% in local currencies with extremely high growth in every operating region. It would seem that the dermal filler market is growing very strongly worldwide with more consumers entering the market given the comfort of the latest generation of lidocaine-containing hyaluronic acid products and more syringes being used per face. At the leading medical conventions around the world, there are increasing numbers of papers and symposia on the use of dermal fillers, especially for volumizing, which is addressed by JUVÉDERM VOLUMA where available. Additionally, we believe that Allergan is steadily gaining share given our innovative range of products across our facial portfolio and our distribution strength in almost all markets around the globe.
In the quarter, strong growth in the U.S. was boosted by the sell-in to physician offices of a consumer-directed promotion, combining purchases of BOTOX Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM. In Europe, we have benefited not only from VOLUMA, but also the launches of JUVÉDERM Hydrate and JUVÉDERM Smile, as well as DTC advertising in the U.K., France and Germany. Of the margin, European region sales were boosted by new launches in the Middle East and the Balkans as well as direct selling in Turkey and Poland. Additionally, JUVÉDERM XC and VOLUMA were launched in the Philippines.
Regarding skin care, sales enjoyed good growth at 16.0% in dollars and 15.8% in local currencies. LATISSE sales enjoyed a rebound, growing 34% in dollars, as well as in local currencies. Part of the strong performance is attributable to the sell-in of promotional offers to physicians, as well as a bonus program for consumers that is in the U.S. Consumer research conducted at the end of last year pointed to the need, strong need, to stimulate initial purchase as consumer satisfaction, having used the product, is high. Our investment in DTC with Claire Danes as a spokesperson for LATISSE is producing strong brand awareness. Outside the U.S., we have experienced good uptake of LATISSE in Canada. In Brazil, we heavily sampled the product in the quarter, pre-full commercialization and initiated sales in April. In Mexico, the Ministry Of Health approved DTC. In Asia, LATISSE was launched in April in Hong Kong and Singapore. In the U.S., we were encouraged that the FDA recently addressed the first warning letter to a company commercializing a supposed lash growth product containing active pharmaceutical ingredient.
Regarding sales of other skin care products, ACZONE increased strongly with acquisition dollars to support sales reported by SDI VONA accelerating at 43%. ACZONE is today one of the principal acne products in the U.S. market. In Q1, we outlicensed ACZONE to Valeant Pharmaceuticals in Canada, as we have many other priorities in the Canadian market and given Valeant's strong presence in Canadian dermatology.
Ex-factory sales of TAZORAC declined in the quarter due to higher rebates and channel inventory change, but in-market sales and acquisition dollars increased double-digit. For breast aesthetics, Q1 sales increased 8.0% in dollars and 7.1% in local currencies, with particularly strong growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. In the U.S., we benefited from the continuing trend of the market to higher-priced silicone gel implants, as well as good uptake for our latest range of tissue expanders with suture tabs. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q1 sales decreased 14.9% in dollars and 16.0% in local currencies. Overall, bariatric procedures in the U.S. market per our market research declined 12% in the first quarter year-over-year, with the reimbursed market declining less severely than the cash pay market, which now accounts for less than 6% of procedures, much of this attributable to unemployment rates.  In March, it appears that the market may have recovered after a really poor January and February, but we're cautious of course regarding short-term data points. 
Within bariatrics, sleeve gastrectomy increased its share of the market from 6% a year ago to 15% in Q1, with share being taken almost equally from bands and bypass. In Q1, bands accounted for about 48% of the total market. And within the band category, LAP-BAND share increased by 5 basis points versus a year ago to about 73%. Overseas, we also had a very poor quarter for LAP-BAND in our key Australian market. Sales of our ORBERA Balloons increased modestly overseas, with strong gains in Brazil offset by a decline in Spain given the local weak economy. In the U.S., we continue to suffer from lack of access for patients to LAP-BAND even if coverage in principle is available to members of commercial insurance plans. High co-pays and necessity to demonstrate failure and medically supervised diet and exercise programs are real barriers, which we're addressing through our managed markets organization. 
We also intend to leverage our recent FDA approval for lower body mass index with payers. Furthermore, we also announced the discontinuation of the Easy Band system acquired in the EndoArt acquisition in Switzerland and closed our facility over there. Very high barriers established by the FDA for all new bariatric devices since the time of the acquisition in 2007 of Endoart have led to a considerable delay in timing of U.S. product approval, which of course accounted for a major part of global sales in our plan. That development, coupled with engineering challenges, contributed to a poor economic result and hence, the need for a tough decision to terminate this program. We, however, remain committed to bring the ORBERA product to market in the U.S.
Commenting urology. Sales decreased 2.9% as we absorbed the impact in generics of our overall -- of our original SANCTURA product. In terms of acquisition dollars as reported by SDI for the first quarter, overall SANCTURA sales declined 5.4% given the impact of generics on the original SANCTURA product, offset by strong gains for SANCTURA XR, which is slowly gaining market share in the urology channel.  The next catalyst for the urology business is the anticipated approval of BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity by the FDA later this year. 
I'll now pass it over to Jeff Edwards, who will provide comments on our financials."

The first quarter of 2011 represented a very nice start to the year for Allergan despite previously discussed headwinds relating to U.S. healthcare reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan was able to overachieve our sales and EPS expectations due to quality and line execution by strong, competitive positions in diversified business. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.77, marking an 18.5% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Allergan was able to deliver this strong first-line quarter earnings performance even as we continued to reinvest into the future growth drivers of the business across the commercial portfolio and our R&D pipeline. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2011 gross margin of 85.4% increased 80 basis points when compared to Q1 2010, driven by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix and better net royalty dynamics. As we have previously communicated, we expect gross margins to be relatively constant throughout 2011.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.6%, totaling $534 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 42.3% and $468 million, respectively. We continued to implement targeted investments to further support our future growth and support the launch of many products approved in 2010. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.8% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $198 million, an increase in spend of approximately $18 million over the first quarter of 2010 and sequentially similar to the level of spend for the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to fund new projects and increase funding of projects advancing through the pipeline. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 119 days. In the first quarter, operating cash flow after capital expenditure was approximately $121 million. It is worth noting that the cash flow was affected by the $60 million up-front payment to MAP Pharmaceuticals relating to our collaboration within the United States for LEVADEX. At the end of our first quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.8 billion and $566 million, respectively. As a reminder, we have recently called our convertible note, which resulted in the use of approximately $750 million to $800 million of our cash in the second quarter of 2011.
For the second quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1.310 billion to $1.360 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.95. Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates net sales in the range of $5.050 billion and $5.250 billion and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $3.56 and $3.62, which represents growth of between 13% and 15%. 
As we have previously communicated, our 2011 expectations include approximately $100 million of pretax equivalent headwinds relating primarily to U.S. healthcare reform and pricing pressures. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.

I think that's highly appropriate given the label that we have. I'm not sure where you heard that our plan was to double the number of injectors. I'd like to think we're much better than that despite we don't want to really complain about where we started. So I gave you the number in terms of -- since approval, about 2,000 physicians have been trained either on the web or through live training. And I thought -- I would say I'm always looking for where's the bottleneck or where's the narrowest point in the pipe. And I think it is training. And there, we have the ability to really step that up, and we've been doing so. And of course, there, we can use a lot of the people who have used BOTOX for years in movement disorders where they're very comfortable with the preparation of the product as well as intradermal injections. And for them, 31 injections around the top of the head, they kind of just smile and say, ""That easy."""

And that is always the case with our products. We have dedicated special resources to this area, not only at the management level but also at the field account level.

So that's one thing. If you then sort of step back and say there's something that doesn't make sense here because, of course, obesity is an epidemic that isn't going away and so this has to be addressed.

It was that way years ago with all of the movement disorders, whether it was cervical dystonia or later on, where we have greater experience really is upper limb spasticity, if I look at Europe in particular.

Clearly, we've spent a lot of time on that because we look at analogs from all the other migraine medications to get an indication of what was their experience in terms of what percentage of their overall sales once the products were up and running, because of course short-term, you got to be careful. But you'd say 3 or 4, 5 years post-launch, how big were those geographies? So I'd certainly agree with you, the opportunity x U.S. is also substantial. Clearly, when you think about the list of countries I mentioned, where we've got approval during the quarter, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong and Korea, that's all great. Now of course the next thing I did try and point out is, from approval date to reimbursement date is a difference. If you think of, say, Australia with the PBS system, it depends on exactly when the book, so to speak, is done. But it can be anywhere between 6 to 12 months, depending on just where you fall into the cycle. Obviously, a country that we continue to pursue in the list is Canada. And there too, you see, from approval to effective provincial formulary coverage can be anywhere from 3 months to 2 years.  Clearly,  the other big one that we're waiting for is Europe. U.K. is the only one so far, and I kind of made the comment awaiting action at the European Medicines Agency. But again, word of caution, once we get the approval, which we hope we will, then there's a delay effect until you actually have coverage in practice. And then further complicating things of course, every country has different delivery of healthcare systems and so -- the U.K. is a very restrictive system, very slow, based on referral to a very limited number of specialty headache centers. Obviously, we're selling and marketing to those. And then other countries like Germany are much broader-based. So luckily, we've been in these markets for a very long time. So it's not all new news to us. I'm sure thing there will be the odd thing, like all products will surprise us. But we're, I think, in good preparation to address these opportunities. Brazil, if I go to Latin America, clearly, there it's going to be a lot about private insurance markets initially because in practice, most of those markets are paid out-of-pocket and then the drug clearly, and the treatment is expensive."

Well first of all, just to clarify, when I talked about what the insurances particularly put in place is that the demonstration that they failed on 2 or 3 other prescriptions. Typically, it would be to triptane, it could be one of the antiepileptics used off label. So there's a very clear migration treillage of other things before people would go to this. I think what's very interesting when I went to the American Academy of Neurology to hear what were the physicians talking about in practice. And of course, not everybody is an immediate responder. Some people take longer, sometimes even 2 or 3 injection cycles. So I think this is really what I call learning in practice, when you actually have a product on the market and physicians that are capable of telling you what is their real-life experience, their real live patient feedback from thousands of patients. So I think things are going fine. In terms of awareness, I would say clearly post-launch, we had hundreds of millions of media impressions by the press. But of course, people have short memories and need to be reminded. And so we're working very strongly to make sure that the plans understand all the details. Various patient advocacy groups are also well informed about what it is. And clearly, we're very anxious to point out the differences in dose between the famous cosmetic indication and this. And then, we're just going to work our way downstream until we feel we've got everything in place. When would be the appropriate time to actually go then to the consumer direct."

The number I remember is typically $2,000 is kind of like a good sort of rule of thumb. So if you can keep people out of the emergency room apart from making their lives better, that's a great thing. I think managed care has been actually quite unconcerned about this because of the blocks they've put in, the very appropriate ones, of demonstration of failure on other medications. And so they don't really see a tidal wave of costs coming their direction. And hence, why I think we've done very well not just because of good management work, getting to 2/3 coverage of commercial lives this quickly in a mere, let's call it 6 months, since approval is pretty good. And of course now, our job is how do we actually deliver smooth experiences. Because again, from a plan saying, ""yes, we've got it approved"" to getting it actually approved through every single insurance verification is a journey. That doesn't happen in 30 days, and you have to do hard work with the plans and the pharmacies to make sure all this works but we've done this many times before and we're just kind of more trained down that road."

Now of course, one of the things you've got to be careful of is the apples-versus-orange comparison. Because when we add Turkey and Poland, those were markets that were -- we were present but were represented through our distributor partners. And so day one, when we bring those people on, we had a load of headcount and that we also add a differential in the number of people. If we look at 2010, roughly 15% of our worldwide sales were in emerging markets. And clearly in the next 5 years or so, this could go as high as maybe 25% or 30%. What I think is really great for Allergan though, in contrast to, and I'm not trying to throw stones at others, some of the big companies that are starved for growth in the U.S. or Western Europe. We have really good growth in those markets because of the state of our markets and the state of our -- vitality, if you like, of our newness of product approvals. And so I disregard emerging markets as yet another great booster engine on what we're trying to do. Also, I should say on headcount add, very clearly adding in R&D because I always say somewhat directly, Scott Whitcup can't spend money in R&D, in my humble view, without people because we don't just go to CROs blindly. We do really good economic analysis in terms of what we want to do internally and create that internal expertise and what we want to do externally, because of the rise and fall of studies and peak loading, which is why the pharmaceutical industry has CROs as partners."

Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. Growth outside the U.S. was particular",2163,"Great, thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. 
Growth outside the U.S. was particularly impressive with year-over-year growth of 29% in dollars in international markets with Asia-Pacific growing 36%, Europe, Africa and Middle East by 30%, and Latin America by 28%. 
For the first time since the spin-off of AMO ago, sales outside the U.S. accounted for greater than 40% in total sales. Despite general concerns over economic growth, our cash pay markets around the world appear to be on continuing upswing result as our products cater to those segments with a population for more economic. 
Furthermore, our reimbursed pharmaceutical product lines are benefiting from the many regulatory approvals secured in 2010. The only minor headwind that we're experiencing is a higher than normal incidence of price cuts in Europe given government austerity programs. The 2011 impact of which have increased from $30 million that we estimated at the start of this year to a now approximately $40 million. 
Reviewing the results for the second quarter, sales increased versus the second quarter of 2010 by 13.7% by the weak U.S. dollar versus most currencies, but still at the strong 9.6% in local currencies. Operating performance continues to be strong with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96, marking an increase of 12.9% versus the second quarter of 2010 and above the range of expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call. Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has grown 15.3% versus the first half of 2010, supported by strong gross margin trends and even as we continue to invest in expansion overseas and in launching our new products on BOTOX indications.
In the first half of the year, we have maintained an SG&A ratio just about 40% of sales. Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses, BOTOX enjoyed good sequential growth from the first quarter and is growing at an accelerated pace as we benefit from the approvals for chronic migraine and our progress in the U.S. as well as marketing growth in the U.S. aesthetic business well into double digits. 
Second quarter year-over-year growth came in at 16.1% growth in dollars and 11.8% the local currencies with good growth steming from both the therapeutics and aesthetic businesses. 
The French Regulatory Agency, AFSSAPS, made France the first country to -- European country to issue a Positive Opinion for BOTOX for associated with Genex activity with a license to be issued in due course.
We await FDA regulatory action for this indication later this year. Demonstrating our scientific leadership in the field of neurotoxins, both FDA and Health Canada have approved the breakthroughs Cell-Based Assay that will permit the dramatic reduction in the use of animal based testing. We filed for approval of many countries outside the U.S. and expect the regulatory agencies in Europe and elsewhere will also shortly approve this assay. 
Since the last earnings report, BOTOX for chronic migraine has been approved in the additional countries of New Zealand, India, Turkey and Poland. The U.S. launch of the BOTOX indication for chronic migraine continues well. There's considerable physician interest in the neurology community and almost 3.5000 physicians are being trained since a per well, both were web-based and laugh injection training. About three quarters of commercial lines now have policy coverage and here their commercial market accounts for about 2/3 of migraine prescription.
Actual number of units used by physicians has been continually trending up and is approaching the FDA indication dose of 155 units, given access to reimbursement and given the 155 units as evidence base medicines. 
Patient awareness for this condition and new use of BOTOX remains relatively low, which points to the opportunity for the use of the DTV as later stage of the chronic migraine launch. 
Regarding in the U.S., we continue to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in focused accounts in academic and medical centers. In the U.S. therapeutic market, this remain a very low market shares. 
Regarding BOTOX Cosmetic that, we're pleased that we've been able to contain share at about 17% procedure share since April of 2010 and should now benefit from the expanding market which we estimate to be well in double digits. 
In late July, Merz announced the FDA approval for cosmetic and the product will be available nationwide by the spring of 2012. Based on market intelligence, it has been reported that there may be manufacturing difficulties contributing to these delays. As we do not fully understand what these are given the CMN is available for therapeutic use in the United States, we're fully ready for Xeomin for cosmetic launch and have a full package of countermeasures at the appropriate moment. 
In Europe, it seems that the market despite economic challenges is growing low double digits with BOTOX losing some market share to new entrance, especially in Italy and Spain, both countries where we historically enjoy extremely high market shares.
Market conditions in Latin America and Asia-Pacific remains buoyant. With the aforementioned limited market share losses, we estimate that BOTOX worldwide shares in Q1 was approximately 76%.
Turning to our pharmaceuticals Q2 sales increased to a gratifying 13.8% in dollars and 9.7% in local currencies, and have grown year-to-date 14.7% in dollars and 12.0% in local currencies versus 2010. 
Year-to-date, growth in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Africa, Middle East in dollars has been well above 20%, the later being both boosted by a direct selling operations in Turkey and Poland.
Turning to , the worldwide ophthalmic marketing in Q1 the last period for which states have available grew to an impressive 15%, thanks in part to the growth of retinal therapeutics. 
In the U.S., our business is recovering from the effects of the generic LUMIGAN of 0.1% and side and ACULAR , out posting year-to-date acquisition dollar growth per of the 7.7% year-to-date in June and a branded ophthalmic market increasing 5.7%. This is due to strong performance in LUMIGAN 0.01% were already 38% of new prescriptions have transitioned to the new product given its superior performance characteristics, as well as strong growth with COMBIGAN and RESTASIS. 
Just the generic side of Xalatan, the LUMIGAN franchise has only been marginally affected in volume given local pace of this market. Vision concerns about the varying quality of generics and strong formulations of LUMIGAN. In Q2, RESTASIS became the #1 product and value in the U.S. prescription ophthalmic market.
In Canada, thanks to the strong launch of RESTASIS with private payers, as well as the strong trajectory for LUMIGAN 0.01%, Arugan has grown in market year-to-date of May of 23%.  
OZURDEX was launched in Canada in June, as well as recently in Argentina and Colombia. In Brazil, in June, for IMS, we just surpassed outcomes become market leader and value share for the first time in our history. 
In Europe, for the European Medicines Agency granted a Marketing Authorization for the additional indication of.
OZURDEX is performing strongly, especially in the imported markets of Germany and France and Italy we received reimbursement and we'll introduce the product shortly. 
In the U.K., the National institute for Clinical Excellence known as NICE recommended OZURDEX for the treatment of macular edema due to the retina vein equation. In Europe, Allergan is strongly gaining share in the glaucoma market due to LUMIGAN .01%, as well as GANFORT and COMBIGAN. In Asia, we're benefiting from strong growth across most of the Asian markets. In July, was launched in Malaysia and Thailand. In Japan, 0.2% was filed at FDA by our partners,. 
Regarding facial aesthetics, Q2 sales grew very strongly at 26.9% in dollars and 20.0% in local currencies. Year-to-date, sales have increased 36.5% in dollars and 31.9% in local currencies. 
As indicated in the last earnings call, Q1 sales in the U.S. were boosted by the sale in of a consumer directed rebate promotion combining JUVÉDERM and BOTOX, which partly sold through in Q2. 
Around the world, we're observing very strong market growth as new consumers enter the market and existing consumers use greater products. Year-to-date, our sales and market outside the U.S. have experienced even higher growth than domestically. JUVÉDERM S&E contain lidocaine was launched in Taiwan and Malaysia. 
Our skin care franchise enjoyed strong Q2 year-over-year of 10.1% in dollars and 9.6% in local currencies. Boutique sales in Q2 declined 8.1% in dollars, but has grown year-to-date 10.5% in dollars and 9.7% in local currency. Boutiques was recently filed for approval at the European Medicines Agency.
As advised in the last earnings call, we executed in the U.S. in Q1 a promotional offer to physicians as well as a bonus program to consumers which of course needed to be sold through and therefore affected Q2 results. 
We just initiated campaign focusing on the effects of aging on women. Based on scientific data and observations among women ages 30 plus that their become thinner, shorter and lighter as they grow older. The campaign underscores that the only FDA product to increase fullness, lengthiness, length, and darkness and is typical for women 30 plus experiencing this effect of aging.
This project emphasize the relevance expertise for women who for looking for rejuvenation therapies and the differentiation of large conditioners that appeal to younger, more price sensitive consumers. In support of all of 2this, were also conducting a national consumer and media campaign that failed that these ratios, with 35 -year-old actress and beauty trendsetter, Christina Hendricks. 
Markets also made initial modest contributions to sales with good initial uptick in Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
Regarding medical dermatology, we've experienced strong growth in the U.S. with approximate 13%. In market, we are pleased that acquisitions we have recorded first-half growth of 42% for ACZONE and 15% for TAZORAC. Two recent events have significantly strengthened our medical dermatology franchise. Firstly, we recently announced the acquisition Vicept Therapeutics, which gives us an exacting program which will move into Phase IIb clinical development. As demonstrated, presents a significant area of market opportunity.
Secondly, FDA recently posted guidance regarding requirements for clinical equivalents for generic. Separately, for both psoriasis and acne. Our interpretation is that this will require generics that conduct a clinical trials for both indications at risks to create the required data package. The database on a review noted team by equivalents study as being posted on clinical trials. This potentially provides a major delay to generics after the May, June 2011 expire of.
Now moving on to, this business enjoys a strong culture with 17.0% growth in dollars and 11.9% in local currencies. Year-to-date, we have recorded growth of 12.6% in dollars and 9.5% in local currency. In the U.S., we benefited from a continuing trend of market preference for higher-priced silicone gel implants, as well as good sales for tissue expanders. Overseas, we have grow substantially in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific. At the end of August, the FDA will hold an advisory panel regarding post marketing studies of silicone gel breast implants to discuss innovative methodological approaches to these studies, as well as the monitoring of long-term safety issues.
This specific transaction we're pleased that at the end of year one post full enrollment of our patients and we have a 60% compliance rate for the Allergan breast implant follow-up study we plan to drive this number higher. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q2 sales decreased 12.1% in dollars and 15.3% in local currency. On the same trend that the year-to-date sales decline of 13.5% in dollars and 15.7% in local currency. Commenting on the situation in the U.S. which accounts for the bulk of global sales, year-to-date, main, the overall number of bariatric procedures was down 8% although it may you year-over-year slightly better and in Europe 4% rate of that line. 
Within the band market, LAP-BAND increased its share in May to 82% from 74% in May of 2010. However, within the overall bariatric market, increased its procedure share from 8% in May 2010 to 20% in May 2011. The majority of this business will bypass, but also 3 share points from bands. 
Building on the recent FDA approval of LAP-BAND for lower body mass index patients with at least non core morbidity and recently published health economics to the LAP-BAND we're embarking programs to improve reimbursement access for patients. Sales in the quarter were both in Australia and Canada, offset by strong sales in Latin America.
Finally, commenting urology. Sales decreased  10.2% in dollars versus, which is attributable to the impact of the generous of the original SANCTURA product. Year-to-date, sales have declined 6.8% for the same reason, but offset by 35% growth of the new generation SANCTURA product. Clearly, next catalyst for this franchise is the anticipated FDA and European approval of BOTOX due to the over activity associated with the neurologic condition. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards for his commentary of our financial performance."

During the second quarter of 2011, Allergan continued its strong performance trend and generated solid operating results as we produce double-digit sales growth in both our pharmaceutical and medical device businesses. This quality results were achieved in the face of costs related to U.S. Health Care Reform and ongoing Europe pricing pressures. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.96, marking at 12.9% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Allergan was able to deliver the strong second quarter earnings performance even as we maintain our commitment to progressive investing in the current and future growth drivers of the business across the commercial portfolio and our research and development pipeline. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan Q2 2011 gross margin of 86.1% increased 160 basis points when compared to Q2 2010. This increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix and better royalty dynamics. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the second quarter was 40.2%, totaling $563 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 40.1% and $495 million, respectively. We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our current and future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010. Likewise, we are continuing to invest in the planned expansion into the emerging markets.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.2% of product sales for the quarter totaling $212 million, an increase spent of approximately $15 million over the first quarter of 2011 and nearly $25 million over the second quarter of 2010.

At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments in cash and short term investments in net events positions total approximately $2.2 billion and $570 million, respectively. 
As a reminder, we called our convertible note which resulted in the use of approximately $809 million of our cash during the second quarter of 2011.
For the third quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,265 million to $1,340 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.90. 
Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,220 million and $5,370 million and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.59 to $3.63, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%.

In terms of the U.S., preparation of course we have the sales force available already given our presence for SANCTURA.

Basically, clearly, we've got distribution in placed and so in our world, that is really 2 factors. One is making sure that reimbursement is available. And as I read in my opening remarks, we've made great progress in terms of policy coverage. Also when we booked behind policy and look at the volume of insurance claims being submitted, there's very good trends for people actually getting patient coverage. And I'll say the one issue that remains, which is very normal and very actionable, is let's say less than stellar preparation of documentation in all cases, but we have reimbursement specialists who can help additions in a very appropriate manner with collection of documents and getting our process together. The other side of course is training, and I think there, you can tell also from the number I mentioned, almost 3,500 positions, lots of interest, lots of good progress and where were putting all our interest is behind live injector training, so this is a normal drill that we see in every single indication for the last 20 years. It's different area of the body, but principles remain the same.

And I think it was really connected with critical mass. Now that we not only have a much greater critical mass and Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals but we have developed BOTOX Cosmetic, BOTOX Therapeutics, the facial line, the breast line and so on, you could imagine we have a really NICE broad range of products that all end up the good share positions, good critical mass and therefore, good earnings power. So I was joking with some of our new South African colleagues, it was a little bit of a return of the prodigal son, welcome back to the family. We've gone direct recently in Turkey, Poland, we created a joint venture in South Korea with our long-term partners, as well as taking all the aesthetics and breast businesses direct. Another market that we're working very hard and we'll be doing pretty soon is Russia. And really, in our strategic planning, we're looking at the cadence of markets where we still have an opportunity to fill in the light space. And there are still a couple of markets in Eastern Europe where the substantial populations of the same markets where we're not yet direct in East Asia and other one we added recently incidentally is the Philippines. So it's all about economics. Answering your question on supply chain, that's pretty easy for us because we have such a concentrated plant distribution that work on logistics partners, but to really plug-in another country is relatively simple. We usually have good relationships with our distributors, we even have many times called us so that we can very harmoniously thank them with and go direct. And really, probably the biggest short-term strain is for my accounting colleagues just to get them onto SAP, that brings them into our accounting systems. But we've done more much difficult things than that over the years."

And I think the next thing that is favorable to us is the relatively low co-pays in the ophthalmology, meaning ophthalmic pharmaceutical markets that typically around the $30-mark and hence why I think beyond decision skepticism about the quality of different generics, when one thinks about growth of value of $30 out of the pocket per month, it's still money. But if the physician thinks that is the real product for the patient, usually, the patient will go along with that."

Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. Growth outside the U.S. was particular",2163,"Great, thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by wide range of products and franchises across many countries around the world. 
Growth outside the U.S. was particularly impressive with year-over-year growth of 29% in dollars in international markets with Asia-Pacific growing 36%, Europe, Africa and Middle East by 30%, and Latin America by 28%. 
For the first time since the spin-off of AMO ago, sales outside the U.S. accounted for greater than 40% in total sales. Despite general concerns over economic growth, our cash pay markets around the world appear to be on continuing upswing result as our products cater to those segments with a population for more economic. 
Furthermore, our reimbursed pharmaceutical product lines are benefiting from the many regulatory approvals secured in 2010. The only minor headwind that we're experiencing is a higher than normal incidence of price cuts in Europe given government austerity programs. The 2011 impact of which have increased from $30 million that we estimated at the start of this year to a now approximately $40 million. 
Reviewing the results for the second quarter, sales increased versus the second quarter of 2010 by 13.7% by the weak U.S. dollar versus most currencies, but still at the strong 9.6% in local currencies. Operating performance continues to be strong with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96, marking an increase of 12.9% versus the second quarter of 2010 and above the range of expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call. Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has grown 15.3% versus the first half of 2010, supported by strong gross margin trends and even as we continue to invest in expansion overseas and in launching our new products on BOTOX indications.
In the first half of the year, we have maintained an SG&A ratio just about 40% of sales. Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses, BOTOX enjoyed good sequential growth from the first quarter and is growing at an accelerated pace as we benefit from the approvals for chronic migraine and our progress in the U.S. as well as marketing growth in the U.S. aesthetic business well into double digits. 
Second quarter year-over-year growth came in at 16.1% growth in dollars and 11.8% the local currencies with good growth steming from both the therapeutics and aesthetic businesses. 
The French Regulatory Agency, AFSSAPS, made France the first country to -- European country to issue a Positive Opinion for BOTOX for associated with Genex activity with a license to be issued in due course.
We await FDA regulatory action for this indication later this year. Demonstrating our scientific leadership in the field of neurotoxins, both FDA and Health Canada have approved the breakthroughs Cell-Based Assay that will permit the dramatic reduction in the use of animal based testing. We filed for approval of many countries outside the U.S. and expect the regulatory agencies in Europe and elsewhere will also shortly approve this assay. 
Since the last earnings report, BOTOX for chronic migraine has been approved in the additional countries of New Zealand, India, Turkey and Poland. The U.S. launch of the BOTOX indication for chronic migraine continues well. There's considerable physician interest in the neurology community and almost 3.5000 physicians are being trained since a per well, both were web-based and laugh injection training. About three quarters of commercial lines now have policy coverage and here their commercial market accounts for about 2/3 of migraine prescription.
Actual number of units used by physicians has been continually trending up and is approaching the FDA indication dose of 155 units, given access to reimbursement and given the 155 units as evidence base medicines. 
Patient awareness for this condition and new use of BOTOX remains relatively low, which points to the opportunity for the use of the DTV as later stage of the chronic migraine launch. 
Regarding in the U.S., we continue to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in focused accounts in academic and medical centers. In the U.S. therapeutic market, this remain a very low market shares. 
Regarding BOTOX Cosmetic that, we're pleased that we've been able to contain share at about 17% procedure share since April of 2010 and should now benefit from the expanding market which we estimate to be well in double digits. 
In late July, Merz announced the FDA approval for cosmetic and the product will be available nationwide by the spring of 2012. Based on market intelligence, it has been reported that there may be manufacturing difficulties contributing to these delays. As we do not fully understand what these are given the CMN is available for therapeutic use in the United States, we're fully ready for Xeomin for cosmetic launch and have a full package of countermeasures at the appropriate moment. 
In Europe, it seems that the market despite economic challenges is growing low double digits with BOTOX losing some market share to new entrance, especially in Italy and Spain, both countries where we historically enjoy extremely high market shares.
Market conditions in Latin America and Asia-Pacific remains buoyant. With the aforementioned limited market share losses, we estimate that BOTOX worldwide shares in Q1 was approximately 76%.
Turning to our pharmaceuticals Q2 sales increased to a gratifying 13.8% in dollars and 9.7% in local currencies, and have grown year-to-date 14.7% in dollars and 12.0% in local currencies versus 2010. 
Year-to-date, growth in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Africa, Middle East in dollars has been well above 20%, the later being both boosted by a direct selling operations in Turkey and Poland.
Turning to , the worldwide ophthalmic marketing in Q1 the last period for which states have available grew to an impressive 15%, thanks in part to the growth of retinal therapeutics. 
In the U.S., our business is recovering from the effects of the generic LUMIGAN of 0.1% and side and ACULAR , out posting year-to-date acquisition dollar growth per of the 7.7% year-to-date in June and a branded ophthalmic market increasing 5.7%. This is due to strong performance in LUMIGAN 0.01% were already 38% of new prescriptions have transitioned to the new product given its superior performance characteristics, as well as strong growth with COMBIGAN and RESTASIS. 
Just the generic side of Xalatan, the LUMIGAN franchise has only been marginally affected in volume given local pace of this market. Vision concerns about the varying quality of generics and strong formulations of LUMIGAN. In Q2, RESTASIS became the #1 product and value in the U.S. prescription ophthalmic market.
In Canada, thanks to the strong launch of RESTASIS with private payers, as well as the strong trajectory for LUMIGAN 0.01%, Arugan has grown in market year-to-date of May of 23%.  
OZURDEX was launched in Canada in June, as well as recently in Argentina and Colombia. In Brazil, in June, for IMS, we just surpassed outcomes become market leader and value share for the first time in our history. 
In Europe, for the European Medicines Agency granted a Marketing Authorization for the additional indication of.
OZURDEX is performing strongly, especially in the imported markets of Germany and France and Italy we received reimbursement and we'll introduce the product shortly. 
In the U.K., the National institute for Clinical Excellence known as NICE recommended OZURDEX for the treatment of macular edema due to the retina vein equation. In Europe, Allergan is strongly gaining share in the glaucoma market due to LUMIGAN .01%, as well as GANFORT and COMBIGAN. In Asia, we're benefiting from strong growth across most of the Asian markets. In July, was launched in Malaysia and Thailand. In Japan, 0.2% was filed at FDA by our partners,. 
Regarding facial aesthetics, Q2 sales grew very strongly at 26.9% in dollars and 20.0% in local currencies. Year-to-date, sales have increased 36.5% in dollars and 31.9% in local currencies. 
As indicated in the last earnings call, Q1 sales in the U.S. were boosted by the sale in of a consumer directed rebate promotion combining JUVÉDERM and BOTOX, which partly sold through in Q2. 
Around the world, we're observing very strong market growth as new consumers enter the market and existing consumers use greater products. Year-to-date, our sales and market outside the U.S. have experienced even higher growth than domestically. JUVÉDERM S&E contain lidocaine was launched in Taiwan and Malaysia. 
Our skin care franchise enjoyed strong Q2 year-over-year of 10.1% in dollars and 9.6% in local currencies. Boutique sales in Q2 declined 8.1% in dollars, but has grown year-to-date 10.5% in dollars and 9.7% in local currency. Boutiques was recently filed for approval at the European Medicines Agency.
As advised in the last earnings call, we executed in the U.S. in Q1 a promotional offer to physicians as well as a bonus program to consumers which of course needed to be sold through and therefore affected Q2 results. 
We just initiated campaign focusing on the effects of aging on women. Based on scientific data and observations among women ages 30 plus that their become thinner, shorter and lighter as they grow older. The campaign underscores that the only FDA product to increase fullness, lengthiness, length, and darkness and is typical for women 30 plus experiencing this effect of aging.
This project emphasize the relevance expertise for women who for looking for rejuvenation therapies and the differentiation of large conditioners that appeal to younger, more price sensitive consumers. In support of all of 2this, were also conducting a national consumer and media campaign that failed that these ratios, with 35 -year-old actress and beauty trendsetter, Christina Hendricks. 
Markets also made initial modest contributions to sales with good initial uptick in Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
Regarding medical dermatology, we've experienced strong growth in the U.S. with approximate 13%. In market, we are pleased that acquisitions we have recorded first-half growth of 42% for ACZONE and 15% for TAZORAC. Two recent events have significantly strengthened our medical dermatology franchise. Firstly, we recently announced the acquisition Vicept Therapeutics, which gives us an exacting program which will move into Phase IIb clinical development. As demonstrated, presents a significant area of market opportunity.
Secondly, FDA recently posted guidance regarding requirements for clinical equivalents for generic. Separately, for both psoriasis and acne. Our interpretation is that this will require generics that conduct a clinical trials for both indications at risks to create the required data package. The database on a review noted team by equivalents study as being posted on clinical trials. This potentially provides a major delay to generics after the May, June 2011 expire of.
Now moving on to, this business enjoys a strong culture with 17.0% growth in dollars and 11.9% in local currencies. Year-to-date, we have recorded growth of 12.6% in dollars and 9.5% in local currency. In the U.S., we benefited from a continuing trend of market preference for higher-priced silicone gel implants, as well as good sales for tissue expanders. Overseas, we have grow substantially in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific. At the end of August, the FDA will hold an advisory panel regarding post marketing studies of silicone gel breast implants to discuss innovative methodological approaches to these studies, as well as the monitoring of long-term safety issues.
This specific transaction we're pleased that at the end of year one post full enrollment of our patients and we have a 60% compliance rate for the Allergan breast implant follow-up study we plan to drive this number higher. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q2 sales decreased 12.1% in dollars and 15.3% in local currency. On the same trend that the year-to-date sales decline of 13.5% in dollars and 15.7% in local currency. Commenting on the situation in the U.S. which accounts for the bulk of global sales, year-to-date, main, the overall number of bariatric procedures was down 8% although it may you year-over-year slightly better and in Europe 4% rate of that line. 
Within the band market, LAP-BAND increased its share in May to 82% from 74% in May of 2010. However, within the overall bariatric market, increased its procedure share from 8% in May 2010 to 20% in May 2011. The majority of this business will bypass, but also 3 share points from bands. 
Building on the recent FDA approval of LAP-BAND for lower body mass index patients with at least non core morbidity and recently published health economics to the LAP-BAND we're embarking programs to improve reimbursement access for patients. Sales in the quarter were both in Australia and Canada, offset by strong sales in Latin America.
Finally, commenting urology. Sales decreased  10.2% in dollars versus, which is attributable to the impact of the generous of the original SANCTURA product. Year-to-date, sales have declined 6.8% for the same reason, but offset by 35% growth of the new generation SANCTURA product. Clearly, next catalyst for this franchise is the anticipated FDA and European approval of BOTOX due to the over activity associated with the neurologic condition. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards for his commentary of our financial performance."

During the second quarter of 2011, Allergan continued its strong performance trend and generated solid operating results as we produce double-digit sales growth in both our pharmaceutical and medical device businesses. This quality results were achieved in the face of costs related to U.S. Health Care Reform and ongoing Europe pricing pressures. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.96, marking at 12.9% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Allergan was able to deliver the strong second quarter earnings performance even as we maintain our commitment to progressive investing in the current and future growth drivers of the business across the commercial portfolio and our research and development pipeline. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan Q2 2011 gross margin of 86.1% increased 160 basis points when compared to Q2 2010. This increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix and better royalty dynamics. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the second quarter was 40.2%, totaling $563 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 40.1% and $495 million, respectively. We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our current and future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010. Likewise, we are continuing to invest in the planned expansion into the emerging markets.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.2% of product sales for the quarter totaling $212 million, an increase spent of approximately $15 million over the first quarter of 2011 and nearly $25 million over the second quarter of 2010. 
With respect to R&D investment in 2011, Allergan continues to make substantial commitments spending across both our medical device and pharmaceutical technology portfolios. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 48 sales while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 113 days. In the second quarter, operating cash flow where after CapEx was approximately $214 million. Please note that this result was affected by the $45 million upfront payment to Molecular Partners, relating to the license agreement for the DARPin anti-digest technology. 
At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments in cash and short term investments in net events positions total approximately $2.2 billion and $570 million, respectively. 
As a reminder, we called our convertible note which resulted in the use of approximately $809 million of our cash during the second quarter of 2011.
For the third quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,265 million to $1,340 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.90. 
Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,220 million and $5,370 million and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.59 to $3.63, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%. 
Regarding 2011 cash flow, we still expect to generate operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $900 million, excluding upfront payments for deals signed throughout 2011. 
For your information, expectations for other lines of income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. 
So with that, operator, we now like to open the call for questions."

In terms of the U.S., preparation of course we have the sales force available already given our presence for SANCTURA.

Basically, clearly, we've got distribution in placed and so in our world, that is really 2 factors. One is making sure that reimbursement is available. And as I read in my opening remarks, we've made great progress in terms of policy coverage. Also when we booked behind policy and look at the volume of insurance claims being submitted, there's very good trends for people actually getting patient coverage. And I'll say the one issue that remains, which is very normal and very actionable, is let's say less than stellar preparation of documentation in all cases, but we have reimbursement specialists who can help additions in a very appropriate manner with collection of documents and getting our process together. The other side of course is training, and I think there, you can tell also from the number I mentioned, almost 3,500 positions, lots of interest, lots of good progress and where were putting all our interest is behind live injector training, so this is a normal drill that we see in every single indication for the last 20 years. It's different area of the body, but principles remain the same. And to answering specifically, DTC, as I've often mentioned, the first move will be to have a non-branded TV campaign, which is -- the purpose of which is to increase disease awareness and I think work continuous and the work is doing, all looks very promising."

And I think it was really connected with critical mass. Now that we not only have a much greater critical mass and Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals but we have developed BOTOX Cosmetic, BOTOX Therapeutics, the facial line, the breast line and so on, you could imagine we have a really NICE broad range of products that all end up the good share positions, good critical mass and therefore, good earnings power. So I was joking with some of our new South African colleagues, it was a little bit of a return of the prodigal son, welcome back to the family. We've gone direct recently in Turkey, Poland, we created a joint venture in South Korea with our long-term partners, as well as taking all the aesthetics and breast businesses direct. Another market that we're working very hard and we'll be doing pretty soon is Russia. And really, in our strategic planning, we're looking at the cadence of markets where we still have an opportunity to fill in the light space. And there are still a couple of markets in Eastern Europe where the substantial populations of the same markets where we're not yet direct in East Asia and other one we added recently incidentally is the Philippines. So it's all about economics. Answering your question on supply chain, that's pretty easy for us because we have such a concentrated plant distribution that work on logistics partners, but to really plug-in another country is relatively simple. We usually have good relationships with our distributors, we even have many times called us so that we can very harmoniously thank them with and go direct. And really, probably the biggest short-term strain is for my accounting colleagues just to get them onto SAP, that brings them into our accounting systems.

Clearly, we'll be monitoring this and as we start getting any positive feedback, we'll gear up so that once we get the proof of concept data, we should go to Phase III right away. The good news is that the FDA regulatory pathway is well delineated as the other products has been approval. It's not quick, you got to go through all of the steps that the FDA requires and that will be 2 Phase III trials following a proof of concept studies. And as you pointed out, we see a potential market, not only for male pattern baldness which is a huge market, but the animal data suggests that for female hair thinning that could be a very beneficial products as well."

Hopefully, for us, innovation and product flow always beats general economic conditions.

If we don't look at the U.S., obviously the same comment about products innovation and differentiated products very much applies. So I'm really pleased that we're in a good spot relatively new exposure to Medicare. Really, when you kind of fit right through it, the only major franchise that is very Medicare oriented is glaucoma where clearly we have a major decision and the grubbing position. But that's 11% of the mix in Medicare of worldwide sales. So it's relative. And I think the next thing that is favorable to us is the relatively low co-pays in the ophthalmology, meaning ophthalmic pharmaceutical markets that typically around the $30-mark and hence why I think beyond decision skepticism about the quality of different generics, when one thinks about growth of value of $30 out of the pocket per month, it's still money.

Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. Growth outside the U.S. was part",2216,"Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. 
Growth outside the U.S. was particularly impressive with year-over-year growth of 29% in dollars in international markets, with Asia-Pacific growing 36%, Europe, Africa and Middle East by 30% and Latin America by 28%. 
For the first time since the spin-off of AMO a decade ago, sales outside the U.S. accounted for greater than 40% of total sales. Despite general concerns over economic growth, our cash pay markets around the world appear to be on continuing upswing, presumably as our products cater to those segments with a population who are more economically resistant. 
Furthermore, our reimbursed pharmaceutical product lines are benefiting from the many regulatory approvals secured in 2010. The only minor headwind that we're experiencing is a higher-than-normal incidence of price cuts in Europe, given government austerity programs. The 2011 impact of which have increased from $30 million that we estimated at the start of this year to a now approximately $40 million. 
Reviewing the results for the second quarter, sales increased versus the second quarter of 2010 by 13.7% fluctuated by the weak U.S. dollar versus most currencies, but still at the strong 9.6% in local currencies. Operating performance continues to be strong with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96, marking an increase of 12.9% versus the second quarter of 2010 and above the range of expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call. Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has grown 15.3% versus the first half of 2010, supported by strong gross margin trends and even as we continue to invest in expansion overseas and in launching our new products on BOTOX indications.
In the first half of the year, we have maintained an SG&A ratio just about 40% of sales. Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses, BOTOX enjoyed good sequential growth from the first quarter and is growing at an accelerated pace as we benefit from the approvals for chronic migraine and upper limb spasticity in the U.S. as well as market growth in the U.S. aesthetic business well into double digits.  Second quarter year-over-year growth came in at 16.1% growth in dollars and 11.8% in local currencies with good growth steming from both the therapeutics and aesthetic businesses. 
The French Regulatory Agency, AFSSAPS, made France the first country to -- European country to issue a Positive Opinion for BOTOX for urinary incontinence associated with neurogenic detrusor overactivity with a license to be issued in due course.
We await FDA regulatory action for this indication later this year. Demonstrating our scientific leadership in the field of neurotoxins, both FDA and Health Canada have approved the breakthrough cell-based assay that will permit the dramatic reduction in the use of animal based testing. We filed for approval in many countries outside the U.S. and expect the regulatory agencies in Europe and elsewhere will also shortly approve this assay. 
Since the last earnings report, BOTOX for chronic migraine has been approved in the additional countries of New Zealand, India, Turkey and Poland. The U.S. launch of the BOTOX indication for chronic migraine continues well. There's considerable physician interest in the neurology community and almost 3,500 physicians are being trained since approval, both through web-based and live injection training. About 3/4 of commercial lines now have policy coverage and here their commercial market accounts for about 2/3 of migraine prescription.
Actual number of units used by physicians has been continually trending up and is approaching the FDA indicated dose of 155 units, given the access to reimbursement and given that 155 units is evidence based medicines. 
Patient awareness for this condition and new use of BOTOX remains relatively low, which points to the opportunity for the use of DTC at a later stage of the chronic migraine launch. 
Regarding upper limb spasticity in the U.S., we continue to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in focused accounts in academic and medical centers. In the U.S. therapeutic market, Dysport and Xeomin remain at very low market shares. Regarding BOTOX Cosmetic, we're pleased that we've been able to contain Dysport share at about 17% procedure share since April of 2010 and should now benefit from the expanding market, which we estimate to be well into double digits. 
In late July, Merz announced the FDA approval for Xeomin cosmetic and that the product will be available nationwide by the spring of 2012. Based on market intelligence, it has been reported that there may be manufacturing difficulties contributing to these delays. As we do not fully understand what these are given that Xeomin is available for therapeutic use in the United States, we're fully ready for Xeomin cosmetic launch and have a full package of countermeasures for deployment at the appropriate moment. 
In Europe, it seems that the market despite, economic challenges, is growing low double digits, with BOTOX losing some market share to new entrants, especially in Italy and Spain, both countries where we historically enjoy extremely high market shares.
Market conditions in Latin America and Asia-Pacific remain buoyant. With the aforementioned limited market share losses, we estimate that BOTOX worldwide shares in Q1 was approximately 76%.
Turning to ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, Q2 sales increased to a gratifying 13.8% in dollars and 9.7% in local currencies, and have grown year-to-date 14.7% in dollars and 12.0% in local currencies versus 2010. 
Year-to-date, growth in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Africa and Middle East in dollars has been well above 20%, the latter being both boosted by direct selling operations in Turkey and Poland.
According to IMS, the worldwide ophthalmic market in Q1, the last period for which data is available, grew an impressive 15%, thanks, in part, to the growth of retinal therapeutics. 
In the U.S., our business is recovering from the effect of the generic of ALPHAGAN 0.15% and of and genericization of ACULAR, posting year-to-date acquisition dollar growth per SDI Health of 7.7% year-to-date in June and the branded ophthalmic market increased 5.7%. This is due to strong performance of LUMIGAN 0.01%, where already 38% of new prescriptions have transitioned to the new product, given its superior performance characteristics, as well as strong growth with COMBIGAN and RESTASIS. 
Since the genericization of Xalatan, the LUMIGAN franchise has only been marginally affected in volume, given low copays in this market, physician concerns about the varying quality of generics and strong formula provisions for LUMIGAN. In Q2, RESTASIS became the #1 product in value in the U.S. prescription ophthalmic market.
In Canada, thanks to the strong launch of RESTASIS with private payers, as well as the strong trajectory for LUMIGAN 0.01%, Allergan has grown in market year-to-date, May at 23%.  
OZURDEX was launched in Canada in June, as well as recently in Argentina and Colombia. In Brazil, in June, per IMS, we just surpassed Alcon to become market leader in value share for the first time in our history.  In Europe, for OZURDEX, the European Medicines Agency granted a Marketing Authorization for the additional indication of uveitis.
OZURDEX is performing strongly, especially in the important markets of Germany and France. In Italy, we received reimbursement and will introduce the product shortly. 
In the U.K., the National institute for Clinical Excellence known as NICE recommended OZURDEX for the treatment of macular edema due to the retinal vein occlusion. In Europe, Allergan is strongly gaining share in the glaucoma market due to LUMIGAN .01%, as well as GANFORT and COMBIGAN. In Asia, we're benefiting from strong growth across most of the Asian markets. In July, OPTIVE was launched in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. In Japan, ALPHAGAN 0.2% was filed with PMDA by our partner Senju. 
Regarding facial aesthetics, Q2 sales grew very strongly at 26.9% in dollars and 20.0% in local currencies. Year-to-date, sales have increased 36.5% in dollars and 31.9% in local currencies. 
As indicated in the last earnings call, Q1 sales in the U.S. were boosted by the sell-in of the consumer directed rebate promotion, combining JUVÉDERM and BOTOX, which partly sold through in Q2. 
Around the world, we're observing very strong market growth as new consumers enter the market and existing consumers use greater volumes of products. Year-to-date, our sales in market outside the U.S. have experienced even higher growth than domestically. JUVÉDERM XC containing lidocaine was launched in Taiwan and Malaysia. Our skin care franchise enjoyed strong Q2 year-over-year growth of 10.1% in dollars and 9.6% in local currencies. LATISSE sales in Q2 declined 8.1% in dollars, but has grown year-to-date 10.5% in dollars and 9.7% in local currency. LATISSE was recently filed for approval at the European Medicines Agency.
As advised in the last earnings call, we executed in the U.S., in Q1, a promotional offer to physicians as well as a bonus program to consumers, which, of course, needed to be sold through, and therefore, affected Q2 results. We've just initiated a new DTC campaign focusing on the effects of aging on women's lashes. Based on scientific data and observations among women ages 30 plus that their lashes become thinner, shorter and lighter as they grow older. The campaign underscores that LATISSE is the only FDA product clinically proven to increase fullness, length, and darkness and is suitable for women 30 plus experiencing this effect of aging.
This further emphasize the relevance of LATISSE to women who are looking for rejuvenation therapies and the differentiation from lash conditioners that appeal to younger, more price-sensitive consumers. In support of all of this, we're also conducting a national consumer and media campaign titled LATISSE Wishes, with 35 -year-old actress and beauty trendsetter, Christina Hendricks. 
Foreign markets also made initial modest contributions to sales, with good initial uptake in Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
Regarding medical dermatology, we've experienced strong growth in the U.S. at approximate 13%. In market, we are pleased that in acquisitions, we have recorded first-half growth of 42% for ACZONE and 15% for TAZORAC. Two recent events have significantly strengthened our medical dermatology franchise. Firstly, we recently announced the acquisition of Vicept Therapeutics, which gives us an exciting program for rosacea, which will move into Phase IIb clinical development. As demonstrated by Galderma, rosacea represents a significant area of market opportunity. Secondly, FDA recently posted guidance regarding requirements for clinical bioequivalence for generic of tazarotene. 
Separately, for both psoriasis and acne, our interpretation is that this will require generics to conduct a clinical trial for both indications at risks to create the required data package. To-date, based on our review, no tazarotene bioequivalence study has been posted on clinical trials. This potentially provides a major delay to generics after the May, June 2011 expiry of the TAZORAC patent.
Now moving on to breast aesthetics, this business enjoyed a strong quarter with 17.0% growth in dollars and 11.9% in local currencies. Year-to-date, we have recorded growth of 12.6% in dollars and 9.5% in local currency. In the U.S., we benefited from a continuing trend of market preference for higher-priced silicone gel implants, as well as good sales for our latest range of tissue expanders. Overseas, we have grown substantially in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific. At the end of August, the FDA will hold an advisory panel regarding post-marketing studies of silicone gel breast implants to discuss innovative methodological approaches to these studies, as well as the monitoring of long-term safety issues.
Due to vigorous action, we're pleased that at the end of year one, post full enrollment of our patients, we have a 60% compliance rate for the Allergan breast implant follow-up study and plan to drive this number higher. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q2 sales decreased 12.1% in dollars and 15.3% in local currency. On the same trend that the year-to-date sales decline of 13.5% in dollars and 15.7% in local currency. Commenting on the situation in the U.S, which accounts for the bulk of global sales, year-to-date May, the overall number of bariatric procedures was down 8%, although, May year-over-year was slightly better at a 4% rate of decline. 
Within the band market, LAP-BAND increased its share in May to 82% from 74% in May of 2010. However, within the overall bariatric market, sleeve gastrectomy increased its procedure share from 8% in May 2010 to 20% in May 2011, taking the majority of this business from bypass, but also 3 share points from bands. 
Building on the recent FDA approval of LAP-BAND for lower body mass index patients with at least one co-morbidity and recently published health economics data for the LAP-BAND, we're embarking on vigorous programs to improve reimbursement access for patients. Sales in the quarter were weak both in Australia and Canada, offset by strong sales growth in Latin America.
Finally, comment in urology. Sales decreased 10.3% in dollars, which is attributable to the impact of the genericization of the original SANCTURA product. Year-to-date, sales have declined 6.8% for the same reason, but offset by 35% growth of the new-generation SANCTURA XR product. Clearly, the next catalyst for this franchise is the anticipated FDA and the European approval to BOTOX for incontinence due to detrusor overactivity associated with the neurological condition. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards for his commentary of our financial performance."

During the second quarter of 2011, Allergan continued its strong performance trend and generated solid operating results as we produce double-digit sales growth in both our pharmaceutical and medical device businesses. These quality results were achieved in the face of costs related to U.S. Health Care Reform and ongoing Europe pricing pressures. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.96, marking at 12.9% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Allergan was able to deliver the strong second quarter earnings performance even as we maintained our commitment to progressive investing in the current and future growth drivers of the business across the commercial portfolio and our research and development pipeline. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan Q2 2011 gross margin of 86.1% increased 160 basis points when compared to Q2 2010. This increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix and better net royalty dynamics. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the second quarter was 40.2%, totaling $563 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 40.1% and $495 million, respectively. We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our current and future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010. Likewise, we are continuing to invest in the planned expansion into the emerging markets.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.2% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $212 million, an increase spent of approximately $15 million over the first quarter of 2011 and nearly $25 million over the second quarter of 2010. 
With respect to R&D investment in 2011, Allergan continues to make substantial commitments spending across both our medical device and pharmaceutical technology portfolios. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 48 sales while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 113 days. In the second quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $214 million. Please note that this result was affected by the $45 million upfront payment to Molecular Partners, relating to the license agreement for the DARPin anti-VEGF technology. 
At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments in cash and short term investments and net-of-debt positions total approximately $2.2 billion and $570 million, respectively.  As a reminder, we called our convertible note, which resulted in the use of approximately $809 million of our cash during the second quarter of 2011.
For the third quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,265,000,000 to $1,340,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.90. 
Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,220,000,000 and $5,370,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.59 to $3.63, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%. 
Regarding 2011 cash flow, we still expect to generate operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $900 million, excluding upfront payments for deals signed throughout 2011. 
For your information, expectations for other lines of income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. 
So with that, operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions."

In terms of preparation, a lot has been published already. I think, the urology community is extremely excited about this indication, both in United States as well as Europe and indeed other markets, because we're already approved in places like Brazil. In terms of the U.S., preparation, of course, we have the sales force available already, given our presence for SANCTURA. And just as in the case we have for chronic migraine that the margin will be adding a couple of dozens of people. But from a cost perspective, this really doesn't change anything at all, when you think about global SG&A spend. So I hope that addressed all your questions."

Basically, clearly, we've got to get distribution in place. And so in our world, that is really 2 factors. One is making sure that reimbursement is available. And as I read in my opening remarks, we've made great progress in terms of policy coverage. Also, when we look behind policy and look at the volume of insurance claims being submitted, there's very good trends for people actually getting patient coverage. And I'll say the one issue that remains, which is very normal and very actionable, is let's say less than stellar preparation of documentation in all cases, but we have reimbursement specialists who can help physicians in a very appropriate manner, with collection of documents and getting our process together. The other side, of course, is training, and I think there, you can tell also from the number I mentioned, almost 3,500 positions, lots of interest, lots of good progress, and where we're putting all our emphasis is behind live injector training because this is a normal drill that we see in every single indication for the last 20 years. It's different area of the body, but principles remain the same. Finally, answering, specifically, DTC, as I've often mentioned, the first move will be to have a unbranded TV campaign, which is -- the purpose of which is to increase disease awareness. And I think work, continuous, the work we're doing all looks very promising."

One, that the Vicept compound was good at decreasing the redness, so that decrease in redness was of cosmetic value to patients, and lasted a fair bit. FDA wants the treatment effect to last throughout the day. So we see an unmet need in terms of the redness. We've actually already interacted with the FDA once the deal was announced.

And I think it was really connected with critical mass. And now that we not only have a much greater critical mass in ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, but we have the benefit of BOTOX Cosmetic, BOTOX Therapeutics, the facial line, the breast line and so on. You can imagine we have a really nice broad range of products that all add up to good share positions, good critical mass and therefore, good earnings power. So I was joking with some of our new South African colleagues, it was a little bit of the return of the prodigal son. Welcome back into the family. We've gone direct recently in Turkey, Poland, head there, too. We created a joint venture in South Korea with our long-term partner, as well as taking all the aesthetics and breast businesses direct. Another market that we're working very hard and we'll be doing pretty soon is Russia. And really, then in our strategic planning, we're looking at the cadence of markets where we still have an opportunity to fill in the wide spaces. And there are still a couple of markets in Eastern Europe, where the substantial populations of the same market, some markets, where we're not yet direct in East Asia. Another one we added recently incidentally is the Philippines. So it's all about economics. Answering your question on supply chain, that's pretty easy for us because we have such a concentrated plant distribution that work on logistics partners, that to really plug in another country is relatively simple. We usually have good relationships with our distributors. We even have many times called us so that we can very harmoniously thank them with and notice and go direct. And really, probably the biggest short-term strain is for my accounting colleagues just to get them on to SAP and bring them into our accounting systems. But we've done much more difficult things than that over the years."

Even Europe looks as if it's progressing quite well. So when I ask myself, what on the earth is going on, and hopefully this isn't a rerun of what we saw at the end of 2008. But it appears that our patients are much more skewed to let's say, the higher income brackets, therefore, they have more resistance to absorb increased cost of food, increased cost of gasoline, increased cost of clothing, that has been going on at least in the last 6 to 12 months. So that's the way I kind of do my observations. And I look very carefully both -- not only the U.S., but all the other markets around the world. Can I detect signs of weakness? And really, when I look through it, beyond the odd countries, I mentioned Italy and Spain. So I'm not even sure there if it's an issue of economic weakness. It's when you have incredibly high market share, you can't hang on to 90% plus. That's just not possible. And frankly, it's all about market growth versus market share."

And you've seen very clear signs this year that in addition to the programs that Scott have in the portfolio for quite  a long time, we've also added to that portfolio through Molecular Partners, the most recent example being Vicept. Then going to sales and marketing expenditure, clearly, we have very good models for checking whether we see return for investment commitments. And Jeff Edwards appropriately likes to give me a hard time over that because that's his job as CFO. So we called it the lie-detection program between what was committed and what was delivered. And fortunately for us, we have great opportunities. We talked about emerging markets earlier, that explains the fair bit of our year-over-year increase.

Well, first of all, Europe, I suppose, as we all read the news, the cuts and price reductions have been even worse than normal. And I suppose that kind of unfortunately makes sense given the squeeze that a lot of those governments find themselves in. Happily, for us, innovation and product flow always beats general economic conditions. So I'm rather pleased that I was able to quote in my opening remarks that Europe, Africa and Middle East grew by 30% in Q2, notwithstanding all the price cuts going on. If we don't look at the U.S., obviously, the same comment about products, along innovation and differentiated products very much applies. So I'm really pleased that we're in a good spot. These are relatively low exposure to Medicare. Really, when you kind of peel right through it, the only major franchise that is very Medicare-oriented is glaucoma, where, clearly, we have major position, and a growing position. But that's 11% of the mix in Medicare of worldwide sales. So it's relative. And I think the next thing that is favorable to us is the relatively low co-pays in the ophthalmology, meaning ophthalmic pharmaceutical markets that typically around the $30-mark, and hence, why, I think, beyond physician skepticism about the quality of different generics, when one thinks about relative value of $30 out of pocket per month, it's still money.

Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. Growth outside the U.S. was part",2214,"Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. 
Growth outside the U.S. was particularly impressive with year-over-year growth of 29% in dollars in international markets, with Asia-Pacific growing 36%, Europe, Africa and Middle East by 30% and Latin America by 28%. 
For the first time since the spin-off of AMO a decade ago, sales outside the U.S. accounted for greater than 40% of total sales. Despite general concerns over economic growth, our cash pay markets around the world appear to be on continuing upswing, presumably as our products cater to those segments with a population who are more economically resistant. 
Furthermore, our reimbursed pharmaceutical product lines are benefiting from the many regulatory approvals secured in 2010. The only minor headwinds that we're experiencing is a higher-than-normal incidence of price cuts in Europe, given government austerity programs. The 2011 impact of which has increased from $30 million that we estimated at the start of this year to a now approximately $40 million. 
Reviewing the results for the second quarter, sales increased versus the second quarter of 2010 by 13.7% fluctuated[ph] by the weak U.S. dollar versus most currencies, but still at the strong 9.6% in local currencies. Operating performance continues to be strong with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96, marking an increase of 12.9% versus the second quarter of 2010 and above the range of expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call. Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has grown 15.3% versus the first half of 2010, supported by strong gross margin trends and even as we continue to invest in expansion overseas and in launching our new products on BOTOX indications.
In the first half of the year, we have maintained an SG&A ratio just about 40% of sales. Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses, BOTOX enjoyed good sequential growth from the first quarter and is growing at an accelerated pace as we benefit from the approvals for chronic migraine and upper limb spasticity in the U.S. as well as market growth in the U.S. aesthetic business well into double digits.  Second quarter year-over-year growth came in at 16.1% growth in dollars and 11.8% in local currencies with good growth stemming from both the therapeutics and aesthetic businesses. 
The French Regulatory Agency, AFSSAPS, made France the first country to -- European country to issue a Positive Opinion for BOTOX for urinary incontinence associated with neurogenic detrusor overactivity with a license to be issued in due course.
We await FDA regulatory action for this indication later this year. Demonstrating our scientific leadership in the field of neurotoxins, both FDA and Health Canada have approved the breakthrough cell-based assay that will permit the dramatic reduction in the use of animal based testing. We filed for approval in many countries outside the U.S. and expect the regulatory agencies in Europe and elsewhere will also shortly approve this assay. 
Since the last earnings report, BOTOX for chronic migraine has been approved in the additional countries of New Zealand, India, Turkey and Poland. The U.S. launch of the BOTOX indication for chronic migraine continues well. There's considerable physician interest in the neurology community and almost 3,500 physicians have been trained since approval, both through web-based and live injection training. About 3/4 of commercial lines now have policy coverage and here their commercial market accounts for about 2/3 of migraine prescription.
Actual number of units used by physicians has been continually trending up and is approaching the FDA indicated dose of 155 units, given access to reimbursement and given that 155 units is evidence based medicines. 
Patient awareness for this condition and new use of BOTOX remains relatively low, which points to the opportunity for the use of DTC as a later stage of the chronic migraine launch. 
Regarding upper limb spasticity in the U.S., we continue to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in focused accounts in academic medical centers. In the U.S. therapeutic market, Dysport and Xeomin remain at very low market shares. Regarding BOTOX Cosmetic, we're pleased that we've been able to contain Dysport share at about 17% procedure share since April of 2010 and should now benefit from the expanding market, which we estimate to be well into double digits. 
In late July, Merz announced the FDA approval for Xeomin cosmetic and that the product will be available nationwide by the spring of 2012. Based on market intelligence, it has been reported that there may be manufacturing difficulties contributing to these delays. As we do not fully understand what these are given that Xeomin is available for therapeutic use in the United States, we're fully ready for Xeomin cosmetic launch and have a full package of countermeasures for deployment at the appropriate moment. 
In Europe, it seems that the market despite, economic challenges, is growing low double digits, with BOTOX losing some market share to new entrants, especially in Italy and Spain, both countries where we historically enjoy extremely high market shares.
Market conditions in Latin America and Asia-Pacific remain buoyant. With the aforementioned limited market share losses, we estimate that BOTOX worldwide shares in Q1 was approximately 76%.
Turning to ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, Q2 sales increased to a gratifying 13.8% in dollars and 9.7% in local currencies, and have grown year-to-date 14.7% in dollars and 12.0% in local currencies versus 2010. 
Year-to-date, growth in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Africa and Middle East in dollars has been well above 20%, the latter being both boosted by direct selling operations in Turkey and Poland.
According to IMS, the worldwide ophthalmic market in Q1, the last period for which data is available, grew an impressive 15%, thanks, in part, to the growth of retinal therapeutics. 
In the U.S., our business is recovering from the effect of the generic of ALPHAGAN 0.15% and genericization of ACULAR, posting year-to-date acquisition dollar growth per SDI Health of 7.7% year-to-date in June and the branded ophthalmic market increased 5.7%. This is due to strong performance of LUMIGAN 0.01%, where already 38% of new prescriptions have transitioned to the new product, given its superior performance characteristics, as well as strong growth with COMBIGAN and RESTASIS. 
Since the genericization of Xalatan, the LUMIGAN franchise has only been marginally affected in volume, given low copays in this market, physician concerns about the varying quality of generics and strong formula provisions for LUMIGAN. In Q2, RESTASIS became the #1 product in value in the U.S. prescription ophthalmic market.
In Canada, thanks to the strong launch of RESTASIS with private payers, as well as the strong trajectory for LUMIGAN 0.01%, Allergan has grown in market year-to-date, May at 23%.  
OZURDEX was launched in Canada in June, as well as recently in Argentina and Colombia. In Brazil, in June, per IMS, we just surpassed Alcon to become market leader in value share for the first time in our history.  In Europe, for OZURDEX, the European Medicines Agency granted a Marketing Authorization for the additional indication of uveitis.
OZURDEX is performing strongly, especially in the important markets of Germany and France. In Italy, we received reimbursement and will introduce the product shortly. 
In the U.K., the National Institute for Clinical Excellence known as NICE recommended OZURDEX for the treatment of macular edema due to the retinal vein occlusion. In Europe, Allergan is strongly gaining share in the glaucoma market due to LUMIGAN .01%, as well as GANFORT and COMBIGAN. In Asia, we're benefiting from strong growth across most of the Asian markets. In July, OPTIVE was launched in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. In Japan, ALPHAGAN 0.2% was filed with PMDA by our partner Senju. 
Regarding facial aesthetics, Q2 sales grew very strongly at 26.9% in dollars and 20.0% in local currencies. Year-to-date, sales have increased 36.5% in dollars and 31.9% in local currencies. 
As indicated in the last earnings call, Q1 sales in the U.S. were boosted by the sell-in of the consumer directed rebate promotion, combining JUVÉDERM and BOTOX, which partly sold through in Q2. 
Around the world, we're observing very strong market growth as new consumers enter the market and existing consumers use greater volumes of products. Year-to-date, our sales in market outside the U.S. have experienced even higher growth than domestically. JUVÉDERM XC containing lidocaine was launched in Taiwan and Malaysia. Our skin care franchise enjoyed strong Q2 year-over-year growth of 10.1% in dollars and 9.6% in local currencies. LATISSE sales in Q2 declined 8.1% in dollars, but has grown year-to-date 10.5% in dollars and 9.7% in local currency. LATISSE was recently filed for approval at the European Medicines Agency.
As advised in the last earnings call, we executed in the U.S., in Q1, a promotional offer to physicians as well as a bonus program to consumers, which, of course, needed to be sold through, and therefore, affected Q2 results. We've just initiated a new DTC campaign focusing on the effects of aging on women's lashes. Based on scientific data and observations among women ages 30 plus that their lashes become thinner, shorter and lighter as they grow older. The campaign underscores that LATISSE is the only FDA product clinically proven to increase fullness, lightness, length, and darkness and is suitable for women 30 plus experiencing this effect of aging.
This further emphasize the relevance of LATISSE to women who are looking for rejuvenation therapies and the differentiation from lash conditioners that appeal to younger, more price-sensitive consumers. In support of all of this, we're also conducting a national consumer and media campaign titled LATISSE Wishes, with 35 -year-old actress and beauty trendsetter, Christina Hendricks. 
Foreign markets also made initial modest contributions to sales, with good initial uptake in Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
Regarding medical dermatology, we've experienced strong growth in the U.S. at approximate 13%. In market, we are pleased that in acquisition dollar growth, we have recorded first-half growth of 42% for ACZONE and 15% for TAZORAC. Two recent events have significantly strengthened our medical dermatology franchise. Firstly, we recently announced the acquisition of Vicept Therapeutics, which gives us an exciting program for rosacea, which will move into Phase IIb clinical development. As demonstrated by Galderma, rosacea represents a significant area of market opportunity. Secondly, FDA recently posted guidance regarding requirements for clinical bioequivalence for generic of tazarotene. 
Separately, for both psoriasis and acne, our interpretation is that this will require generics to conduct a clinical trial for both indications at risks to create the required data package. To-date, based on our review, no tazarotene bioequivalence study has been posted on clinicaltrials.gov. This potentially provides a major delay to generics after the May, June 2011 expiry of the TAZORAC patent.
Now moving on to breast aesthetics, this business enjoyed a strong quarter with 17.0% growth in dollars and 11.9% in local currencies. Year-to-date, we have recorded growth of 12.6% in dollars and 9.5% in local currency. In the U.S., we benefited from a continuing trend of market preference for higher-priced silicone gel implants, as well as good sales for our latest range of tissue expanders. Overseas, we have grown substantially in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific. At the end of August, the FDA will hold an advisory panel regarding post-marketing studies of silicone gel breast implants to discuss innovative methodological approaches to these studies, as well as the monitoring of long-term safety issues.
Due to vigorous action, we're pleased that at the end of year one, post full enrollment of our patients, we have a 60% compliance rate for the Allergan breast implant follow-up study and plan to drive this number higher. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q2 sales decreased 12.1% in dollars and 15.3% in local currency. On the same trend that the year-to-date sales decline of 13.5% in dollars and 15.7% in local currency. Commenting on the situation in the U.S, which accounts for the bulk of global sales, year-to-date May, the overall number of bariatric procedures was down 8%, although, May year-over-year was slightly better at a 4% rate of decline. 
Within the band market, LAP-BAND increased its share in May to 82% from 74% in May of 2010. However, within the overall bariatric market, sleeve gastrectomy increased its procedure share from 8% in May, 2010 to 20% in May, 2011, taking the majority of this business from bypass, but also 3 share points from bands. 
Building on the recent FDA approval of LAP-BAND for lower body mass index patients with at least one co-morbidity and recently published health economics data for the LAP-BAND, we're embarking on vigorous programs to improve reimbursement access for patients. Sales in the quarter were weak both in Australia and Canada, offset by strong sales growth in Latin America.
Finally, commenting on urology, sales decreased 10.3% in dollars, which is attributable to the impact of the genericization of the original SANCTURA product. Year-to-date, sales have declined 6.8% for the same reason, but offset by 35% growth of the new-generation SANCTURA XR product. Clearly, the next catalyst for this franchise is the anticipated FDA and the European approval to BOTOX for incontinence due to detrusor overactivity associated with the neurological condition. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards for his commentary of our financial performance."

During the second quarter of 2011, Allergan continued its strong performance trend and generated solid operating results as we produce double-digit sales growth in both our pharmaceutical and medical device businesses. These quality results were achieved in the face of costs related to U.S. Health Care Reform and ongoing Europe pricing pressures. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.96, marking a 12.9% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Allergan was able to deliver the strong second quarter earnings performance even as we maintained our commitment to progressive investing in the current and future growth drivers of the business across the commercial portfolio and our research and development pipeline. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan Q2 2011 gross margin of 86.1% increased 160 basis points when compared to Q2 2010. This increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix and better net royalty dynamics. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the second quarter was 40.2%, totaling $563 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 40.1% and $495 million, respectively. We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our current and future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010. Likewise, we are continuing to invest in the planned expansion into the emerging markets.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.2% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $212 million, an increase of spent of approximately $15 million over the first quarter of 2011 and nearly $25 million over the second quarter of 2010. 
With respect to R&D investment in 2011, Allergan continues to make substantial commitments to spending across both our medical device and pharmaceutical technology portfolios. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 48 sales while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 113 days. In the second quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $214 million. Please note that this result was affected by the $45 million upfront payment to Molecular Partners, relating to the license agreement for the DARPin anti-VEGF technology. 
At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments in cash and short term investments and net-of-debt positions total approximately $2.2 billion and $570 million, respectively.  As a reminder, we called our convertible note, which resulted in the use of approximately $809 million of our cash during the second quarter of 2011.
For the third quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,265,000,000 to $1,340,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.90. 
Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,220,000,000 and $5,370,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.59 to $3.63, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%. 
Regarding 2011 cash flow, we still expect to generate operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $900 million, excluding upfront payments for deals signed throughout 2011. 
For your information, expectations for other lines of income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. 
So with that, operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions."

In terms of preparation, a lot has been published already. I think, the urology community is extremely excited about this indication, both in United States as well as Europe and indeed other markets, because we're already approved in places like Brazil. In terms of the U.S. preparation, of course, we have the sales force available already, given our presence for SANCTURA. And just as in the case we had for chronic migraine that the margin will be adding a couple of dozens of people. But from a cost perspective, this really doesn't change anything at all, when you think about global SG&A spend. So I hope that addressed all your questions."

Basically, clearly, we've got to get distribution in place. And so in our world, that is really 2 factors. One is making sure that reimbursement is available. And as I read in my opening remarks, we've made great progress in terms of policy coverage. Also, when we look behind policy and look at the volume of insurance claims being submitted, there's very good trends for people actually getting patient coverage. And I'll say the one issue that remains, which is very normal and very actionable, is let's say less than stellar preparation of documentation in all cases, but we have reimbursement specialists who can help physicians in a very appropriate manner, with collection of documents and getting a process together. The other side, of course, is training, and I think there, you can tell also from the number I mentioned, almost 3,500 physicians, lots of interest, lots of good progress, and where we're putting all our emphasis is behind live injector training because this is the normal drill that we see in every single indication for the last 20 years. It's different area of the body, but principles remain the same. Finally, answering, specifically, DTC, as I've often mentioned, the first move will be to have an unbranded TV campaign, which is -- the purpose of which is to increase disease awareness. And I think work continuous, the work we're doing all looks very promising."

But there's persistent redness that's very bothersome to the patients, and so we looked at their proof of concept data and saw few things. One that the Vicept compound was good at decreasing the redness, so that decrease in redness was of cosmetic value to patients, and lasted a fair bit. FDA wants the treatment effect to last throughout the day. So we see an unmet need in terms of the redness. We've actually already interacted with the FDA once the deal was announced. We want to make sure we get the dosing right, concentration right, et cetera, so we have ultimate success in Phase III, which is why our plan is to do a Phase IIb, but in linking with the commercial [indiscernible], I see this is a -- still one of our big opportunities in medical dermatology."

And I think it was really connected with critical mass. And now that we not only have a much greater critical mass in ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, but we have the benefit of BOTOX Cosmetic, BOTOX Therapeutics, the facial line, the breast line and so on. You can imagine we have a really nice broad range of products that all add up to good share positions, good critical mass and therefore, good earnings power. So I was joking with some of our new South African colleagues, it was a little bit of the return of the prodigal son. Welcome back into the family. We've gone direct recently in Turkey, Poland and here too we created a joint venture in South Korea with our long-term partner, as well as taking all the aesthetics and breast businesses direct. Another market that we're working very hard and we'll be doing pretty soon is Russia. And really, then in our strategic planning, we're looking at the cadence of markets where we still have an opportunity to fill in the wide spaces. And there are still a couple of markets in Eastern Europe where the substantial populations of the same with some markets where we're not yet direct. In East Asia, another one we added recently incidentally is the Philippines. So it's all about economics. Answering your question on supply chain, that's pretty easy for us because we have such a concentrated plant distribution at work on logistics partners, that to really plug in another country is relatively simple. We usually have good relationships with our distributors. We even have many times called us so that we can very harmoniously thank them with notice and go direct. And really, probably the biggest short-term strain is for my accounting colleagues just to get them on to ASAP and bring them into our accounting systems.

So when I ask myself, what on the earth is going on, and hopefully this isn't a rerun of what we saw at the end of 2008. But it appears that our patient groups are much more skewed to, let's say, the higher income brackets, therefore, they have more resistance to absorb increased cost of food, increased cost of gasoline, increased cost of clothing, that has been going on at least in the last 6 to 12 months. So that's the way I kind of do my observations. And I look very carefully both -- not only to the U.S., but all the other markets around the world. Can I detect signs of weakness? And really, when I look through it, beyond the odd countries, I mentioned Italy and Spain. So I'm not even sure there it's an issue of economic weakness.

Clearly, we'll be monitoring this and as we start getting any positive feedback, we'll gear up, so that once we get the proof of concept data, we could go to Phase III right away. The good news is that the FDA regulatory pathway is well delineated as there are other products that have been approved. The negative is it's not quick. You've got to go through all of the steps that FDA requires and that will be 2 Phase III trials following a proof of concept study.

Well, first of all, Europe, I suppose, as we all read the news, the cuts and price reductions have been even worse than normal. And I suppose that kind of unfortunately makes sense given the squeeze that a lot of those governments find themselves in. Happily, for us, innovation and product flow always beats general economic conditions. So I'm rather pleased that I was able to quote in my opening remarks that Europe, Africa and Middle East grew by 30% in Q2, notwithstanding all the price cuts going on. If we don't look at the U.S., obviously, the same comment about products, along innovation and differentiated products very much applies. So I'm really pleased that we're in a good spot. These are relatively low exposure to Medicare. Really, when you kind of peel right through it, the only major franchise that is very Medicare-oriented is glaucoma, where, clearly, we have major position, and a growing position. But that's 11% of the mix in Medicare of worldwide sales. So it's relative. And I think the next thing that is favorable to us is the relatively low co-pays in the ophthalmology, meaning ophthalmic pharmaceutical markets that typically around the $30 mark, and hence, why, I think, beyond physician skepticism about the quality of different generics, when one thinks about relative value of $30 out of pocket per month, it's still money. But if the physician thinks that is the real product for the patient, usually, the patient will go along with that."

During the third quarter, Allergan continued to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. Growth in",2687,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During the third quarter, Allergan continued to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. 
Growth in the quarter outside the U.S. continued at an impressive late with year-over-year growth of 20% in dollars in overall international markets, with Asia-Pacific growing 27%, Latin America by 22% and Europe, Africa, Middle East by 17%. 
The latter is particularly encouraging given macro economic growth concerns in Europe and as the direct markets of Turkey and Poland are now included in the baseline of the prior year. 
With only a small new contribution to growth, we made by the new direct market of South Africa. 
Even with general concerns about economics and consumer spending, our cash pay markets around the world generally enjoyed good growth. Although there are some signs of a moderation in North America since August. 
Western Europe provided surprisingly good growth rates in most product markets in most countries despite some start external economic reports. 
Clearly, we're monetary trends very carefully. Overall, we're benefiting from the many regulatory approvals secured both in 2010 and so far in 2011. Regarding our reimbursed pharmaceutical product lines, we're now receiving notifications of several new rounds of price comps by governments in Europe as well as in South Korea, which we're factoring into our operating plan for 2012.
During the course of 2011, we have absorbed cost of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts. Initially estimates through in January of $100 million for the year, which we subsequently increased to $110 million on the second quarter earnings call. 
And now estimate about $112 million for this year. Looking ahead, we're pleased that we'll be direct in Russia in 2012 for our medical aesthetics, neurosciences and ophthalmology businesses. 
Reviewing the results for the third quarter. Sales increased versus the third quarter of 2010 by 10.0%. This was slightly by the weak dollar in most of the quarter and with local currency growth of 7.2%. 
Operating performance continued at a strong trajectory with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92, marking an increase of 17.9% versus the third quarter of 2010 and above the range of expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call. 
Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has grown 15.8% versus prior year, benefiting from strong gross margins, and even as we invest in both overseas expansion and in launching our recently improved products and new BOTOX indications. 
Year-to-date, SG&A has been just over 40% of sales on a non-GAAP basis and we've increased R&D expenditure by 12.5% versus 2010, as we reload our R&D pipeline with new exciting programs. We look forward to sharing new clinical data and insights at our R&D day at the end of March 2012.
Now commenting on the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX growth picked up across the year, as we benefited from the launches of BOTOX for chronic migraine and upper limbs spasticity in the U.S. 
Third quarter year-over-year BOTOX global growth was 16.1% in dollars and 13.1% in local currencies with good growth stemming from both the global therapeutic and aesthetic franchises.
We estimate that the global neuro modulator market encompassing all therapeutic and effective uses grow in excess of 20% in the second quarter year-over-year. 
At the margin, Allergan lost a limited share in Q2. The last period for which we can assemble worldwide data. Given the launch of Azzalure by Galderma and Merz in Europe and more limited regional competitive activity in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. 
In the U.S., for Q2, BOTOX Cosmetics still have some minor share loss year-over-year to Dysport in the anesthetic market. Nevertheless, we estimate the global sharing Q2 were 77%, down just from under 80% in Q2 of 2010. 
Going forward, we anticipate that share will be broadly stable, as we grow share on the therapeutic side further to developing our new market indications. Offset on the other hand, buy some share loss in the expanding aesthetic market.
We're very pleased with the progress of chronic migraine launch in the United States. Also, since the receipt of the license of the chronic migraine from the Irish Medicines Board of the lead country under the mutual recognition procedure, we've received additional license in German and Belgian -- German and Belgium. 
For clarification, the U.K. issued a national license in 2010 followed by several markets in Eastern Europe were not included in the mutual recognition procedure. 
Additionally, we received approval of our chronic migraine in Malaysia and Ecuador. In the U.S., position interest and adoption is progressing very well. We have conducted over 4,500 trainings of physicians with about 3,800 individual physicians trained either by the web or in live of trajectory training sessions. 
Over 80% of commercial lives now have policy coverage with the commercial market accounting for about 2/3 of migraine prescriptions of other migrane products. 
Of the Medicare Part B side, we enjoyed 100% policy coverage. Patients and physician satisfaction with BOTOX is positive and on the steadily improving trend. 
Actual number of units used by physicians continues to move toward the FDA indicated dose of 155 units given access to reimbursement and the low rates of insurance denials. 
Given this good access and the sufficient number of physicians trained and also willing to refer patients to colleagues, we initiated an unbranded direct-to-consumer advertising campaign at the end of September. We're sensing good traffic of patients searching for headache specialist on the website. 
In addition, we're conducting a patient education and awareness campaign through patients can submit in their stories and when the opportunity to recreate a loss moment due to chronic migraine. 
This campaign featuring celebrity event planner Mindy Weiss, is receiving a lot of attention in the media. 
Regarding upper limb spasticity in the U.S., we continue to experience double-digit growth in focused hospital accounts. In the U.S. therapeutic market, Dysport and Xeomin have remained low market shares. 
During the quarter, we receive approvals both in the U.S. and Europe for Botox, for urinary incontinence in adults with neurological conditions such as a spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. 
Since Ireland issued first national license, we also received the German and Danish licenses and we expect others will follow shortly. France issued a national license in this area in Q2 and we recently launched the indication in France. The U.S. launch will occur imminently. 
Good reimbursement coverage is already in place under existing injection codes. Given the U.S. approval, we to combined neurology in medical dermatology sales force and create a 2 focus in expanded sales forces. 
Regarding BOTOX Cosmetics, we are pleased that the U.S. market continues to grow strongly at a rate estimated to be close to 10% in Q2. 
In August, our survey data showed Dysport of 19% procedure share, which is ghastly higher than August 2010. Since the FDA approval of Xeomin in July, Merz recently announced their pricing which for 100 unit file is discounted by almost 20% of the price of a BOTOX, 100 unit dial. 
SEA A labeling emphasizes that bottle in the toxins are not interchangeable. Assuming labels is the duration of effect is up to 3 months, while the effect may significantly longer or shorther in individual patients. 
The BOTOX label states that the duration is up to 4 months, which clearly, offers greater patient convenience. Merz continues to communicate a full national availability will not take place until the spring of 2012. 
In Europe, we have a new syndicated industry survey showing that the ex-factory market for all users of neuromodulators in the European Union increased over 13% in value year-over-year in Q2, which is very encouraging given poor general reports on consumer spending. 
Market conditions for aesthetic procedures in BOTOX sales in Latin America and Asia remain buoyant. We're also pleased that we have received the first approval beyond the U.S. and Canada for the use of our cell-based assays for BOTOX in Switzerland. 
We continuing to work with agencies across Europe and other parts of the world for use of this breakthrough assay. 
Turning to ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, Q3 sales increased 7.5% in dollars and 4.8% to local currencies versus the third quarter of 2010. With year-to-date growth of 12.2% in dollars and 9.5% in local currencies. 
In Q3, U.S. sales were flat, which had an impact of the numbers for our key brands. Outside the U.S., sales grew strongly at over 19% in dollars for Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia grown double digits. 
Regarding real demand in the U.S., SDI held an IRI shows year-to-date acquisition dollars growth for our combined ophthalmic prescription eye drop businesses increasing 8.8% year-over-year. 
On a U.S. demand basis, both LUMIGAN and RESTASIS grew double-digit. The difference is attributable to some changes in infantry of wholesale and to increase rebates necessary to secure favorable formulary positions, both with commercial and party plans. 
We're pleased that the for the 2012 plan year for managed care, LUMIGAN has provides basis in the 12 most important lands in the U.S. Given the lower rates of hyperemia for LUMIGAN 0.1% compared to the original 0.3% LUMIGAN and physicians prescription of the efficacy of LUMIGAN, our overall prescription share and volume has not been impacted by the genericization of Xalatan with 47% of new prescriptions now being written for 0.01%. 
Our patient outreach efforts for RESTASIS continues to be successful, as we now have more than 500,000 who opted into our database. Regarding further data on end market performance, now worldwide, IMS Global shows the Xalatan grew in markets year-to-date June versus 2010 at 9% in an overall ophthalmic pharmaceutical market increasing into robust 12% in value, driven majorly by the rapid uptake of retinal therapeutics.
And our focus areas of glaucoma and dry eye and artificial tears, Allergan gained modest market share. In Europe, OZURDEX is performing strongly in the important markets of France, Germany and Italy, Spain is in the early launch phase. 
In the top 5 European markets, OZURDEX has now surpassed Mr. in sales. In the U.K., we should benefit from the recent NICE recommendation. 
In Asia with high market growth rates, we're performing well across a wide range of countries and are gaining share particularly in India, Korea, and of the small base in China and the Philippines. In Latin America, we are the fastest growing multinational ophthalmic company across a wide range of countries driven by our corporate products such as LUMIGAN, GANFORT, COMBIGAN and. Most of regional products such as RESTASIS for allergy and Zegerid, a combination of sigh Mark and ponies. 
Regarding your logics, sales increased 13.8% in Q3 year-over-year due to the genericization of the regional factor of product. Year-to-date sales have increased by 9.4% with a 20% growth of the new generation sector iStar product being insufficient to offset the impact of generics. 
Trulia now focus for the neurology sales and marketing team is the launch of BOTOX for the indicated neurologic conditions. 
Regarding facial aesthetics, growth continued in Q3 at a brisk pace of 29.1% in dollars and 24.5% in local currencies maintaining the strong trend across the year. Year-to-date, the JUVÉDERM franchise grew 34.4% in Barrows and 29.4% in local currency. The market has grown strongly in all around the world, as new consumers enter thanks to the reduction in pain associated with the introduction of lidocaine containing products and existing consumers using greater volumes. 
Outside the U.S., the introduction of JUVÉDERM VOLUMA created a new volumizing segments and added considerable growth to the overall market growth. 
Hence, we're delighted that VOLUMA with lidocaine was filed with the FDA to make this innovation available to American patients. JUVÉDERM XC containing lidocaine was recently launched in Mexico and Thailand. 
Returning to the theme of surprisingly strong growth in Europe mentioned in my earlier comments in BOTOX, filler sales in all Western European countries continued on a very strong growth trend. 
In the U.S., the third quarter sales benefited from a duet dividend promotion covering JUVÉDERM and both BOTOX cosmetics. Our skin care franchise grew in the third quarter year-over-year 81% in dollars and 7.8% in local currencies broadly in line with year-to-date performance of 11.2% in dollars and 10.8% in local currencies. 
ACZONE increased year-over-year a strong 34% in the quarter and is now the second-most prescribed branded anti-inflammatory acne drug. 
Cataracts was flat to 1.0% growth. With above-mentioned split of the medical dermatology and neurology sales force into focus unit, does was going will again received promotional support after we leard from the FDA guidance document that FDA has established higher hurdles for generics. 
Therefore, we conclude that there are unlikely to be any generics for several years. the sales were flat year-over-year with Q3 with 0.4% growth and year-to-date, they increase 7.1% in dollars and 6.3% in local currency. The bulk of the sales in the U.S. with contribution to growth to be made also by Canada, Mexico, Brazil and various markets in East Asia. 
Our consumer market research shows that our repositioning of LATISSE as an antiaging treatment along with the other products in our portfolio and targeted to win in 35 years plus is being well received. 
Equally, our new TV commercial with noncelebrity women and including a testimonial from a physician user goes very well. 
In Q3, some demand in the U.S. was curtailed, as customers awaited the trade promotion which began in October. Breast aesthetics sales increase in the third quarter year-over-year by 11.2% in dollars and by 7.5% in local currencies. Broadly in line with the year-to-date growth performance of 12.2% in dollars and 8.9% in local currencies. 
U.S. sales have benefited from the continuing trend of market preference for higher-priced silicone implants and new tissue expanded products. But the recent plastic surgery of convention, we launched an innovative technology for breast, face and body imaging in partnership with Canfield, the leading imaging company. 
Allergan contributed some recently purchased software technology to the partnership, and Canfield has incorporated this technology into their VECTRA XT hardware platform, and is also responsible for providing equipment service. 
Overseas breast aesthetics sales were strong across our markets in Latin America and Asia. However, in the U.S., we've seen softening implant sales since August. 
In Europe, sales have breast aesthetics have increased in 2011 even in economically challenged markets in Southern Europe. It is our believe that we've gained market worldwide, as we leverage the presence of our direct selling capabilities in many markets and the benefits of our full range of products and services. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q3 sales continued their downward trend declining 16.2% in dollars and 18.5% in local currencies. The core of the issue lies in the U.S. on to a lesser extent in Australia, and we believe center is an access to reimbursement, unemployment rates and out-of-pocket costs to the patient. 
Notably, overall bariatric procedures have declined in the U.S. year-to-date through August by 9%, while the South Bay market finance by credit card debt has virtually disappeared.
Within bariatric procedures, the share of bands has declined from 52% in August 2010 to 44% in August 2011 with sleeve gastrectomy increasing for the same time points from 10% to 21%. 
A bright spot was the increase in LAP-BAND share of bands from 70% to 82% in August of this year. Our key goal in the U.S. will be to increase patient access to reimbursement utilizing recently published recently published health economics data. 
The type 2 diabetes patients with the greater than 35 Body Mass Index, this data shows a 2.3 payback on the total procedure costs. 
We recently created a dedicated reimbursement group within the other than manage markets team, the same team who for years has secured great positions for our pharmaceutical brands as recently evidenced by BOTOX for chronic migraine and ophthalmics.
Beyond managed care organizations, the issue of obesity is also clearly, a government possibly issue both federally and for states with large low turnover in dominant populations. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards to comment on our financial."

During the third quarter of 2011, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. These quality results continue to be achieved in spite of cost related to U.S. Health Care Reform and ongoing Europe pricing pressures. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for that third quarter was $0.92, marking a 17.9% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. The strong third quarter earnings performance was produced even as we continue to fulfill our internal commitment to progressive investing in the current and future growth drivers of our business across the commercial portfolio and research and development pipeline. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2011 gross margin of 85.7% increase 60 basis points when compared to Q3 2010. This increase in gross margin was driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix positive manufacturing variances and positive royalty dynamics. 
The non-GAAP selling and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 39.4%, totaling $517 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 with 39.5% and $470 million, respectively. 
We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our current and future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010 and 2011. 
As mentioned in the past, we're continuing to invest in the plant expansion and into certain higher growth emerging markets, and x distributor markets. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.9% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $221 million, an increase in spend up approximately $27 million over the third quarter of 2010, as we continue to make significant commitments to spending across both our medical device and pharmaceutical technology portfolios.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 118 days. 
In the third quarter operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $291 million. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments cash and short-term investments in cash and short term investments net of debt, positions total approximately $2.3 billion and $684 million, respectively. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,330,000,000 to to $1,405,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99. 
As a reminder, when looking at year-over-year quarterly EPS growth rate for the quarter quarter, it is important to remember that in 2010, the fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit cost by renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit. 
As the fu benefit of the credit for 2010 was recorded in the fourth quarter. Adjusting the fourth quarter 2010 EPS to a confidence force then catch-up we'll provide a more comparable base to calculate fourth quarter 2011 earnings growth. 
Regarding full year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,295,000,000 and $5,370,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.62 and $3.64, which represents growth of approximately 15%.

So I've been very favorably surprised and you'll see that very clearly, in my remarks. Also in terms of trend, no signs of weakening despite all the stories of calamity coming out of your.

And basically, answering the second part of your question looking forward to 2012, I think the way to think about it is, this year, I referred to rebates. Clearly, we have to get prepared for the genericization of latanoprost and protecting our formulated positions. We have done a very capably naturally across the money also the doughnut hole which was a government mandate that costs money for rebates. And basically, as we come around the block in Q1 of 2012, all that stuff broadly has anniversaried. So the drag of 2011 borrowing stuff of the very margin doesn't really repeat itself in 2012."

I'll take the first part of your question regarding some moderation of growth in the aesthetics market. What we learned last time and certainly, we're not seeing the kind of dramatic drop offs that we saw in the recession of late, what will call it early 2009 and we've learned consumer promotions really work. That's why I refer to things like that dividends. Coupons to patients bring patience through the doctors door and also encourages them to shorten the GAAP between the first procedure on the subsequent one. So that's working very well. Also, we've now established a gigantic CRM database where patients have opted in to receive information from us. And of course, we also assist, as requested, positions how they build their own databases because we have plenty of advice that we can offer with a request it. I think the second side of part of your question was rebates in terms of really managed care and reimburse pharmaceuticals. And I think when I answer the question earlier, I think this was the year of the big increase in rebates because of protecting our formally positions against latanoprost generics, government mandated programs like the doughnut hole and pretty much we've got that under control for 2012.

This is also in correlation with positions view that the quality of latanoprost generics and probably 7 or 8 or them are not all the same.

I think at the margin, there were probably some currency in both certainly if you could look at our guidance back on the last earnings call, the dollar was weaker than it was at the end of quarter. But I think that's a the third reason. I think the other 2 reasons that no one is inventory change. Clearly, inventory and wholesale we reduced that would reduce our ex- factory sales in Q3. And then going back to the rebate collection. If you imagine that all of the formulary positions renegotiated for 2012 led to an increase in rebates and primarily due to the need to protect LUMIGAN in a preferred status position knowing that Xalatan's patent was expiring in the summer 2011 and we've done that. And I've commented how well LUMIGAN is doing in its entirety, but also how well 0.01 is doing and how that franchise will grow. Imagine we're looking at formularies for 2012. The months of rebates we are paying in 2012 are very similar to those being paid in 2011. So the increase of 2012 versus 2011 is pretty mild. And hence, that's not one of my concerns looking forward. How do I put together an operating plan for 2012 to secure both top line and bottom line growth. On RESTASIS, we watch that very carefully. One of the things that is difficult for you to follow and understand is this which from 30 trade down to 60 trade down. So a training prescription is a trading prescription or a new prescription is a new prescription. But we're still getting pickup in volume as we move more and more to 60 than on a prescription units versus 30. So was not withstanding of course, I'm looking for growth. And in those weeks when I look, it is positive numbers jump around weak year-over-year. But we have a lot of effort behind RESTASIS and we believe that both the acceptance by positions, the detailing volume and also the acceptance of patients looking at TV campaign and the print campaign we run his very positive."

So we still got some more work to do. There are still positions left or not get onto live injector training and we will continue doing that.

During the third quarter, Allergan continued to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. Growth in",2685,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During the third quarter, Allergan continued to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. 
Growth in the quarter outside the U.S. continued at an impressive late with year-over-year growth of 20% in dollars in overall international markets, with Asia-Pacific growing 27%, Latin America by 22% and Europe, Africa, Middle East by 17%. 
The latter is particularly encouraging given macroeconomic growth concerns in Europe and as the direct markets of Turkey and Poland are now included in the baseline of the prior year. 
With only a small new contribution to growth, we made by the new direct market of South Africa. 
Even with general concerns about economics and consumer spending, our cash pay markets around the world generally enjoyed good growth, although there are some signs of a moderation in North America since August. 
Western Europe provided surprisingly good growth rates in most product markets in most countries despite some stark external economic reports. 
Clearly, we're monetary trends very carefully. Overall, we're benefiting from the many regulatory approvals secured both in 2010 and so far in 2011. Regarding our reimbursed pharmaceutical product lines, we're now receiving notifications of several new rounds of price comps by governments in Europe, as well as in South Korea, which we're factoring into our operating plan for 2012.
During the course of 2011, we have absorbed cost of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts. Initially estimates in January of $100 million for the year, which we subsequently increased to $110 million on the second quarter earnings call and now estimate about $120 million for this year. Looking ahead, we're pleased that we'll be direct in Russia in 2012 for our medical aesthetics, neurosciences and ophthalmology businesses. 
Reviewing the results for the third quarter. Sales increased versus the third quarter of 2010 by 10.0%. This is slightly by the weak dollar in most of the quarter and with local currency growth of 7.2%. 
Operating performance continued on a strong trajectory with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92, marking an increase of 17.9% versus the third quarter of 2010 and above the range of expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call. 
Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has grown 15.8% versus prior year, benefiting from strong gross margins, and even as we invested both in overseas expansion and in launching our recently improved products and new BOTOX indications. 
Year-to-date SG&A has been just over 40% of sales on a non-GAAP basis, and we've increased R&D expenditure by 12.5% versus 2010, as we reload our R&D pipeline with new exciting programs. We look forward to sharing new clinical data and insights at our R&D Day at the end of March 2012.
Now commenting on the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX growth picked up across the year, as we benefited from the launches of BOTOX for chronic migraine and upper limb spasticity in the U.S. 
Third quarter year-over-year BOTOX global growth was 16.1% in dollars and 13.1% in local currencies with good growth stemming from both the global therapeutic and aesthetic franchises.
We estimate that the global neuromodulator market encompassing all therapeutic and aesthetic uses grew in excess of 20% in the second quarter year-over-year. 
At the margin, Allergan lost a limited share in Q2, the last period for which we can assemble worldwide data, given the launches of Azzalure by Galderma and Bocouture by Merz in Europe and more limited regional competitive activity in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. 
In the U.S. for Q2, BOTOX Cosmetics still have some minor share loss year-over-year to Dysport in the anesthetic market. Nevertheless, we estimate that our global share in Q2 was 77%, down from just under 80% in Q2 of 2010. 
Going forward, we anticipate that share will be broadly stable, as we grow share on the therapeutic side further to developing our new market indications, offset on the other hand, by some share loss in the expanding aesthetic market.
We're very pleased with the progress of chronic migraine launch in the United States. Also, since the receipt of the license for chronic migraine from the Irish Medicines Board of the lead country under the Mutual Recognition Procedure, we've received additional license in German and Belgian -- German and Belgium. 
For clarification, the U.K. issued a national license in 2010 followed by several markets in Eastern Europe who are not included in the Mutual Recognition Procedure. 
Additionally, we received approval for chronic migraine in Malaysia and Ecuador. In the U.S., position interest and adoption is progressing very well. We have conducted over 4,500 trainings of physicians with about 3,800 individual physicians trained either by the web or in live injector training sessions. 
Over 80% of commercial lives now have policy coverage, with the commercial market accounting for about 2/3 of migraine prescriptions of other migraine products. 
For the Medicare Part B side, we enjoy 100% policy coverage. Patient and physician satisfaction with BOTOX is positive and on a steadily improving trend. 
Actual number of units used by physicians continues to move towards the FDA indicated dose of 155 units, given access to reimbursement and a low rate of insurance denials. 
Given this good access and the sufficient number of physicians trained and also willing to refer patients to colleagues, we initiated an unbranded direct-to-consumer advertising campaign at the end of September. We're sensing good traffic of patients searching for headache specialists on the website. 
In addition, we're conducting a patient education and awareness campaign through which patients could submit their stories, and when the opportunity to recreate a lost moment due to chronic migraine. 
This campaign featuring celebrity event planner Mindy Weiss, is receiving a lot of attention in the media. Regarding upper limb spasticity in the U.S., we continue to experience double-digit growth in focused hospital accounts. In the U.S. therapeutic market, Dysport and Xeomin have remained low market shares. 
During the quarter, we received approvals both in the U.S. and Europe for BOTOX, for urinary incontinence in adults with neurological conditions, such as a spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. 
Since Ireland issued the first national license, we also received the German and Danish licenses and we expect others will follow shortly. France issued a national license in this area in Q2 and we recently launched the indication in France. The U.S. launch will occur imminently. 
Good reimbursement coverage is already in place under existing injection codes. Given the U.S. approval, we're strict to combine neurology in medical dermatology sales force and created 2 focus in expanded sales forces. 
Regarding BOTOX Cosmetics, we are pleased that the U.S. market continues to grow strongly at a rate estimated to be close to 10% in Q2. 
In August, our survey data showed Dysport at 19% procedure share, which is ghastly higher than August 2010. Since the FDA approval of Xeomin in July, Merz recently announced their pricing, which for 100-unit vial is discounted almost 20% of the price of a BOTOX 100-unit vial. 
I see labeling emphasizes that botulinum toxins are non-interchangeable. The Xeomin label states that the duration of effect is up to 3 months, while the effect may last significantly longer or shorter in individual patients. 
The BOTOX label states the duration is up to 4 months, which clearly offers greater patient convenience. Merz continues to communicate that full national availability will not take place until the spring of 2012. 
In Europe, we have a new syndicated industry survey showing that the ex-factory market for all users of neuromodulators in the European Union increased over 13% in value year-over-year in Q2, which is very encouraging given poor general reports on consumer spending. 
Market conditions for aesthetic procedures in BOTOX sales in Latin America and Asia remain buoyant. We're also pleased that we have received the first approval beyond the U.S. and Canada for the use of our cell-based assay for BOTOX in Switzerland. 
We continue to work with agencies across Europe and other parts of the world for use of this breakthrough assay. 
Turning to ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, Q3 sales increased 7.5% in dollars and 4.8% to local currencies versus the third quarter of 2010, with year-to-date growth of 12.2% in dollars and 9.5% in local currencies. 
In Q3, U.S. sales were flat, which had an impact to the numbers for our key brands. Outside the U.S., sales grew strongly at over 19% in dollars with Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia growing double digits. 
Regarding real demand in the U.S., SDI Health and IRI shows year-to-date acquisition dollars growth for our combined ophthalmic prescription eye drops businesses increasing 8.8% year-over-year. 
On a U.S. demand basis, both LUMIGAN and RESTASIS grew double digit. The difference is attributable to some changes in inventory of wholesale and to increased rebates necessary to secure favorable formulary positions both with commercial and  [indiscernible] plans. 
We're pleased that for the 2012 plan year for managed care, LUMIGAN has provided status in the 12 most important plans in the U.S. Given the lower rates of hyperemia for LUMIGAN, 0.1% compared to the original 0.3% LUMIGAN, and physician's perceptions of the efficacy of LUMIGAN, our overall prescription share and volume has not been impacted by the genericization of Xalatan, with 47% of new prescriptions now being written for 0.01%. 
Our patient outreach efforts for RESTASIS continue to be successful, as we now have more than 500,000 who've opted into our database. Regarding further data on end market performance, now worldwide, IMS Global shows that Xalatan grew end market year-to-date June versus 2010 at 9% in an overall ophthalmic pharmaceutical market increasing at a robust 12% in value, driven majorly by the rapid uptake of retinal therapeutics.
In our focus areas of glaucoma and dry eye and artificial tears, Allergan gained modest market share. In Europe, OZURDEX is performing strongly in the important markets of France, Germany and Italy. Spain is in the early launch phase. 
In the top 5 European markets, OZURDEX has now surpassed Vicodin in sales. In the U.K., we should benefit from the recent NICE recommendation. 
In Asia, with high market growth rates, we're performing well across a wide range of countries and are gaining share particularly in India, Korea, and of the small base in China and the Philippines. In Latin America, we are the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company across a wide range of countries driven by our corporate products such as LUMIGAN, GANFORT, COMBIGAN and OPTIVE, most of regional products such as Relestat for allergy and Zypred, a combination of ZYMAR and prednisolone. 
Regarding your logics, sales decreased 13.8% in Q3 year-over-year due to the genericization of the regional SANCTURA products. Year-to-date sales have decreased by 9.4% with a 20% growth of the new generation SANCTURA XR product being insufficient to offset the impact of generics. 
Truly now a focus for the neurology sales and marketing team is the launch of BOTOX for the indicated neurologic conditions. 
Regarding facial aesthetics, growth continued in Q3 at a brisk pace of 29.1% in dollars and 24.5% in local currencies, maintaining the strong trend across the year. Year-to-date, the JUVÉDERM franchise grew 34.0% in dollars and 29.4% in local currencies. The market has grown strongly in all regions around the world, as new consumers enter the market. Thanks to the reduction in pain associated with the introduction of lidocaine containing products and existing consumers using greater volumes. 
Outside the U.S., the introduction of JUVÉDERM VOLUMA created a new volumizing segment and added considerable growth to the overall market growth. 
Hence, we're delighted that VOLUMAs with lidocaine was filed with the FDA to make this innovation available to American patients. JUVÉDERM XC containing lidocaine was recently launched in Mexico and Thailand. 
Returning to the theme of surprisingly strong growth in Europe, mentioned in my earlier comments in BOTOX, filler sales in all Western European countries continued on a very strong growth trend. 
In the U.S., the third quarter sales benefited from a duet dividends promotion covering JUVÉDERM and both BOTOX Cosmetics. Our skin care franchise grew in the third quarter year-over-year of 8.1% in dollars and 7.8% in local currencies, broadly in line with year-to-date performance of 11.2% in dollars and 10.8% to local currencies. 
ACZONE increased year-over-year a strong 34% in the quarter and is now the second-most prescribed branded anti-inflammatory acne drug. 
TAZORAC was flat, 1.0% growth. With the above mentioned split the medical dermatology and neurology sales force into focus unit, TAZORAC going forward again received promotional support after we learned from an FDA guidance document that FDA has established high hurdles for tazarotene generics. 
And therefore, we conclude that there are unlikely to be any generics for several years. LATISSE sales were flat year-over-year on Q3, with 0.4% growth. And year-to-date, they increased 7.1% in dollars and 6.3% in local currencies. The bulk of the sales are in the U.S., with contribution to growth being made also by Canada, Mexico, Brazil and various markets in East Asia. 
Our consumer market research shows that our repositioning of LATISSE as an antiaging treatment along with the other products in our portfolio and targeted to women 35 years-plus is being well received.
Equally, our new TV commercial with noncelebrity women and including a testimonial from a physician user goes very well. 
In Q3, some demand in the U.S. was curtailed, as customers awaited the trade promotion which began in October. Breast aesthetics sales increased in the third quarter year-over-year by 11.2% in dollars and by 7.5% in local currencies, broadly in line with the year-to-date growth performance of 12.2% in dollars and 8.9% in local currencies. 
U.S. sales have benefited from the continuing trend of market preference for higher-priced silicone implants and new tissue expansion products. At a recent plastic surgery convention, we launched an innovative technology for breast, face and body imaging in partnership with Canfield, the leading imaging company. 
Allergan contributed some recently purchased software technology to the partnership, and Canfield has incorporated this technology into their VECTRA XT hardware platform and is also responsible for providing equipment service. 
Overseas breast aesthetics sales were strong, across our markets in Latin America and Asia. However, in the U.S., we've seen softening implant sales since August. 
In Europe, sales of breast aesthetics have increased in 2011 even in economically challenged markets in Southern Europe. It is our belief that we have gained market share worldwide, as we leverage the presence of our direct selling capabilities in many markets and the benefits of our full range of products and services. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q3 sales continued their downward track, declining 16.2% in dollars and 18.5% in local currencies. The core of the issue lies in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Australia. And we believe center is an access to reimbursement, unemployment rates and out-of-pocket costs to the patient. 
Notably, overall bariatric procedures have declined in the U.S. year-to-date through August by 9%, while the South Bay market financed by credit card debt has virtually disappeared.
Within bariatric procedures, the share of bands has declined from 52% in August 2010 to 44% in August 2011, with sleeve gastrectomy increasing for the same time points from 10% to 21%. 
A bright spot with the increase in LAP-BAND share of bands from 70% to 82% in August of this year. Our key goal in the U.S. will be to increase patient access to reimbursement, utilizing recently published health economics data. 
The type 2 diabetes patients with the greater than 35 Body Mass Index, this data shows a 2.3-year payback on the total procedure cost. 
We recently created a dedicated reimbursement group within the Allergan managing markets team, the same team who for years has secured great formulary positions for our pharmaceutical brands as recently evidenced by BOTOX for chronic migraine and ophthalmics.
Beyond managed care organizations, the issue of obesity is also clearly a government policy issue both federally and for states, with large low turnover in dominant populations. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards to comment on our financial."

During the third quarter of 2011, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. These quality results continue to be achieved in spite of cost related to U.S. Health Care Reform and ongoing Europe pricing pressures. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.92, marking a 17.9% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. This strong third quarter earnings performance was produced even as we continue to fulfill our internal commitment to progressive investing in the current and future growth drivers of our business across the commercial portfolio and research and development pipeline. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2011 gross margin of 85.7% increased 60 basis points when compared to Q3 2010. This increase in gross margins was driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix, positive manufacturing variances and positive royalty dynamics. 
The non-GAAP selling and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 39.4%, totaling $517 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 was 39.5% and $470 million, respectively. 
We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our current and future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010 and 2011. 
As mentioned in the past, we are continuing to invest in the planned expansion and into certain higher growth emerging markets, and x distributor markets. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.9% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $221 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the third quarter of 2010. As we continue to make significant commitments to spending across both our medical device and pharmaceutical technology portfolios.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 118 days. 
In the third quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $291 million. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments in cash and short-term investments net of debt positions total approximately $2.3 billion and $684 million, respectively. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,330,000,000 to $1,405,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99. 
As a reminder, when looking at year-over-year quarterly EPS growth rate for the quarter, it is important to remember that in 2010, the fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit cost by renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit, as the full-year benefit of the credit for 2010 was recorded in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusting the fourth quarter 2010 EPS to a confidence force that catch-up will provide a more comparable base to calculate fourth quarter 2011 earnings growth. 
Regarding full-year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,295,000,000 and $5,370,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.62 and $3.64, which represents growth of approximately 15%. 
For your information, expectations for all other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. 
So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

We have product markets going double digit, which to me tells me that a -- those societies place high value upon appearance, which means not only how their faces look but what kind of clothes they wear. And that's just deeply embedded in those cultures. I think it also is reflective of the fact that we are catering to probably, let's call it, the more economically favored population segment, middle and upper classes. So I've been very favorably surprised and you'll see that very clearly in my remarks. Also in terms of trend, no signs of weakening despite all the stories of calamity coming out of Europe.

Clearly, we have to get prepared for the genericization of latanoprost and protecting our formulated positions. We've done that very capably. Naturally it costs the money and also the doughnut hole which was a government mandate that costs money for rebates.

What we learned the last time and certainly, we're not seeing the kind of dramatic drop-offs that we saw in the recession of late -- well, let's call it early 2009. And we learned that consumer promotions really work. That's why I refer to things like duet dividends. Coupons to patients bring patients through the doctor's door and also encourages them to shorten the gap between the first procedure and the subsequent one. So that's working very well. Also, we've now established a gigantic CRM database where patients have opted in to receive information from us. And of course, we also assist, as requested, physicians how they build their own databases because we have plenty of advice that we can offer when they request it. I think the second sort of part of your question was rebates in terms of really managed care and reimbursed pharmaceuticals.

And I spoke to many glaucoma specialists to ask them precisely your question, where I really knew the answer but I wanted a confirmation. I think you're absolutely right in your sort of insinuation that 0.01 is much more than just a replacement for 0.03. Given the very low rates of hyperemia, yet the physicians believe in the fact that it still has virtually or maybe even the same efficacy profile as the original 0.03. It has been very much put in the position of being first-line therapy. Very important in terms of timing with the genericization of Xalatan in the summer. You can see that when you look at the script track that we have virtually been unaffected in terms both of anorexia up to the first couple of weeks, where there was a lot of turmoil in the data, as well as overall volume, where some of our competitors clearly are being affected, and their number is just starting to go down. This is also in correlation with physicians' view that the quality of latanoprost generics, and there's probably 7 or 8 of them, are not all the same. And so for newly diagnosed patients, I heard from many ophthalmologists that they will, in fact, go to LUMIGAN 0.01 as their treatment of choice and not run the risk of writing a latanoprost prescription not knowing which one, which quality might be failed.

Now if we go over to the largest and most difficult to comment business, which is the ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, there you've got various things going on. On the one side, you've got a larger delta between growth sales to net as the rebates are moved up. So then the other side, you also have mixed shift, where I'm sure this is typical of many pharmaceutical companies that you follow, where older products are lower-priced, new ones in the mix are higher price. And so we got great pickup in terms of currency versus actual number of bottles produced in our plants. And then of course, also at least in this country, we are able to post some price increases where we have strong product positioning and strong market shares."

First of all, this is, once again, Allergan in a position where we can create a market that didn't exist before. And fortunately, if we look at the environment in the products for treatment of migraine, there's very little competition these days because if we take the big products of the past Imitrex from GlaxoSmithKline, the product is now generic. So this is a fairly low-noise market where we're one of the few promoted products and the only product indicated for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine. And that's the very powerful part of being able to run an unbranded DTC campaign talking to that indication. And we knew from our market research that this should work. Of course, it's a big group of patients, 3.2 million suffers from 15 days and more, and it's all about driving people into work and they be treated to the specialists. And that's exactly what we can do through that TV campaign, where people can log on to a website to look for a physician. And there you see the commonalities of what we did years and years ago. Totally unconnected with migraine, BOTOX for leveler, for aesthetic, in terms of to find the physician too, which these days seems pretty normal. One thing Google type words, right? How do I find my outlet, my store, my physician. And we've certainly learned lots of lessons and have optimized that over the last 7 to 10 years."

When you look at the culture, clearly on all our key brands, we were lower than what most analysts, sell side analysts were looking for. I think at the margin, there was probably some currency involved. Certainly if you look at our guidance back on the last earnings call, the dollar was weaker than it was at the end of the quarter. But I think that's the third reason. I think the other 2 reasons, one is inventory change. Clearly, inventory in wholesale were reduced. That would reduce our ex-factory sales in Q3. And then going back to the rebate question. If you imagine that all of the formulary positions we negotiated for 2012 led to an increase in rebates and primarily due to the need to protect LUMIGAN in a preferred status position knowing that Xalatan's patent was expiring in the summer 2011, and we've done that. And I commented how well LUMIGAN is doing in its entirety, but also how well 0.01 is doing and how that franchise will grow. Imagine we're looking at formularies for 2012. The months of rebates we're paying in 2012 are very similar to those being paid in 2011. So the increase of 2012 versus 2011 is pretty mild. And hence, that's not one of my concerns looking forward. How do I put together an operating plan for 2012 to secure both top line and bottom line growth? On RESTASIS, we watch that very carefully. One of the things that's difficult for you to follow and understand is the switch from 30 trade count to 60 trade count. So a trailing prescription is a trailing prescription or a new prescription is a new prescription. But we're still getting pickup in volume as we move more and more to 60 than on a prescription unit versus 30. So that was not withstanding, of course, I'm looking for growth. And in most weeks when I look, it is positive. Numbers jump around weak year-over-year. But we have a lot of effort behind RESTASIS and we believe that both the acceptance by physicians, the detailing volume and also the acceptance of patients looking at the TV campaign and the print campaign we run is very positive."

There will be physicians who are happy to refer the patients in their practice to a colleague, or maybe a different colleague in the same multi-physician group practice. So we still got some more work to do. There are still physicians left who have not yet gone through live injector training, and we will continue doing that.

During the third quarter, Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. Growth in",2682,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During the third quarter, Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. 
Growth in the quarter outside the U.S. continued at an impressive rate with year-over-year growth of 20% in dollars in overall international markets, with Asia-Pacific growing 27%, Latin America by 22% and Europe, Africa, and Middle East by 17%. 
The latter is particularly encouraging given Macroeconomic growth concerns in Europe and as the direct markets of Turkey and Poland are now included in the baseline of the prior year. 
With only a small new contribution to growth, being made by the new direct market of South Africa. 
Even with general concerns about economics and consumer spending, our cash pay markets around the world generally enjoyed good growth, although there are some signs of a moderation in North America since August. 
Western Europe provided surprisingly good growth rates in most product markets in most countries despite some stark external economic reports. 
Clearly, we're monetary trends very carefully. Overall, we're benefiting from the many regulatory approvals secured both in 2010 and so far in 2011. Regarding our reimbursed pharmaceutical product lines, we're now receiving notifications of several new rounds of price cuts by governments in Europe, as well as in South Korea, which we're factoring into our operating plan for 2012.
During the course of 2011, we have absorbed costs of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts, initially estimated in January at $100 million for the year, which we subsequently increased to $110 million on the second quarter earnings call and now estimate at $112 million for this year. Looking ahead, we're pleased that we'll be direct in Russia in 2012 for our medical aesthetics, neurosciences and ophthalmology businesses. 
Reviewing the results for the third quarter. Sales increased versus the third quarter of 2010 by 10.0%, boosted slightly by the weak dollar in most of the quarter and with local currency growth at 7.2%. 
Operating performance continued on a strong trajectory with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92, marking an increase of 17.9% versus the third quarter of 2010 and above the range of expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call. 
Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has grown 15.8% versus prior year, benefiting from strong gross margins, and even as we invested both in overseas expansion and in launching our recently approved products and new BOTOX indications. 
Year-to-date SG&A has been just over 40% of sales on a non-GAAP basis, and we've increased R&D expenditure by 12.5% versus 2010, as we reload our R&D pipeline with new exciting programs. We look forward to sharing new clinical data and insights at our R&D Day at the end of March 2012.
Now commenting on the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX growth picked up across the year, as we benefited from the launches of BOTOX for chronic migraine and upper limb spasticity in the U.S. 
Third quarter year-over-year BOTOX global growth was 16.1% in dollars and 13.1% in local currencies with good growth stemming from both the global therapeutic and aesthetic franchises.
We estimate that the global neuromodulator market encompassing all therapeutic and aesthetic uses grew in excess of 20% in the second quarter year-over-year. 
At the margin, Allergan lost a limited share in Q2, the last period for which we can assemble worldwide data, given the launches of Azzalure by Galderma and Bocouture by Merz in Europe and more limited regional competitive activity in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. 
In the U.S. for Q2, BOTOX Cosmetics still have some minor share loss year-over-year to Dysport in the anesthetic market. Nevertheless, we estimate that our global share in Q2 was 77%, down from just under 80% in Q2 of 2010. 
Going forward, we anticipate that share will be broadly stable, as we grow share on the therapeutic side further to developing our new market indications, offset on the other hand, by some share loss in the expanding aesthetic market.
We're very pleased with the progress of chronic migraine launch in the United States. Also, since the receipt of the license for chronic migraine from the Irish Medicines Board of the lead country under the Mutual Recognition Procedure, we've received additional national licenses in Germany and Belgium. 
For clarification, the U.K. issued a national license in 2010 followed by several markets in Eastern Europe who are not included in the Mutual Recognition Procedure. 
Additionally, we received approval for chronic migraine in Malaysia and Ecuador. In the U.S., physician interest and adoption is progressing very well. We have conducted over 4,500 trainings of physicians with about 3,800 individual physicians trained either by the web or in live injector training sessions. 
Over 80% of commercial lives now have policy coverage, with the commercial market accounting for about 2/3 of migraine prescriptions of other migraine products. 
For the Medicare Part B side, we enjoy 100% policy coverage. Patient and physician satisfaction with BOTOX is positive and on a steadily improving trend. 
Actual number of units used by physicians continues to move towards the FDA indicated dose of 155 units, given access to reimbursement and a low rate of insurance denials. 
Given this good access and the sufficient number of physicians trained and also willing to refer patients to colleagues, we initiated an unbranded direct-to-consumer advertising campaign at the end of September. We're sensing good traffic of patients searching for headache specialists on the website. 
In addition, we're conducting a patient education and awareness campaign through which patients could submit their stories, and when the opportunity to recreate a lost moment due to chronic migraine. 
This campaign featuring celebrity event planner Mindy Weiss, is receiving a lot of attention in the media. Regarding upper limb spasticity in the U.S., we continue to experience double-digit growth in focused hospital accounts. In the U.S. therapeutic market, Dysport and Xeomin have remained low market shares. 
During the quarter, we received approvals both in the U.S. and Europe for BOTOX, for urinary incontinence in adults with neurological conditions, such as spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. 
Since Ireland issued the first national license, we also received the German and Danish licenses and we expect others will follow shortly. France issued a national license in this area in Q2 and we recently launched the indication in France. The U.S. launch will occur imminently. 
Good reimbursement coverage is already in place under existing injection codes. Given the U.S. approval, we split the combined neurology and medical dermatology sales force and created 2 focused and expanded sales forces. 
Regarding BOTOX Cosmetics, we are pleased that the U.S. market continues to grow strongly at a rate estimated to be close to 10% in Q2. 
In August, our survey data showed Dysport at 19% procedure share, which is scarcely higher than August 2010. Since the FDA approval of Xeomin in July, Merz recently announced their pricing, which for 100-unit vial is discounted almost 20% of the price of a BOTOX 100-unit vial. 
FDA labeling emphasizes that botulinum toxins are non-interchangeable. The Xeomin label states that the duration of effect is up to 3 months, while the effect may last significantly longer or shorter in individual patients. 
The BOTOX label states the duration is up to 4 months, which clearly offers greater patient convenience. Merz continues to communicate that full national availability will not take place until the spring of 2012. 
In Europe, we have a new syndicated industry survey showing that the ex-factory market for all users of neuromodulators in the European Union increased over 13% in value year-over-year in Q2, which is very encouraging given poor general reports on consumer spending. 
Market conditions for aesthetic procedures in BOTOX sales in Latin America and Asia remain buoyant. We're also pleased that we have received the first approval beyond the U.S. and Canada for the use of our cell-based assay for BOTOX in Switzerland. 
We continue to work with agencies across Europe and other parts of the world for use of this breakthrough assay. 
Turning to ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, Q3 sales increased 7.5% in dollars and 4.8% to local currencies versus the third quarter of 2010, with year-to-date growth of 12.2% in dollars and 9.5% in local currencies. 
In Q3, U.S. sales were flat, which had an impact to the numbers for our key brands. Outside the U.S., sales grew strongly at over 19% in dollars with Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia growing double digits. 
Regarding real demand in the U.S., SDI Health and IRI shows year-to-date acquisition dollars growth for our combined ophthalmic prescription eye drops businesses increasing 8.8% year-over-year. 
On a U.S. demand basis, both LUMIGAN and RESTASIS grew double digit. The difference is attributable to some changes in inventory of wholesale and to increased rebates necessary to secure favorable formulary positions both with commercial and part D[ph] plans. 
We're pleased that for the 2012 plan year for managed care, LUMIGAN has preferred status in the 12 most important plans in the U.S. Given the lower rates of hyperemia for LUMIGAN, 0.01% compared to the original 0.03% LUMIGAN, and physician's perceptions of the efficacy of LUMIGAN, our overall prescription share and volume has not been impacted by the genericization of Xalatan, with 47% of new prescriptions now being written for 0.01%. 
Our patient outreach efforts for RESTASIS continue to be successful, as we now have more than 500,000 who've opted into our database. Regarding further data on end market performance, now worldwide, IMS Global shows that Xalatan grew end market year-to-date June versus 2010 at 9% in an overall ophthalmic pharmaceutical market increasing at a robust 12% in value, driven majorly by the rapid uptake of retinal therapeutics.
In our focus areas of glaucoma and dry eye and artificial tears, Allergan gained modest market share. In Europe, OZURDEX is performing strongly in the important markets of France, Germany and Italy. Spain is in the early launch phase. 
In the top 5 European markets, OZURDEX has now surpassed Vicodin in sales. In the U.K., we should benefit from the recent NICE recommendation. 
In Asia, with high market growth rates, we're performing well across a wide range of countries and are gaining share particularly in India, Korea, and off the small base in China and the Philippines. In Latin America, we are the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company across a wide range of countries driven by our corporate products such as LUMIGAN, GANFORT, COMBIGAN and OPTIVE, but also by regional products such as Relestat for allergy and Zypred, a combination of ZYMAR and prednisolone. 
Regarding Euro[ph]  logics, sales decreased 13.8% in Q3 year-over-year due to the genericization of the regional SANCTURA products. Year-to-date sales have decreased by 9.4% with a 20% growth of the new generation SANCTURA XR product being insufficient to offset the impact of generics. 
Truly now a focus for the neurology sales and marketing team is the launch of BOTOX for the indicated neurologic conditions. 
Regarding facial aesthetics, growth continued in Q3 at a brisk pace of 29.1% in dollars and 24.5% in local currencies, maintaining the strong trend across the year. Year-to-date, the JUVÉDERM franchise grew 34.0% in dollars and 29.4% in local currencies. The market has grown strongly in all regions around the world, as new consumers enter the market, thanks to the reduction in pain associated with the introduction of lidocaine containing products and existing consumers using greater volumes. 
Outside the U.S., the introduction of JUVÉDERM VOLUMA created a new volumizing segment and added considerable growth to the overall market growth. 
Hence, we're delighted that VOLUMAs with lidocaine was filed with the FDA to make this innovation available to American patients. JUVÉDERM XC containing lidocaine was recently launched in Mexico and Thailand. 
Returning to the theme of surprisingly strong growth in Europe, mentioned in my earlier comments in BOTOX, filler sales in all Western European countries continued on a very strong growth trend. 
In the U.S., the third quarter sales benefited from a duet dividends promotion covering JUVÉDERM and both BOTOX Cosmetics. Our skin care franchise grew in the third quarter year-over-year of 8.1% in dollars and 7.8% in local currencies, broadly in line with year-to-date performance of 11.2% in dollars and 10.8% to local currencies. 
ACZONE increased year-over-year a strong 34% in the quarter and is now the second-most prescribed branded anti-inflammatory acne drug. 
TAZORAC was flat at 1.0% growth. With the above-mentioned split the medical dermatology and neurology sales force into a focused unit, TAZORAC will, going forward again, receive promotional support,after we learned from an FDA guidance document that FDA has established high hurdles for tazarotene generics. 
And therefore, we conclude that there are unlikely to be any generics for several years. LATISSE sales were flat year-over-year on Q3, with 0.4% growth. And year-to-date, they increased 7.1% in dollars and 6.3% in local currencies. The bulk of the sales are in the U.S., with contribution to growth being made also by Canada, Mexico, Brazil and various markets in East Asia. 
Our consumer market research shows that our repositioning of LATISSE as an antiaging treatment along with the other products in our portfolio and targeted to women 35 years-plus is being well received.
Equally, our new TV commercial with noncelebrity women and including a testimonial from a physician user scores very well. 
In Q3, some demand in the U.S. was curtailed, as customers awaited a trade promotion which began in October. Breast aesthetics sales increased in the third quarter year-over-year by 11.2% in dollars and by 7.5% in local currencies, broadly in line with the year-to-date growth performance of 12.2% in dollars and 8.9% in local currencies. 
U.S. sales have benefited from the continuing trend of market preference for higher-priced silicone implants and new tissue expansion products. At a recent plastic surgery convention, we launched an innovative technology for breast, face and body imaging in partnership with Canfield, the leading imaging company. 
Allergan contributed some recently purchased software technology to the partnership, and Canfield has incorporated this technology into their VECTRA XT hardware platform and is also responsible for providing equipment service. 
Overseas breast aesthetics sales were strong, across our markets in Latin America and Asia. However, in the U.S., we've seen softening implant sales since August. 
In Europe, sales of breast aesthetics have increased in 2011 even in economically challenged markets in Southern Europe. It is our belief that we have gained market share worldwide, as we leverage the presence of our direct selling capabilities in many markets and the benefits of our full range of products and services. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q3 sales continued their downward track, declining 16.2% in dollars and 18.5% in local currencies. The core of the issue lies in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Australia. And we believe centers on access to reimbursement, unemployment rates and out-of-pocket costs to the patient. 
Notably, overall bariatric procedures have declined in the U.S. year-to-date through August by 9%, while the South Bay market financed by credit card debt has virtually disappeared.
Within bariatric procedures, the share of bands has declined from 52% in August 2010 to 44% in August 2011, with sleeve gastrectomy increasing for the same time points from 10% to 21%. 
A bright spot with the increase in LAP-BAND share of bands from 70% to 82% in August of this year. Our key goal in the U.S. will be to increase patient access to reimbursement, utilizing recently published health economics data. 
In type 2 diabetes patients with a greater than 35 Body Mass Index, this data shows a 2.3-year payback on the total procedure costs. 
We recently created a dedicated reimbursement group within the Allergan managing markets team, the same team who for years has secured great formulary positions for our pharmaceutical brands as recently evidenced by BOTOX for chronic migraine and ophthalmics.
Beyond managed care organizations, the issue of obesity is also clearly a government policy issue both federally and for states, with large low turnover employment [ph] populations. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards to comment on our financial."

During the third quarter of 2011, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. These quality results continue to be achieved in spite of costs related to U.S. Health Care Reform and ongoing Europe pricing pressures. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.92, marking a 17.9% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. This strong third quarter earnings performance was produced even as we continue to fulfill our internal commitment to progressive investing in the current and future growth drivers of our business across the commercial portfolio and research and development pipeline. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2011 gross margin of 85.7% increased 60 basis points when compared to Q3 2010. This increase in gross margins was driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix, positive manufacturing variances and positive royalty dynamics. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 39.4%, totaling $517 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 39.5% and $470 million, respectively. 
We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our current and future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010 and 2011. 
As mentioned in the past, we are continuing to invest in the planned expansion into certain higher growth emerging markets, and x distributor markets. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.9% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $221 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the third quarter of 2010. As we continue to make significant commitments to spending across both our medical device and pharmaceutical technology portfolios.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 118 days. 
In the third quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $291 million. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments in cash and short-term investments net of debt positions total approximately $2.3 billion and $684 million, respectively. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,330,000,000 to $1,405,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99. 
As a reminder, when looking at year-over-year quarterly EPS growth rate for the quarter, it is important to remember that in 2010, the fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit cost by renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit, as the full-year benefit of the credit for 2010 was recorded in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusting the fourth quarter 2010 EPS to account for this $0.04 catch-up will provide a more comparable base to calculate fourth quarter 2011 earnings growth. 
Regarding full-year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,295,000,000 and $5,370,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.62 and $3.64, which represents growth of approximately 15%. 
For your information, expectations for all other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.

They're very used to deploying cystoscopes, so it's really down to the details of what individual cystoscope and needles does the individual neurologist like. And then, walking them through the normal process so how do you get access to reimbursement. So I think that's looking fine in terms of the set up. In Europe, we're just beginning to get the licenses. As I stated, the big one really is Germany, both in terms of its investments and its healthcare system and overall population. And I've also stated that France we've already got going. The launch was roughly 4 weeks ago. After that, the even bigger market will be for idiopathic overactive bladder, but that's still at the order of magnitude roughly plus/minus 2 years away, just to keep things in the right context."

But I think there are signs that it's moderated a little bit and we just watch that very carefully. Now on the offset, when I look at a lot of our European numbers and even the ones in southern Europe, where reading the newspaper, you'd think that business would have to be terrible. We have product markets growing double digit, which to me tells me that a -- those societies place high value upon appearance, which means not only how their faces look but what kind of clothes they wear. And that's just deeply embedded in those cultures. I think it also is reflective of the fact that we are catering to probably, let's call it, the more economically-favored population segment, middle and upper classes. So I've been very favorably surprised and you'll see that very clearly in my remarks. Also in terms of trend, no signs of weakening despite all the stories of calamity coming out of Europe. And then of course, when you move down to Latin America and across to Asia, things are really humming. And we're very well positioned for a lot of growth."

Clearly, we had to get prepared for the genericization of latanoprost and protecting our formulated positions. We've done that very capably. Naturally it costs the money and also the doughnut hole which was a government mandate that costs money for rebates.

What we learned the last time and certainly, we're not seeing the kind of dramatic drop-offs that we saw in the recession of late -- well, let's call it early 2009. And we learned that consumer promotions really work. That's why I refer to things like duet dividends. Coupons to patients bring patients through the doctor's door and also encourages them to shorten the gap between the first procedure and the subsequent one. So that's working very well. Also, we've now established a gigantic CRM database where patients have opted in to receive information from us. And of course, we also assist, as requested, physicians how they build their own databases because we have plenty of advice that we can offer when they request it. I think the second sort of part of your question was rebates in terms of really managed care and reimbursed pharmaceuticals. And I think when I answered the question earlier, I think this was the year of the big increase in rebates because of protecting our primary physicians against latanoprost generics, government mandated programs like the doughnut hole and pretty much we've got that under control for 2012.

And in those markets where, outside Europe, where there are limited number of products available, the introduction of VOLUMA has really had quite a dramatic effect on not just our business, but total market growth. And within Europe, I remarked several times in my comments, who would guess that the European market is growing really, really fast for fillers. And I think part of the explanation is VOLUMA."

And then, I'll see if my ophthalmology physician expert will catch me out for anything I've missed. So literally, this weekend, we have been to Orlando, Florida, the convention with 25,000 of our best friends in ophthalmology and that was the overall attendee number for the American Academy of Ophthalmology with many, many physicians, of course, also coming from overseas. And I spoke to many glaucoma specialists to ask them precisely your question, where I really knew the answer but I wanted confirmation. I think you're absolutely right in your sort of insinuation that 0.01 is much more than just a replacement for 0.03. Given the very low rates of hyperemia, yet the physicians belief in the fact that it still has virtually or maybe even the same efficacy profile as the original 0.03. It has been very much put in the position of being first-line therapy. Very important in terms of timing with the genericization of Xalatan in the summer. You can see that when you look at the script track that we have virtually been unaffected in terms both of anorex share up to the first couple of weeks, where there was a lot of turmoil in the data, as well as overall volume, where some of our competitors clearly are being affected, and their numbers are starting to go down. This is also in correlation with physicians' view that the quality of latanoprost generics, and there's probably 7 or 8 of them, are not all the same. And so for newly diagnosed patients, I heard from many ophthalmologists that they will, in fact, go to LUMIGAN 0.01 as their treatment of choice and not run the risk of writing a latanoprost prescription not knowing which one, which quality might be filled. Anything I miss, Scott."

Now of course, when you step back and look at the aesthetic market, it's, to me, quite astounding that when we look at the 2011 market, it's substantially bigger than the markets were prerecession even in the glory year of 2008. So that shows you the mega trends of aesthetic growth notwithstanding economic ups and downs. So I think in your overall conclusion, you're probably directionally right that the share of the aesthetic franchise in this coming 5-year time period will be a little bit less. But of course, I do very much predict the continued growth of these aesthetic markets and the filler numbers are particularly astounding. But we're still seeing easily double-digit growth of BOTOX for the cosmetic and neuromodulators market worldwide."

Well first of all, if you look at the BOTOX side, now happily, thinking of anesthetics, there we don't have any rebates for governments or managed care. Now we do have promotions, which affect gross to net but we know they really work. If we then go to BOTOX therapeutics, that is also an area where there are very low or no rebates. So the numbers you see in terms of local currency growth are pretty close to volume growth. Now if we go over to the largest and most difficult to comment business, which is the ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, there you've got various things going on. On the one side, you've got a larger delta between growth sales to net as the rebates have moved up. So then the other side, you also have makeshift, where I'm sure this is typical of many pharmaceutical companies that you follow, where older products are lower-priced, new ones in the mix are higher price. And so we got great pickup in terms of currency versus actual number of bottles produced in our plants. And then of course, also at least in this country, we are able to post some price increases where we have strong product positioning and strong market shares."

First of all, this is, once again, Allergan in a position where we can create a market that didn't exist before. And fortunately, if we look at the environment in the products for treatment of migraine, there's very little competition these days because if we take the big products of the past Imitrex from GlaxoSmithKline, the product is now generic. So this is a fairly low-noise market where we're one of the few promoted products and the only product indicated for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine. And that's the very powerful part of being able to run an unbranded DTC campaign talking to that indication. And we knew from our market research that this should work. Of course, it's a big group of patients, 3.2 million sufferers from 15 days and more, and it's all about driving people into work and they be treated to the specialists. And that's exactly what we can do through that TV campaign, where people can log on to a website to look for a physician. And there you see the commonalities of what we did years and years ago. Totally unconnected with migraine, BOTOX for leveler, for aesthetic, in terms of the ""find a physician tool"", which these days seems pretty normal when one thinks of a Google type world, right? How do I find my outlet, my store, my physician. And we've certainly learned lots of lessons and have optimized that over the last 7 to 10 years."

When you look at the quarter, clearly on all our key brands, we were lower than what most analysts, outside analysts, were looking for. I think at the margin, there was probably some currency involved. Certainly if you look at our guidance back on the last earnings call, the dollar was weaker than it was at the end of the quarter. But I think that's the third reason. I think the other 2 reasons, one is inventory change. Clearly,if inventory in wholesale were reduced, that would reduce our ex-factory sales in Q3. And then going back to the rebate question. If you imagine that all of the formulary positions we negotiated for 2012 led to an increase in rebates and primarily due to the need to protect LUMIGAN in a preferred status position knowing that Xalatan's patent was expiring in the summer 2011, and we've done that. And I commented how well LUMIGAN is doing in its entirety, but also how well 0.01 is doing and how that franchise will grow. Imagine we're looking at formularies for 2012. The months of rebates we're paying in 2012 are very similar to those being paid in 2011. So the increase of 2012 versus 2011 is pretty mild. And hence, that's not one of my concerns looking forward. How do I put together an operating plan for 2012 to secure both top line and bottom line growth? On RESTASIS, we watch that very carefully. One of the things that's difficult for you to follow and understand is the switch from 30 trade count to 60 trade count. So a trailing prescription is a trailing prescription or a new prescription is a new prescription. But we're still getting pickup in volume as we move more and more to 60 on a prescription unit versus 30. So that was notwithstanding, of course, I'm looking for growth. And in most weeks when I look, it is positive. Numbers jump around week year-over-year. But we have a lot of effort behind RESTASIS and we believe that both the acceptance by physicians, the detailing volume and also the acceptance of patients looking at the TV campaign and the print campaign we run is very positive."

During the third quarter, Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. Growth in",2684,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During the third quarter, Allergan continues to enjoy double-digit earnings and sales growth, driven by a wide range of products and franchises and across many countries around the world. 
Growth in the quarter outside the U.S. continued at an impressive rate with year-over-year growth of 20% in dollars in overall international markets, with Asia-Pacific growing 27%, Latin America by 22% and Europe, Africa, and Middle East by 17%. 
The latter is particularly encouraging given macroeconomic growth concerns in Europe and as the direct markets of Turkey and Poland are now included in the baseline of the prior year. 
With only a small new contribution to growth, being made by the new direct market of South Africa. 
Even with general concerns about economics and consumer spending, our cash pay markets around the world generally enjoyed good growth, although there are some signs of a moderation in North America since August. 
Western Europe provided surprisingly good growth rates in most product markets in most countries despite some stark external economic reports. 
Clearly, we're monetary trends very carefully. Overall, we're benefiting from the many regulatory approvals secured both in 2010 and so far in 2011. Regarding our reimbursed pharmaceutical product lines, we're now receiving notifications of several new rounds of price cuts by governments in Europe, as well as in South Korea, which we're factoring into our operating plan for 2012.
During the course of 2011, we have absorbed costs of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts, initially estimated in January at $100 million for the year, which we subsequently increased to $110 million on the second quarter earnings call and now estimate at $112 million for this year. Looking ahead, we're pleased that we'll be direct in Russia in 2012 for our medical aesthetics, neurosciences and ophthalmology businesses. 
Reviewing the results for the third quarter. Sales increased versus the third quarter of 2010 by 10.0%, boosted slightly by the weak dollar in most of the quarter and with local currency growth at 7.2%. 
Operating performance continued on a strong trajectory with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92, marking an increase of 17.9% versus the third quarter of 2010 and above the range of expectations provided at the time of the last earnings call. 
Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has grown 15.8% versus prior year, benefiting from strong gross margins, and even as we invested both in overseas expansion and in launching our recently approved products and new BOTOX indications. 
Year-to-date SG&A has been just over 40% of sales on a non-GAAP basis, and we've increased R&D expenditure by 12.5% versus 2010, as we reload our R&D pipeline with new exciting programs. We look forward to sharing new clinical data and insights at our R&D Day at the end of March 2012.
Now commenting on the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX growth picked up across the year, as we benefited from the launches of BOTOX for chronic migraine and upper limb spasticity in the U.S. 
Third quarter year-over-year BOTOX global growth was 16.1% in dollars and 13.1% in local currencies with good growth stemming from both the global therapeutic and aesthetic franchises.
We estimate that the global neuromodulator market encompassing all therapeutic and aesthetic uses grew in excess of 20% in the second quarter year-over-year. 
At the margin, Allergan lost a limited share in Q2, the last period for which we can assemble worldwide data, given the launches of Azzalure by Galderma and Bocouture by Merz in Europe and more limited regional competitive activity in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. 
In the U.S. for Q2, BOTOX Cosmetics still have some minor share loss year-over-year to Dysport in the anesthetic market. Nevertheless, we estimate that our global share in Q2 was 77%, down from just under 80% in Q2 of 2010. 
Going forward, we anticipate that share will be broadly stable, as we grow share on the therapeutic side further to developing our new market indications, offset on the other hand, by some share loss in the expanding aesthetic market.
We're very pleased with the progress of chronic migraine launch in the United States. Also, since the receipt of the license for chronic migraine from the Irish Medicines Board of the lead country under the Mutual Recognition Procedure, we've received additional national licenses in Germany and Belgium. 
For clarification, the U.K. issued a national license in 2010 followed by several markets in Eastern Europe who are not included in the Mutual Recognition Procedure. 
Additionally, we received approval for chronic migraine in Malaysia and Ecuador. In the U.S., physician interest and adoption is progressing very well. We have conducted over 4,500 trainings of physicians with about 3,800 individual physicians trained either by the web or in live injector training sessions. 
Over 80% of commercial lives now have policy coverage, with the commercial market accounting for about 2/3 of migraine prescriptions of other migraine products. 
For the Medicare Part B side, we enjoy 100% policy coverage. Patient and physician satisfaction with BOTOX is positive and on a steadily improving trend. 
Actual number of units used by physicians continues to move towards the FDA indicated dose of 155 units, given access to reimbursement and a low rate of insurance denials. 
Given this good access and the sufficient number of physicians trained and also willing to refer patients to colleagues, we initiated an unbranded direct-to-consumer advertising campaign at the end of September. We're sensing good traffic of patients searching for headache specialists on the website. 
In addition, we're conducting a patient education and awareness campaign through which patients could submit their stories, and when the opportunity to recreate a lost moment due to chronic migraine. 
This campaign featuring celebrity event planner Mindy Weiss, is receiving a lot of attention in the media. Regarding upper limb spasticity in the U.S., we continue to experience double-digit growth in focused hospital accounts. In the U.S. therapeutic market, Dysport and Xeomin have remained low market shares. 
During the quarter, we received approvals both in the U.S. and Europe for BOTOX, for urinary incontinence in adults with neurological conditions, such as spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. 
Since Ireland issued the first national license, we also received the German and Danish licenses and we expect others will follow shortly. France issued a national license in this area in Q2 and we recently launched the indication in France. The U.S. launch will occur imminently. 
Good reimbursement coverage is already in place under existing injection codes. Given the U.S. approval, we split the combined neurology and medical dermatology sales force and created 2 focused and expanded sales forces. 
Regarding BOTOX Cosmetics, we are pleased that the U.S. market continues to grow strongly at a rate estimated to be close to 10% in Q2. 
In August, our survey data showed Dysport at 19% procedure share, which is scarcely higher than August 2010. Since the FDA approval of Xeomin in July, Merz recently announced their pricing, which for 100-unit vial is discounted almost 20% of the price of a BOTOX 100-unit vial. 
FDA labeling emphasizes that botulinum toxins are non-interchangeable. The Xeomin label states that the duration of effect is up to 3 months, while the effect may last significantly longer or shorter in individual patients. 
The BOTOX label states the duration is up to 4 months, which clearly offers greater patient convenience. Merz continues to communicate that full national availability will not take place until the spring of 2012. 
In Europe, we have a new syndicated industry survey showing that the ex-factory market for all users of neuromodulators in the European Union increased over 13% in value year-over-year in Q2, which is very encouraging given poor general reports on consumer spending. 
Market conditions for aesthetic procedures in BOTOX sales in Latin America and Asia remain buoyant. We're also pleased that we have received the first approval beyond the U.S. and Canada for the use of our cell-based assay for BOTOX in Switzerland. 
We continue to work with agencies across Europe and other parts of the world for use of this breakthrough assay. 
Turning to ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, Q3 sales increased 7.5% in dollars and 4.8% to local currencies versus the third quarter of 2010, with year-to-date growth of 12.2% in dollars and 9.5% in local currencies. 
In Q3, U.S. sales were flat, which had an impact to the numbers for our key brands. Outside the U.S., sales grew strongly at over 19% in dollars with Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia growing double digits. 
Regarding real demand in the U.S., SDI Health and IRI shows year-to-date acquisition dollars growth for our combined ophthalmic prescription eye drops businesses increasing 8.8% year-over-year. 
On a U.S. demand basis, both LUMIGAN and RESTASIS grew double digit. The difference is attributable to some changes in inventory of wholesale and to increased rebates necessary to secure favorable formulary positions both with commercial and part D [ph] plans. 
We're pleased that for the 2012 plan year for managed care, LUMIGAN has preferred status in the 12 most important plans in the U.S. Given the lower rates of hyperemia for LUMIGAN, 0.01% compared to the original 0.03% LUMIGAN, and physician's perceptions of the efficacy of LUMIGAN, our overall prescription share and volume has not been impacted by the genericization of Xalatan, with 47% of new prescriptions now being written for 0.01%. 
Our patient outreach efforts for RESTASIS continue to be successful, as we now have more than 500,000 who've opted into our database. Regarding further data on end market performance, now worldwide, IMS Global shows that Xalatan grew end market year-to-date June versus 2010 at 9% in an overall ophthalmic pharmaceutical market increasing at a robust 12% in value, driven majorly by the rapid uptake of retinal therapeutics.
In our focus areas of glaucoma and dry eye and artificial tears, Allergan gained modest market share. In Europe, OZURDEX is performing strongly in the important markets of France, Germany and Italy. Spain is in the early launch phase. 
In the top 5 European markets, OZURDEX has now surpassed Vicodin in sales. In the U.K., we should benefit from the recent NICE recommendation. 
In Asia, with high market growth rates, we're performing well across a wide range of countries and are gaining share particularly in India, Korea, and off the small base in China and the Philippines. In Latin America, we are the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company across a wide range of countries driven by our corporate products such as LUMIGAN, GANFORT, COMBIGAN and OPTIVE, but also by regional products such as Relestat for allergy and Zypred, a combination of ZYMAR and prednisolone. 
Regarding Euro [ph] logics, sales decreased 13.8% in Q3 year-over-year due to the genericization of the regional SANCTURA products. Year-to-date sales have decreased by 9.4% with a 20% growth of the new generation SANCTURA XR product being insufficient to offset the impact of generics. 
Truly now a focus for the neurology sales and marketing team is the launch of BOTOX for the indicated neurologic conditions. 
Regarding facial aesthetics, growth continued in Q3 at a brisk pace of 29.1% in dollars and 24.5% in local currencies, maintaining the strong trend across the year. Year-to-date, the JUVÉDERM franchise grew 34.0% in dollars and 29.4% in local currencies. The market has grown strongly in all regions around the world, as new consumers enter the market, thanks to the reduction in pain associated with the introduction of lidocaine containing products and existing consumers using greater volumes. 
Outside the U.S., the introduction of JUVÉDERM VOLUMA created a new volumizing segment and added considerable growth to the overall market growth. 
Hence, we're delighted that VOLUMAs with lidocaine was filed with the FDA to make this innovation available to American patients. JUVÉDERM XC containing lidocaine was recently launched in Mexico and Thailand. 
Returning to the theme of surprisingly strong growth in Europe, mentioned in my earlier comments in BOTOX, filler sales in all Western European countries continued on a very strong growth trend. 
In the U.S., the third quarter sales benefited from a duet dividends promotion covering JUVÉDERM and both BOTOX Cosmetics. Our skin care franchise grew in the third quarter year-over-year of 8.1% in dollars and 7.8% in local currencies, broadly in line with year-to-date performance of 11.2% in dollars and 10.8% to local currencies. 
ACZONE increased year-over-year a strong 34% in the quarter and is now the second-most prescribed branded anti-inflammatory acne drug. 
TAZORAC was flat at 1.0% growth. With the above-mentioned split the medical dermatology and neurology sales force into a focused unit, TAZORAC will, going forward again, receive promotional support,after we learned from an FDA guidance document that FDA has established high hurdles for tazarotene generics. 
And therefore, we conclude that there are unlikely to be any generics for several years. LATISSE sales were flat year-over-year on Q3, with 0.4% growth. And year-to-date, they increased 7.1% in dollars and 6.3% in local currencies. The bulk of the sales are in the U.S., with contribution to growth being made also by Canada, Mexico, Brazil and various markets in East Asia. 
Our consumer market research shows that our repositioning of LATISSE as an antiaging treatment along with the other products in our portfolio and targeted to women 35 years-plus is being well received.
Equally, our new TV commercial with noncelebrity women and including a testimonial from a physician user scores very well. 
In Q3, some demand in the U.S. was curtailed, as customers awaited a trade promotion which began in October. Breast aesthetics sales increased in the third quarter year-over-year by 11.2% in dollars and by 7.5% in local currencies, broadly in line with the year-to-date growth performance of 12.2% in dollars and 8.9% in local currencies. 
U.S. sales have benefited from the continuing trend of market preference for higher-priced silicone implants and new tissue expansion products. At a recent plastic surgery convention, we launched an innovative technology for breast, face and body imaging in partnership with Canfield, the leading imaging company. 
Allergan contributed some recently purchased software technology to the partnership, and Canfield has incorporated this technology into their VECTRA XT hardware platform and is also responsible for providing equipment service. 
Overseas breast aesthetics sales were strong, across our markets in Latin America and Asia. However, in the U.S., we've seen softening implant sales since August. 
In Europe, sales of breast aesthetics have increased in 2011 even in economically challenged markets in Southern Europe. It is our belief that we have gained market share worldwide, as we leverage the presence of our direct selling capabilities in many markets and the benefits of our full range of products and services. 
Regarding the obesity intervention line, Q3 sales continued their downward track, declining 16.2% in dollars and 18.5% in local currencies. The core of the issue lies in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Australia. And we believe centers on access to reimbursement, unemployment rates and out-of-pocket costs to the patient. 
Notably, overall bariatric procedures have declined in the U.S. year-to-date through August by 9%, while the South Bay market financed by credit card debt has virtually disappeared.
Within bariatric procedures, the share of bands has declined from 52% in August 2010 to 44% in August 2011, with sleeve gastrectomy increasing for the same time points from 10% to 21%. 
A bright spot with the increase in LAP-BAND share of bands from 70% to 82% in August of this year. Our key goal in the U.S. will be to increase patient access to reimbursement, utilizing recently published health economics data. 
In type 2 diabetes patients with a greater than 35 Body Mass Index, this data shows a 2.3-year payback on the total procedure costs. 
We recently created a dedicated reimbursement group within the Allergan managing markets team, the same team who for years has secured great formulary positions for our pharmaceutical brands as recently evidenced by BOTOX for chronic migraine and ophthalmics.
Beyond managed care organizations, the issue of obesity is also clearly a government policy issue both federally and for states, with large low turnover employment [ph] populations. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards to comment on our financial."

During the third quarter of 2011, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. These quality results continue to be achieved in spite of costs related to U.S. Health Care Reform and ongoing Europe pricing pressures. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.92, marking a 17.9% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. This strong third quarter earnings performance was produced even as we continue to fulfill our internal commitment to progressive investing in the current and future growth drivers of our business across the commercial portfolio and research and development pipeline. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2011 gross margin of 85.7% increased 60 basis points when compared to Q3 2010. This increase in gross margins was driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, favorable product mix, positive manufacturing variances and positive royalty dynamics. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 39.4%, totaling $517 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 39.5% and $470 million, respectively. 
We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our current and future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010 and 2011. 
As mentioned in the past, we are continuing to invest in the planned expansion into certain higher growth emerging markets, and x distributor markets. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.9% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $221 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the third quarter of 2010. As we continue to make significant commitments to spending across both our medical device and pharmaceutical technology portfolios.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 118 days. 
In the third quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $291 million. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments in cash and short-term investments net of debt positions total approximately $2.3 billion and $684 million, respectively. 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,330,000,000 to $1,405,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99. 
As a reminder, when looking at year-over-year quarterly EPS growth rate for the quarter, it is important to remember that in 2010, the fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit cost by renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit, as the full-year benefit of the credit for 2010 was recorded in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusting the fourth quarter 2010 EPS to account for this $0.04 catch-up will provide a more comparable base to calculate fourth quarter 2011 earnings growth. 
Regarding full-year expectations for 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,295,000,000 and $5,370,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.62 and $3.64, which represents growth of approximately 15%. 
For your information, expectations for all other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.

Obviously, a different part of the body but same procedure in terms of teaching physicians, surgeons how to use BOTOX. They're very used to deploying cystoscopes, so it's really down to the details of what individual cystoscope and needles does the individual neurologist like. And then, walking them through the normal process so how do you get access to reimbursement. So I think that's looking fine in terms of the set up. In Europe, we're just beginning to get the licenses. As I stated, the big one really is Germany, both in terms of its investments and its healthcare system and overall population. And I've also stated that France we've already got going. The launch was roughly 4 weeks ago. After that, the even bigger market will be for idiopathic overactive bladder, but that's still at the order of magnitude roughly plus/minus 2 years away, just to keep things in the right context."

But I think there are signs that it's moderated a little bit and we just watch that very carefully. Now on the offset, when I look at a lot of our European numbers and even the ones in southern Europe, where reading the newspaper, you'd think that business would have to be terrible. We have product markets growing double digit, which to me tells me that a -- those societies place high value upon appearance, which means not only how their faces look but what kind of clothes they wear. And that's just deeply embedded in those cultures. I think it also is reflective of the fact that we are catering to probably, let's call it, the more economically-favored population segment, middle and upper classes. So I've been very favorably surprised and you'll see that very clearly in my remarks. Also in terms of trend, no signs of weakening despite all the stories of calamity coming out of Europe. And then of course, when you move down to Latin America and across to Asia, things are really humming. And we're very well positioned for a lot of growth."

Clearly, we had to get prepared for the genericization of latanoprost and protecting our formulated positions. We've done that very capably. Naturally it costs the money and also the doughnut hole which was a government mandate that costs money for rebates. And basically, as we come around the block in Q1 of 2012, all that stuff broadly has anniversaried. So the drag of 2011,barring stuff at the very margin, doesn't really repeat itself in 2012."

What we learned the last time and certainly, we're not seeing the kind of dramatic drop-offs that we saw in the recession of late -- well, let's call it early 2009. And we learned that consumer promotions really work. That's why I refer to things like duet dividends. Coupons to patients bring patients through the doctor's door and also encourages them to shorten the gap between the first procedure and the subsequent one. So that's working very well. Also, we've now established a gigantic CRM database where patients have opted in to receive information from us. And of course, we also assist, as requested, physicians how they build their own databases because we have plenty of advice that we can offer when they request it. I think the second sort of part of your question was rebates in terms of really managed care and reimbursed pharmaceuticals. And I think when I answered the question earlier, I think this was the year of the big increase in rebates because of protecting our primary physicians against latanoprost generics, government mandated programs like the doughnut hole and pretty much we've got that under control for 2012. The increases will be pretty much in line with growth in net sales. So the gross to net delta will be pretty much the same in 2012 as it is in 2011."

So literally, this weekend, we have been to Orlando, Florida, the convention with 25,000 of our best friends in ophthalmology and that was the overall attendee number for the American Academy of Ophthalmology with many, many physicians, of course, also coming from overseas. And I spoke to many glaucoma specialists to ask them precisely your question, where I really knew the answer but I wanted confirmation. I think you're absolutely right in your sort of insinuation that 0.01 is much more than just a replacement for 0.03. Given the very low rates of hyperemia, yet the physicians belief in the fact that it still has virtually or maybe even the same efficacy profile as the original 0.03. It has been very much put in the position of being first-line therapy. Very important in terms of timing with the genericization of Xalatan in the summer. You can see that when you look at the script track that we have virtually been unaffected in terms both of anorex share up to the first couple of weeks, where there was a lot of turmoil in the data, as well as overall volume, where some of our competitors clearly are being affected, and their numbers are starting to go down. This is also in correlation with physicians' view that the quality of latanoprost generics, and there's probably 7 or 8 of them, are not all the same. And so for newly diagnosed patients, I heard from many ophthalmologists that they will, in fact, go to LUMIGAN 0.01 as their treatment of choice and not run the risk of writing a latanoprost prescription not knowing which one, which quality might be filled.

So I think in your overall conclusion, you're probably directionally right that the share of the aesthetic franchise in this coming 5-year time period will be a little bit less.

Now we do have promotions, which affect gross to net but we know they really work. If we then go to BOTOX therapeutics, that is also an area where there are very low or no rebates. So the numbers you see in terms of local currency growth are pretty close to volume growth. Now if we go over to the largest and most difficult to comment business, which is the ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, there you've got various things going on. On the one side, you've got a larger delta between growth sales to net as the rebates have moved up. So then the other side, you also have makeshift, where I'm sure this is typical of many pharmaceutical companies that you follow, where older products are lower-priced, new ones in the mix are higher price. And so we got great pickup in terms of currency versus actual number of bottles produced in our plants.

First of all, this is, once again, Allergan in a position where we can create a market that didn't exist before. And fortunately, if we look at the environment in the products for treatment of migraine, there's very little competition these days because if we take the big products of the past Imitrex from GlaxoSmithKline, the product is now generic. So this is a fairly low-noise market where we're one of the few promoted products and the only product indicated for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine. And that's the very powerful part of being able to run an unbranded DTC campaign talking to that indication. And we knew from our market research that this should work. Of course, it's a big group of patients, 3.2 million sufferers from 15 days and more, and it's all about driving people into work and they be treated to the specialists. And that's exactly what we can do through that TV campaign, where people can log on to a website to look for a physician. And there you see the commonalities of what we did years and years ago. Totally unconnected with migraine, BOTOX for leveler, for aesthetic, in terms of the ""find a physician tool"", which these days seems pretty normal when one thinks of a Google type world, right?

When you look at the quarter, clearly on all our key brands, we were lower than what most analysts, outside analysts, were looking for. I think at the margin, there was probably some currency involved. Certainly if you look at our guidance back on the last earnings call, the dollar was weaker than it was at the end of the quarter. But I think that's the third reason. I think the other 2 reasons, one is inventory change. Clearly,if inventory in wholesale were reduced, that would reduce our ex-factory sales in Q3. And then going back to the rebate question. If you imagine that all of the formulary positions we negotiated for 2012 led to an increase in rebates and primarily due to the need to protect LUMIGAN in a preferred status position knowing that Xalatan's patent was expiring in the summer 2011, and we've done that. And I commented how well LUMIGAN is doing in its entirety, but also how well 0.01 is doing and how that franchise will grow. Imagine we're looking at formularies for 2012. The months of rebates we're paying in 2012 are very similar to those being paid in 2011. So the increase of 2012 versus 2011 is pretty mild. And hence, that's not one of my concerns looking forward. How do I put together an operating plan for 2012 to secure both top line and bottom line growth? On RESTASIS, we watch that very carefully. One of the things that's difficult for you to follow and understand is the switch from 30 trade count to 60 trade count. So a trailing prescription is a trailing prescription or a new prescription is a new prescription. But we're still getting pickup in volume as we move more and more to 60 on a prescription unit versus 30. So that was notwithstanding, of course, I'm looking for growth. And in most weeks when I look, it is positive. Numbers jump around week year-over-year. But we have a lot of effort behind RESTASIS and we believe that both the acceptance by physicians, the detailing volume and also the acceptance of patients looking at the TV campaign and the print campaign we run is very positive."

So we've still got some more work to do. There are still physicians left who have not yet gone through live injector training, and we will continue doing that. And that's very much in line with the experience for the last 10 or even 20 years on the roll-out of all BOTOX indications. So time will come where we then say, okay, we've done most of the urologists and then we'll start looking at general practitioners. When we look at their prescribing habits, really look like neurologists, although they're not board-certified neurologists. They just have huge volumes of headache patients in their practices. That will be the next stage."

I think that the emphasis will be on the key areas for the company. So you'll see on the ophthalmology side updates, predominantly on glaucoma and retina, people are always interested in BOTOX. We'll update you on the neurology programs. People are interested in our targeted toxin programs. So clearly, we'll have some data there. On the aesthetics side, we've said we'll try to give you some indication on bimatoprost for scalp growth. Although those trials really won't -- that proof of concept won't be done until, sorry, after R&D day, but we'll update you on the program there and some other dermatology assets and then a little bit on the Allergan medical side as well. So it will be a fair bit of updates going on. But again, emphasizing probably BOTOX, the targeted toxin and ophthalmology will be a fair bit of it."
