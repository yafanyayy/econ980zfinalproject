Before we begin today's discussion, I want to pause and reflect on the horrific events in Japan. We've all been moved by the pictures of destruction in that country, and our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the people of Japan and the many vendor partners and friends of Best Buy who live and work there. Since the tsunami struck in March 11, we have been in close contract with our business partners in Japan and they know that we will support them with the best of our abilities as they recover and rebuild from this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this disaster.
I'd like to cover a few things this morning. A quick recap of the fourth quarter, a look back at last year and some thoughts and priorities for this new year. First, the fourth quarter. Jim will provide you with a detailed overview of the quarter, but I'd like to highlight a few things. Gross margin improvements continued. A true reflection of the increased profit levers we have developed and highlighted by Domestic segment. Adjusted margins were up 90 basis points. 
We demonstrated expense control in the quarter. Total company SG&A was up only slightly as we reduce spending in response to the sluggish sales environment. Now, looking back on the full year, we finished a restraining consumer in a difficult industry environments during the year especially in televisions. The TV market was down significantly last year caused in large part by demand for IPTV and 3DTV but did not materialize as the industry haven't dissipated. But despite these challenges, I'm pleased with how we responded and executed. We want to be improved last year than we did. Despite lower comps, our Domestic business adjusted gross margin was up 90 basis points. Overall gross profit dollars were up, and importantly, gross profit per square foot was up. 
Our cost control was good throughout the year. SG&A was up less than 5% for the year, which was an improvement from the previous year. Our adjusted operating income dollars were up and operating margin was up despite a down comp in a difficult industry environment for the year. I think this was a significant accomplishment.
Putting it all together, despite the industry backdrop, the team responded well and our execution at the store level was good. Our retail customer satisfaction scores were up last year. Our close rate improvement on a year-on-year basis and we had notable improvements in connections, accessories and Geek Squad Black Tie Protection. Having said that, we are never 100% satisfied with our customer experience and we intend to make it even better. More on that later. 
One of the strengths of Best Buy is our ability to change and adapt. One of our four company values and practice to learn from challenge and change. The nature of our business requires us to constantly innovate. Just look at our Quickware assortment changes with the natural cycles of technology. Last year was no exception, and we took action to improve our model.
We have made good progress on our Connected World strategy and in building out differentiated value propositions to thrive in that world. Best Buy Mobile is the tip of the spear in our connected world strategy and we gained share in the mobile phone category overall in the U.S., and particularly in the smartphone category. Best Buy Mobile also saw improvements in both Geek Squad Black Tie Protection and accessories over last year. Special appreciation goes out to more than 20,000 Geek Squad agents who enabled the highest and best possible customer service in-store or at home.
Outside of mobile phones, we continue to see significant growth of connectivity in other areas. A good point of this was unit growth over 50% on air cards and my fly devices, we deliver mobile broadband service to consumer devices. As we've talked about, last summer we made significant changes to the store and the continuing effort to maximize our return on space. We decreased the size of declining categories and increased space of higher margin and faster growing categories. CD space was reduced by over 50%, and that space is allocated to fast-growing areas like Best Buy Mobile, eReaders and seasonal impulse products. 
In the fall, we launched a refreshing in our gaming business. Customers can now buy and sell preowned games in approximately 90% of our stores, and we've also added pre-ordered kiosks for new titles in all of our stores. The Gaming business is a long heritage at Best Buy, and we're determined to strengthen our strengthen our position as a premier destination for all types of gamers. 
We also launched the buyback program with a campaign that imported our first ever Super Bowl commercial. Our research shows that a high percentage of consumers agree that concerns about obsolescence have likely prevented them or would have prevent them in the future from purchasing CE products. The buyback program allows customers to future proof their technology purchases in a world where technological advances are rapid and relentless.  It's still early, but we've seen encouraging trends for this program to date. Outside of the period it was offered for free. This program is particularly feeling mobile phone and tablet categories which gives us meaningful differentiation in two of the highest growing categories in CE.
As I mentioned, we recently announced a significant restructuring of our International business that we believe will build on the positive aspects of our International business performance last year. We had good sales growth led by Five Star in China and saw encouraging signs from smaller business like Mexico. Including the announced restructuring charges -- excuse me, excluding the announced restructuring charges, our International operating income growth was up over 30% last year. 
Looking forward to fiscal 2012, Jim will take you through the guidance in detail, but here are some areas of particular focus.  I strongly believe Best Buy's business model's positioned for success this year. We're fully aware that consumers are still relatively constrained, and some of our major categories are coming off challenging years. As you saw from our sales guidance for this year, we're still assuming that some of these headwinds will continue. This is particularly a concern with the housing market that's still not growing and the cost of energy will have a predictable impact to consumers. 
That said, we see several significant incremental opportunities this year and we have targeted plans in place to take full advantage of them. One clear incremental opportunity for us this year is growing in product categories where we have lower share like mobile, appliances and gaming. And Mike Vitelli will take you through that detail in a moment.
We also see an opportunity to enhance the overall returns of our stores and we are taking actions to realize that. First, we have project that we expect will improve performance in our big-box stores, including key lessons from our connected store pilot, and actions were taken in our appliance business. Second, we've slowed big-box growth footage growth; and third, we're increasing our point of presents in small box formats like Best Buy Mobile. A model that's relevant to a new set of customers and one that has powerful and proven returns. To sum it up, we are exploring and redefining what the optimal big-box footprint is for us and we're finding ways to maximize returns through a variety of actions, including extending many of our key categories that should increase customer footsteps every day. 
We believe a strong physical presence and a strong online presence is a major competitive advantage for Best Buy and a point of differentiation. Last year, our U.S.  .com business sales were up significantly and according to our estimates are market share was also up in this channel. However, we have a real opportunities to improve our performance in the online channel and we're taking actions now to do this. 
We're responding to customers want shop. And what we're hearing loud and clear is that many customers want to use multiple channels. We offer customers options and solutions across all channels and across the entire spectrum of price points. As a testament to this, when you look across our U.S. big-box stores, and our .com channel, our traffic was up in fiscal 2011.
Last year, we deployed two new multi-channel options for customers to add to our already popular in-store pickup within the hour approach. We started ship-to-store and friends and family guest pickup. After these two additions were deployed, we saw total in-store pickup built on approximately 35% to over 40% of all products sold online. In our mobile web and apps business, at the highest growth rate this year of any of our touch points, demonstrating that we are increasingly serving customers where and how they want to shop. An important point to support the value of multi-channel is the fact that recently, almost 80% of larger screen TVs that were purchased online at Best Buy were picked up in the store. We believe we're an industry leader in giving consumers plenty of information, choice and speed in how they want to purchase their products.
So what do we anticipate for TVs overall this year? We expect to see very large screen TVs which will include all the latest technology at great prices. We will have to see our consumers respond to this environment, but we believe that this combination will play to our strengths because our strength is helping customers understand the new technology, walking them through the different options and having the Geek Squad deliver, install and set up the equipment.
One last opportunity I'd like to briefly discuss is our International business. We focused that business. We're investing strongly in the growth of Five Star, we continue to expand and drive our powerful warehouse mobile box business and we're conservatively expanding our Best Buy stores in the relatively new markets of Mexico and the United Kingdom. I believe this focused strategy will allow our International business to contribute significantly to our overall profitability over time.
Last month we announced some high profile changes to our business that demonstrate our commitments and focused investment only on efforts that meet our expectations for profitable returns. We will continue to be disciplined and tenacious about investing in areas that meet our standards for ROIC, and we intend to actively reach out to new customers of all ages and interests to take advantage of how easy it is to shop for, compare and buy with confidence at Best Buy in-store and online. 
To gain traction in this environment, we have to provide good reasons to shop and buy now. Our partnerships with the industry's largest investment manufacturers allow us the opportunity to attract and acquire increased numbers of new customers with strong offers, available credit and broad assortments of products all backed with the industry's best technical service. This promise continues to be the foundation of the company and will serve our new and loyal customers. 
In closing, I am looking forward to this year. We have several exciting incremental opportunities in front of us, that I believe are playing the Best Buy's core strengths, all the while being realistic about the headwinds we all see. We look at the to make the changes we need to make, to meet the challenges of this dynamic marketplace, to evolve our business and to focus our capital initiatives in the areas that generate the greatest customer acquisition and returns on our market-leading position.
With that, I would like to pass it to Mike Vitelli for some additional color around opportunities in our U.S. business. Mike?"

One clear incremental opportunity for us is to grow specific areas of our business. There are several areas in our store where we believe we have a powerful value proposition with a great brand set that had and we believe that with effective communication and great execution, we have the opportunity to pick up additional share. 
First, Mobile. Best Buy Mobile isn't executing very well and we've gained share. But despite that strong only around 6%. We're seeing solid momentum in this business. We're going to put footprint for mobile and our big-box stores to add additional customers as we announced last month we plan to open an additional 150 mobile standalone stores, taking to account a total of approximately 325 stores by the end of this year. In addition, our new buyback program is especially relevant to mobile phone consumers, and we're seeing strong attach rates as well as increasing buyback attach rates when bundled with Geek Squad Black Tie Protection. Our biggest obstacle to grow mobile share appears to be awareness. And we believe the store count growth supported by advertising to drive consumer awareness and smart promotions like Free Phone Friday will address the awareness gap and accelerate our growth. 
Last year's hot products was the iPad and we had success with the iPad and now again with the iPad 2. As choice becomes more important in the emerging tablet category, we are best positioned to showcase the choices and inspire our customers to be at possible the also the ability to touch and try all the models side-by-side. We have employee between the products and platforms, offering unbiased device. Best Buy customers can maximize the benefits of their purchases with the accessories, content and connections that they want and need. To make this experience come to life, we have used a similar proven labor, training and compensation operating model used by Best Buy Mobile to drive the tablet business. 
Finally, we've launched our buyback program for tablets, which, like mobile phones, is particularly relevant for consumers who love to have the latest and greatest. And buyback makes Best Buy a great place to buy your smartphones and your tablets.
Another opportunity is Appliances. Appliances represented 5% of our U.S. sales last year and we're still number four in the market. Appliances has a big footprint in our stores and we need to get a better return on that space. We believe we can make significant improvements to our Appliance business and improve our share position. We're seeing it already. As a good example, we've seen solid results when we take key elements of the Pacific Sales appliance model into Best Buy. Currently, we have eight tech sales stored in the store concepts on the West Coast. And in Southern California where we have both Best Buy and tech sales, we've seen both higher market share and better growth for our appliance business overall. 
The gaming industry is a $20 billion business in which Best Buy's is number two in hardware and number three in software, and we currently have a very small share in preowned games. In order to improve our position and materially change the way we compete in this space, we're making investments in dedicated gaming labor, in-store and online pre-order and trade in capabilities in digital content. First we've added the ability to pre-order games in all of our stores and in BestBuy.com. We also changed our promotional rhythm on new games to promote them during the pre-release and pre-order periods where most consumer activity occurs for many iconic franchise games. Second we've added the ability to trade in used games at Best Buy for the more attractive Best Buy Gift Card, and this includes the ability to use those trade in dollars for anything in the Best Buy store, not just gaming titles. Best Buy will open outstanding gaming experience for our customers and these investments allow us to participate in the multibillion-dollar digital and preowned spaces for almost entirely incremental to our current business with higher margins, and we regularly expect this to drive traffic to our stores. We're seeing very good signs that customers are eager for choices and like our offers. 
And before I hand this over to Jim, I look to discuss one more thing. We did some discussion recently about our pricing strategy that is incorrect and I'd like to take this opportunity to address this. Can we do things to improve our price impressions with customers? Absolutely. We see this opportunity and we're acting on it. We also know we bring value to biotechnology and more ways than just price. As a result we believe that are sure would support that we're the leading destination for technology in the world. First and foremost, were committed in our stores and online to ensure people by the right technology to meet their needs and accessories, connection, content and services, to get the experience that made them one after the first place. 
What's more, we make technology more accessible with refinancing and Rewards Zone. We make it easy to get their technology up and stay running through a wide array of service products and we allow consumers to future proof and protect their technology through products like Buyback and Geek Squad Black-tie Protection. Pricing transparency is never been better for customers. It easy to price tech products today, even write in your hand on your smartphone. But many of our value-added promotions like financing and rewards and others like bundled savings don't translate well into SKU only product price comparison engines.
Best Buy intends to use a variety of pricing strategies to compete against the diverse set of competitors which differ by category we saw thousands of products and Services in dozens of different categories, applying a single pricing strategy across all of our products and categories that have not been practical or rewarded. My point is that price matters and so does value, and we want to make sure that we're more effectively communicating our prices and value offers in all Best Buy channels everyday to get customers the best and right solution for each of them.
With that, I'll hand it over to Jim."

I'd like to start this morning by recapping our fourth quarter financial results and by providing some additional color on our performance. Then I'll recap what we set out to accomplish in fiscal '11 and how we performed against those goals. We will close with our thoughts on how we currently see fiscal '12 playing out and the resulting financial guidance. 
As Bill noted up front, the numbers we will be discussing exclude the restructuring charges detailed in our release this morning. This morning we announced adjusted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.98, which was up 9% versus last year. As Brian mentioned up front, we're pleased to continue the theme of strong gross margin performance driven primarily by strength in our key connectivity category Best Buy Mobile, along with discipline SG&A spending set against a consumer demand backdrop in our industry.
Let's quickly run through some of the key headlines. First in the fourth quarter, revenue declined 2% driven by comparable store sales decline of 4.6% and partially offset by new store growth. In our Domestic segment, fourth quarter revenues decreased almost 4% from last year to $12.1 billion, as comparable store sales declined 5.5%. While on the surface, this decline appears similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, the trend was actually modestly better when you look at the two-year comp and consider that domestic comparable sales were up over 7% in the fourth quarter last year. 
The decline in comp store sales was driven primarily by a couple of factors. First, the industry continued to experience lower demand in key categories, including TVs and notebook computers. Second, we were up against a nearly 40% comparable store sales gain last year in mobile computing, largely due to the launch of Windows 7. 
Sales in our International segment increased approximately 4% to $4.1 billion, driven primarily by new store growth and the impact of favorable FX rates. These gains were partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.3%. Our Best Buy U.S. business experienced a low single-digit  percent increase in operable store sales for the quarter. Canada saw many of the same consumer demand industry headwinds that we experienced in the Domestic segment which resulted in the similar are losing of the operable store sales decline. In Five Star, we experienced a low single-digit comparable store sales decline as we began to lap significant year-over-year strength. For context, our Five Star comparable store sales growth was over 35% during the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. For the full year Five Star experienced a comparable store sales growth of 18% in fiscal '11. 
Turning now to gross margins, the highlight for the quarter was again the continued expansion of our gross profit rate. Total company gross profit rate of 24.4% reflected a 40 basis point year-over-year improvement. The Domestic gross profit rate was up 90 basis points to 24.5%. The 90 basis point expansion can be attributed to overall flat rates and in improvements in mix due to continued growth in Best Buy Mobile and a lower mix of computing and entertainment hardware and software. 
Additionally, similar to the first three quarters of the year, gross margin rate improved slightly as a larger portion of our vendor programs were orientated towards purchase incentive instead of advertising support, which is recorded as a reduction in SG&A. Just as a reminder, this is the last quarter this reclassification will impact our year-over-year financial comparisons as we will anniversary this change in the first quarter of fiscal '12. 
Within the International segment, the gross profit rate of 24.2% reflects 120 basis point decline year-over-year, primarily driven by higher mix of sales in the B2B channel in Europe, partially offset by strong margin improvement in both our Five Star and our teams in Canada.
Turning to SG&A, fourth quarter expenses increased just 2% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. SG&A dollar growth was limited due to tight cost controls on variable spending items. In addition, similar to the third quarter, SG&A also benefited from lower incentive compensation expense tied to our overall financial results. Lower incentive costs favorably impacted our overall rate by 40 and 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the full year respectively. Bringing it all together, the net result is that the fourth quarter operating income decreased 4% versus last year to $1.2 billion or 7.5% of sales. Again, these results excludes the restructuring costs Bill referenced.
I also wanted to touch on a couple of specific points related to how we closed out the year to help avoid any potential confusion. First, the year ended with higher than usual working capital, including inventory, accounts payable and accounts receivable. Each of these items included several timing related events spend a minute and touch on each key driver. As you saw in our release, total inventory was up 7.5% year-over-year compared to up 12% at the end of the third quarter. In Q4, growth from new stores and changes in foreign currency contributed approximately half of the inventory increase. 
Domestic comparable store inventory in Q4 was up 2% and reflected an improvement over the third quarter, which was up 8%. The growth in Domestic inventory was principally in support of the continued strong sales growth in Best Buy Mobile. As the company reduced inventory receipts in January and February in response to holiday sales trends, total accounts payable declined as we paid for our existing inventory under our normal practices. Accordingly accounts payable finished the year lower than last year due to timing changes in our inventory receipt patterns this year. And finally, we also saw an increase in the receivables at year end due to the timing of several large payments due from our vendors. A large portion of these payments have been received since our year-end. The combined impact of the above items increased our year end working capital and lowered free cash flow. 
To be clear, our overall working capital and cash flow model has not changed significantly as these items are timing in nature. We anticipate our working capital positions will return to more normalized levels in the first half of fiscal '12 which will benefit our year-over-year free cash flow generation.
Second, our effective tax rate of 31.4% was lower than last year and our expectations, due primarily to the favorable resolution of several tax matters in the quarter and a higher proportion of our income from foreign operations, which is taxed at lower rates. We estimate that temporary reductions in our tax rate favorably impacted the fourth quarter and full year earnings by approximately $0.12 and $0.11 respectively.
While there were certainly challenges that both Best Buy and the CE industry faced in fiscal '11, we also saw exciting growth opportunity in new connected technologies and achieved several important goals that we set out to accomplish during the year. We drove profitable sales growth in key parts of our business such as Best Buy Mobile my opening of over 100 new stand-alone stores and saw continued growth in our profitable Five Star model in China. 
Domestic gross profit margins grew by 90 basis points for the year. This year-over-year gain shows that our connectivity strategy are gaining traction and demonstrates our ability to respond to market opportunity and grow margins even when some product categories are challenged, which we believe positions us well for the future. We announced restructuring plans for our International business, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing our profitability and returns. We exercise strong cost discipline in a tough environment, which limited SG&A dollar growth to 4.6% for the year. 
Setting aside the impact of the restructuring, this cost control, combined with our significant gross margin expansion, allowed us to grow operating income dollars 2% and operating income rate 10 basis points for the full year despite the negative comp sales environment. And lastly, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion or 33 million shares of our stock which is over a percent of our previously outstanding shares of the company during fiscal '11. This was the second largest year of repurchase activity in the history of the company and we continue to see share repurchases as one of the important elements of improving share returns for our shareholders over time.
Looking ahead to fiscal '12, we recognize that there continues to be many variables in the environment. It appears likely that macro influences such as unemployment, housing and higher gas prices may continue to pressure consumers. Strong companies and brands like Best Buy utilize times like these to play offense and leverage their position in the marketplace. We plan to pursue profitable growth opportunity by focusing on key connectivity categories like Best Buy Mobile in exciting new technologies like tablet. 
As Mike discussed earlier, we are also planning to grow our Gaming and Appliance businesses in the year. Given these can competing factors our fiscal '12 plans reflect the range of potential outcomes and are focused on making prudent investments in several profitable growth areas of our business, while maintaining disciplined cost control. 
Our fiscal 2012  guidance calls for top line revenue of $51 billion to $52.5 billion which is an average of 1% to 4% growth year-over-year. Key assumptions behind this outlook includes new store plans were disclosed in late February, which call for approximately 150 new Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores, U.S. big-box square footage growth of less than 1% and 40 to 50 new Five Star stores in China.
Additionally, we anticipate that the inclusion of the 53rd week during the fiscal fourth quarter will add approximately 1.5% to 2% year-over-year to our top line revenue. Partially offsetting these gains is our comparable store sales estimate for the year of flat to down 3%, which reflects our current view of the range of potential outcomes in this environment. Looking at gross margins, we expect to grow gross margins next year but at a more modest rate than in fiscal '11. We anticipate a large portion of this growth will be driven by further progress in our connectable categories led by Best Buy Mobile. 
As I mentioned earlier we made solid progress in focusing our discretionary SG&A spending in fiscal '11. We will be prudent in our SG&A investments, striking an important balance of pushing forward on profitable growth areas and managing our SG&A. Given planned investments to grow our Connections business the addition of the 53rd week and the impact of lapping more incentive costs in fiscal '11, we anticipate that total SG&A dollar spending will grow approximately 4% for the year or approximately 2%, excluding the impact of higher incentive comp and the 53rd week.
So rolling it all up, we anticipate that total operating income dollars will be flat to up 7% as improvements in our gross margin rate mitigate potential softness in the comp sales environment. We also anticipate that the recently completed bond offering will add approximately $50 million to our full year net interest expense. Doing the math, this translates to approximately $0.08 of EPS for the year. 
Bringing it all together we are forecasting annual non-GAAP EPS of $3.30 to $3.55 for fiscal 2012, which represents a 4% decrease to 4% increase year-over-year, excluding restructuring related charges. This adjusted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of any potential share repurchases in fiscal 2012. 
Taking a quick look at our fiscal '12 CapEx outlook, we expect to spend approximately $800 million, which would be slightly lower than our fiscal 2011 CapEx spend. With that as context to what we expect for the full year, let's shift gears for a minute on our expectations for fiscal '12. First, we expect that our comparable store sales performance in the first half, especially in the first quarter, will be similar to the quarter we just completed. Additionally we anticipate that the second half sales will improve over the first half trends based on the actions already discussed by Brian and Mike earlier, including initiatives in our Best Buy Mobile, Tablets, Gaming and Appliance businesses. And of course, we'll be up against much easier compares in the second half of the year. 
Regarding SG&A for the year, we anticipate higher growth in the second half of the year as incentive compensation returns to more normalized levels and given the inclusion of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter. Given the pacing of our fiscal '11 actual results and the above assumptions, we do not anticipate that year-over-year EPS growth will grow until the second half of fiscal 2012.
One last thought on our outlook, currently, we are not aware of any significant impacts to our business as a result of the recent tragedy in Japan. We are in contact with our vendor partners and suppliers that recognize that it is still too early for them to assess what impact, if any, this may have on our business in fiscal '12.
In closing, there were challenging elements that impacted the CE industry and Best Buy during fiscal '11. Consumers are clearly telling us that they are interested in capturing all the benefits of a connected lifestyle, but they also selected about how and where they spend their discretionary dollars. We believe the strength of our multi-channel approach in serving customers, the ability to showcase all the latest and greatest technologies all in one place, coupled with our knowledgeable Blue Shirts who can help customers get the most out of their spending, continues to position our model attractively for customers, vendors and shareholders. Equally, we realize that we have many opportunities to improve our model, attracting customers and drive stronger performance in the near term and beyond.

I'll remember last year in Q4, with the launch of Windows 7, notebooks went way up. So it pressed our margins and Q4 last year when taken that would mix driven. Overall our rates in most of our categories has stayed fairly stable. One exception would be in the television business is purely due to the mix of the active TV sales that we've seen this year versus the previous year as Mike mentioned the new technologies that the industry planed to sell this year didn't grow as fast as the industry planned. We sold more mid-line televisions and lower and televisions. So our margins in that space came down. So I would attribute that because of the mix within the TV categories not our rate on a stupor SKU tech products rates are relatively stable through the year we think we have opportunities to drive more sales related that my talk about that going to have some about the pressure on rates next year but those are incremental sales dollars of incremental margin dollars that's why the guidance provided next year is expecting gross margins to grow albeit at a smaller rate then we saw this year."

I think for the things that we think the model specifically for last year around investing and gaming and things of that nature were not talking about enormous investments in those spaces to improve the productivity of those stores. Similar to what we think we can experience in the appliance space, given a better value proposition and labor model around selling appliances like we've seen in our early days of our tax sales or is rid in Best Buy stores it demonstrates we got the right traffic in the store to convert customers if we have the right we have a better value prop and labor model. That's really where we saw success of Best Buy Mobile putting Best Buy Mobile in the store initially we didn't bring new customers into the store we were leveraging the traffic is there in that basis we more productive than it was before so we think we have the opportunity to do that but to also share each point we also we think we have opportunities that we see how these neighbor models evolve to meet customer needs.

And as usual, the media are participating in this call in a listen-only mode.
Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. I'd also like to remind you that Best Buy will be having an Analyst Investor Day at its corporate campus on April 14. If you would like to register for this event or need further information, please contact Investor Relations. For those of you that cannot make it in person, the event will be webcast and available on our IR site.
You will also note that our reported results this morning included detailed information regarding the impact of the restructuring activities we announced on February 22. I ask that you please refer to our earnings release to understand how our announced restructuring affected our fourth quarter year-end financial results within our Domestic and International segments and across the company as a whole. The adjusted numbers we will be discussing today do not include these charges. It should not be confused with the GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release and the GAAP numbers we will report in our 10-K.
For a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supplemental schedule on Page 12 of this morning's news release.

We've all been moved by the pictures of destruction in that country, and our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the people of Japan and the many vendor partners and friends of Best Buy who live and work there.

Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this disaster.
I'd like to cover a few things this morning. A quick recap of the fourth quarter, a look back at last year and some thoughts and priorities for this new year. First, the fourth quarter. Jim will provide you with a detailed overview of the quarter, but I'd like to highlight a few things. Gross margin improvements continued, a true reflection of the increased profit levers we have developed and highlighted via Domestic segment. Adjusted margins were up 90 basis points. 
We've demonstrated expense control in the quarter. Total company SG&A was up only slightly, as we reduced spending in response to the sluggish sales environment. Now, looking back on the full year, we faced a restrained consumer in a difficult industry environment during the year, especially in televisions. The TV market was down significantly last year, caused in large part by demand for IPTV and 3D TV that did not materialize as the industry had anticipated. But despite these challenges, I'm pleased with how we responded and executed. We wanted to improve our gross margins last year, and we did. Despite lower comps, our Domestic business adjusted gross margin was up 90 basis points. Overall gross profit dollars were up and importantly, gross profit per square foot was up. 
Our cost control was good throughout the year. SG&A was up less than 5% for the year, which was an improvement from the previous year. Our adjusted operating income dollars were up and operating margin was up despite a down comp in a difficult industry environment for the year. I think this was a significant accomplishment.
Putting it all together, despite the industry backdrop, the team responded well and our execution at the store level was good. Our retail customer satisfaction scores were up last year. Our close rate improved on a year-on-year basis and we had notable improvements in connections, accessories and Geek Squad Black Tie Protection. Having said that, we're never 100% satisfied with our customer experience and we intend to make it even better. More on that later. 
One of the strengths of Best Buy is our ability to change and adapt. One of our four company values, in fact, is to learn from challenge and change. The nature of our business requires us to constantly innovate. Just look at how quick our assortment changes with the natural cycles of technology. Last year was no exception, and we took action to improve our model.
We have made good progress on our Connected World strategy and in building out differentiated value propositions to thrive in that world. Best Buy Mobile is the tip of the spear in our connected world strategy, and we gained share in the mobile phone category overall in the U.S., and particularly in the smartphone category. Best Buy Mobile also saw improvements in both Geek Squad Black Tie Protection and accessories over last year. Special appreciation goes out to more than 20,000 Geek Squad agents, who enabled the highest and best possible customer service in-store or at home.
Outside of mobile phones, we continue to see significant growth of connectivity in other areas. A good proof point of this was unit growth over 50% on AirCards and MiFi devices that deliver mobile broadband service to computing devices. As we've talked about, last summer we made significant changes to the store and the continuing effort to maximize our return on space. We decreased the size of declining categories and increased space of higher margin and faster growing categories. TV space was reduced by over 50%, and that space is allocated to fast-growing areas like Best Buy Mobile, eReaders and seasonal impulse products. 
In the fall, we launched the Refreshed of our Gaming business. Customers can now buy and sell pre-owned games in approximately 90% of our stores, and we've also added pre-ordered kiosks for new titles in all of our stores. The Gaming business is a long heritage at Best Buy, and we're determined to strengthen our position as a premier destination for all types of gamers. 
We also launched the buyback program with a campaign that inputted our first ever Super Bowl commercial. Our research shows that a high percentage of consumers agree that concerns about obsolescence have likely prevented them, or would prevent them in the future from purchasing CE products. The buyback program allows customers to future-proof their technology purchases in a world where technological advances are rapid and relentless. It's still early, but we've seen encouraging trends for this program to date. Outside of the period, it was offered for free. This program is particularly appealing in mobile phone and tablet categories, which gives us meaningful differentiation in two of the highest-growing categories in CE.
As I mentioned, we recently announced a significant restructuring of our International business that we believe will build on the positive aspects of our International business performance last year. We had good sales growth led by Five Star in China and saw encouraging signs from smaller business like Mexico. Excluding the announced restructuring charges, our international operating income growth was up over 30% last year. 
Looking forward to fiscal 2012, Jim will take you through the guidance in detail, but here are some areas of particular focus. I strongly believe Best Buy's business model is positioned for success this year. We're fully aware that consumers are still relatively constrained and some of our major categories are coming off challenging years. As you saw from our sales guidance for this year, we're still assuming that some of these headwinds will continue. This is particularly concerned with the housing market that's still not growing, and the cost of energy will have a predictable impact to consumers. 
That said, we see several significant incremental opportunities this year, and we have targeted plans in place to take full advantage of them. One clear incremental opportunity for us this year is growing in product categories where we have lower share like mobile, appliances and gaming. And Mike Vitelli will take you through that detail in a moment.
We also see an opportunity to enhance the overall returns of our stores and we are taking actions to realize that. First, we have projects that we expect will improve performance in our big-box stores, including key lessons from our connected store pilot and actions we're taking in our Appliance business; second, we've slowed big-box square footage growth; and third, we're increasing our points of presence in small-box formats like Best Buy Mobile, a model that's relevant to a new set of customers and one that has powerful and proven returns. To sum it up, we are exploring and redefining what the optimal big-box footprint is for us, and we're finding ways to maximize returns through a variety of actions, including extending many of our key categories that should increase customer footsteps everyday. 
We believe a strong physical presence and a strong online presence is a major competitive advantage for Best Buy and a point of differentiation. Last year, our U.S. Dotcom business sales were up significantly and according to our estimates, our market share was also up in this channel. However, we have real opportunities to improve our performance in the online channel, and we're taking actions now to do this. 
We're responding to help customers want to shop. And what we're hearing loud and clear is that many customers want to use multiple channels. We offer customers options and solutions across all channels and across the entire spectrum of price points. As a testament to this, when you look across our U.S. big-box stores, and our Dotcom channel, our traffic was up in fiscal 2011.
Last year, we deployed two new multi-channel options for customers to add to our already popular in-store pickup-within-the-hour approach. We started ship-to-store and friends and family guest pickup. After these two additions were deployed, we saw total in-store pickup go from approximately 35% to over 40% of all products sold online. In our Mobile Web and Apps business had the highest growth rate this year of any of our touch points, demonstrating that we are increasingly serving customers where and how they want to shop. An important proof point to support the value of multi-channel is the fact that recently, almost 80% of larger-screen TVs that were purchased online at Best Buy were picked up in the store. We believe we are an industry leader in giving consumers plenty of information, choice and speed in how they want to purchase their products.
So what do we anticipate for TVs overall this year? We expect to see very large screen TVs, which will include all the latest technology at great prices. We will have to see our consumers respond to this environment, but we believe that this combination will play to our strengths because our strength is helping the customers understand the new technology, walking them through the different options and having the Geek Squad deliver, install and set up the equipment.
One last opportunity I'd like to briefly discuss is our International business. We've focused that business. We're investing strongly in the growth of Five Star, we continue to expand and drive our powerful warehouse Small-Box business and we're conservatively expanding our Best Buy stores in the relatively new markets of Mexico and the United Kingdom. I believe this focused strategy will allow our International business to contribute significantly to our overall profitability over time.
Last month we announced some high profile changes to our business that demonstrate our commitments, and focus investment only on efforts that meet our expectations for profitable returns. We will continue to be disciplined and tenacious about investing in areas that meet our standards for ROIC, and we intend to actively reach out to new customers of all ages and interests to take advantage of how easy it is to shop for, compare and buy with confidence at Best Buy in-store and online. 
To gain traction in this environment, we have to provide good reasons to shop and buy now. Our partnerships with the industry's largest investment manufacturers allow us the opportunity to attract and acquire increased numbers of new customers with strong offers, available credit and broad assortments of products, all backed with the industry's best technical service. This promise continues to be the foundation of our company and will serve our new and loyal customers. 
In closing, I am looking forward to this year. We have several exciting incremental opportunities in front of us that I believe are play into Best Buy's core strengths, all the while being realistic about the headwinds we all see. We will continue to make the changes we need to make, to meet the challenges of this dynamic marketplace, to evolve our business and to focus our capital initiatives in the areas that generate the greatest customer acquisition and returns on our market-leading position.
With that, I'd like to pass it to Mike Vitelli for some additional color around opportunities in our U.S. business. Mike?"

One clear incremental opportunity for us is to grow in specific areas of our business. There are several areas in our store where we believe we have a powerful value proposition, with a great brand fit but our share is low. And we believe with effective communication and great execution, we have the opportunity to pick up additional share. 
First, mobile. Best Buy Mobile has been executing very well and we've gained share. But despite that strong showing, our share is still only around 6%. We're seeing solid momentum in this business. We're growing the footprint of mobile in our big-box stores to add additional accessories. And as we announced last month, we're planning to open an additional 150 mobile standalone stores, taking the count to a total of approximately 325 stores by the end of this year. In addition, our new buyback program is especially relevant to mobile phone consumers, and we're seeing strong attach rates as well as increasing buyback attach rates when bundled with Geek Squad Black Tie Protection. Our biggest obstacle to growing mobile share appears to be awareness, and we believe the store count growth, supported by advertising to drive consumer awareness and smart promotions like Free Phone Fridays will address the awareness gap and accelerate our growth. 
Last year's hot product was the iPad, and we had success with the iPad and now again with the iPad 2. As choice becomes more important in the emerging tablet category, we are best positioned to showcase the choices and inspire our customers to the art of what's possible. We offer the ability to touch and try all the models side-by-side. We have employees who can explain the differences between the different products and platforms, offering unbiased advice. Best Buy customers can maximize the benefits of their purchases with the accessories, content and connections that they want and need. To make this experience come to life, we intend to use a similar proven labor, training and compensation operating model used by Best Buy Mobile to drive the Tablet business. 
Finally, we've launched our buyback program for tablets, which, like mobile phones, is particularly relevant for consumers who love to have the latest and greatest. And buyback makes Best Buy a great place to buy your smartphone and your tablet.
Another opportunity is appliances. Appliances represented 5% of our U.S. sales last year and we're still number four in the market. But appliances has a big footprint in our stores, and we need to get a better return on that space. We believe we can make significant improvements to our Appliance business and improve our share position. We're seeing it already. As a good example, we're seeing solid results when we take key elements of the Pacific Sales appliance model into Best Buy. Currently, we have eight tech sales stored in the store concepts on the West Coast. And in Southern California where we have both Best Buy and tech sales, we've seen both higher market share and better growth for our appliance business overall. 
The gaming industry is a $20 billion business in which Best Buy is number two in hardware and number three in software, and we currently have a very small share in preowned games. In order to improve our position and materially change the way we compete in this space, we're making investments in dedicated gaming labor, in-store and online pre-order and trade-in capability in digital content. First we've added the ability to pre-order games in all of our stores and on BestBuy.com. We'll also change our promotional rhythm on new games to promote them during the pre-release and pre-order periods, when most consumer activity occurs for many iconic franchise games. Second, we've added the ability to trade-in used games at Best Buy for the more attractive Best Buy Gift Card, and this includes the ability to use those trade-in dollars for anything in the Best Buy store, not just game titles. Best Buy will open outstanding gaming experience for our customers, and these investments will allow us to participate in the multibillion-dollar digital and preowned spaces that are almost entirely incremental to our current business with higher margins, and we regularly expect this to drive traffic to our stores. We're seeing very good signs that customers are eager for choices and like our offers. 
And before now that I hand this over to Jim, I'd like to discuss one more thing. We did some discussion recently about our pricing strategy that is incorrect and I'd like to take this opportunity to address this. Can we do things to improve our price impressions with customers? Absolutely. We see this opportunity and we're acting on it. And we also know we're bringing value to buying technology in more ways than just price. As a result, we believe and our share with support, that we're perhaps the leading destination to buy technology in the world. First and foremost, were committed in our stores and online, to ensure people buy the right technology to meet their needs and the accessories, connections, content and services to get them the experience that made them want to buy it in the first place. 
What's more, we make technology more accessible through financing and Reward Zone. We make it easy to get their technology up and stay running through a wide array of service products, and we allow consumers to future-proof and protect their technology through products like buyback and Geek Squad Black-tie Protection. Pricing transparency has never been better for our customers. It's easy to price check products today, even write in your hand on your smartphone. But many of our value-added promotions like financing and Reward Zone, and others like bundled savings don't translate well into SKU-only product price comparison engines.
Best Buy intends to use a variety of pricing strategies to compete against a diverse set of competitors which often differ by category. We sell thousands of products and services in dozens of different categories. Applying a single pricing strategy across all of our products and categories would not be practical or rewarding. My point is that price matters and so does value, and we want to make sure that we're more effectively communicating our prices and value offers in all Best Buy channels everyday to get customers the best and right solutions for each of them.
With that, I'll hand it over to Jim."

Then I'll recap what we set out to accomplish in fiscal '11 and how we performed against those goals. We will close with our thoughts on how we currently see fiscal '12 playing out and the resulting financial guidance. 
As Bill noted up front, the numbers we will be discussing exclude the restructuring charges detailed in our release this morning. This morning, we announced adjusted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.98, which was up 9% versus last year. As Brian mentioned up front, we are pleased to continue the theme of strong gross margin performance, driven primarily by strength in our key connectivity category, Best Buy Mobile, along with disciplined SG&A spending set against the consumer demand backdrop in our industry.
Let's quickly run through some of the key headlines. First, in the fourth quarter, revenue declined 2%, driven by a comparable store sales decline of 4.6% and partially offset by new store growth. In our Domestic segment, fourth quarter revenues decreased almost 4% from last year to $12.1 billion, as comparable store sales declined 5.5%. While on the surface, this decline appears similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, the trend was actually modestly better when you look at the two-year comp and consider that domestic comparable store sales were up over 7% in the fourth quarter last year. 
The decline in comp store sales was driven primarily by a couple of factors. First, the industry continue to experience lower demand in key categories, including TVs and notebook computers. Second, we were up against a nearly 40% comparable store sales gain last year in mobile computing, largely due to the launch of Windows 7. 
Sales in our International segment increased approximately 4% to $4.1 billion, driven primarily by new store growth in the impact of favorable FX rates. These gains were partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.3%. Our Best Buy U.S. business experienced a low single-digit  percent increase in comparable store sales for the quarter. Canada saw many of the same consumer demand industry headwinds that were experienced in the Domestic segment, which resulted in the similar low single-digit comparable store sales decline. In Five Star, we experienced a low single-digit comparable store sales decline as we began to elapse significant year-over-year strength. For context, our Five Star comparable store sales growth was over 35% during the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. For the full year, Five Star experienced a comparable store sales growth of 18% in fiscal '11. 
Turning now to gross margins, the highlight for the quarter was again the continued expansion of our gross profit rate. Total company gross profit rate of 24.4% reflected a 40-basis-point year-over-year improvement. The domestic gross profit rate was up 90 basis points to 24.5%. The 90-basis-point expansion can be attributed to overall flat rates and an improvement in mix due to continued growth in Best Buy Mobile and a lower mix of computing and entertainment hardware and software. 
Additionally, similar to the first three quarters of the year, gross margin rate improved slightly as a larger portion of our vendor programs were orientated towards purchase incentives instead of advertising support, which is recorded as a reduction in SG&A. Just as a reminder, this is the last quarter this reclassification will impact our year-over-year financial comparisons as we will anniversary this change in the first quarter of fiscal '12. 
Within the International segment, the gross profit rate of 24.2% reflects a 120-basis-point decline year-over-year, primarily driven by higher mix of sales in the B2B channel in Europe, partially offset by strong margin improvement by both our Five Star and our teams in Canada.
Turning to SG&A, fourth quarter expenses increased just 2% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. SG&A dollar growth was limited due to tight cost controls on variable spending items. In addition, similar to the third quarter, SG&A also benefited from lower incentive compensation expense tied to our overall financial results. Lower incentive costs favorably impacted our overall rate by 40 and 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the full year respectively. Bringing it all together, the net result is that the fourth quarter operating income decreased 4% versus last year to $1.2 billion or 7.5% of sales. Again, these results exclude the restructuring costs Bill referenced.
I also wanted to touch on a couple of specific points related to how we closed out the year to help avoid any potential confusion. First, the year ended with higher-than-usual working capital, including inventory, accounts payable and accounts receivable. Each of these items included several timing-related events, so let's spend a minute and touch on each of the key drivers. As you saw in the release, total inventory was up 7.5% year-over-year compared to up 12% at the end of the third quarter. In Q4, growth from new stores and changes in foreign currency contributed approximately half of the inventory increase. 
Domestic comparable store inventory in Q4 was up 2% and reflected an improvement over the third quarter, which was up 8%. The growth in domestic inventory was principally in support of the continued strong sales growth in Best Buy Mobile. As the company reduced inventory receipts in January and February in response to holiday sales trends, total accounts payable declined as we paid for our existing inventory under our normal practices. Accordingly, accounts payable finished the year lower than last year due to timing changes in our inventory receipt patterns this year. And finally, we also saw an increase in the receivables at year-end, due to the timing of several large payments due from our vendors. A large portion of these payments have been received since our year-end. The combined impact of the above items increased our year-end working capital and lowered free cash flow. 
To be clear, our overall working capital and cash flow model has not changed significantly, as these items are timing in nature. We anticipate our working capital positions will return to more normalized levels in the first half of fiscal '12, which will benefit our year-over-year free cash flow generation.
Second, our effective tax rate of 31.4% was lower than last year and our expectations, due primarily to the favorable resolution of several tax matters in the quarter and a higher proportion of our income from foreign operations, which is taxed at lower rates. We estimate that temporary reductions in our tax rate favorably impacted the fourth quarter and full year earnings by approximately $0.12 and $0.11 respectively.
While there were certainly challenges that both Best Buy and the CE industry faced in fiscal '11, we also saw exciting growth opportunity in new connected technologies and achieved several important goals that we set out to accomplish during the year. We drove profitable sales growth in key parts of our business such as Best Buy Mobile by opening up over 100 new stand-alone stores, and saw continued growth in our profitable Five Star model in China. 
Domestic gross profit margins grew by 90 basis points for the year. This year-over-year gain shows that our connectivity strategy is gaining traction and demonstrates our ability to respond to market opportunity and grow margins even when some product categories are challenged, which we believe positions us well for the future. We announced restructuring plans for our International business, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing our profitability and returns. We exercise strong cost discipline in a tough environment, which limited SG&A dollar growth to 4.6% for the year. 
Setting aside the impact of the restructuring, this cost control, combined with our significant gross margin expansion, allowed us to grow operating income dollars 2% and operating income rate 10 basis points for the full year, despite the negative comp sales environment. And lastly, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion or 33 million shares of our stock, which is over 8% of the previously outstanding shares of the company during fiscal '11. This was the second largest year of repurchase activity in the history of the company, and we continue to see share repurchases as one of the important elements of improving returns for our shareholders over time.
Looking ahead to fiscal '12, we recognize that there continues to be many variables in the environment. It appears likely that macro influences such as unemployment, housing and higher gas prices may continue to pressure consumers. Strong companies and brands like Best Buy utilize times like these to play offense and leverage their position in the marketplace. We plan to pursue profitable growth opportunities by focusing on key connectivity categories like Best Buy Mobile, and exciting new technologies like tablets. 
As Mike discussed earlier, we are also planning to grow our Gaming and Appliance businesses in the year. Given these competing factors, our fiscal '12 plans reflect the range of potential outcomes, and are focused on making prudent investments in several profitable growth areas of our business, while maintaining disciplined cost control. 
Our fiscal 2012 guidance calls for top line revenue of $51 billion to $52.5 billion, which is an average of 1% to 4% growth year-over-year. Key assumptions behind this outlook includes the new store plans we disclosed in late February, which call for approximately 150 new Best Buy Mobile standalone stores, U.S. big-box square footage growth of less than 1% and 40 to 50 new Five Star stores in China.
Additionally, we anticipate that the inclusion of the 53rd week during the fiscal fourth quarter will add approximately 1.5% to 2% year-over-year to our top line revenue. Partially offsetting these gains is our comparable store sales estimate for the year of flat to down 3%, which reflects our current view of the range of potential outcomes in this environment. Looking at gross margins, we expect to grow gross margins next year but at a more modest rate than in fiscal '11. We anticipate a large portion of this growth will be driven by further progress in our connectable categories led by Best Buy Mobile. 
As I mentioned earlier, we made solid progress in focusing our discretionary SG&A spending in fiscal '11. We will be prudent in our SG&A investments, striking an important balance of pushing forward on profitable growth areas and managing our SG&A. Given planned investments to grow our Connections business, the addition of the 53rd week and the impact of lapping more incentive costs in fiscal '11, we anticipate that total SG&A dollar spending will grow approximately 4% for the year or approximately 2%, excluding the impact of higher incentive comp and the 53rd week.
So rolling it all up, we anticipate that total operating income dollars will be flat to up 7%, as improvements in our gross margin rate mitigate potential softness in the comp sales environment. We also anticipate that the recently completed bond offering will add approximately $50 million to our full year net interest expense. Doing the math, this translates to approximately $0.08 of EPS for the year. 
Bringing it all together, we are forecasting annual non-GAAP EPS of $3.30 to $3.55 for fiscal 2012, which represents a 4% decrease to 4% increase year-over-year, excluding restructuring related charges. This adjusted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of any potential share repurchases in fiscal 2012. 
Taking a quick look at our fiscal '12 CapEx outlook, we expect to spend approximately $800 million, which would be slightly lower than our fiscal 2011 CapEx spend. With that as context to what we expect for the full year, let's shift gears and spend a minute on our phasing expectations for fiscal '12. First, we expect that our comparable store sales performance in the first half, especially in the first quarter, will be similar to the quarter we've just completed. Additionally, we anticipate that the second half sales will improve over the first half trends based on the actions already discussed by Brian and Mike earlier, including the initiatives in our Best Buy Mobile, Tablets, Gaming and Appliance businesses. And of course, we'll be up against much easier compares in the second half of the year. 
Regarding SG&A for the year, we anticipate higher growth in the second half of the year as incentive compensation returns to more normalized levels, and given the inclusion of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter. Given the phasing of our fiscal '11 actual results and the above assumptions, we do not anticipate that year-over-year EPS growth will grow until the second half of fiscal 2012.
One last thought on our outlook. Currently, we are not aware of any significant impacts to our business as a result of the recent tragedy in Japan. We are in contact with our vendor partners and suppliers that recognize that it is still too early for them to assess what impact, if any, this may have on our business in fiscal '12.
In closing, there were challenging elements that impacted the CE industry and Best Buy during fiscal '11. Consumers are clearly telling us that they are interested in capturing all the benefits of a connected lifestyle, but they are also selective about how and where they spend their discretionary dollars. We believe the strength of our multi-channel approach in serving customers; the ability to showcase all the latest and greatest technologies all in one place, coupled with our knowledgeable Blue Shirts who can help customers get the most out of their spending; continue to position our model attractively for customers, vendors and shareholders. Equally, we realize that we have many opportunities to improve our model, attracting customers and drive stronger performance in the near term and beyond. 
So with that, Alicia, we are ready for questions."

The declines we saw are consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. But for the year, in looking at it for the total of the year, last year our share was approximately 22%, indicated again in the categories that we're measuring here which should support the fallout of missing the things that were growing the fastest in cellphones, services, tablets. These aren't in these track numbers yet. But our share this year was down about 100 basis points for the year. We were up 170 last year, so we're still on a sequencing trend positive over a multiyear basis. We have a very strong number one position in television, computing and digital imaging and television. Our share is higher than the next three competitors combined. So in those areas, we're going to really vigorously defend the share in those three positions. The biggest thing we're going to do with our shares, what I mentioned earlier, we have four categories for our shares that are in single digits. Gaming and software, we have probably a little over that, but we have massive area for improvement in mobile, appliances, tablets is just beginning. So these are all areas of -- that's where we see the growth coming from while we maintain and continue to grow back the really strong sales positions you have in the big three."

Those things we're doing and planning to grow our share in television is twofold. One is the industry is going to be focused on larger screen sizes, and we think that fits very well within our model, as Brian mentioned earlier, about large televisions being ordered online or in the store but being picked up in the store, because that's what people want to do with those televisions that size versus shipping it. But equally important is what mentioned earlier, the rapid expansion of our Online Only assortment. That's going to allow us -- we were already competing in those SKUs in prior periods."

So certainly, as we look at the different parts of our business, you have pieces moving in different directions but from a macro standpoint, as we noted in our release, basically the improvement in gross profit through most of the year has been mix-driven based on what happened in Best Buy Mobile growing successfully, and just stayed lower portion of notebook computers in our mix. I'll remind you that, remember last year in Q4, with the launch of Windows 7? Notebooks in the mix went way up. So it depressed our margins in Q4 of last year, once again that was mix-driven. Overall, our re-rates in most of our categories has stayed very fairly stable. One exception would be in the Television business, and that's purely due to the mix of the type of TV sales that we've seen this year versus the previous year. As Mike mentioned, the new technologies that the industry planned to sell this year didn't grow as fast as the industry planned. We sold more mid-line televisions and lower-end televisions, so our margins in that space came down. But I would attribute that to kind of mixed within the TV categories, not a rate on a SKU-per-SKU-type product. So overall, rates relatively stable through the year. We think we have opportunities to drive more sales going forward as Mike talked about. That's going to have some impact and pressure on the rates next year, but those are incremental sales dollars in incremental margin dollars, that's why the guidance we've provided next year is expecting gross margins to grow, albeit at a slower rate then we saw this year."

So late in Q3, early in Q4, our computing comps were way down as we were bleeding down inventories to prepare for that Windows 7 launch. Computing comps in January and February last year were enormous in the business. I know I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we saw Q4 comps in mobile computing at about 40%, driven by that.

So to Shari's point, as we see opportunities in the marketplace to improve the utilization of our square footage, were actually doing it. I think for the things that we see in the models specifically for next year around investing and gaming and things of that nature, were not talking about enormous investments in those spaces to improve the productivity of those stores. Similar to what we think we can experience in the appliance space, given a better value proposition and labor model around selling appliances like we're seeing in our early days of our tech sales stores within Best Buy stores, demonstrates that we've got the right traffic in the store to convert customers if we have a better value prop and labor model. That's really where we saw the success in Best Buy Mobile, putting Best Buy Mobile in the store. Initially we didn't bring new customers into the store, we were leveraging the traffic that's there, and that space is way more productive than it was before. So we think we have opportunities to both to do that, but to also Shari's point, we also we think we have opportunities that we see how these labor models evolve to meet customer needs. We think we can pull that off in smaller square footage. And as we get sharper on what that looks like and how customers respond to that in this environment, we'll be pulling those leverage to accommodate that as well."

Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. I'd also like to remind you that Best Buy will be having an Analyst Investor Day at its corporate campus on April 14. If you would like to register for this event or need further information, please contact Investor Relations. For those of you that cannot make it in person, the event will be webcast and available on our IR site.
You will also note that our reported results this morning included detailed information regarding the impact of the restructuring activities we announced on February 22. I ask that you please refer to our earnings release to understand how our announced restructuring affected our fourth quarter year-end financial results within our Domestic and International segments and across the company as a whole. The adjusted numbers we will be discussing today do not include these charges. It should not be confused with the GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release and the GAAP numbers we will report in our 10-K.

Before we begin today's discussion, I want to pause and reflect on the horrific events in Japan. We've all been moved by the pictures of destruction in that country, and our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the people of Japan and the many vendor partners and friends of Best Buy who live and work there. Since the tsunami struck on March 11, we have been in close contact with our business partners in Japan and they know that we will support them to the best of our ability as they work to recover and rebuild from this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this disaster.
I'd like to cover a few things this morning. A quick recap of the fourth quarter, a look back at last year and some thoughts and priorities for this new year. First, the fourth quarter. Jim will provide you with a detailed overview of the quarter, but I'd like to highlight a few things. Gross margin improvements continued, a true reflection of the increased profit levers we have developed and highlighted via Domestic segment. Adjusted margins that were up 90 basis points. 
We demonstrated expense control in the quarter. Total company SG&A was up only slightly, as we reduced spending in response to the sluggish sales environment. Now, looking back on the full year, we faced a restrained consumer in a difficult industry environment during the year, especially in televisions. The TV market was down significantly last year, caused in large part by demand for IPTV and 3D TV that did not materialize as the industry had anticipated. But despite these challenges, I'm pleased with how we responded and executed. We wanted to improve our gross margins last year, and we did. Despite lower comps, our Domestic business adjusted gross margin was up 90 basis points. Overall gross profit dollars were up and importantly, gross profit per square foot was up. 
Our cost control was good throughout the year. SG&A was up less than 5% for the year, which was an improvement from the previous year. Our adjusted operating income dollars were up and operating margin was up despite a down comp in a difficult industry environment for the year. I think this was a significant accomplishment.
Putting it all together, despite the industry backdrop, the team responded well and our execution at the store level was good. Our retail customer satisfaction scores were up last year. Our close rate improved on a year-on-year basis and we had notable improvements in connections, accessories and Geek Squad Black Tie Protection. Having said that, we're never 100% satisfied with our customer experience and we intend to make it even better. More on that later. 
One of the strengths of Best Buy is our ability to change and adapt. One of our four company values, in fact, is to learn from challenge and change. The nature of our business requires us to constantly innovate. Just look at how quickly our assortment changes with the natural cycles of technology. Last year was no exception, and we took action to improve our model.
We have made good progress on our Connected World strategy and in building out differentiated value propositions to thrive in that world. Best Buy Mobile is the tip of the spear in our connected world strategy, and we gained share in the mobile phone category overall in the U.S., and particularly in the smartphone category. Best Buy Mobile also saw improvements in both Geek Squad Black Tie Protection and accessories over last year. Special appreciation goes out to more than 20,000 Geek Squad agents, who enabled the highest and best possible customer service in-store or at home.
Outside of mobile phones, we continued to see significant growth of connectivity in other areas. A good proof point of this was unit growth over 50% on AirCards and MiFi devices that deliver mobile broadband service to computing devices. As we've talked about, last summer we made significant changes to the store in a continuing effort to maximize our return on space. We decreased the size of declining categories and increased space of higher margin and faster growing categories. CD space was reduced by over 50%, and that space was allocated to fast-growing areas like Best Buy Mobile, eReaders and seasonal impulse products. 
In the fall, we launched the refresh of our Gaming business. Customers can now buy and sell pre-owned games in approximately 90% of our stores, and we've also added pre-ordered kiosks for new titles in all of our stores. The Gaming business has a long heritage at Best Buy, and we're determined to strengthen our position as a premier destination for all types of gamers. 
We also launched the Buy Back Program with a campaign that included our first ever Super Bowl commercial. Our research shows that a high percentage of consumers agree that concerns about obsolescence have likely prevented them, or would prevent them in the future from purchasing CE products. The Buy Back Program allows customers to future-proof their technology purchases in a world where technological advances are rapid and relentless. It's still early, but we've seen encouraging trends for this program to date. Outside of the period, it was offered for free. This program is particularly appealing in mobile phone and tablet categories, which gives us meaningful differentiation in two of the highest-growing categories in CE.
As I mentioned, we recently announced a significant restructuring of our International business that we believe will build on the positive aspects of our International business performance last year. We had good sales growth led by Five Star in China and saw encouraging signs from smaller business like Mexico. Excluding the announced restructuring charges, our international operating income growth was up over 30% last year. 
Looking forward to fiscal 2012, Jim will take you through the guidance in detail, but here are some areas of particular focus. I strongly believe Best Buy's business model is positioned for success this year. We're fully aware that consumers are still relatively constrained and some of our major categories are coming off challenging years. As you saw from our sales guidance for this year, we're still assuming that some of these headwinds will continue. This is particularly a concern with a housing market that's still not growing, and the cost of energy will have a predictable impact to consumers. 
That said, we see several significant incremental opportunities this year, and we have targeted plans in place to take full advantage of them. One clear incremental opportunity for us this year is growing in product categories where we have lower share like mobile, appliances and gaming. And Mike Vitelli will take you through that detail in a moment.
We also see an opportunity to enhance the overall returns of our stores and we are taking actions to realize that. First, we have projects that we expect will improve performance in our big-box stores, including key lessons from our connected store pilot and actions we're taking in our Appliance business; second, we've slowed big-box square footage growth; and third, we're increasing our points of presence in small-box formats like Best Buy Mobile, a model that's relevant to a new set of customers and one that has powerful and proven returns. To sum it up, we are exploring and redefining what the optimal big-box footprint is for us, and we're finding ways to maximize returns through a variety of actions, including extending many of our key categories that should increase customer footsteps every day. 
We believe a strong physical presence and a strong online presence is a major competitive advantage for Best Buy and a point of differentiation. Last year, our U.S. Dotcom business sales were up significantly and according to our estimates, our market share was also up in this channel. However, we have real opportunities to improve our performance in the online channel, and we're taking actions now to do this. 
We're responding to how customers want to shop. And what we're hearing loud and clear is that many customers want to use multiple channels. We offer customers options and solutions across all channels and across the entire spectrum of price points. As a testament to this, when you look across our U.S. big-box stores, and our Dotcom channel, our traffic was up in fiscal 2011.
Last year, we deployed two new multi-channel options for customers to add to our already popular in-store pickup-within-the-hour approach. We started ship-to-store and friends and family guest pickup. After these two additions were deployed, we saw total in-store pickup go from approximately 35% to over 40% of all products sold online. And our Mobile Web and Apps business had the highest growth rate this year of any of our touch points, demonstrating that we are increasingly serving customers where and how they want to shop. An important proof point to support the value of multi-channel is the fact that recently, almost 80% of larger-screen TVs that were purchased online at Best Buy were picked up in the store. We believe we are an industry leader in giving consumers plenty of information, choice and speed in how they want to purchase their products.
So what do we anticipate for TVs overall this year? We expect to see very large screen TVs, which will include all the latest technology at great prices. We will have to see how consumers respond to this environment, but we believe that this combination will play to our strengths because our strength is helping customers understand the new technology, walking them through the different options and having the Geek Squad deliver, install and set up the equipment.
One last opportunity I'd like to briefly discuss is our International business. We've focused that business. We're investing strongly in the growth of Five Star, we continue to expand and drive our powerful warehouse [ph] Small-Box business and we're conservatively expanding our Best Buy stores in the relatively new markets of Mexico and the United Kingdom. I believe this focused strategy will allow our International business to contribute significantly to our overall profitability over time.
Last month we announced some high profile changes to our business that demonstrate our commitment to focus investment only on efforts that meet our expectations for profitable returns. We will continue to be disciplined and tenacious about investing in areas that meet our standards for ROIC, and we intend to actively reach out to new customers of all ages and interests to take advantage of how easy it is to shop for, compare and buy with confidence at Best Buy in-store and online. 
To gain traction in this environment, we have to provide good reasons to shop and buy now. Our partnerships with the industry's largest investment manufacturers allow us the opportunity to attract and acquire increased numbers of new customers with strong offers, available credit and broad assortments of products, all backed with the industry's best technical service. This promise continues to be the foundation of our company and will serve our new and loyal customers. 
In closing, I am looking forward to this year. We have several exciting incremental opportunities in front of us that I believe play into Best Buy's core strengths, all the while being realistic about the headwinds we all see. We will continue to make the changes we need to make, to meet the challenges of this dynamic marketplace, to evolve our business and to focus our capital initiatives in the areas that generate the greatest customer acquisition and returns on our market-leading position.
With that, I'd like to pass it to Mike Vitelli for some additional color around opportunities in our U.S. business. Mike?"

One clear incremental opportunity for us is to grow in specific areas of our business. There are several areas in our store where we believe we have a powerful value proposition, with a great brand fit but our share is low. And we believe with effective communication and great execution, we have the opportunity to pick up additional share. 
First, mobile. Best Buy Mobile has been executing very well and we've gained share. But despite that strong showing, our share is still only around 6%. We're seeing solid momentum in this business. We're growing the footprint of mobile in our big-box stores to add additional accessories. And as we announced last month, we're planning to open an additional 150 mobile standalone stores, taking the count to a total of approximately 325 stores by the end of this year. In addition, our new Buy Back Program is especially relevant to mobile phone consumers, and we're seeing strong attach rates as well as increasing buyback attach rates when bundled with Geek Squad Black Tie Protection. Our biggest obstacle to growing mobile share appears to be awareness, and we believe the store count growth, supported by advertising to drive consumer awareness and smart promotions like Free Phone Fridays will address the awareness gap and accelerate our growth. 
Last year's hot product was the iPad, and we had success with the iPad and now again with the iPad 2. As choice becomes more important in the emerging tablet category, we are best positioned to showcase the choices and inspire our customers to the art of what's possible. We offer the ability to touch and try all the models side-by-side. We have employees who can explain the differences between the different products and platforms, offering unbiased advice. Best Buy customers can maximize the benefits of their purchases with the accessories, content and connections that they want and need. To make this experience come to life, we intend to use a similar proven labor, training and compensation operating model used by Best Buy Mobile to drive the Tablet business. 
Finally, we've launched our Buy Back Program for tablets, which, like mobile phones, is particularly relevant for consumers who love to have the latest and greatest. And Buy Back makes Best Buy a great place to buy your smartphone and your tablet.
Another opportunity is appliances. Appliances represented 5% of our U.S. sales last year and we're still number four in the market. But appliances has a big footprint in our stores, and we need to get a better return on that space. We believe we can make significant improvements to our Appliance business and improve our share position. We're seeing it already. As a good example, we’ve seen solid results when we take key elements of the Pacific Sales appliance model into Best Buy. Currently, we have eight Pac sales stored [ph] in the store concepts on the West Coast. And in Southern California where we have both Best Buy and Pac sales, we've seen both higher market share and better growth for our appliance business overall. 
The gaming industry is a $20 billion business in which Best Buy is number two in hardware and number three in software, and we currently have a very small share in preowned games. In order to improve our position and materially change the way we compete in this space, we're making investments in dedicated gaming labor, in-store and online pre-order and trade-in capability and digital content. First we've added the ability to pre-order games in all of our stores and on BestBuy.com. We'll also change our promotional rhythm on new games to promote them during the pre-release and pre-order periods, when most consumer activity occurs for many iconic franchise games. Second, we've added the ability to trade-in used games at Best Buy for the more attractive Best Buy Gift Card, and this includes the ability to use those trade-in dollars for anything in the Best Buy store, not just game titles. Best Buy will offer an outstanding gaming experience for our customers, and these investments will allow us to participate in the multibillion-dollar digital and preowned spaces that are almost entirely incremental to our current business with higher margins, and we regularly expect this to drive traffic to our stores. We're seeing very good signs that customers are eager for choices and like our offers. 
And before now that I hand this over to Jim, I'd like to discuss one more thing. There’s been some discussion recently about our pricing strategy that is incorrect and I'd like to take this opportunity to address this. Can we do things to improve our price impressions with customers? Absolutely. We see this opportunity and we're acting on it. And we also know we bring value to buying technology in more ways than just price. As a result, we believe and our share would support, that we're perhaps the leading destination to buy technology in the world. First and foremost, we’re committed in our stores and online, to ensure people buy the right technology to meet their needs and the accessories, connections, content and services to get them the experience that made them want to buy it in the first place. 
What's more, we make technology more accessible through financing and Reward Zone. We make it easy to get their technology up and stay running through a wide array of service products, and we allow consumers to future-proof and protect their technology through products like Buy Back and Geek Squad Black-tie Protection. Pricing transparency has never been better for our customers. It's easy to price check products today, even right in your hand on your smartphone. But many of our value-added promotions like financing and Reward Zone, and others like bundled savings don't translate well into SKU-only product price comparison engines.
Best Buy intends to use a variety of pricing strategies to compete against a diverse set of competitors which often differ by category. We sell thousands of products and services in dozens of different categories. Applying a single pricing strategy across all of our products and categories would not be practical or rewarding. My point is that price matters and so does value, and we want to make sure that we're more effectively communicating our prices and value offers in all Best Buy channels everyday to get customers the best and right solutions for each of them.
With that, I'll hand it over to Jim."

I'd like to start this morning by recapping our fourth quarter financial results, and by providing some additional color on our performance. Then I'll recap what we set out to accomplish in fiscal '11 and how we performed against those goals. We will close with our thoughts on how we currently see fiscal '12 playing out and the resulting financial guidance. 
As Bill noted up front, the numbers we will be discussing exclude the restructuring charges detailed in our release this morning. This morning, we announced adjusted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.98, which was up 9% versus last year. As Brian mentioned up front, we are pleased to continue the theme of strong gross margin performance, driven primarily by strength in our key connectivity category, Best Buy Mobile, along with disciplined SG&A spending set against the consumer demand backdrop in our industry.
Let's quickly run through some of the key headlines. First, in the fourth quarter, revenue declined 2%, driven by a comparable store sales decline of 4.6% and partially offset by new store growth. In our Domestic segment, fourth quarter revenues decreased almost 4% from last year to $12.1 billion, as comparable store sales declined 5.5%. While on the surface, this decline appears similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, the trend was actually modestly better when you look at the two-year comp and consider that domestic comparable store sales were up over 7% in the fourth quarter last year. 
The decline in comp store sales was driven primarily by a couple of factors. First, the industry continued to experience lower demand in key categories, including TVs and notebook computers. Second, we were up against a nearly 40% comparable store sales gain last year in mobile computing, largely due to the launch of Windows 7. 
Sales in our International segment increased approximately 4% to $4.1 billion, driven primarily by new store growth and the impact of favorable FX rates. These gains were partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.3%. Our Best Buy Europe business experienced a low single-digit percent increase in comparable store sales for the quarter. Canada saw many of the same consumer demand industry headwinds that were experienced in the Domestic segment, which resulted in a similar low single-digit comparable store sales decline. In Five Star, we experienced a low single-digit comparable store sales decline as we began to lapse [ph] significant year-over-year strength. For context, our Five Star comparable store sales growth was over 35% during the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. For the full year, Five Star experienced a comparable store sales growth of 18% in fiscal '11. 
Turning now to gross margins, the highlight for the quarter was again the continued expansion of our gross profit rate. Total company gross profit rate of 24.4% reflected a 40-basis-point year-over-year improvement. The domestic gross profit rate was up 90 basis points to 24.5%. The 90-basis-point expansion can be attributed to overall flat rates and an improvement in mix due to continued growth in Best Buy Mobile and a lower mix of computing and entertainment hardware and software. 
Additionally, similar to the first three quarters of the year, gross margin rates improved slightly as a larger portion of our vendor programs were orientated towards purchase incentives instead of advertising support, which is recorded as a reduction in SG&A. Just as a reminder, this is the last quarter this reclassification will impact our year-over-year financial comparisons as we will anniversary this change in the first quarter of fiscal '12. 
Within the International segment, the gross profit rate of 24.2% reflects a 120-basis-point decline year-over-year, primarily driven by a higher mix of sales in the B2B channel in Europe, partially offset by strong margin improvements by both our Five Star and our teams in Canada.
Turning to SG&A, fourth quarter expenses increased just 2% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. SG&A dollar growth was limited due to tight cost controls on variable spending items. In addition, similar to the third quarter, SG&A also benefited from lower incentive compensation expense tied to our overall financial results. Lower incentive costs favorably impacted our overall rate by 40 and 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the full year respectively. Bringing it all together, the net result is that the fourth quarter operating income decreased 4% versus last year to $1.2 billion or 7.5% of sales. Again, these results exclude the restructuring costs Bill referenced.
I also wanted to touch on a couple of specific points related to how we closed out the year to help avoid any potential confusion. First, the year ended with higher-than-usual working capital, including inventory, accounts payable and accounts receivable. Each of these items included several timing-related events, so let's spend a minute and touch on each of the key drivers. As you saw in the release, total inventory was up 7.5% year-over-year compared to up 12% at the end of the third quarter. In Q4, growth from new stores and changes in foreign currency contributed approximately half of the inventory increase. 
Domestic comparable store inventory in Q4 was up 2% and reflected an improvement over the third quarter, which was up 8%. The growth in domestic inventory was principally in support of the continued strong sales growth in Best Buy Mobile. As the company reduced inventory receipts in January and February in response to holiday sales trends, total accounts payable declined as we paid for our existing inventory under our normal practices. Accordingly, accounts payable finished the year lower than last year due to timing changes in our inventory receipt patterns this year. And finally, we also saw an increase in the receivables at year-end, due to the timing of several large payments due from our vendors. A large portion of these payments have been received since our year-end. The combined impact of the above items increased our year-end working capital and lowered free cash flow. 
To be clear, our overall working capital and cash flow model has not changed significantly, as these items are timing in nature. We anticipate our working capital positions will return to more normalized levels in the first half of fiscal '12, which will benefit our year-over-year free cash flow generation.
Second, our effective tax rate of 31.4% was lower than last year and our expectations, due primarily to the favorable resolution of several tax matters in the quarter and a higher proportion of our income from foreign operations, which is taxed at lower rates. We estimate that temporary reductions in our tax rate favorably impacted the fourth quarter and full year earnings by approximately $0.12 and $0.11 respectively.
While there were certainly challenges that both Best Buy and the CE industry faced in fiscal '11, we also saw exciting growth opportunities in new connected technologies and achieved several important goals that we set out to accomplish during the year. We drove profitable sales growth in key parts of our business such as Best Buy Mobile by opening up over 100 new stand-alone stores, and saw continued growth in our profitable Five Star model in China. 
Domestic gross profit margins grew by 90 basis points for the year. This year-over-year gain shows that our connectivity strategy is gaining traction and demonstrates our ability to respond to market opportunities and grow margins even when some product categories are challenged, which we believe positions us well for the future. We announced restructuring plans for our International business, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing our profitability and returns. We exercised strong cost discipline in a tough environment, which limited SG&A dollar growth to 4.6% for the year. 
Setting aside the impact of the restructuring, this cost control, combined with our significant gross margin expansion, allowed us to grow operating income dollars 2% and operating income rate 10 basis points for the full year, despite a negative comp sales environment. And lastly, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion or 33 million shares of our stock, which is over 8% of the previously outstanding shares of the company during fiscal '11. This was the second largest year of repurchase activity in the history of the company, and we continue to see share repurchases as one of the important elements of improving returns for our shareholders over time.
Looking ahead to fiscal '12, we recognize that there continues to be many variables in the environment. It appears likely that macro influences such as unemployment, housing and higher gas prices may continue to pressure consumers. Strong companies and brands like Best Buy utilize times like these to play offense and leverage their position in the marketplace. We plan to pursue profitable growth opportunities by focusing on key connectivity categories like Best Buy Mobile, and exciting new technologies like tablets. 
As Mike discussed earlier, we are also planning to grow our Gaming and Appliance businesses in the year. Given these competing factors, our fiscal '12 plans reflect a range of potential outcomes, and are focused on making prudent investments in several profitable growth areas of our business, while maintaining disciplined cost control. 
Our fiscal 2012 guidance calls for top line revenue of $51 billion to $52.5 billion, which is an average of 1% to 4% growth year-over-year. Key assumptions behind this outlook include the new store plans we disclosed in late February, which call for approximately 150 new Best Buy Mobile standalone stores, U.S. big-box square footage growth of less than 1% and 40 to 50 new Five Star stores in China.
Additionally, we anticipate that the inclusion of the 53rd week during the fiscal fourth quarter will add approximately 1.5% to 2% year-over-year to our top line revenue. Partially offsetting these gains is our comparable store sales estimate for the year of flat to down 3%, which reflects our current view of the range of potential outcomes in this environment. Looking at gross margins, we expect to grow gross margins next year but at a more modest rate than in fiscal '11. We anticipate a large portion of this growth will be driven by further progress in our connectable categories led by Best Buy Mobile. 
As I mentioned earlier, we made solid progress in focusing our discretionary SG&A spending in fiscal '11. We will be prudent in our SG&A investments, striking an important balance of pushing forward on profitable growth areas and managing our SG&A. Given planned investments to grow our Connections business, the addition of the 53rd week and the impact of lapping more incentive costs in fiscal '11, we anticipate that total SG&A dollar spending will grow approximately 4% for the year or approximately 2%, excluding the impact of higher incentive comp and the 53rd week.
So rolling it all up, we anticipate that total operating income dollars will be flat to up 7%, as improvements in our gross margin rate mitigate potential softness in the comp sales environment. We also anticipate that the recently completed bond offering will add approximately $50 million to our full year net interest expense. Doing the math, this translates to approximately $0.08 of EPS for the year. 
Bringing it all together, we are forecasting annual non-GAAP EPS of $3.30 to $3.55 for fiscal 2012, which represents a 4% decrease to 4% increase year-over-year, excluding restructuring related charges. This adjusted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of any potential share repurchases in fiscal 2012. 
Taking a quick look at our fiscal '12 CapEx outlook, we expect to spend approximately $800 million, which would be slightly lower than our fiscal 2011 CapEx spend. With that as context for what we expect for the full year, let's shift gears and spend a minute on our phasing expectations for fiscal '12. First, we expect that our comparable store sales performance in the first half, especially in the first quarter, will be similar to the quarter we've just completed. Additionally, we anticipate that the second half sales will improve over the first half trends based on the actions already discussed by Brian and Mike earlier, including the initiatives in our Best Buy Mobile, Tablets, Gaming and Appliance businesses. And of course, we'll be up against much easier compares in the second half of the year. 
Regarding SG&A for the year, we anticipate higher growth in the second half of the year as incentive compensation returns to more normalized levels, and given the inclusion of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter. Given the phasing of our fiscal '11 actual results and the above assumptions, we do not anticipate that year-over-year EPS growth will grow until the second half of fiscal 2012.
One last thought on our outlook. Currently, we are not aware of any significant impacts to our business as a result of the recent tragedy in Japan. We are in contact with our vendor partners and suppliers but recognize that it is still too early for them to assess what impact, if any, this may have on our business in fiscal '12.
In closing, there were challenging elements that impacted the CE industry and Best Buy during fiscal '11. Consumers are clearly telling us that they are interested in capturing all the benefits of a connected lifestyle, but they are also selective about how and where they spend their discretionary dollars. We believe the strength of our multi-channel approach in serving customers; the ability to showcase all the latest and greatest technologies all in one place, coupled with our knowledgeable Blue Shirts who can help customers get the most out of their spending; continues to position our model attractively for customers, vendors and shareholders. Equally, we realize that we have many opportunities to improve our model, attract new customers and drive stronger performance in the near term and beyond. 
So with that, Alicia, we are ready for questions."

We'll use different operating models in those spaces to get the right amount of labor in with the customer, in a way that we think we can get better returns. So in those particular categories, those are queued up this year for that. And then two, I would call the general bucket of space, better returns in the existing stores from a category perspective. So we've expanded the space around Best Buy Mobile, we'll expand around tablets, and as we mentioned, we'll expand around gaming and the used gaming and gaming trade-in. More broadly on real estate, yes, we've got opportunity in the big-box portfolio. We're still a little bit early, but we like what we're seeing in the connected stores right now in terms of our ability to handle the traffic, to show customers better Connected World and multichannel value propositions in a less space.

These aren't in these track numbers yet. But our share this year was down about 100 basis points for the year. We were up 170 last year, so we're still on a sequencing trend positive over a multiyear basis. We have a very strong number one position in television, computing and digital imaging and television. Our share is higher than the next three competitors combined. So in those areas, we're going to really vigorously defend the share in those three positions. The biggest thing we're going to do to grow share is what I mentioned earlier, we have four categories for our shares that are in single digits. Gaming and software, we have probably a little over that, but we have massive area for improvement in mobile, appliances, tablets is just beginning.

So certainly, as we look at the different parts of our business, you have pieces moving in different directions but from a macro standpoint, as we noted in our release, basically the improvement in gross profit through most of the year has been mix-driven based on what happened in Best Buy Mobile growing successfully, and just a lower portion of notebook computers in our mix. I'll remind you that, remember last year in Q4, with the launch of Windows 7, notebooks in the mix went way up. So it depressed our margins in Q4 of last year, once again that was mix-driven. Overall, our rates in most of our categories has stayed very fairly stable. One exception would be in the Television business, and that's purely due to the mix of the type of TV sales that we've seen this year versus the previous year. As Mike mentioned, the new technologies that the industry planned to sell this year didn't grow as fast as the industry planned. We sold more mid-line televisions and lower-end televisions, so our margins in that space came down. But I would attribute that to kind of mix within the TV category, not a rate on a SKU-per-SKU-type product. So overall, rates relatively stable through the year. We think we have opportunities to drive more sales going forward as Mike talked about. That's going to have some impact and pressure on the rates next year, but those are incremental sales dollars and incremental margin dollars, that's why the guidance we've provided next year is expecting gross margins to grow, albeit at a slower rate than we saw this year."

I know you're investing in gaming, that seems also like an eventually declining category. So with 8% of your stores up for renewal each year, is there something else that's keeping you from closing stores in the U.S? Is it the age of the underperforming stores, maybe opening [indiscernible] (59:51) five, or do you expect innovation to ultimately be able to refill that space?"

There's nothing that's preventing us from doing things that we see in the model today that we should be taking actions on. So to Shari's point, as we see opportunities in the marketplace to improve the utilization of our square footage, we’re actually doing it. I think for the things that we see in the models specifically for next year around investing in gaming and things of that nature, we’re not talking about enormous investments in those spaces to improve the productivity of those stores. Similar to what we think we can experience in the appliance space, given a better value proposition and labor model around selling appliances like we're seeing in our early days of our Pac sales stores within Best Buy stores, demonstrates that we've got the right traffic in the store to convert customers if we have a better value prop and labor model. That's really where we saw the success in Best Buy Mobile, putting Best Buy Mobile in the store. Initially we didn't bring new customers into the store, we were leveraging the traffic that's there, and that space is way more productive than it was before. So we think we have opportunities to both to do that, but to also Shari's point, we also think we have opportunities as we see how these labor models evolve to meet customer needs. We think we can pull that off in smaller square footage. And as we get sharper on what that looks like and how customers respond to that in this environment, we'll be pulling those leverage to accommodate that as well."

Before I pass the call over to Brian, I'd like to take care of a few housekeeping items. First, we would like to request that callers limit themselves to a single questions so that we can include more people in our Q&A session. Also, as usual, the media who are participating in this call are in a listen-only mode. 
I'd like to highlight several enhancements we've made to our earnings material this quarter. First, we have included slides this quarter that complement the results. You'll find these slides on our IR site. We also included a quarterly cash flow statement, and we've included started reporting total domestic connections quarterly. And we started reporting Best Buy Mobile comps. You will also see that we renamed the category Home Office to Computing and Mobile Phones to better reflect what's in the category. Nothing in the category itself has changed. 
Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. You would also note that our reported results this morning included information regarding the impact of the restructuring activities we announced on February 22. I ask that you please refer to our earnings release to understand how our announced restructuring affected our first quarter results within our Domestic and International segments and across the company as a whole. The adjusted numbers we will be discussing today, do not include these charges, and should not be confused with GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release and the GAAP numbers we'll report in our 10-Q.

My comments this morning will focus on our first quarter performance and an update on our strategic priorities and opportunities. 
I feel good about our start to this fiscal year. We delivered improved sales trends and continued to generate significant cash flow which illustrates the financial health and strength of our company. Our multichannel strategy clearly differentiates us from competitors and gives us unique opportunities to grow. We are optimizing our skill for growth in the key areas we previously discussed, new products and services like tablets and connections, categories where we have a competitive advantage and significant upside such as appliances and gaming, and formats in new locations like Five Star in China and Best Buy Mobile standalone stores throughout the U.S. 
But before I jump over to the highlights of the quarter, I would like to thank our employees worldwide, those who helped create compelling offers and value propositions, as well as the men and women who work so diligently to bring the Connected World to life for our customers. Thank you for everything you do to make Best Buy a great place to shop and work.
Now let's take a look at some of the key items from the quarter. Our sales performance was better than planned. I'll provide more color on this in a minute. Our Domestic Online sales continue to grow at double-digit rates. As you know, we're committed to accelerating growth in our Internet business and our progress here shows that our focus on this channel and our overall multichannel strategy is progressing. Total Domestic connections grew 20% in the quarter. This growth show the momentum of our Connected World vision, both in Best Buy Mobile and the increasingly rapid growth of connections in our TV and Computing businesses. And we continue to take actions to improve returns to shareholders. During the first quarter, we brought back $0.5 billion worth of stock, representing 4% of our outstanding shares. 
Summarizing Q1, the quarter unfolded largely as we anticipated. We had been very deliberate creating new offers that leverage our unique capabilities and leading position in the marketplace, and consumers are responding.
Let me review some drivers of our Domestic performance in Q1. In Mobile Computing, we had improved performance overall, even against strong comparisons from last year. The biggest catalyst of our positive performance was the rapid growth in tablets as we successfully kicked off the launch of the iPad 2. Notebooks also improved versus the plans we experienced in the second half of last year. 
Best Buy Mobile continued its excellent performance, delivering comps of 28% with strong margins. We were a lead retailer for the launch of the Verizon iPhone, and as we positioned in our marketing, we are the home of 4G, with phones like the HT Inspire and the Samsung Epic leading the way. Allow me to share a brief example of the kind of unique compelling offers that our customers have responded to. In the last week of the quarter, we ran a promotion of a free smartphone combined with Lady Gaga's latest CD. The promotion was such a success that it was 1 of Mobile's best weeks of the year, and we believe we captured number 1 market share in sales of the physical CD as well. The results were great, but the real story here is the value of our cross category promotions to drive incremental revenue and traffic. 
Gaming sales trends also improved as we partnered with Nintendo on a very successful multichannel launch of the new 3DS portable gaming system during the quarter. Our sales performance is a positive sign because we're just ramping up many of the changes were making to our gaming business. I'll talk more about that in a bit.
We also activated targeted promotional programs across additional product categories online and in-store during the quarter. These were promotions with specific customer-focused value propositions, designed to drive incremental sales. While this promotional activity factor into the quarter's gross margin rate decline, which Jim will cover in more detail later, we're pleased with the incremental sales volumes we've produced. Our ability to create compelling offers that cause customers to respond shows that our operating model has elasticity and that we have selling products and services at values consumers can't pass up.  Looking at the financial performance in total, our goal to deliver bottom line results and operating income and EPS were consistent with our expectations for the quarter. 
Looking next that our International business, revenue and operating profit grew significantly. These improved results are emerging even before we fully realize the benefits from our increased focus on the International business, including the recently structuring and strategic investments in assets like Five Star, which was up to 170 stores at the close of the quarter. 
Five Star is off to a good start to the year. Comp sales were up 9% on top of over 30% comps last year. In addition, Five Star's growth [Audio Gap] to enhance our competitiveness and returns as we leverage the advantages inherent in our portfolio of physical and digital assets. Multiple ways to shop, buy and interact with us online. A variety of the store formats and sizes. Call centers staff with knowledgable Blue Shirts and agents as well as a wide range of in-store remote and in-home services. 
I'd like to provide some color and updates around these priorities.  Let's start with Online. We are determined to double or U.S. Online business in the next 3 to 5 years, and as I mentioned, our Online revenue grew double-digits in Q1. Our business in this channel strengthened throughout the quarter as we started to the ramp up many new activities to drive traffic, including the significant expansion of our online assortment. This is a key component to improving our competitive position online and we've made good progress to date, adding over 10,000 SKUs online since Q1 of last year. 
Another important part of our multichannel strategy is leveraging our complimentary physical channels with the Internet to provide even greater points of presence. A couple of good examples: Best Buy Mobile standalone stores now sell tablets as well, and also take in preowned video game title; this is important because our mobile stores have a differentiated traffic and attracts a unique customer base. 25% of shoppers in our Mobile stores are first-time Best Buy customers, and these locations also have a higher proportion of female shoppers in our big-box stores. 
Next, let's take a look at a few strategic areas where we intend to leverage our scale to grow: Tablets, mobile phone, appliances and gaming. First, tablets. As we've said, we're making a big push in tablets this year and expect to have the strongest assortment in the marketplace. We started rolling out Tablet Central in May and in the beginning of July, we expect it will be in all of our big-box stores. Tablet Central will be a zone within our Computing Department with the value proposition modeled from the Best Buy Mobile. It will be a one-stop shop showcasing the features, connections and accessory opportunities for tablets. We believe that this will play directly to our strengths of demonstrating new technology and helping customers navigate the way to the important choices. The tablets base is heating up now, and our vendor partners are aggressively advertising to build awareness. So we expect to see the number of tablets ramp up quickly in this quarter. We're excited about the variety of models we offer, complete with a wide range of features and price points that will drive consumer interest as well as our business.
Next, mobile phones. As I mentioned, Mobile comps were up 28% for the quarter and our data shows that the significantly increased our smartphone share in the quarter. We also opened about 20 standalone stores in Q1, taking the total to almost 200. You may recall that we began increasing the Mobile footprint in our big-box stores last year. And now we have expanded space allocations in 600 stores. We believe we have a very differentiated model in this category, and Mobile upgrade checks are a great example of that. We did almost 40 million upgrade checks for customer last quarter, compared to 9 million for all of last year. Over 1/3 of these customers opting in the program and want us to contact them when they're due for an upgrade. This provides us a great opportunity to engage new customers on a requested basis.
Appliances and gaming, these are areas where we believe we can bring more to customers than our competition and we're on track to reach the goals we've set to these businesses. In the Appliance category, we focused on timing promotions to match the seasonality of the appliance market consumer demand. This, combined with the continued rollout of operating model improvements, resulted in a solid financial performance in a downmarket this quarter.
Finally, gaming, we're making a lot of important changes to our Gaming business, and specifically, how we approach the full life cycle of the game customer. We've made progress, and as I said before, our new model is not yet fully rolled out. For example, we've launched a new dedicated desk in the gaming department, with an adjacent pre-order touchscreen to help customers get the games they want. Our results have shown that when we have the preowned trade in desk within the gaming department, there are trade-ins and preowned sales improved by a 2 to 1 ratio. One important advantage we have allows customers to trade in used games and receive a Best Buy Gift Card that can be used on anything online and in the store, not just in other games. Right now, we're seeing about half of the value of these footprints been spent outside the gaming department, which tells us that our value proposition truly is adding value and differentiating. Trade-ins and preowned sales are still relatively new, but we're making good progress.
E3 was last week, and we made several important gaming-related announcements at the event. Let me highlight 1 that is another example of our multichannel advantage. In order to drive our Gaming business, we're giving over 2 million Reward Zone Gamers Club numbers, $100 in Reward Zone points to spend on anything on the store or online when they pre-order and pick up games. 
Wrapping things up, we've mentioned the various ways we can leverage our physical and digital assets to strengthen competitive advantage. Our multichannel strategy, which includes big-box stores, small footprint stores, our e-commerce channel, mobile Web and apps, digital content delivery, compelling Reward Zone benefits, call center Blue Shirts and agents, in-home remote and in-store services allows us to uniquely serve customers within and across a variety of channels. It's much, much more than simply stores and a website. 
I'd like to once again thank our employees for the results they've delivered this quarter. We're making steady progress through priorities we talked about during our Analyst Day. We are financially strong, and we manage a highly cash-generative business. We continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation on a core set of growth initiatives, as well as returning cash to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim."

Today, I'd like to cover some of the financial highlights of our first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the year, and provide you some additional color on how we're progressing on several of the key value drivers in our business.",1896,"Thanks, Brian. Today, I'd like to cover some of the financial highlights of our first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the year, and provide you some additional color on how we're progressing on several of the key value drivers in our business. 
Before we get started, I want to call your attention to a couple of specific new additions that Bill noted up front to our quarterly reporting that we know you will find helpful.  First, to better highlight the growth trends and momentum tied to our profitable Connected World initiatives, we're adding both domestic mobile phone comp sales and total connections growth information to our regular quarterly reporting rhythm. Second, we have accelerated the disclosure of our condensed cash flow statement information to the quarterly press release. 
For those public service announcements out of the way, let's turn to some of the key highlights and insights from Q1. Total first quarter revenue grew by a little over 1%, driven primarily by net new store growth and the favorable impact of foreign currency. These gains were partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.7%. In the Domestic segment, sales declined 1% and comparable store sales were down 2.4%. As we discussed at the beginning of the year, we planned for the domestic comps to be down in Q1. The performance in Q1 was actually better than we had expected, and also represented a significant sequential improvement over the fourth quarter comp sales trends that were down 5.5%. The improvement in this trend was driven primarily by Mobile Computing and Gaming. Mobile Computing comp was up mid-single digits, driven by strong tablet sales growth as we continue to make a big push in tablets with the rollout of Tablet Central and also by improved trends in notebooks. Gaming trends also improved significantly from Q4, with comps only down slightly. As Brian already highlighted, we continued to see strong growth in Domestic Mobile phones were comps were up 28%, as we experienced the benefits from both our differentiated model and Best Buy Mobile and strong customer interest in smartphones.
Next, high consumer interest in e-readers, coupled with our broad assortment in this space drove triple digit comp growth. I mentioned this because while this category still is relatively small in overall dollar terms, its growth was strong enough this quarter to meaningfully benefit our overall domestic comp. It also serves as a reminder of the excitement customers are demonstrating in mobile technologies and showcases our ability to bring this experience together for them, both online and in-store to drive growth.
Our clients comps were up almost 3%, due to successful promotional activities and actions taken during focused customer drive times in Q1. This results encouraging giving the in the industry and based on the fact that we were lapping last year's significant low double digit comp gains, driven by rebate incentives.
TV comps were down high single digits, which was similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. Given the current macro environment, we continue to plan for a modest near-term outlook in this category, and note that our Q1 performance in TVs was consistent with our plans.
During the quarter, it also became evident that digital camera sales in the industry would be negatively impacted by component shortages, driven by the events in Japan. Looking forward, we currently expect product availability will improve as we progress further in the year.
Sales in our International segment increased approximately 8%, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency, net new store growth and a 0.4% comparable store sales gain. This gain was primarily the result of high single-digit comparable store sales gains in our  Five Star business, which was on top of an almost 35% comp last year. Canada and Best Buy Europe experienced low single-digit comp declines.
Turning to gross profit, first quarter gross profit dollars of $2.8 billion were down approximately 1%. As I have discussed previously, driving gross profit dollar growth is a key priority for this organization which we continue to plan on delivering for the year. 
Looking closer at the Domestic segment gross profit rates, you will recall that the comparisons to last year will be difficult in fiscal 2012, given our very strong domestic rate performance of up 90 basis points last year, including up 60 basis points in the first quarter of last year. This is not new information. It just provides you important context for our comparisons throughout the year.
The Q1 domestic gross profit rate declined 60 basis points year-over-year and was driven primarily by rate declines, partially offset by a favorable mix impact from the continued growth in Best Buy Mobile. 
Four key items contributed to the lower rates in the quarter. First, we took offensive actions and targeted promotional activity designed to drive revenue improvements in key categories like Computing, Appliances and Gaming. Second, product availability issues in higher margin digital cameras impacted our sales and margins as the industry was adversely affected by the events in Japan that I spoke about earlier.  Third, we experienced higher transportation costs driven in part by higher fuel costs and finally, the Q1 margins were also impacted as we anniversary-ed of the large annual vendor rebate that we received in the first fiscal quarter of 2011 that we discussed with you last year.  So when you put all these pieces together and you normalize for the items that were more onetime in nature, we estimate that the domestic gross margin rate would have been down closer to 30 to 35 basis point for the quarter. 
Within the International segment, we had strong 6% increase in gross profit dollars driven by growth in sales, gross profit rate growth within Five Star and improved margin performance in Canada. Overall, the International gross margin rate of 25.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year, was driven largely by the mix impact of higher B2B sales in Europe, which provide incremental gross margin dollars but at a lower rate.
Turning to SG&A, first quarter expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at $2.5 billion, and we leveraged 30 basis points on a rate basis. Consistent with our previous plans, we expect that Q1 will represent the lowest level of SG&A dollar spending growth for the year. As you will recall, we had our highest spending growth levels in Q1 last year. This combined with the timing of our investments to support growth in areas like Best Buy Mobile standalone stores, Tablet Central and the rollout of used gaming this year and the addition of the 53rd week, together are expected to result in higher year-over-year spending growth in Qs 2 through to Q4 over the flat growth we experienced in the first quarter. To be clear, our expectation for annual SG&A dollar growth of approximately 4% excluding the impacts of FX remains unchanged. 
As you would expect, given the impact of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter, we anticipate that SG&A dollar growth in the second half will be higher than the annual 4% rate and the first half will finish at the lower end of this rate.
Overall, we are pleased that the operational and promotional actions we took in the quarter drove improved sales trends. While these investments resulted in a slight decline in gross profit dollars, we continue to demonstrate solid expense management and delivered operating income and EPS within our expectations for the first quarter.
Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong and continue to highlight 1 of the key strengths of our model. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $1.3 billion, up significantly from last year. As I discussed at length during last quarter is called, the biggest driver of the Q1 operating cash flow increased was the reversal of year and timing differences in several key working capital items. We successfully lowered Q1 inventory levels and domestic comp store inventories finished down 4%. Receivable positions and payables also made good progress to returning to more normalized levels from where we finished fiscal 2011. 
Before we leave the quarter, I also want to provide an update on the progress we had made on several key value drivers in the business. Brian has already commented on the performance on the online channel so I'll start with connections. We believe that connections are important proxy for you to assess our progress and our Connected World strategy that we discussed. Connections are clearly a very profitable part of that HACCS model that we are intent on growing. Our target for this year is to grow our total domestic connections from 8 million units last year to 10 million units. We have made good progress towards that goal. With domestic connections growth of up 20% for the first quarter. To add a little color to that number within mobile phones we had higher growth of mobile phones postpaid connections which drove strong mobile comp sales and importantly, mobile gross margin dollars. Connections within both mobile computing and TVs also increased significantly during the quarter.
During our recent Analyst Day, we also talked about structural opportunities that would help us further improve our strong model. One of the key goals we have in this space is to reduce our big box square footage in the U.S. by 10% over the next 3 to 5 years. We've made good initial progress in our plan to achieve this goal, and have started space reduction discussions with several landlords. We will keep you updated on this initiative as it progresses.
That brings me to our outlook for the year. As we mentioned up front, we delivered our plan for the first quarter. With a vast majority of this year's sales and earnings still in front of us, we still anticipate delivering on our financial goals for the year. Based on what we can see so far, we expect full year revenue towards the higher end of the guided range of $51 billion to $52.5 billion. We also continue to expect annual operating income dollars of flat to growth of 7%. Additionally, we still anticipate delivering on our expectations for operating income dollars in the first half of FY '12 consistent with our original plans. Bringing in altogether, we are maintaining our annual non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.30 to $3.55, excluding restructuring related charges and the impact of FY '12 share repurchases.
So to summarize, the year is off to a good start. We took actions to improve the sales trajectory of our business and delivered earnings in line with our plans. We're excited about the growth opportunities we continue to see and expanding technology and service offerings for customers, and know that the combination of our physical and digital assets puts us in a unique position to compete and win. At the same time we also know that the customer is stretched thin in the current environment. So we would be fluid and purposeful with our plans and follow them where they need us to go, and we will be competitive in the marketplace.  And finally, we are leveraging our strong financial condition and taking actions to improve our returns by improving growth, capitalizing on structural opportunities and generating cash to both invest in the business and to return to shareholders. 
So with that, Lisa, we are ready for the callers' questions."

We said we're going to follow the customer where the customer wants to be based on the categories that they have the most interest in. And we knew we have more elasticity in the demand as we tightened up our promotional model across several key categories. We made emphasis in the quarter to focus on areas that we thought we could benefit from customer traffic early, especially in the Gaming, Appliance and Computing businesses, and we're very pleased, as Brian mentioned, that we saw progress in that space. So we anticipate that the year is going to continue to be competitive as it always is every year and we're just excited that we have the opportunity to use some of the multichannel assets we have to continue to drive the top line growth in our business throughout the year. We'll see where the customer goes, but we're quite encouraged by what we've seen so far in this space."

And we don't have any imminent announcement about our business in the U.K. and you know I don't comment on rumors. Thanks for the question, Gary."

A few comments. One, first in terms of the question around labor, we have already done work and will continue to do it around pulling out nonproductive, noncustomer phasing, tasking and operating task labor and the team's did a very good job at the very beginning of this year that we then turned around and reinvested into gaming categories specifically. So we funded the gaming value proposition and dedicated labor by taking on productive labor into other places in the store. That's always the first choice and we'll keep doing that. Secondarily to your question about training, yes, we absolutely have to be better in what we're delivering to the customer and the level of knowledge, selling interaction and skills that we deliver in our stores. We've got a I think good legacy of being very good at that and give into our competitors are today and given what the demands are of the customers we have to be better. And to that, we put a significant investment in training across all of our store, specifically focused on both the product knowledge side of it, as well as the selling skills side of it. And we're in process of doing that right now. And then thirdly in terms of op model changes, we've talked before about some of the things we're testing in the Connected Stores of which we now have about 30 plus stores operating without operating model. And yes, we found that in particular in the spaces where there's more complexity for the consumers. Mobile is a good example that you already know about, computing is another example of that, where we get the right level of dedicated labor to that and we've got them in both a different compensation model that includes compensation around their overall productivity, as well as how their customers rate them, as well as their demonstrated level of knowledge, we like the early results receive their impact in our testers, we now have the 2 tiers of different selling skills and selling rules in the store. But it's still early but we like what were seen so far. So yes would be the answer to number 3. And as always, we just going to make sure that we get the return that we need on the changes. But there's no doubt there's opportunity there."

I also think to Shari's comment earlier, the fact that our in-store pickup grew so materially in April, I think in May is such an important indicator about what the consumer actually wants. And we know when we get consumers in the store to make an in-store pickup, it is a good -- not only good for the consumer, it's a good experience for our shareholders as well. So we're not overly concerned with the migration we're making from bricks to online.

Clearly, we're focused on delivering our gross margin dollar goals for the year. As you know from our history, a to of the margin rate that we see especially within our Domestic business, is driven by the types of products that people want to buy. So last year was softer in the computing space overall as tablets took off. We saw mix favorability this year. 2 years ago as we saw strong notebook sales with the release of things like Windows 7. We saw very high notebook sales which impacted our mix negatively so. As we look in pull apart where does the customer want to go, how do we balance our promotion to drive both top line, to get those customers in stores so the that we can sell them that suite of services that our HACCS model that really differentiates us not only for customers but also for shareholders. We're going to be there on price with them in the categories they want us to be in. So sitting here, as you look at the results in Q1, we certainly don't expect that our margin rates are going to continue in the same space that we've seen in Q1. But it's just too early in the year to know exactly where it's going to be. We're focused on delivering margin dollars and are going to grow them to the year and our plan is to grow operating income in the range of provided of zero to 7% and we'll see where the customer needs us to be."

Also, as usual, the media who are participating in this call in a listen-only mode. 
I'd like to highlight several enhancements we've made to our earnings material this quarter. First, we have included slides this quarter that complement the results. You'll find these slides on our IR site. We've also included a quarterly cash flow statement, and we've included -- started reporting total domestic connections quarterly. And we started reporting Best Buy Mobile comps. You will also see that we renamed the category home office to computing and mobile phones to better reflect what's in the category. Nothing in the category itself has changed. 
Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.

It's early  but  I feel go",1911,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings conference call. My comments this morning will focus on our first quarter performance and an update on our strategic priorities and opportunities. 
It's early  but  I feel good about our start to this fiscal year. We delivered improved sales trends and continued to generate significant cash flow which illustrates the financial health and strength of our company. Our multichannel strategy clearly differentiates us from competitors and gives us unique opportunities to grow. We are optimizing our skill for growth in the key areas we previously discussed, new products and services like tablets and connections, categories where we have a competitive advantage and significant upside such as appliances and gaming and formats in new locations like Five Star in China and Best Buy Mobile standalone stores throughout the U.S. 
But before I jump over to the highlights of the quarter, I would like to thank our employees worldwide, those who helped create compelling offers and value propositions, as well as the men and women who work so diligently to bring the Connected World to life for our customers. Thank you for everything you do to make Best Buy a great place to shop and work.
Now, let's take a look at some of the key items from the quarter. Our sales performance was better than planned. I'll provide more color on this in a minute. Our Domestic Online sales continue to grow at double-digit rates. As you know, we're committed to accelerating growth in our Internet business, and our progress here shows that our focus on this channel and our overall multichannel strategy is progressing. Total domestic connections grew 20% in the quarter. This growth shows the momentum of our Connected World vision, both in Best Buy Mobile and the increasingly rapid growth of connections in our TV and Computing businesses. And we continue to take actions to improve returns to shareholders. During the first quarter, we bought back $0.5 billion worth of stock, representing 4% of our outstanding shares. 
Summarizing Q1, the quarter unfolded largely as we anticipated. We had been very deliberate in creating new offers that leverage our unique capabilities and leading position in the marketplace, and consumers are responding.
Let me review some drivers of our domestic performance in Q1. In Mobile Computing, we had improved performance overall, even against strong comparisons from last year. The biggest catalyst of our positive performance was the rapid growth in tablets as we successfully kicked off the launch of the iPad 2. Notebooks also improved versus the steeper declines we experienced in the second half of last year. 
Best Buy Mobile continued its excellent performance, delivering comps of 28% with strong margins. We were a lead retailer for the launch of the Verizon iPhone, and as we positioned in our marketing, we are the home of 4G, with phones like the HT (sic) [HTC] Inspire and the Samsung Epic leading the way. 
Allow me to share a brief example of the kinds of unique compelling offers that our customers have responded to. In the last week of the quarter, we ran a promotion of a free smartphone combined with Lady Gaga's latest CD. The promotion was such a success that it was one of mobile's best weeks of the year, and we believe we captured #1 market share in sales of the physical CD as well. The results were great, but the real story here is the value of our cross category promotions that drived incremental revenue and traffic. 
Gaming sales trends also improved, as we partnered with Nintendo on a very successful multichannel launch of the new 3DS portable gaming system during the quarter. Our sales performance is a positive sign because we're just ramping up many of the changes were making to our gaming business. I'll talk more about that in a bit.
We also activated targeted promotional programs across additional product categories online and in-store during the quarter. These were promotions with specific customer-focused value propositions, designed to drive incremental sales. While this promotional activity factor into the quarter's gross margin rate decline, which Jim will cover in a more detail later, we are pleased with the incremental sales volumes we've produced. 
Our ability to create compelling offers that cause customers to respond shows that our operating model has elasticity and that we are truly selling products and services at values consumers can't pass up.  Looking at the financial performance in total, our goal is to deliver bottom line results, and operating income and EPS were consistent with our expectations for the quarter. 
Looking next that our International business. Revenue and operating profit grew significantly. These improved results are emerging even before we fully realized the benefits from our increased focus on the International business, including the recent restructuring and strategic investments in assets like Five Star, which was up to 170 stores at the close of the quarter. 
Five Star is off to a good start to the year. Comp sales were up 9% on top of over 30% comps last year. In addition, Five Star's growth [Audio Gap] to enhance our competitiveness and returns, as we leverage the advantages inherent in our portfolio of physical and digital assets, multiple ways to shop, buy and interact with us online, a variety of the store formats and sizes, call centers staff with knowledgable Blue Shirts and agents, as well as a wide range of in-store remote and in-home services. 
I'd like to provide some color and updates around these priorities.  Let's start with Online. We are determined to double our U.S. Online business in the next 3 to 5 years, and as I mentioned, our Online revenue grew double digits in Q1. Our business in this channel strengthened throughout the quarter, as we started to the ramp up many new activities to drive traffic, including the significant expansion of our online assortment. This is a key component to improving our competitive position online, and we've made good progress to date, adding over 10,000 SKUs online since Q1 of last year. 
Another important part of our multichannel strategy is leveraging our complimentary physical channels with the Internet to provide even greater points of presence. A couple of good examples: Best Buy Mobile standalone stores now sell tablets as well and also take in preowned video game titles. This is important because our mobile stores have a differentiated traffic and attracts a unique customer base. 25% of shoppers in our Mobile stores are first-time Best Buy customers, and these locations also have a higher proportion of female shoppers in our ""big-box"" stores. 
Next, let's take a look at a few strategic areas where we intend to leverage our scale to grow: tablets, mobile phone, appliances and gaming. First, tablets. As we've said, we're making a big push in tablets this year and expect to have the strongest assortment in the marketplace. We started rolling out Tablet Central in May. In the beginning of July, we expect it will be in all of our ""big-box"" stores. Tablet Central will be a zone within our Computing department with a value proposition modeled up for Best Buy Mobile. It will be a one-stop shop showcasing the features, connections and accessory opportunities for tablets. We believe that this will play directly to our strengths of demonstrating new technology and helping customers navigate their way to the important choices. 
The tablets base is heating up now, and our vendor partners are aggressively advertising to build awareness. So we expect to see the number of tablets ramp up quickly in this quarter. We're excited about the variety of models we offer, complete with a wide range of features and price points that will drive consumer interest, as well as our business.
Next, mobile phones. As I mentioned, mobile comps were up 28% for the quarter, and our data shows that we significantly increased our smartphone share in the quarter. We also opened about 20 standalone stores in Q1, taking the total to almost 200. You may recall that we began increasing the mobile footprint in our ""big-box"" stores last year. And now we have the expanded space allocation in 600 stores. We believe we have a very differentiated model in this category, and mobile upgrade checks are a great example of that. 
We did almost 4 million upgrade checks for customers last quarter, compared to 9 million for all of last year. Over 1/3 of these customers have opt in, in the program and want us to contact them when they're due for an upgrade. This provides us a great opportunity to engage new customers on a requested basis.
Appliances and gaming. These are areas where we believe we can bring more to customers than our competition, and we're on track to reach the goals we've set for these businesses. In the appliance category, we focused on timing promotions to match the seasonality of the appliance market consumer demand. This, combined with the continued rollout of operating model improvements, resulted in a solid financial performance in a down market this quarter.
Finally, gaming. We're making a lot of important changes to our Gaming business, and specifically, how we approach the full life cycle of the gaming customer. We've made progress, and as I said before, our new model is not yet fully rolled out. For example, we've launched a new dedicated desk in the gaming department, with an adjacent pre-order touchscreen to help customers get the games they want. 
Our results have shown that when we have the preowned trade-in desk within the gaming department, those trade-ins and preowned sales improved by a 2:1 ratio. One important advantage we have allows customers to trade in used games and receive a Best Buy Gift Card that can be used on anything online and in the store, not just in other games. Right now, we're seeing about half of the value of these gift cards being spent outside the gaming department, which tells us that our value proposition truly is adding value and differentiating. Trade-ins and preowned sales are still relatively new, but we're making good progress.
E3 was last week, and we made several important gaming-related announcements at the event. Let me highlight one that is another example of our multichannel advantage. In order to drive our Gaming business, we're giving over 2 million Reward Zone Gamer's Club members $100 in Reward Zone points to spend on anything on the store or online when they preorder and pick up 5 games. 
Wrapping things up, we've mentioned the various ways we can leverage our physical and digital assets to strengthen competitive advantage. Our multichannel strategy, which includes ""big-box"" stores, small footprint stores, our e-commerce channel, mobile Web and apps, digital content delivery, compelling Reward Zone benefits, call center staff with Blue Shirts and agents, in-home remote and in-store services allows us to uniquely serve customers within and across a variety of channels. It's much, much more than simply stores and a website. 
I'd like to once again thank our employees for the results they've delivered this quarter. We're making steady progress with the priorities we talked about during our Analyst Day. We are financially strong, and we manage a highly cash-generative business. We continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation on a core set of growth initiatives, as well as returning cash to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim."
255397,133894048,135754,"Best Buy Co. Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 14, 2011",2011-06-14,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Today, I'd like to cover some of the financial highlights of our first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the year and provide you some additional color on how we're progressing on several of the key value drivers in our business. B",1892,"Thanks, Brian. Today, I'd like to cover some of the financial highlights of our first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the year and provide you some additional color on how we're progressing on several of the key value drivers in our business. 
Before we get started, I want to call your attention to a couple of specific new additions that Bill noted up front to our quarterly reporting that we know you will find helpful.  First, to better highlight the growth trends and momentum tied to our profitable Connected World initiatives, we're adding both domestic mobile phone comp sales and total connections growth information to our regular quarterly reporting rhythm. Second, we have accelerated the disclosure of our condensed cash flow statement information to the quarterly press release. 
With those public service announcements out of the way, let's turn to some of the key highlights and insights from Q1. Total first quarter revenue grew by a little over 1%, driven primarily by net new store growth and the favorable impact of foreign currency. These gains were partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.7%. In the Domestic segment, sales declined 1% and comparable store sales were down 2.4%. 
As we discussed at the beginning of the year, we planned for the domestic comps to be down in Q1. The performance in Q1 was actually better than we had expected, and also represented a significant sequential improvement over the fourth quarter comp sales trends that were down 5.5%. The improvement in this trend was driven primarily by mobile computing and gaming. 
Mobile computing comp was up mid-single digits, driven by strong tablet sales growth as we continue to make a big push in tablets with the rollout of Tablet Central and also by improved trends in notebooks. Gaming trends also improved significantly from Q4, with comps only down slightly. As Brian already highlighted, we continue to see strong growth in domestic mobile phones, where comps were up 28%, as we experienced the benefits from both our differentiated model and Best Buy Mobile and strong customer interest in smartphones.
Next, high consumer interest in eReaders, coupled with our broad assortment in this space drove triple digit comp growth. I mentioned this because while this category is still relatively small in overall dollar terms, its growth was strong enough this quarter to meaningfully benefit our overall domestic comp. It also serves as a reminder of the excitement customers are demonstrating in mobile technologies and showcases our ability to bring this experience together for them, both online and in-store to drive growth.
Our clients comps were up almost 3%, due to successful promotional activities and actions taken during focused customer drive times in Q1. This result is encouraging given the difficult housing environment in the industry and based on the fact that we were lapping last year's significant low double-digit comp gains, driven by rebate incentives.
TV comps were down high-single digits, which was similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. Given the current macro environment, we continue to plan for a modest near-term outlook in this category, and note that our Q1 performance in TVs was consistent with our plans.
During the quarter, it also became evident that digital camera sales in the industry would be negatively impacted by components of  shortages, driven by the events in Japan. Looking forward, we currently expect product availability will improve, as we progress further in the year.
Sales in our International segment increased approximately 8%, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency, net new store growth and a 0.4% comparable store sales gain. This gain was primarily the result of high single-digit comparable store sales gains in our  Five Star business, which was on top of an almost 35% comp last year. Canada and Best Buy Europe experienced low single-digit comp declines.
Turning to gross profit. First quarter gross profit dollars of $2.8 billion were down approximately 1%. As I have discussed previously, driving gross profit dollar growth is a key priority for this organization, which we continue to plan on delivering for the year. 
Looking closer at the Domestic segment gross profit rates, you will recall that the comparisons to last year will be difficult in fiscal 2012, given our very strong domestic rate performance of up 90 basis points last year, including up 60 basis points in the first quarter of last year. This is not new information. It just provides you important context for our comparisons throughout the year. The Q1 domestic gross profit rate declined 60 basis points year-over-year and was driven primarily by rate declines, partially offset by a favorable mix impact from the continued growth in Best Buy Mobile. 
Four key items contributed to the lower rates in the quarter. First, we took offensive actions and targeted  promotional activity designed to drive revenue improvements in key categories like computing, appliances and gaming. Second, product availability issues in higher-margin digital cameras impacted our sales and margins as the industry was adversely affected by the events in Japan that I spoke about earlier.  Third, we experienced higher transportation costs driven in part by higher fuel costs. And finally, the Q1 margins were also impacted as we anniversary-ed the large annual vendor rebate that we received in the first fiscal quarter of 2011 that we discussed with you last year.  So when you put all these pieces together and you normalize for the items that were more onetime in nature, we estimate that the domestic gross margin rate would have been down closer to 30 to 35 basis point for the quarter. 
Within the International segment, we had strong 6% increase in gross profit dollars driven by growth in sales, gross profit rate growth within Five Star and improved margin performance in Canada. Overall, the International gross margin rate of 25.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year, was driven largely by the mix impact of higher B2B sales in Europe, which provide incremental gross margin dollars but at a lower rate.
Turning to SG&A. First quarter expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at $2.5 billion, and we leveraged 30 basis points on a rate basis. Consistent with our previous plans, we expect that Q1 will represent the lowest level of SG&A dollar spending growth for the year. As you will recall, we had our highest spending growth levels in Q1 last year. This combined with the timing of our investments to support growth in areas like Best Buy Mobile standalone stores, Tablet Central and the rollout of used gaming this year and the addition of the 53rd week, together, are expected to result in higher year-over-year spending growth in Qs 2 through Q4 over the flat growth we experienced in the first quarter. 
To be clear, our expectation for annual SG&A dollar growth of approximately 4%, excluding the impact of FX, remains unchanged. As you would expect, given the impact of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter, we anticipate that SG&A dollar growth in the second half will be higher than the annual 4% rate and the first half will finish at lower than this rate.
Overall, we are pleased that the operational and promotional actions we took in the quarter drove improved sales trends. While these investments resulted in a slight decline in gross profit dollars, we continue to demonstrate solid expense management and delivered operating income and EPS within our expectations for the first quarter.
Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong and continue to highlight one of the key strengths of our model. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $1.3 billion, up significantly from last year. As I discussed at length during last quarter's called, the biggest driver of the Q1 operating cash flow increase was the reversal of year-end timing differences in several key working capital items. We successfully lowered Q1 inventory levels and domestic comp store inventories finished down 4%. Receivable positions and payables also made good progress to returning to more normalized levels from where we finished fiscal 2011. 
Before we leave the quarter, I also wanted to provide an update on the progress we had made on several key value drivers in the business. Brian has already commented on the performance on the online channel, so I'll start with connections. We believe that connections are an important proxy for you to assess our progress in our Connected World strategy that we've discussed. Connections are clearly a very profitable part of that HACCS model that we are intent on growing. Our target for this year is to grow our total domestic connections from 8 million units last year to 10 million units. We have made good progress towards that goal, with domestic connections growth of up 20% for the first quarter. 
To add a little color to that number. Within mobile phones, we had higher growth of mobile phone postpaid connections, which drove strong mobile comp sales and importantly, mobile gross margin dollars. Connections within both mobile computing and TVs also increased significantly during the quarter.
During our recent Analyst Day, we also talked about structural opportunities that would help us further improve our strong model. One of the key goals we have in this space is to reduce our ""big box"" square footage in the U.S. by 10% over the next 3 to 5 years. We've made good initial progress in our plans to achieve this goal and have started space reduction discussions with several landlords. We will keep you updated on this initiative as it progresses.
That brings me to our outlook for the year. As we mentioned up front, we delivered our plan for the first quarter. With a vast majority of this year's sales and earnings still in front of us, we still anticipate delivering on our financial goals for the year. Based on what we can see so far, we expect full year revenue towards the higher end of the guided range of $51 billion to $52.5 billion. 
We also continue to expect annual operating income dollars of flat to growth of 7%. Additionally, we still anticipate delivering on our expectations for operating income dollars in the first half of FY '12 consistent with our original plans. Bringing it altogether, we are maintaining our annual non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.30 to $3.55, excluding restructuring-related charges and the impact of FY '12 share repurchases.
So to summarize, the year is off to a good start. We took actions to improve the sales trajectory of our business and delivered earnings in line with our plans. We're excited about the growth opportunities we continue to see in expanding technology and service offerings for customers and know that the combination of our physical and digital assets puts us in a unique position to compete and win. 
At the same time, we also know that the customer is stretched thin in the current environment. So we would be fluid and purposeful with our plans and follow them where they need us to go, and we will be competitive in the marketplace.  And finally, we are leveraging our strong financial condition and taking actions to improve our returns by improving growth, capitalizing on structural opportunities and generating cash to both invest in the business and to return to shareholders. 
So with that, Alicia, we are ready for the callers' questions."

We made specific emphasis in the quarter to focus on areas that we thought we could benefit from customer traffic early, especially in the Gaming, Appliance and Computing businesses. And we're very pleased, as Brian mentioned, that we saw progress in that space. So we anticipate that the year is going to continue to be competitive as it always is every year, and we're just excited that we have the opportunity to use some of the multichannel assets we have to continue to drive the top line growth in our business throughout the year.

The only thing you didn't cover in your summary there was we also said the operating income performance from a dollar standpoint was still in line with original expectations. Sitting here at Q1, we're so much of the business in front of us, and given the fact that we're focused, first and foremost, on driving gross margin dollars, we're going to have to see where the customer is at this year around what they want to buy in the business. So the good news is we've seen elasticity in categories like notebooks, in tablets. Early days yet that suggests that there might be a little bit more room in those spaces. You know how those play out in the gross margin rates overall, but the exciting part for us is that we get that traffic in the store. We get a chance to drive the HACCS model that we've shared with you. So I guess, it's early in the day to kind of predict where exactly gross margin rates are going to land. But we still feel very confident on delivering the gross margin dollars and our overall guidance. And we'll just see how that plays out with the customer mix in the balance of the year."

We have landlords that are very excited about that opportunity, and we have sub-tenants who are very interested to step in to those spaces and leverage off the traffic that we have coming to the Best Buy model overall.

A few comments. One, first in terms of the question around labor, we have already done work and will continue to do it around pulling out nonproductive, non customer-facing, tasking and operating tasks labor, and the team did a very good job of that at the very beginning of this year that we then turned around and reinvested into gaming categories specifically. So we funded the gaming value proposition and dedicated labor by taking on productive labor out of other places in the store. That's always the first choice, and we'll keep doing that. Secondarily, to your question about training, yes, we absolutely have to be better in what we're delivering to the customer and the level of knowledge, selling interaction and skills that we deliver in our stores. We've got a, I think, good legacy of being very good at that. And given who our competitors are today and given what the demands are of the customers, we have to be better. And to that, we put a significant investment in training across all of our stores, specifically focused on both the product knowledge side of it, as well as the selling skills side of it. And we're in process of doing that right now. And then thirdly, in terms of op model changes, we've talked before about some of the things we're testing in the Connected Stores, of which we now have about 30 plus stores operating with that operating model. And yes, we found that in particular in the spaces where there's more complexity for the consumers. Mobile is a good example that you already know about. Computing is another example of that, where we get the right level of dedicated labor to that, and we've got them in both a different compensation model that includes compensation around their overall productivity, as well as how their customers rate them, as well as their demonstrated level of knowledge. We like the early results we're seeing there. In fact, in our test stores, we now have the 2 tiers of different selling skills and selling rules in the store. And it's still early but we like what were seeing so far. So yes would be the answer to #3. And as always, we just got to make sure that
we get the return that we need on the changes. But there's no doubt there's opportunity there."

I mean,  clearly, we're focused on delivering our gross margin dollar goals for the year. As you know from our history, a lot of the margin rate that we see, especially within our Domestic business, is driven by the types of products that people want to buy. So last year, it was softer in the computing space overall as tablets took off. We saw mix favorability last year. Two years ago we saw strong notebook sales with the release of things like Windows 7. We saw very high notebook sales, which impacted our mix negatively. So as we look and pull apart where does the customer want to go, how do we balance our promotion to drive both top line, to get those customers in stores so that we can sell them that suite of services that our HACCS model that really differentiates us not only for customers but also for shareholders. We're going to be there on price with them in the categories they want us to be in. So sitting here, as you look at the results in Q1, we certainly don't expect that our margin rates are going to continue in the same space that we've seen in Q1.

And our plan is to grow operating income in the range we provided of 0% to 7%, and we'll see where the customer needs us to be."

Before I pass the call over to Brian, I'd like to take care of a few housekeeping items. First, we would like to request that callers limit themselves to a single question so that we can include more people in our Q&A session. Also, as usual, the media are participating in this call in a listen-only mode. 
I'd like to highlight several enhancements we've made to our earnings material this quarter. First, we have included slides this quarter that complement the results. You'll find these slides on our IR site. We've also included a quarterly cash flow statement, and we've included -- started reporting total domestic connections quarterly. And we started reporting Best Buy Mobile comps. You will also see that we renamed the category home office to computing and mobile phones to better reflect what's in the category. Nothing in the category itself has changed. 
Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. You will also note that our reported results this morning included information regarding the impact of the restructuring activities we announced on February 22. I ask that you please refer to our earnings release to understand how our announced restructuring affected our first quarter results within our Domestic and International segments and across the company as a whole. The adjusted numbers we will be discussing today, do not include these charges and should not be confused with GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release and the GAAP numbers we'll report in our 10-Q.
With those housekeeping items aside, I would like to turn the call over to Brian Dunn."

My comments this morning will focus on our first quarter performance and an update on our strategic priorities and opportunities. 
It's early but  I feel good about our start to this fiscal year. We delivered improved sales trends and continued to generate significant cash flow which illustrates the financial health and strength of our company. Our multichannel strategy clearly differentiates us from competitors and gives us unique opportunities to grow. We are optimizing our skill for growth in the key areas we previously discussed, new products and services like tablets and connections, categories where we have a competitive advantage and significant upside such as appliances and gaming and formats in new locations like Five Star in China and Best Buy Mobile standalone stores throughout the U.S. 
But before I jump over to the highlights of the quarter, I would like to thank our employees worldwide, those who helped create compelling offers and value propositions, as well as the men and women who work so diligently to bring the Connected World to life for our customers. Thank you for everything you do to make Best Buy a great place to shop and work.
Now, let's take a look at some of the key items from the quarter. Our sales performance was better than planned. I'll provide more color on this in a minute. Our Domestic Online sales continue to grow at double-digit rates. As you know, we're committed to accelerating growth in our Internet business, and our progress here shows that our focus on this channel and our overall multichannel strategy is progressing. Total domestic connections grew 20% in the quarter. This growth shows the momentum of our Connected World vision, both in Best Buy Mobile and the increasingly rapid growth of connections in our TV and Computing businesses. And we continue to take actions to improve returns to shareholders. During the first quarter, we bought back $0.5 billion worth of stock, representing 4% of our outstanding shares. 
Summarizing Q1, the quarter unfolded largely as we anticipated. We had been very deliberate in creating new offers that leverage our unique capabilities and leading position in the marketplace, and consumers are responding.
Let me review some drivers of our domestic performance in Q1. In Mobile Computing, we had improved performance overall, even against strong comparisons from last year. The biggest catalyst of our positive performance was the rapid growth in tablets as we successfully kicked off the launch of the iPad 2. Notebooks also improved versus the steeper declines we experienced in the second half of last year. 
Best Buy Mobile continued its excellent performance, delivering comps of 28% with strong margins. We were a lead retailer for the launch of the Verizon iPhone, and as we positioned in our marketing, we are the home of 4G, with phones like the HT (sic) [HTC] Inspire and the Samsung Epic leading the way. 
Allow me to share a brief example of the kinds of unique compelling offers that our customers have responded to. In the last week of the quarter, we ran a promotion of a free smartphone combined with Lady Gaga's latest CD. The promotion was such a success that it was one of mobile's best weeks of the year, and we believe we captured #1 market share in sales of the physical CD as well. The results were great, but the real story here is the value of our cross category promotions that drived incremental revenue and traffic. 
Gaming sales trends also improved, as we partnered with Nintendo on a very successful multichannel launch of the new 3DS portable gaming system during the quarter. Our sales performance is a positive sign because we're just ramping up many of the changes were making to our gaming business. I'll talk more about that in a bit.
We also activated targeted promotional programs across additional product categories online and in-store during the quarter. These were promotions with specific customer-focused value propositions, designed to drive incremental sales. While this promotional activity factored into the quarter's gross margin rate decline, which Jim will cover in more detail later, we are pleased with the incremental sales volumes we've produced. 
Our ability to create compelling offers that cause customers to respond shows that our operating model has elasticity and that we are truly selling products and services at values consumers can't pass up.  Looking at the financial performance in total, our goal is to deliver bottom line results, and operating income and EPS were consistent with our expectations for the quarter. 
Looking next at our International business. Revenue and operating profit grew significantly. These improved results are emerging even before we fully realized the benefits from our increased focus on the International business, including the recent restructuring and strategic investments in assets like Five Star, which was up to 170 stores at the close of the quarter. 
Five Star is off to a good start to the year. Comp sales were up 9% on top of over 30% comps last year. In addition, Five Star's growth [Audio Gap] to enhance our competitiveness in returns, as we leverage the advantages inherent in our portfolio of physical and digital assets, multiple ways to shop, buy and interact with us online, a variety of the store formats and sizes, call centers staff with knowledgable Blue Shirts and agents, as well as a wide range of in-store remote and in-home services. 
I'd like to provide some color and updates around these priorities.  Let's start with Online. We are determined to double our U.S. Online business in the next 3 to 5 years, and as I mentioned, our Online revenue grew double digits in Q1. Our business in this channel strengthened throughout the quarter, as we started to the ramp up many new activities to drive traffic, including the significant expansion of our online assortment. This is a key component to improving our competitive position online, and we've made good progress to date, adding over 10,000 SKUs online since Q1 of last year. 
Another important part of our multichannel strategy is leveraging our complimentary physical channels with the Internet to provide even greater points of presence. A couple of good examples: Best Buy Mobile standalone stores now sell tablets as well and also take in preowned video game titles. This is important because our mobile stores have a differentiated traffic and attracts a unique customer base. 25% of shoppers in our Mobile stores are first-time Best Buy customers, and these locations also have a higher proportion of female shoppers than our ""big-box"" stores. 
Next, let's take a look at a few strategic areas where we intend to leverage our scale to grow: tablets, mobile phone, appliances and gaming. First, tablets. As we've said, we're making a big push in tablets this year and expect to have the strongest assortment in the marketplace. We started rolling out Tablet Central in May. In the beginning of July, we expect it will be in all of our ""big-box"" stores. Tablet Central will be a zone within our Computing department with a value proposition modeled up for Best Buy Mobile. It will be a one-stop shop showcasing the features, connections and accessory opportunities for tablets. We believe that this will play directly to our strengths of demonstrating new technology and helping customers navigate their way to the important choices. 
The tablets base is heating up now, and our vendor partners are aggressively advertising to build awareness. So we expect to see the number of tablets ramp up quickly in this quarter. We're excited about the variety of models we’ll offer, complete with a wide range of features and price points that will drive consumer interest, as well as our business.
Next, mobile phones. As I mentioned, mobile comps were up 28% for the quarter, and our data shows that we significantly increased our smartphone share in the quarter. We also opened about 20 standalone stores in Q1, taking the total to almost 200. You may recall that we began increasing the mobile footprint in our ""big-box"" stores last year. And now we have the expanded space allocation in 600 stores. We believe we have a very differentiated model in this category, and mobile upgrade checks are a great example of that. 
We did almost 4 million upgrade checks for customers last quarter, compared to 9 million for all of last year. Over 1/3 of these customers optioned the program and want us to contact them when they're due for an upgrade. This provides us a great opportunity to engage new customers on a requested basis.
Appliances and gaming. These are areas where we believe we can bring more to customers than our competition, and we're on track to reach the goals we've set for these businesses. In the appliance category, we focused on timing promotions to match the seasonality of the appliance market consumer demand. This, combined with the continued rollout of operating model improvements, resulted in a solid financial performance in a down market this quarter.
Finally, gaming. We're making a lot of important changes to our Gaming business, and specifically, how we approach the full life cycle of the gaming customer. We've made progress, and as I said before, our new model is not yet fully rolled out. For example, we've launched a new dedicated desk in the gaming department, with an adjacent pre-order touchscreen to help customers get the games they want. 
Our results have shown that when we have the preowned trade-in desk within the gaming department, those trade-ins and preowned sales improved by a 2:1 ratio. One important advantage we have allows customers to trade in used games and receive a Best Buy Gift Card that can be used on anything online and in the store, not just in other games. Right now, we're seeing about half of the value of these gift cards being spent outside the gaming department, which tells us that our value proposition truly is adding value and differentiating. Trade-ins and preowned sales are still relatively new, but we're making good progress.
E3 was last week, and we made several important gaming-related announcements at the event. Let me highlight one that is another example of our multichannel advantage. In order to drive our Gaming business, we're giving over 2 million Reward Zone Gamer's Club members $100 in Reward Zone points to spend on anything on the store or online when they preorder and pick up 5 games. 
Wrapping things up, we've mentioned the various ways we can leverage our physical and digital assets to strengthen competitive advantage. Our multichannel strategy, which includes ""big-box"" stores, small footprint stores, our e-commerce channel, mobile Web and apps, digital content delivery, compelling Reward Zone benefits, call center staff with Blue Shirts and agents, in-home remote and in-store services allows us to uniquely serve customers within and across a variety of channels. It's much, much more than simply stores and a website. 
I'd like to once again thank our employees for the results they've delivered this quarter. We're making steady progress with the priorities we talked about during our Analyst Day. We are financially strong, and we manage a highly cash-generative business. We continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation on a core set of growth initiatives, as well as returning cash to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim."

Today, I'd like to cover some of the financial highlights of our first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the year and provide you some additional color on how we're progressing on several of the key value drivers in our business. B",1892,"Thanks, Brian. Today, I'd like to cover some of the financial highlights of our first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the year and provide you some additional color on how we're progressing on several of the key value drivers in our business. 
Before we get started, I want to call your attention to a couple of specific new additions that Bill noted up front to our quarterly reporting that we know you will find helpful.  First, to better highlight the growth trends and momentum tied to our profitable Connected World initiatives, we're adding both domestic mobile phone comp sales and total connections growth information to our regular quarterly reporting rhythm. Second, we have accelerated the disclosure of our condensed cash flow statement information to the quarterly press release. 
With those public service announcements out of the way, let's turn to some of the key highlights and insights from Q1. Total first quarter revenue grew by a little over 1%, driven primarily by net new store growth and the favorable impact of foreign currency. These gains were partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.7%. In the Domestic segment, sales declined 1% and comparable store sales were down 2.4%. 
As we discussed at the beginning of the year, we planned for the domestic comps to be down in Q1. The performance in Q1 was actually better than we had expected, and also represented a significant sequential improvement over the fourth quarter comp sales trends that were down 5.5%. The improvement in this trend was driven primarily by mobile computing and gaming. 
Mobile computing comp was up mid-single digits, driven by strong tablet sales growth as we continue to make a big push in tablets with the rollout of Tablet Central and also by improved trends in notebooks. Gaming trends also improved significantly from Q4, with comps only down slightly. As Brian already highlighted, we continue to see strong growth in domestic mobile phones, where comps were up 28%, as we experienced the benefits from both our differentiated model and Best Buy Mobile and strong customer interest in smartphones.
Next, high consumer interest in eReaders, coupled with our broad assortment in this space drove triple digit comp growth. I mentioned this because while this category is still relatively small in overall dollar terms, its growth was strong enough this quarter to meaningfully benefit our overall domestic comp. It also serves as a reminder of the excitement customers are demonstrating in mobile technologies and showcases our ability to bring this experience together for them, both online and in-store to drive growth.
Our clients comps were up almost 3%, due to successful promotional activities and actions taken during focused customer drive times in Q1. This result is encouraging given the difficult housing environment in the industry and based on the fact that we were lapping last year's significant low double-digit comp gains, driven by rebate incentives.
TV comps were down high-single digits, which was similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. Given the current macro environment, we continue to plan for a modest near-term outlook in this category, and note that our Q1 performance in TVs was consistent with our plans.
During the quarter, it also became evident that digital camera sales in the industry would be negatively impacted by components of shortages, driven by the events in Japan. Looking forward, we currently expect product availability will improve, as we progress further in the year.
Sales in our International segment increased approximately 8%, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency, net new store growth and a 0.4% comparable store sales gain. This gain was primarily the result of high single-digit comparable store sales gains in our Five Star business, which was on top of an almost 35% comp last year. Canada and Best Buy Europe experienced low single-digit comp declines.
Turning to gross profit. First quarter gross profit dollars of $2.8 billion were down approximately 1%. As I have discussed previously, driving gross profit dollar growth is a key priority for this organization, which we continue to plan on delivering for the year. 
Looking closer at the Domestic segment gross profit rates, you will recall that the comparisons to last year will be difficult in fiscal 2012, given our very strong domestic rate performance of up 90 basis points last year, including up 60 basis points in the first quarter of last year. This is not new information. It just provides you important context for our comparisons throughout the year. The Q1 domestic gross profit rate declined 60 basis points year-over-year and was driven primarily by rate declines, partially offset by a favorable mix impact from the continued growth in Best Buy Mobile. 
Four key items contributed to the lower rates in the quarter. First, we took offensive actions and targeted promotional activity designed to drive revenue improvements in key categories like computing, appliances and gaming. Second, product availability issues in higher-margin digital cameras impacted our sales and margins as the industry was adversely affected by the events in Japan that I spoke about earlier.  Third, we experienced higher transportation costs driven in part by higher fuel costs. And finally, the Q1 margins were also impacted as we anniversary-ed the large annual vendor rebate that we received in the first fiscal quarter of 2011 that we discussed with you last year.  So when you put all these pieces together and you normalize for the items that were more onetime in nature, we estimate that the domestic gross margin rate would have been down closer to 30 to 35 basis point for the quarter. 
Within the International segment, we had strong 6% increase in gross profit dollars driven by growth in sales, gross profit rate growth within Five Star and improved margin performance in Canada. Overall, the International gross margin rate of 25.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year, was driven largely by the mix impact of higher B2B sales in Europe, which provide incremental gross margin dollars but at a lower rate.
Turning to SG&A. First quarter expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at $2.5 billion, and we leveraged 30 basis points on a rate basis. Consistent with our previous plans, we expect that Q1 will represent the lowest level of SG&A dollar spending growth for the year. As you will recall, we had our highest spending growth levels in Q1 last year. This combined with the timing of our investments to support growth in areas like Best Buy Mobile standalone stores, Tablet Central and the rollout of used gaming this year and the addition of the 53rd week, together, are expected to result in higher year-over-year spending growth in Qs 2 through Q4 over the flat growth we experienced in the first quarter. 
To be clear, our expectation for annual SG&A dollar growth of approximately 4%, excluding the impact of FX, remains unchanged. As you would expect, given the impact of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter, we anticipate that SG&A dollar growth in the second half will be higher than the annual 4% rate and the first half will finish at lower than this rate.
Overall, we are pleased that the operational and promotional actions we took in the quarter drove improved sales trends. While these investments resulted in a slight decline in gross profit dollars, we continue to demonstrate solid expense management and delivered operating income and EPS within our expectations for the first quarter.
Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong and continues to highlight one of the key strengths of our model. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $1.3 billion, up significantly from last year. As I discussed at length during last quarter's called, the biggest driver of the Q1 operating cash flow increase was the reversal of year-end timing differences in several key working capital items. We successfully lowered Q1 inventory levels and domestic comp store inventories finished down 4%. Receivable positions and payables also made good progress to returning to more normalized levels from where we finished fiscal 2011. 
Before we leave the quarter, I also wanted to provide an update on the progress we had made on several key value drivers in the business. Brian has already commented on the performance on the online channel, so I'll start with connections. We believe that connections are an important proxy for you to assess our progress in our Connected World strategy that we've discussed. Connections are clearly a very profitable part of that HACCS model that we are intent on growing. Our target for this year is to grow our total domestic connections from 8 million units last year to 10 million units. We have made good progress towards that goal, with domestic connections growth of up 20% for the first quarter. 
To add a little color to that number. Within mobile phones, we had higher growth of mobile phone postpaid connections, which drove strong mobile comp sales and importantly, mobile gross margin dollars. Connections within both mobile computing and TVs also increased significantly during the quarter.
During our recent Analyst Day, we also talked about structural opportunities that would help us further improve our strong model. One of the key goals we have in this space is to reduce our ""big box"" square footage in the U.S. by 10% over the next 3 to 5 years. We've made good initial progress in our plans to achieve this goal and have started space reduction discussions with several landlords. We will keep you updated on this initiative as it progresses.
That brings me to our outlook for the year. As we mentioned up front, we delivered our plan for the first quarter. With a vast majority of this year's sales and earnings still in front of us, we still anticipate delivering on our financial goals for the year. Based on what we can see so far, we expect full year revenue towards the higher end of the guided range of $51 billion to $52.5 billion. 
We also continue to expect annual operating income dollars of flat to growth of 7%. Additionally, we still anticipate delivering on our expectations for operating income dollars in the first half of FY '12 consistent with our original plans. Bringing it altogether, we are maintaining our annual non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.30 to $3.55, excluding restructuring-related charges and the impact of FY '12 share repurchases.
So to summarize, the year is off to a good start. We took actions to improve the sales trajectory of our business and delivered earnings in line with our plans. We're excited about the growth opportunities we continue to see in expanding technology and service offerings for customers and know that the combination of our physical and digital assets puts us in a unique position to compete and win. 
At the same time, we also know that the customer is stretched thin in the current environment. So we would be fluid and purposeful with our plans and follow them where they need us to go, and we will be competitive in the marketplace.  And finally, we are leveraging our strong financial condition and taking actions to improve our returns by improving growth, capitalizing on structural opportunities and generating cash to both invest in the business and to return to shareholders. 
So with that, Alicia, we are ready for the callers' questions."

A few comments. One, first in terms of the question around labor, we have already done work and will continue to do it around pulling out nonproductive, non customer-facing, tasking and operating tasks labor, and the team did a very good job of that at the very beginning of this year that we then turned around and reinvested into gaming categories specific labor. So we funded the gaming value proposition and dedicated labor by taking unproductive labor out of other places in the store. That's always the first choice, and we'll keep doing that. Secondarily, to your question about training, yes, we absolutely have to be better in what we're delivering to the customer and the level of knowledge, selling interaction and skills that we deliver in our stores. We've got a, I think, good legacy of being very good at that. And given who our competitors are today and given what the demands are of the customers, we have to be better. And to that, we put a significant investment in training across all of our stores, specifically focused on both the product knowledge side of it, as well as the selling skills side of it. And we're in process of doing that right now. And then thirdly, in terms of op model changes, we've talked before about some of the things we're testing in the Connected Stores, of which we now have about 30 plus stores operating with that operating model. And yes, we found that in particular in the spaces where there's more complexity for the consumers. Mobile is a good example that you already know about. Computing is another example of that, where we get the right level of dedicated labor to that, and we've got them in both a different compensation model that includes compensation around their overall productivity, as well as how their customers rate them, as well as their demonstrated level of knowledge. We like the early results we're seeing there. In fact, in our test stores, we now have the 2 tiers of different selling skills and selling roles in the store. And it's still early but we like what we’re seeing so far. So yes would be the answer to #3. And as always, we just got to make sure that we get the return that we need on the changes. But there's no doubt there's opportunity there."

I mean, clearly, we're focused on delivering our gross margin dollar goals for the year. As you know from our history, a lot of the margin rate that we see, especially within our Domestic business, is driven by the types of products that people want to buy. So last year, it was softer in the computing space overall as tablets took off. We saw mix favorability last year. Two years ago we saw strong notebook sales with the release of things like Windows 7. We saw very high notebook sales, which impacted our mix negatively. So as we look and pull apart where does the customer want to go, how do we balance our promotion to drive both top line, to get those customers in stores so that we can sell them that suite of services in our HACCS model that really differentiates us not only for customers but also for shareholders. We're going to be there on price with them in the categories they want us to be in. So sitting here, as you look at the results in Q1, we certainly don't expect that our margin rates are going to continue in the same space that we've seen in Q1. But it's just too early in the year to know exactly where it's going to be. We're focused on delivering margin dollars, and we're going to grow them through the year.

Also, as usual, the media are participating in this call in a listen-only mode. 
I'd like to highlight several enhancements we've made to our earnings material this quarter. First, we have included slides this quarter that complement the results. You'll find these slides on our IR site. We've also included a quarterly cash flow statement, and we've included -- started reporting total domestic connections quarterly. And we started reporting Best Buy Mobile comps. You will also see that we renamed the category home office to computing and mobile phones to better reflect what's in the category. Nothing in the category itself has changed. 
Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. You will also note that our reported results this morning included information regarding the impact of the restructuring activities we announced on February 22. I ask that you please refer to our earnings release to understand how our announced restructuring affected our first quarter results within our Domestic and International segments and across the company as a whole. The adjusted numbers we will be discussing today, do not include these charges and should not be confused with GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release and the GAAP numbers we'll report in our 10-Q.

My comments this morning will focus on our first quarter performance and an update on our strategic priorities and opportunities. 
It's early but  I feel good about our start to this fiscal year. We delivered improved sales trends and continued to generate significant cash flow which illustrates the financial health and strength of our company. Our multichannel strategy clearly differentiates us from competitors and gives us unique opportunities to grow. We are optimizing our skill for growth in the key areas we previously discussed, new products and services like tablets and connections, categories where we have a competitive advantage and significant upside such as appliances and gaming and formats in new locations like Five Star in China and Best Buy Mobile standalone stores throughout the U.S. 
But before I jump over to the highlights of the quarter, I would like to thank our employees worldwide, those who helped create compelling offers and value propositions, as well as the men and women who work so diligently to bring the Connected World to life for our customers. Thank you for everything you do to make Best Buy a great place to shop and work.
Now, let's take a look at some of the key items from the quarter. Our sales performance was better than planned. I'll provide more color on this in a minute. Our Domestic Online sales continue to grow at double-digit rates. As you know, we're committed to accelerating growth in our Internet business, and our progress here shows that our focus on this channel and our overall multichannel strategy is progressing. Total domestic connections grew 20% in the quarter. This growth shows the momentum of our Connected World vision, both in Best Buy Mobile and the increasingly rapid growth of connections in our TV and Computing businesses. And we continue to take actions to improve returns to shareholders. During the first quarter, we bought back $0.5 billion worth of stock, representing 4% of our outstanding shares. 
Summarizing Q1, the quarter unfolded largely as we anticipated. We had been very deliberate in creating new offers that leverage our unique capabilities and leading position in the marketplace, and consumers are responding.
Let me review some drivers of our domestic performance in Q1. In Mobile Computing, we had improved performance overall, even against strong comparisons from last year. The biggest catalyst of our positive performance was the rapid growth in tablets as we successfully kicked off the launch of the iPad 2. Notebooks also improved versus the steeper declines we experienced in the second half of last year. 
Best Buy Mobile continued its excellent performance, delivering comps of 28% with strong margins. We were a lead retailer for the launch of the Verizon iPhone, and as we positioned in our marketing, we are the home of 4G, with phones like the HT (sic) [HTC] Inspire and the Samsung Epic leading the way. 
Allow me to share a brief example of the kinds of unique compelling offers that our customers have responded to. In the last week of the quarter, we ran a promotion of a free smartphone combined with Lady Gaga's latest CD. The promotion was such a success that it was one of mobile's best weeks of the year, and we believe we captured #1 market share in sales of the physical CD as well. The results were great, but the real story here is the value of our cross category promotions that drive incremental revenue and traffic. 
Gaming sales trends also improved, as we partnered with Nintendo on a very successful multichannel launch of the new 3DS portable gaming system during the quarter. Our sales performance is a positive sign because we're just ramping up many of the changes were making to our gaming business. I'll talk more about that in a bit.
We also activated targeted promotional programs across additional product categories online and in-store during the quarter. These were promotions with specific customer-focused value propositions, designed to drive incremental sales. While this promotional activity factored into the quarter's gross margin rate decline, which Jim will cover in more detail later, we are pleased with the incremental sales volumes we've produced. 
Our ability to create compelling offers that cause customers to respond shows that our operating model has elasticity and that we are truly selling products and services at values consumers can't pass up.  Looking at the financial performance in total, our goal is to deliver bottom line results, and operating income and EPS were consistent with our expectations for the quarter. 
Looking next at our International business. Revenue and operating profit grew significantly. These improved results are emerging even before we fully realized the benefits from our increased focus on the International business, including the recent restructuring and strategic investments in assets like Five Star, which was up to 170 stores at the close of the quarter. 
Five Star is off to a good start to the year. Comp sales were up 9% on top of over 30% comps last year. In addition, Five Star's growth [Audio Gap] to enhance our competitiveness in returns, as we leverage the advantages inherent in our portfolio of physical and digital assets, multiple ways to shop, buy and interact with us online, a variety of the store formats and sizes, call centers staff with knowledgeable Blue Shirts and agents, as well as a wide range of in-store remote and in-home services. 
I'd like to provide some color and updates around these priorities.  Let's start with Online. We are determined to double our U.S. Online business in the next 3 to 5 years, and as I mentioned, our Online revenue grew double digits in Q1. Our business in this channel strengthened throughout the quarter, as we started to the ramp up many new activities to drive traffic, including the significant expansion of our online assortment. This is a key component to improving our competitive position online, and we've made good progress to date, adding over 10,000 SKUs online since Q1 of last year. 
Another important part of our multichannel strategy is leveraging our complimentary physical channels with the Internet to provide even greater points of presence. A couple of good examples: Best Buy Mobile standalone stores now sell tablets as well and also take in preowned video game titles. This is important because our mobile stores have a differentiated traffic and attracts a unique customer base. 25% of shoppers in our Mobile stores are first-time Best Buy customers, and these locations also have a higher proportion of female shoppers than our ""big-box"" stores. 
Next, let's take a look at a few strategic areas where we intend to leverage our scale to grow: tablets, mobile phone, appliances and gaming. First, tablets. As we've said, we're making a big push in tablets this year and expect to have the strongest assortment in the marketplace. We started rolling out Tablet Central in May. In the beginning of July, we expect it will be in all of our ""big-box"" stores. Tablet Central will be a zone within our Computing department with a value proposition modeled up for Best Buy Mobile. It will be a one-stop shop showcasing the features, connections and accessory opportunities for tablets. We believe that this will play directly to our strengths of demonstrating new technology and helping customers navigate their way to the important choices. 
The tablets base is heating up now, and our vendor partners are aggressively advertising to build awareness. So we expect to see the number of tablets ramp up quickly in this quarter. We're excited about the variety of models we’ll offer, complete with a wide range of features and price points that will drive consumer interest, as well as our business.
Next, mobile phones. As I mentioned, mobile comps were up 28% for the quarter, and our data shows that we significantly increased our smartphone share in the quarter. We also opened about 20 standalone stores in Q1, taking the total to almost 200. You may recall that we began increasing the mobile footprint in our ""big-box"" stores last year. And now we have the expanded space allocation in 600 stores. We believe we have a very differentiated model in this category, and mobile upgrade checks are a great example of that. 
We did almost 4 million upgrade checks for customers last quarter, compared to 9 million for all of last year. Over 1/3 of these customers optioned the program and want us to contact them when they're due for an upgrade. This provides us a great opportunity to engage new customers on a requested basis.
Appliances and gaming. These are areas where we believe we can bring more to customers than our competition, and we're on track to reach the goals we've set for these businesses. In the appliance category, we focused on timing promotions to match the seasonality of the appliance market consumer demand. This, combined with the continued rollout of operating model improvements, resulted in a solid financial performance in a down market this quarter.
Finally, gaming. We're making a lot of important changes to our Gaming business, and specifically, how we approach the full life cycle of the gaming customer. We've made progress, and as I said before, our new model is not yet fully rolled out. For example, we've launched a new dedicated desk in the gaming department, with an adjacent pre-order touchscreen to help customers get the games they want. 
Our results have shown that when we have the preowned trade-in desk within the gaming department, those trade-ins and preowned sales improved by a 2:1 ratio. One important advantage we have allows customers to trade in used games and receive a Best Buy Gift Card that can be used on anything online and in the store, not just in other games. Right now, we're seeing about half of the value of these gift cards being spent outside the gaming department, which tells us that our value proposition truly is adding value and differentiating. Trade-ins and preowned sales are still relatively new, but we're making good progress.
E3 was last week, and we made several important gaming-related announcements at the event. Let me highlight one that is another example of our multichannel advantage. In order to drive our Gaming business, we're giving over 2 million Reward Zone Gamer's Club members $100 in Reward Zone points to spend on anything on the store or online when they preorder and pick up 5 games. 
Wrapping things up, we've mentioned the various ways we can leverage our physical and digital assets to strengthen competitive advantage. Our multichannel strategy, which includes ""big-box"" stores, small footprint stores, our e-commerce channel, mobile Web and apps, digital content delivery, compelling Reward Zone benefits, call center staff with Blue Shirts and agents, in-home remote and in-store services allows us to uniquely serve customers within and across a variety of channels. It's much, much more than simply stores and a website. 
I'd like to once again thank our employees for the results they've delivered this quarter. We're making steady progress with the priorities we talked about during our Analyst Day. We are financially strong, and we manage a highly cash-generative business. We continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation on a core set of growth initiatives, as well as returning cash to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim."
255397,133894048,135879,"Best Buy Co. Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jun 14, 2011",2011-06-14,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Today, I'd like to cover some of the financial highlights of our first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the year and provide you some additional color on how we're progressing on several of the key value drivers in our business. B",1892,"Thanks, Brian. Today, I'd like to cover some of the financial highlights of our first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the year and provide you some additional color on how we're progressing on several of the key value drivers in our business. 
Before we get started, I want to call your attention to a couple of specific new additions that Bill noted up front to our quarterly reporting that we know you will find helpful.  First, to better highlight the growth trends and momentum tied to our profitable Connected World initiatives, we're adding both domestic mobile phone comp sales and total connections growth information to our regular quarterly reporting rhythm. Second, we have accelerated the disclosure of our condensed cash flow statement information to the quarterly press release. 
With those public service announcements out of the way, let's turn to some of the key highlights and insights from Q1. Total first quarter revenue grew by a little over 1%, driven primarily by net new store growth and the favorable impact of foreign currency. These gains were partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.7%. In the Domestic segment, sales declined 1% and comparable store sales were down 2.4%. 
As we discussed at the beginning of the year, we planned for the domestic comps to be down in Q1. The performance in Q1 was actually better than we had expected, and also represented a significant sequential improvement over the fourth quarter comp sales trends that were down 5.5%. The improvement in this trend was driven primarily by mobile computing and gaming. 
Mobile computing comp was up mid-single digits, driven by strong tablet sales growth as we continue to make a big push in tablets with the rollout of Tablet Central and also by improved trends in notebooks. Gaming trends also improved significantly from Q4, with comps only down slightly. As Brian already highlighted, we continue to see strong growth in domestic mobile phones, where comps were up 28%, as we experienced the benefits from both our differentiated model and Best Buy Mobile and strong customer interest in smartphones.
Next, high consumer interest in eReaders, coupled with our broad assortment in this space drove triple digit comp growth. I mentioned this because while this category is still relatively small in overall dollar terms, its growth was strong enough this quarter to meaningfully benefit our overall domestic comp. It also serves as a reminder of the excitement customers are demonstrating in mobile technologies and showcases our ability to bring this experience together for them, both online and in-store to drive growth.
Our clients comps were up almost 3%, due to successful promotional activities and actions taken during focused customer drive times in Q1. This result is encouraging given the difficult housing environment in the industry and based on the fact that we were lapping last year's significant low double-digit comp gains, driven by rebate incentives.
TV comps were down high-single digits, which was similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. Given the current macro environment, we continue to plan for a modest near-term outlook in this category, and note that our Q1 performance in TVs was consistent with our plans.
During the quarter, it also became evident that digital camera sales in the industry would be negatively impacted by components of shortages, driven by the events in Japan. Looking forward, we currently expect product availability will improve, as we progress further in the year.
Sales in our International segment increased approximately 8%, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency, net new store growth and a 0.4% comparable store sales gain. This gain was primarily the result of high single-digit comparable store sales gains in our Five Star business, which was on top of an almost 35% comp last year. Canada and Best Buy Europe experienced low single-digit comp declines.
Turning to gross profit. First quarter gross profit dollars of $2.8 billion were down approximately 1%. As I have discussed previously, driving gross profit dollar growth is a key priority for this organization, which we continue to plan on delivering for the year. 
Looking closer at the Domestic segment gross profit rates, you will recall that the comparisons to last year will be difficult in fiscal 2012, given our very strong domestic rate performance of up 90 basis points last year, including up 60 basis points in the first quarter of last year. This is not new information. It just provides you important context for our comparisons throughout the year. The Q1 domestic gross profit rate declined 60 basis points year-over-year and was driven primarily by rate declines, partially offset by a favorable mix impact from the continued growth in Best Buy Mobile. 
Four key items contributed to the lower rates in the quarter. First, we took offensive actions and targeted promotional activity designed to drive revenue improvements in key categories like computing, appliances and gaming. Second, product availability issues in higher-margin digital cameras impacted our sales and margins as the industry was adversely affected by the events in Japan that I spoke about earlier.  Third, we experienced higher transportation costs driven in part by higher fuel costs. And finally, the Q1 margins were also impacted as we anniversaried the large annual vendor rebate that we received in the first fiscal quarter of 2011 that we discussed with you last year.  So when you put all these pieces together and you normalize for the items that were more onetime in nature, we estimate that the domestic gross margin rate would have been down closer to 30 to 35 basis point for the quarter. 
Within the International segment, we had strong 6% increase in gross profit dollars driven by growth in sales, gross profit rate growth within Five Star and improved margin performance in Canada. Overall, the International gross margin rate of 25.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year, was driven largely by the mix impact of higher B2B sales in Europe, which provide incremental gross margin dollars but at a lower rate.
Turning to SG&A. First quarter expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at $2.5 billion, and we leveraged 30 basis points on a rate basis. Consistent with our previous plans, we expect that Q1 will represent the lowest level of SG&A dollar spending growth for the year. As you will recall, we had our highest spending growth levels in Q1 last year. This combined with the timing of our investments to support growth in areas like Best Buy Mobile standalone stores, Tablet Central and the rollout of used gaming this year and the addition of the 53rd week, together, are expected to result in higher year-over-year spending growth in Qs 2 through Q4 over the flat growth we experienced in the first quarter. 
To be clear, our expectation for annual SG&A dollar growth of approximately 4%, excluding the impact of FX, remains unchanged. As you would expect, given the impact of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter, we anticipate that SG&A dollar growth in the second half will be higher than the annual 4% rate and the first half will finish at lower than this rate.
Overall, we are pleased that the operational and promotional actions we took in the quarter drove improved sales trends. While these investments resulted in a slight decline in gross profit dollars, we continue to demonstrate solid expense management and delivered operating income and EPS within our expectations for the first quarter.
Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong and continues to highlight one of the key strengths of our model. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $1.3 billion, up significantly from last year. As I discussed at length during last quarter's called, the biggest driver of the Q1 operating cash flow increase was the reversal of year-end timing differences in several key working capital items. We successfully lowered Q1 inventory levels and domestic comp store inventories finished down 4%. Receivable positions and payables also made good progress to returning to more normalized levels from where we finished fiscal 2011. 
Before we leave the quarter, I also wanted to provide an update on the progress we had made on several key value drivers in the business. Brian has already commented on the performance on the online channel, so I'll start with connections. We believe that connections are an important proxy for you to assess our progress in our Connected World strategy that we've discussed. Connections are clearly a very profitable part of that HACCS model that we are intent on growing. Our target for this year is to grow our total domestic connections from 8 million units last year to 10 million units. We have made good progress towards that goal, with domestic connections growth of up 20% for the first quarter. 
To add a little color to that number. Within mobile phones, we had higher growth of mobile phone postpaid connections, which drove strong mobile comp sales and importantly, mobile gross margin dollars. Connections within both mobile computing and TVs also increased significantly during the quarter.
During our recent Analyst Day, we also talked about structural opportunities that would help us further improve our strong model. One of the key goals we have in this space is to reduce our ""big box"" square footage in the U.S. by 10% over the next 3 to 5 years. We've made good initial progress in our plans to achieve this goal and have started space reduction discussions with several landlords. We will keep you updated on this initiative as it progresses.
That brings me to our outlook for the year. As we mentioned up front, we delivered our plan for the first quarter. With a vast majority of this year's sales and earnings still in front of us, we still anticipate delivering on our financial goals for the year. Based on what we can see so far, we expect full year revenue towards the higher end of the guided range of $51 billion to $52.5 billion. 
We also continue to expect annual operating income dollars of flat to growth of 7%. Additionally, we still anticipate delivering on our expectations for operating income dollars in the first half of FY '12 consistent with our original plans. Bringing it altogether, we are maintaining our annual non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.30 to $3.55, excluding restructuring-related charges and the impact of FY '12 share repurchases.
So to summarize, the year is off to a good start. We took actions to improve the sales trajectory of our business and delivered earnings in line with our plans. We're excited about the growth opportunities we continue to see in expanding technology and service offerings for customers and know that the combination of our physical and digital assets puts us in a unique position to compete and win. 
At the same time, we also know that the customer is stretched thin in the current environment. So we would be fluid and purposeful with our plans and follow them where they need us to go, and we will be competitive in the marketplace.  And finally, we are leveraging our strong financial condition and taking actions to improve our returns by improving growth, capitalizing on structural opportunities and generating cash to both invest in the business and to return to shareholders. 
So with that, Alicia, we are ready for the callers' questions."

And we're very pleased, as Brian mentioned, that we saw progress in that space. So we anticipate that the year is going to continue to be competitive as it always is every year, and we're just excited that we have the opportunity to use some of the multichannel assets we have to continue to drive the top line growth in our business throughout the year.

We have landlords that are very excited about that opportunity, and we have sub-tenants who are very interested to step in to those spaces and leverage off the traffic that we have coming to the Best Buy model overall.

A few comments. One, first in terms of the question around labor, we have already done work and will continue to do it around pulling out nonproductive, non customer-facing, tasking and operating tasks labor, and the team did a very good job of that at the very beginning of this year that we then turned around and reinvested into gaming categories specific labor. So we funded the gaming value proposition and dedicated labor by taking unproductive labor out of other places in the store. That's always the first choice, and we'll keep doing that. Secondarily, to your question about training, yes, we absolutely have to be better in what we're delivering to the customer and the level of knowledge, selling interaction and skills that we deliver in our stores. We've got a, I think, good legacy of being very good at that. And given who our competitors are today and given what the demands are of the customers, we have to be better. And to that, we put a significant investment in training across all of our stores, specifically focused on both the product knowledge side of it, as well as the selling skills side of it. And we're in process of doing that right now. And then thirdly, in terms of op model changes, we've talked before about some of the things we're testing in the Connected Stores, of which we now have about 30 plus stores operating with that operating model. And yes, we found that in particular in the spaces where there's more complexity for the consumers. Mobile is a good example that you already know about. Computing is another example of that, where we get the right level of dedicated labor to that, and we've got them in both a different compensation model that includes compensation around their overall productivity, as well as how their customers rate them, as well as their demonstrated level of knowledge. We like the early results we're seeing there. In fact, in our test stores, we now have the 2 tiers of different selling skills and selling roles in the store. And it's still early but we like what we’re seeing so far. So yes would be the answer to number 3. And as always, we just got to make sure that we get the return that we need on the changes. But there's no doubt there's opportunity there."

And we know when we get consumers in the store to make an in-store pickup, it is a good -- not only good for the consumer, it's a good experience for our shareholders as well.

I mean, clearly, we're focused on delivering our gross margin dollar goals for the year. As you know from our history, a lot of the margin rate that we see, especially within our Domestic business, is driven by the types of products that people want to buy. So last year, it was softer in the computing space overall as tablets took off. We saw mix favorability last year. Two years ago we saw strong notebook sales with the release of things like Windows 7. We saw very high notebook sales, which impacted our mix negatively. So as we look and pull apart where does the customer want to go, how do we balance our promotion to drive both top line, to get those customers in stores so that we can sell them that suite of services in our HACCS model that really differentiates us not only for customers but also for shareholders. We're going to be there on price with them in the categories they want us to be in. So sitting here, as you look at the results in Q1, we certainly don't expect that our margin rates are going to continue in the same space that we've seen in Q1.

My comments this morning will focus on our second quarter performance, how we're progressing on our strategic priorities and how we see the rest of the year playing out. But before I jump into my comments in the quarter, I would like to thank our employees for another quarter of outstanding effort in bringing the Connected World to life for our customers across all of our channels and geographies. I'm especially proud of the way our teams in London pulled together to ensure the safety of their employees and customers during the riots in London last month and how our U.S. employees helped their communities and each other through the extreme difficulties of Hurricane Irene and the recent battering of the East Coast.
We continue to execute our strategy in times of challenge and continue to see opportunity. We're responding to the needs of our customers in each segment and channel, where we conduct business. 
Before I turn it over to Jim for more specific details, I want to put our results and outlook in the context of our overall business strategy. As you know, our strategy is to drive the three elements. One, our financial strength and flexibility, Two, a unique multichannel approach that allows us to connect wherever and whenever people shop and three, optimizing our scale to drive growth to new categories, new store formats and share gains in key categories. Let's begin our look at the financial strength that is enabling us to continue to invest and return value to our shareholders.
Looking at the big picture worldwide, we're still facing an uncertain macro environment, with volatile consumer shopping behavior and this was evident in our results for the second quarter. Despite that, we generated significantly more cash in Q2 and ended of the quarter with more than $2 billion of cash-on-hand. Our free cash flow was $1.1 billion in the first half. This has helped us to continue to fuel our share repurchase strategy and we are on target, we were on target to Buy Back approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. We remain disciplined in our use of capital while continuing to invest for growth geographically, by channel and by category.
Geographically, in China, we are continuing our rapid rollout of Five Star stores. We added seven more stores in the second quarter, taking us to a total of 178. In addition, Five Stars' continuing operation were once again a highlight of the quarter, delivering 7% comps and increased margins. 
In Canada, where we are facing a challenging economic environment, very similar to that of the U.S., the team did a great job of delivering solid gross margin rate improvement. And we continue to see a solid performance in Mexico. While the contributions of our Mexican operations are still relatively small within the context of our enterprise, we are pleased with the growth and revenue and gross profit rate between posted this quarter. 
Our performance in Europe reflected the challenging economic situation and the resulting effect on consumer spending. 
In our Domestic segment, we've made solid progress on the strategic initiatives we introduced earlier this year while prudently managing our business. Beginning with our channels, last week, we launched the Best Buy marketplace that allows third-party sellers to offer thousands of additional products through BestBuy.com and enables us to expand our range of assortments, price points and brands. Marketplace is one step in our plan to double our domestic online revenue in the next three to five years. 
Also under the heading of channels, we continue to invest in expanding the portfolio in our Services business which delivered its third consecutive quarter of positive comps, including more than 3% in Q2.  I'll provide more detail shortly on both of these multichannel initiatives that will help us drive revenue and margin in the future. 
By category, we are continuing to see positive momentum from our investments in the two hottest consumer electronic products, tablets and mobile phones. The rapid growth in tablets was the primary catalyst that drove the strong momentum in mobile computing during the quarter. iPad Sales were strong in the quarter as we expected. But sales of Android devices also were solid and better than we expected. Going forward, we continue to be bullish on the growth of this new computing form factor and are encouraged by the new models in the pipeline over the next several months that will offer our customers even more choices, both online and in stores. We believe tablet central fueled by smart friendly Blue Shirts that will help customers select a device with the right operating system, accessories and connections to get the most of their purchase has positioned us well to capitalize on the momentum this new product category is bringing the industry.
The mobile phone industry was facing difficult comparisons, with no major phone launches in the second quarter compared with several new models in the summer of 2010. While the lack of traffic driving launches led to a year-over-year declined in comps, our mobile teams were able to overcome the industry's situation and deliver share growth. With the product cycle shift from summer to fall, we expect several iconic devices to hit the market in the back half and drive customers into our stores and online, as they look to upgrade their phones.
And we're ready for that expected uptick, as we continue to invest to expand our points of presence by adding 25 mobile standalone stores across the country in Q2, bringing our total to 222 to complement with the mobile stores already located in our 1,100 big-box stores and our online mobile presence. Our mobile expansion strategy is just one example of our second strategic imperative on our multichannel business model. The TV industry continues to be challenging and our TV comps in Q2 were down low double-digits. However, we continue to progress well on our strategy to drive sales of larger screen TVs. Jim will provide more in his remarks.
The second strategic imperative I mentioned earlier was our multichannel approach to serving customer needs. As you know, we intend to double our Domestic online business in the next three to five years. While we're pleased with the continued double-digit revenue growth we've been seeing, we're even more pleased with the new digital capabilities we're deploying. 
Unique tools, platforms and promotional strategies that capitalize on the evolving shopping habits and expectations of today's tech-savvy multi-channel customers. 
Earlier I mentioned a loss last week of Best Buy marketplace. It's good for our customers who will get access to a broader, deeper pool of products. It's good for our partners who are able to leverage the power of our brand in the 800 million visits a year to our e-commerce site and it's great for us. We expand our online assortment, drive incremental traffic and revenue and create opportunities to attach additional products and services. 
Best Buy receives a percentage commission on each marketplace sale. Incremental income that falls to the bottom line. This is an element of our multichannel strategy that provides us with the ability to grow margin, revenue, and/or share depending on the channel. We will continue to update you on the progress of marketplace in the quarters to come.
We are also creating new innovative digital marketing strategies. Our recently launched Deal Of the Day program is one example. Deal Of The Day is a promotion we have on BestBuy.com in which customer sign-up to be notified of a great new deal via e-mail, text or by visiting the site on a specific product each day. The objectives of the program are to drive additional traffic and new customers to BestBuy.com and prove conversion and also to add to our database of customers with whom we regularly communicate. 
We have also significantly enhanced our own online assortments to the tune of 20,000 new online SKUs this fiscal year.
Finally, customers continue to value the option of picking up their online order in stores. In the second quarter, in-store pickup accounted for over 40% of our domestic online sales volume, up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. These multichannel initiatives are critical in helping us grow in new categories, gain share in existing categories and develop new store formats aimed at helping us differentiate our business and optimize sales to drive growth.
That leads me to the third element of our strategy that I discussed at the front end. Optimizing our scale to drive growth. One of our greatest differentiators and one which offers both revenue and margin growth opportunities is our Services business. We've committed to expanding our Services portfolio. And I'll provide just a few high-level examples of work we've done to test the growth of the model. 
We've expanded our new Geek Squad tech-support program which offers customers one or two years of comprehensive computer service via remote chat session, a store visit, phone call or e-mail. a true example of a multichannel value proposition. Even though it's been available for a fairly short period, our attachment rate has been significantly better than what we expected. This program creates connections with our customers that extend well beyond the initial purchase. We provide help with their product regardless of where they purchased it in whatever way is most convenient to them. 
Our Buy Back Program which was launched at the beginning of the year has resonated well, especially with our mobile phone customers. 
Appliances is another category where we're using our considerable size and scale to deliver growth. This category had its third quarter in a row of positive comps, a particularly impressive performance by our team as we were up against difficult comparisons from last year. We're very pleased with the continued strong performance and market share gains in the category which we believe provide a long runway of growth for Best Buy.
Next, gaming. Gaming is an area of significant opportunity for us. We've completed the physical and operational transformation of the gaming departments throughout our stores and are pleased with our progress in trade-in volume and pre-order volume. One data point that illustrates the momentum we've had in gaming, our Reward Zone gamers club membership grew 25% in the last year and now totals 2.6 million members. This number is very important as we build our base of core gamer customers who are the most active purchasers of both new and preowned titles. 
The gaming industry experienced softness in the first half of this year due to a lack of new titles and this impacted our results in the second quarter. While there was a stream of new titles coming in the months ahead, it remains unclear where the customer will choose to spend. Regardless of the state of the industry however, we are confident we have the people and promotions to continue growing share and making progress in this category. 
As I mentioned earlier, we knew this year was going to be a volatile and uncertain consumer environment. While we have updated our outlook for the year, we continue to believe in our multichannel approach and are cautiously optimistic about the back half for a number of reasons. We are taking action to invest in areas where we believe we can grow returns and where customers expect and need us to be. As we see more examples of what connections can do for consumers, we become increasingly convinced of the strength of our multichannel position in the areas where we plan to win. 
We also believe there is a lot to be excited about this upcoming holiday. I'll provide a brief high-level rundown of what's coming. We see tremendous opportunity for Best Buy Mobile and expect several iconic products to be launched in the next few weeks and months. We are on track to deliver our annual target of 10 million total connections in our Domestic segment. We expect tablets will be big and believe BestBuy.com and Tablet Central will continue to be the destination for tablet choice. As I noted earlier, we believe we are well-positioned for the new title releases in the gaming category and we're introducing compelling offers across all of our product categories and channels that we believe will continue to add value for our customers. 
Our strategic approach remains clear and the fundamentals of our business are strong. Our multichannel advantages, including the progress we're making in digital platforms and promotions differentiate us from competitors. We offer competitive pricing, selection and services for customers and we remain disciplined in our use of capital and we're a financially strong cash generative business. And we continue to ensure we are prudently managing our costs. That financial strength and the differentiation of our multichannel business model are big assets for us in these uncertain economic times. With that, I'll hand it over to Jim."

Today I'd like to cover the financial highlights of our second quarter results and provide you with the progress update on several of our key initiatives for the year. I'll also discuss some of the background around the changes we announced to our annual EPS outlook this morning based on what we have observed so far this year. 
Earlier, Brian touched on what we are seeing in the macro environment and its dampening impact on consumer spending and the CE industry. Together, we have seen this play out through the first half in various industry data points, as well as in the commentary in some of our vendor partners and competitors. Context of these current macro industry headwinds, our business faired comparatively well. But still, our Q2 results were below our original expectations. With this is important and contacts are second quarter revenue came in about flat to last year the favorable impact of foreign currency and new store growth were offset by a comparable store sales decline of 2.8%. 
In the Domestic segment, sales declined 1.5% and comparable store sales were down 2.7%. These results were relatively consistent with the sales trends we experienced in the first quarter of the year. The biggest positive drivers in the domestic comp included tablets, appliances and e-readers. 
Total mobile computing had strong comparable store sales growth of 9% for the quarter. The growth was driven by a very strong tablet sales supported by the benefits of implementing our Tablet Central model which leverages a broad assortment of devices, side-by-side with dedicated expert labor. 
Also in Computing, it's worth noting that traditional notebook comp trends while still negative improved again during the quarter. 
Appliances continued its momentum, with strong comp sales up 12% on top of positive comps in the prior year. We believe the benefits about the operational changes we made in the appliance area and improved competitive offers have helped us grow market share in this business. 
Another product category worth noting is e-readers which once again delivered triple digit comps and had a meaningful impact on the total Domestic segment. These products, along with mobile phones and tablets highlight the continuing consumer appetite for mobile technologies and the revenue growth that can be derived by bringing the complete mobile experience together, along with a broad assortment of products and employees provided by to help customers select the best solution for their individual needs. 
Let's also spend a moment of the performance of the Best Buy Mobile business in Q2. As noted in the release this morning, mobile phone sales performance in Q2 decelerated from the strong growth trends experienced in the reason quarters due to 16 product cycles of new handset launches by vendors. Specifically, Q2 lacked the type of significant device launches like iPhone 4 and the HTC Evo that were a major catalyst during Q2 in the prior year. Putting our sales into context compared to the broader mobile phone industry, we estimate that we continue to gain significant share during the quarter compared to last year. 
As we've discussed before, in Best Buy Mobile, the sales comp only tells part of the financial story. While the timing shift of major smartphone launches adversely impacted AFPs and postpaid connection volumes, our overall connection volumes in Best Buy Mobile continued to grow during Q2, driven by strong growth in the prepaid phones and additional Best Buy Mobile standalone store locations.
As Brian discussed, we anticipated stronger lineup of new handsets in the second half and continue to expect that this business will deliver its top line and profit goals for the year.
TV comps in Q2 finished down low double digits the result similar to the previous two quarters and very much in line with overall industry trends. As you recall, we went into this year with the expectation of the TV business would be soft. But given what the industry experienced with last year and the continued macro headwinds accordingly we focus our plans this year on helping customers with their purchase decisions on larger screen sizes with more advanced features. So far this year, our sales mix of larger screen sizes has been growing, with nearly 60% of our business coming from screen sizes 46 inches and up. This represented double-digit unit growth on large screens during the quarter. 
In serving the premium home theater enthusiasts, our Magnolia Home Theater business, which is in 385 of our U.S. stores, continues to perform very well and delivered mid-double-digit comparable store sales gains during the quarter. 
In our Gaming business we had planned for stronger sales performance in the quarter. We believe that the softness in gaming was driven by the lack of major software title launches during the period. We remain on track in delivering the enhanced capabilities to our customers via improvement in pre-order, and pre-owned title capabilities. Coupled with additional lever be made in the space to help customers with their purchase decisions. 
Sales in our International segment increased to approximately 5% driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency and new store growth which offset a 3.2% comparable store sales decline. 
Our Five Star business in China continue to solid growth for the comparable store sales gain of 7% which was on top of almost 22% comp last year. We remain on track for 40 to 50 new Five Star openings this year in this important market for the future.
Canada and Best Buy Europe experienced high and low single-digit comparable store sales decline respectively. 
Turning to gross profit. Second quarter gross profit dollars of $2.9 billion were down 2%. Within the Domestic segment, the gross profit rate declined 50 basis points on a difficult comparison to the previous year, when gross profit rate was up 150 basis points. This will be our most difficult comparison period of the year.
There were several factors that influenced the rate decline in Q2. Consistent with Q1, we continue to take a bit of action to successfully drive revenue improvements in key categories like appliances, computing and gaming. Additionally, the new Geek Squad tech support service offering that Brian discussed earlier had a negative impact on our gross profit rate in the second quarter. Under this program, customers enter into an ongoing service relationship with us for one to two years. Accordingly, we recognize the revenue and profits over the life of the agreement. In the past, if a customer purchased a service product for assistance with a one-time repair, we recognized a profit at full at the time of the service. If this program continues to prove successful, we would expect the tech-support membership sales to drive both increased margin dollars and improved the rate over time.
Partially offsetting the items that negatively impacted gross margin was strength in mobile phones. Largely from increased sales of accessory and service solutions, as well as handset mix.
Within the International segment, we had a 4% increase in gross profit dollars, driven largely by FX. Overall, the International gross profit margin rate was 25.4%, a slight decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by a more promotional environment in the mobile phones business in Europe that they see a backdrop of reduced upgrade volume in the industry due to the migration of UK customers from 18 months to 24 month contracts, which began taking place roughly a year and a half ago. We are very pleased with the progress made by our businesses in Canada in Five Star to improve the gross margin rates in Q2. The rate improvement in Canada was driven by increased promotional effectiveness, operating model changes made by the business to focus on driving profitable sales and the growth in the mix of mobile phones. Five Star margins increase based on improved cost programs with vendors. 
Given the lower sales environment we experienced in the second quarter, we also took action to reduce expenses while maintaining focus on areas which will provide benefits in the second half and beyond. 
Excluding the impact of FX, total company SG&A increased to 1% during the quarter. The modest increase year-over-year in SG&A spending was driven primarily by the addition of new stores and increased advertising., mostly offset by proactive adjustments to our spending profile during the quarter. For the first half of the year, total SG&A expense that was essentially flat, excluding FX.
Since we're talking about expenses, this is also a good opportunity to provide you with a quick update on the progress we have made with our initiative to reduce our Domestic big-box square footage. As you recall, we are making plans to evolve the operating model in our U.S. big-box stores to better support the increased growth opportunities we see in connected businesses and to improve our overall experience for customers and employees. As a part of this work, we are planning to reduce our big-box square footage by 10% over the next three to five years. Our test results so far in this space continue to indicated that a store prototype which combines the enhanced operating model with reduced space and lower operating costs has not materially lowered our sales volumes in these stores.
With almost 40% of our leases set to expire over the next five years, we have a significant opportunity to execute a portion of these plans based reduction at the natural end of the lease, which of course is very cost-effective. Additionally, we are actively pursuing options to both sublease and return space to landlords where opportunities exist. By way of example, in FY '12, we estimate that in total that we will work with landlords on approximately 30 store locations. We currently expect to reduce space in well over 50% of these locations to achieve a total square footage reduction of 10% to 15% against this entire tranche of 30 stores. To be clear, we still have work to do with subleasing all of these sites to achieve the full financial benefit, but we continue to be encouraged by our discussions to date with prospective tenants. As these plans continue to develop, we look forward to updating you on our progress.
A few more items I wanted to touch on before discussing our guidance for the year. We have actively managed our inventory for lower balances from where we started the year. Domestic comp store inventory finished down 5% in the second quarter. In addition, our receivable positions and payables have also made good progress in returning to more verbalize levels from where we finished fiscal 2011.
Free cash flow for the first half looked very strong at $1.1 billion, up significantly from last year. As previously discussed, the biggest driver of the first half free cash flow increase was the reversal of year-end timing differences in several key working capital items. We believe we are still on track to hit our free cash flow target for the year of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The cash generative nature of our business continued to be one of the key strength of our model.
During the quarter, we also continued share repurchase activity. Total repurchases during the first half of the year totaled $863 million, which reflects 29.2 million shares or approximately 7% of our outstanding shares.
Looking back at the first half of the year, while the environment remains challenging, we feel good about the solid progress we made on our key growth initiatives. We will continue to invest and push forward on these opportunities for profitable growth and improve shareholder returns.
Our outlook for the year has evolved. Based on what we've seen so far from both the consumer and in the profile of our margins year-to-date. Based on these factors and our expectations for the balance of the year, we have modified our full year earnings expectations. 
We continue to expect full year revenue in the range of $51 billion to $52.5 billion with full year comps of flat to down 3%. Specifically, in the second half we are expecting continued strong growth in tablet of industry growth and from the benefit of our Tablet Central work. We expect strong growth of Best Buy Mobile from significant device launches and the continued strength of our differentiated model. We also expect meaningful improvement in the gaming industry from a stronger lineup of software title releases and the progression in our pre-order and preowned capabilities.
Our expectation for the second half has not assumed a significant improvement in the trends of two of our largest categories, TVs and notebooks. Consistent with our outlook at the beginning of the year. 
As a reminder, another item that impacts full year total revenue is the inclusion of the 53rd week during the fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate that the 53rd week will favorably impact full year to a revenue growth by approximately 1.5% to 2%. 
Moving onto gross profit rate expectation for the year, which is the most significant driver in our updated outlook, the first half gross profit rate was down 50 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by targeted promotional activity to drive revenue, several non-recurring items in Q1, and the impact of new tech support services which temporarily lowered our margin rates. 
In the second half, we expect gross rate trend to improve, driven primarily by improved performance in mobile phones based on anticipated sales increases and solutions attached, improvements in game driven by strong title releases and a higher mix of preowned game software and improved attachment and solution sales in our mobile computing space.
For the full year, we now expect that our gross profit rate will be modestly down. We have also lowered our annual spending profile in SG&A and now expect SG&A to be up 3% to 4%, excluding FX or approximately 1% to 2%, excluding the impact of higher incentive comp and the 53rd week.
The reduction in SG&A growth reflects lower discretionary and project spending as we prudently manage our spending in this environment. Strike an important balance of pushing forward on the profitable growth areas while managing our spending into more uncertain near term. 
So rolling it all up, we anticipate that total operating income dollars for the year will be in the range of a 5% decline to 2% growth, reflecting the impact of lower expected gross profit rate, partially mitigated by lower SG&A spend. 
We are updating our annual EPS guidance range to $3.35 to $3.65. For clarity, this range now includes the impact of $1.5 billion of expected share repurchases for this fiscal year or approximately $0.20 to $0.25 depending upon where earnings finalize for the year. As a reminder, our original fiscal 2012 EPS guidance of $3.30 to $3.35 excludes fiscal '12 share repurchases. 
So in closing, while we expect to see continued volatility in consumer behavior in the second half of the year given the uncertainties in the macro, we continue to be fluid and purposeful with our plans and will follow customers where they need us to go. We will focus our resources on driving the profitable strategic growth opportunities we see in the business. We are confident that our unique combination of multichannel assets, service capabilities and strong financial foundation, coupled with our biggest differentiator, our outstanding people put us in a position to drive shareholder returns over time. So With that, Alicia, we are ready for questions."

You rightly pointed out that our operating profit in Q1 in International increased significantly year-over-year. When you take a look at what happened in Q2, we saw many of the same trends and improved operating profits that we saw in Q1 actually happened in Q2 as well. The primary difference in our operating income performance in Q2 for International was driven by the results in our European business. When I look at the performance of our business in Canada, Five Star and Mexico coupled with the restructuring activities we did in Turkey and China, our profits actually increased pretty dramatically in the International segments. Europe profits were actually down significantly in Q2 after being up in Q1, primarily driven by two factors. Very difficult macro environments in consumer spending in Europe, similar to what we've seen in other parts of the world quite badly at that environment is more difficult than what we're experiencing in the U.S. market from a consumer standpoint. The other thing not to be underestimated and that is the commentary that both Brian and I provided in what's going on with mobile phone connections in Europe specifically in the U.K.. About a year and a half ago, the carriers in that market switched from 18 month contract for customers to 24 month contracts. We are now in the middle of that low period were typically, we would have more contracts that are coming up for renewal that aren't available for the marketplace to basically upgrade those customers. So we'll start to see that later towards the tail end of this year, but a combination of the macro environment in Europe and that significant change in contract terms kind of being in a value right now is what's driving our European operating profit down."

In fact just the opposite. We are making investments in our store labor areas by having key labor investments in our gaming area, in our computer and tablet area, in Best Buy Mobile, all the places where we're seeing the growth. That's were putting our labor there.

You correctly point out that model that we have launched within Best Buy and roughly 10 stores we had there wasn't getting the type of benefit that we had expected. We certainly think that there's opportunities that remain in China under some type of business. But the reason we started to test there in the first place is to figure out where we could provide a meaningful level of differentiation overtime that make a sense for the customer there. So we haven't given up on Best Buy in China as a matter of fact we think we have other opportunities, but we are absolutely focused on growing the opportunity that we have right in front of us in the profitable Five Star business in the year-end now. In Europe specifically, as I look at the run rate change of operating profit Q1 to Q2, the biggest driver of that performance is not the ""big box"" performance, it's actually the performance of our public 2400 small box stores, driven by once again the macro environment and the carrier contract changes we talked about. As we launched those ""big box"" stores in the UK, we purposely said we want to test to see how that value proposition works with customers. We certainly as the rest of the market had been met with a very challenging macro setup in that space and we certainly like all of our test, we continue to evaluate what makes the most sense in that marketplace from a multichannel approach. And quite candidly we need to make sure as we do on all of our business both domestically and internationally that each in those businesses is there's right to future capital in the space. So things we know for sure we know for sure that our teams in the UK have done a great job of landing a model in that plays where customers recognize the value that a service environment provides and a customer experience that's differentiated. We're very pleased with what our team had landed there, customer and service perspective. We haven't come to a conclusion yet on what the long-term model should look like for multichannel and ""big box"" Budd this day we actually look at it all the time of it about the best bets can be made to grow our portfolio profitably overtime."

What I tried to laid out in the commentary through the follow-up on Q&A the key things that we see influencing the run rate of gross profit in the back half of the year, versus what we saw in the first half of the year is really that increased sales mix of mobile phones, higher mix of gaming titles given industry strength and the things that we've done from a pre-order and they use a gaming business which carries higher margin in our portfolio. And specifically what we're doing around this utilizing that labor attachment that labor adjustment that Mike Vitelli talked about to improve our attachment rate cash solution sales both of mobile phones, gaming and in our Computing business overall. We'll see how the mix of sales pans out in the back half of the year with customers, but also remind you that our margin rate comparison gets much easier in the back half of the year than what we saw in the first half of the year as well. So a combination of those factors domestically and internationally the biggest change in the expected gross profit rate is really coming from the European business as more of those available upgrades become available because we're going to start to hit in that window of the value of the 18 to 24 months cycle. We'll see the margins in the UK business improve as well. That will be a different phenomenon than what we saw in the first half.

My comments this morning will focus on our second quarter performance, how we're progressing on our strategic priorities and how we see the rest of the year playing out. But before I jump into my comments on the quarter, I would like to thank our employees for another quarter of outstanding effort in bringing the Connected World to life for our customers across all of our channels and geographies. I'm especially proud of the way our teams in London pulled together to ensure the safety of their employees and customers during the riots in London last month and how our U.S. employees helped their communities and each other through the extreme difficulties of Hurricane Irene and the recent battering of the East Coast. We continue to execute on our strategy in times of challenge and continue to see opportunity. We're responding to the needs of our customers in each segment and channel where we conduct business. 
Before I turn it over to Jim for more specific details, I want to put our results and outlook in the context of our overall business strategy. As you know, our strategy is to drive the 3 elements: one, our financial strength and flexibility; two, a unique multichannel approach that allows us to connect wherever and whenever people shop; and three, optimizing our scale to drive growth to new categories, new store format and share gains in key categories. 
Let's begin our look at the financial strength that is enabling us to continue to invest and return value to our shareholders. Looking at the big picture worldwide, we're still facing an uncertain macro environment with volatile consumer shopping behavior and this was evident in our results for the second quarter. Despite that, we generated significantly more cash in Q2 and ended the quarter with more than $2 billion of cash on hand. Our free cash flow was $1.1 billion in the first half. This has helped us to continue to fuel our share repurchase strategy and we were on target -- we are on target to buyback approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. We remain disciplined in our use of capital while continuing to invest for growth geographically, by channel and by category.
Geographically, in China, we are continuing our rapid rollout of Five Star stores. We added 7 more stores in the second quarter, taking us to a total of 178. In addition, Five Star's continuing operations were once again a highlight of the quarter, delivering 7% comps and increased margins. In Canada, where we are facing a challenging economic environment very similar to that of the U.S., the team did a great job of delivering solid gross margin rate improvement. And we continue to see solid performance in Mexico. While the contributions of our Mexican operations are still relatively small within the context of our enterprise, we are pleased with the growth and revenue and gross profit rate the team posted this quarter. Our performance in Europe reflected the challenging economic situation and the resulting effect on consumer spending. 
In our Domestic segment, we've made solid progress on the strategic initiatives we introduced earlier this year while prudently managing our business. Beginning with our channels, last week, we launched the Best Buy Marketplace that allows third-party sellers to offer thousands of additional products through BestBuy.com and enables us to expand our range of assortments, price points and brands. Marketplace is one step in our plan to double our domestic online revenue in the next 3 to 5 years. 
Also under the heading of channels, we continue to invest in expanding the portfolio in our services business which delivered its third consecutive quarter of positive comps, including more than 3% in Q2. I'll provide more detail shortly on both of these multichannel initiatives that will help us drive revenue and margin in the future. 
By category, we are continuing to see positive momentum from our investments in the 2 hottest consumer electronic products, tablets and mobile phones. The rapid growth in tablets was the primary catalyst that drove the strong momentum in mobile computing during the quarter. iPad sales were strong in the quarter as we expected, but sales of Android devices also were solid and better than we expected. Going forward, we continue to be bullish on the growth of this new computing form factor and are encouraged by the new models in the pipeline over the next several months that will offer our customers even more choice both online and in stores. We believe Tablet Central, fueled by smart friendly Blue Shirts that will help customers select a device with the right operating system, accessories and connections to get the most of their purchase, has positioned us well to capitalize on the momentum this new product category is bringing the industry.
The mobile phone industry was facing difficult comparisons with no major phone launches in the second quarter compared with several new models in the summer of 2010. While the lack of traffic driving launches led to a year-over-year decline in comps, our mobile teams were able to overcome the industry's situation and deliver share growth. With the product cycle shifting from summer to fall, we expect several iconic devices to hit the market in the back half and drive customers into our stores and online as they look to upgrade their phones.
And we're ready for that expected uptick as we continue to invest to expand our points of presence by adding 25 mobile standalone stores across the country in Q2, bringing our total to 222 to complement with the mobile stores already located in our 1,100 big box stores and our online mobile presence. Our mobile expansion strategy is just one example of our second strategic imperative on our multichannel business model. 
The TV industry continues to be challenged and our TV comps in Q2 were down low double digits. However, we continue to progress well on our strategy to drive sales of large screen TVs. Jim will provide more detail on this category in his remarks.
The second strategic imperative I mentioned earlier is our multichannel approach to serving customer needs. As you know, we intend to double our Domestic online business in the next 3 to 5 years. While we're pleased with the continued double-digit revenue growth we've been seeing, we're even more pleased with the new digital capabilities we're deploying, unique tools, platforms and promotional strategies that capitalize on the evolving shopping habit and expectations of today's tech-savvy multichannel customers. 
Earlier, I mentioned the launch last week of Best Buy Marketplace. It's good for our customers who'll get access to a broader, deeper pool of products. It's good for our partners who are able to leverage the power of our brand in the 800 million visits a year to our e-commerce site, and it's great for us. We expand our online assortment, drive incremental traffic and revenue and create opportunities to attach additional products and services. Best Buy receives a percentage commission on each Marketplace sale, incremental income that falls to the bottom line. This is an element of our multichannel strategy that provides us with the ability to grow margin, revenue and/or share depending on the channel. We will continue to update you on the progress of Marketplace in the quarters to come.
We are also creating new innovative digital marketing strategies. Our recently launched Deal of the Day program is one example. Deal of the Day is a promotion we have on BestBuy.com in which customers sign-up to be notified of a great new deal via e-mail, text or by visiting the site on a specific product each day. The objectives of the program are to drive additional traffic and new customers to BestBuy.com, improve conversion and also to add to our database of customers with whom we regularly communicate. We have also significantly enhanced our own online assortment to the tune of 20,000 new online SKUs this fiscal year.
Finally, customers continue to value the option of picking up their online order in stores. In the second quarter, in-store pickup accounted for over 40% of our domestic online sales volume, up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. 
These multichannel initiatives are critical in helping us grow in new categories, gain share in existing categories and develop new store format aimed at helping us differentiate our business and optimize sales to drive growth.
That leads me to the third element of our strategy that I discussed at the front end, optimizing our scale to drive growth. One of our greatest differentiators and one which offers both revenue and margin growth opportunities is our services business. We've committed to expanding our services portfolio and I'll provide just a few high-level examples of work we've done to test the growth of the model. 
We've expanded our new Geek Squad Tech Support program which offers customers 1 or 2 years of comprehensive computer service via remote chat session, a store visit, phone call or e-mail, a true example of a multichannel value proposition. Even though it's been available for a fairly short period, our attach rate has been significantly better than what we expected. This program creates connections with our customers that extend well beyond the initial purchase. We provide help with their product regardless of where they purchased it in whatever way is most convenient to them. 
Our Buy Back Program, which was launched at the beginning of the year, has resonated well especially with our mobile phone customers. 
Appliances is another category where we're using our considerable size and scale to deliver growth. This category had its third quarter in a row of positive comps, a particularly impressive performance by our team as we were up against difficult comparisons from last year. We're very pleased with the continued strong performance and market share gains in the category which we believe provide a long runway of growth for Best Buy.
Next, gaming. Gaming is an area of significant opportunity for us. We have completed the physical and operational transformation of the gaming departments throughout our stores and are pleased with our progress in trade-in volume and pre-order volume. One data point that illustrates the momentum we've had in gaming, our Reward Zone Gamer's Club membership grew 25% in the last year and now totals 2.6 million members. This number is very important as we build our base of core gamer customers who are the most active purchasers of both new and pre-owned titles. The gaming industry experienced softness in the first half of this year due to a lack of new titles and this impacted our results in the second quarter. While there is a stream of new titles coming in the months ahead, it remains unclear where the customer will choose to spend. Regardless of the state of the industry, however, we are confident we have the people and promotions to continue growing share and making progress in this category. 
As I mentioned earlier, we knew this year was going to be a volatile and uncertain consumer environment. While we have updated our outlook for the year, we continue to believe in our multichannel approach and are cautiously optimistic about the back half for a number of reasons. We are taking action to invest in areas where we believe we can grow returns and where customers expect and need us to be. As we see more examples of what connections can do for consumers, we become increasingly convinced of the strength of our multichannel position in the areas where we plan to win. 
We also believe there is a lot to be excited about this upcoming holiday. I'll provide a brief high-level rundown of what's coming. We see tremendous opportunity for Best Buy Mobile and expect several iconic products to be launched in the next few weeks and months. We are on track to deliver our annual target of 10 million total connections in our Domestic segment. We expect tablets will be big and believe BestBuy.com and Tablet Central will continue to be the destination for tablet choice. As I noted earlier, we believe we are well positioned for the new title releases in the gaming category and we're introducing compelling offers across all of our product categories and channels that we believe will continue to add value for our customers. 
Our strategic approach remains clear and the fundamentals of our business are strong. Our multichannel advantages, including the progress we're making in digital platforms and promotions, differentiate us from competitors. We offer competitive pricing, selection and services for customers. And we remain disciplined in our use of capital and we're a financially strong cash-generative business. And we continue to ensure we are prudently managing our costs. That financial strength and the differentiation of our multichannel business model are big assets for us in these uncertain economic times. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Jim."

Today, I'd like to cover the financial highlights of our second quarter results and provide you with a progress update on several of our key initiatives for the year. I will also discuss some of the background around the changes we announced to our annual EPS outlook this morning based on what we have observed so far this year. 
Earlier, Brian touched on what we are seeing in the macro environment and its dampening impact on consumer spending and the CE industry. Together, we have seen this play out through the first half in various industry data points as well as in the commentary of some of our vendor partners and competitors. Viewed in the context of these current macro and industry headwinds, our business faired comparatively well. But still, our Q2 results were below our original expectations. With this as important context, our second quarter revenue came in about flat to last year. The favorable impact of foreign currency and new store growth were offset by a comparable store sales decline of 2.8%. 
In the Domestic segment, sales declined 1.5% and comparable store sales were down 2.7%. These results were relatively consistent with the sales trends we experienced in the first quarter of the year. The biggest positive drivers in the Domestic comp included tablets, appliances and e-readers. 
Total mobile computing had strong comparable store sales growth of 9% in the quarter. The growth was driven by a very strong tablet sales supported by the benefits of implementing our Tablet Central model which leverages a broad assortment of devices side by side with dedicated expert labor. Also in computing, it's worth noting that traditional notebook comp trends, while still negative, improved again during the quarter. 
Appliances continued its momentum with strong comp sales of 12% on top of positive comps in the prior year. We believe the benefits of both the operational changes we made in the appliance area and improved competitive offers have helped us grow market share on this business. 
Another product category worth noting is e-readers, which once again delivered triple-digit comps and had a meaningful impact on the total Domestic segment. These products, along with mobile phones and tablets, highlight the continuing consumer appetite for mobile technology and the revenue growth that can be derived by bringing the complete mobile experience together, along with a broad assortment of products and employees who can provide advice to help customers select the best solution for their individual needs. 
Let's also spend a moment on the performance of the Best Buy Mobile business in Q2. As noted in the release this morning, mobile phone sales performance in Q2 decelerated from the strong growth trends experienced in the recent quarters due to shifting product cycles of new handset launches by vendors. Specifically, Q2 lacked the type of significant device launches like iPhone 4 and the HTC EVO that were a major catalyst during Q2 in the prior year. Putting our sales into context compared to the broader mobile phone industry, we estimate that we continue to gain significant share during the quarter compared to last year. 
As we've discussed before, in Best Buy Mobile, the sales comp only tells part of the financial story. While the timing shift of major smartphone launches adversely impacted AFPs [ph] and postpaid connection volumes, our overall connection volumes in Best Buy Mobile continued to grow during Q2, driven by strong growth in prepaid phones and additional Best Buy Mobile standalone store locations. As Brian discussed, we anticipate a stronger lineup of new handsets in the second half and continue to expect that this business will deliver its top line and profit goals for the year.
TV comps in Q2 finished down low double digits, a result similar to the previous 2 quarters and very much in line with overall industry trend. As you recall, we went into this year with the expectation that the TV business would be soft. But given what the industry experienced with last year and the continued macro headwinds, accordingly, we focused our plan this year on helping customers with their purchase decisions on larger screen sizes with more advanced features. So far, this year, our sales mix of larger screen sizes had been growing with nearly 60% of our business coming from screen sizes 46 inches and up. This represent a double-digit unit growth on large screens during the quarter. In serving the premium home theater enthusiasts, our Magnolia Home Theater business, which is in 385 of our U.S. stores, continues to perform very well and delivered mid-double-digit comparable store sales gains during the quarter. 
In our gaming business, we had planned for stronger sales performance in the quarter. We believe that the softness in gaming was driven by the lack of major software title launches during the period. We remain on track in delivering the enhanced capabilities to our customers via improvement in pre-order and pre-owned title capabilities coupled with additional labor investments we made in the space to help customers with their purchase decisions. 
Sales in our International segment increased to approximately 5% driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency and new store growth, which offset a 3.2% comparable store sales decline. 
Our Five Star business in China continued its solid growth with a comparable store sales gain of 7%, which was on top of almost to 22% comp last year. We remain on track for 40 to 50 new Five Star openings this year in this important market for the future. Canada and Best Buy Europe experienced high and low single-digit comparable store sales declines, respectively.
Turning to gross profit. Second quarter gross profit dollars of $2.9 billion were down 2%. Within the Domestic segment, the gross profit rate declined 50 basis points on a difficult comparison to the previous year when gross profit rate was up 150 basis points. This will be our most difficult comparison period of the year. There were several factors that influenced the rate decline in Q2. Consistent with Q1, we continue to take competitive action to successfully drive revenue improvements in key categories like appliances, computing and gaming. Additionally, the new Geek Squad Tech Support service offering that Brian discussed earlier had a negative impact on our gross profit rate in the second quarter. Under this program, customers enter into an ongoing service relationship with us for 1 to 2 years. Accordingly, we recognize the revenue and profits over the life of the agreement. In the past, if a customer purchased a service product for assistance with a one-time repair, we recognized the profit at full at the time of the service. If this program continues to prove successful, we would expect the Tech Support membership sales to drive both increased margin dollars and improve rate over time. Partially offsetting the items that negatively impacted gross margin was rate strength in mobile phones largely from increased sales of accessory and service solutions as well as handset mix.
Within the International segment, we had a 4% increase in gross profit dollars driven largely by FX. Overall, the International gross profit margin rate was 25.4%, a slight decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by a more promotional environment in the mobile phone business in Europe that's facing a backdrop of reduced upgrade volume in the industry due to the migration of U.K. customers from 18-month to 24-month contracts which began taking place roughly 1.5 years ago. We are very pleased with the progress made by our businesses in Canada and Five Star to improve their gross margin rates in Q2. The rate improvement in Canada was driven by increased promotional effectiveness, operating model changes made by the business to focus on driving profitable sales and the growth in the mix of mobile phones. Five Star margins increased based on improved cost programs with vendors. 
Given the lower sales environment we experienced in the second quarter, we also took action to reduce expenses while maintaining focus on areas which will provide benefits in the second half and beyond. 
Excluding the impact of FX, total company SG&A increased 1% during the quarter. The modest increase year-over-year in SG&A spending was driven primarily by the addition of new stores and increased advertising mostly offset by proactive adjustments to our spending profile during the quarter. For the first half of the year, total SG&A expense was essentially flat excluding FX.
Since we're talking about expenses, this is also a good opportunity to provide you with a quick update on the progress we have made with our initiative to reduce our Domestic big box square footage. As you will recall, we are making plans to evolve the operating model in our U.S. big box stores to better support the increased growth opportunities we see in connected businesses and to improve our overall experience for customers and employees. As a part of this work, we are planning to reduce our big box square footage by 10% over the next 3 to 5 years. Our test results so far in the space continue to indicate that a store prototype, which combines the enhanced operating model with reduced space and lower operating cost, has not materially lowered our sales volumes in these stores. With almost 40% of our leases set to expire over the next 5 years, we have a significant opportunity to execute a portion of this planned space reduction at the natural end of the lease, which of course is very cost effective. Additionally, we are actively pursuing an option to both sublease and return space to landlords where opportunities exist. By way of example, in FY '12, we estimate that in total that we will work with landlords on approximately 30 store locations. We currently expect to reduce space in well over 50% of these locations to achieve a total square footage reduction of 10% to 15% against this entire tranche of 30 stores. To be clear, we still have work to do with subleasing all of these sites to achieve the full financial benefit but we continue to be encouraged by our discussions to date with prospective tenants. As these plans continue to develop, we look forward to updating you on our progress.
A few more items I wanted to touch on before discussing our guidance for the year. We have actively managed our inventory to lower balances from where we started the year. Domestic comp store inventories finished down 5% in the second quarter. In addition, our receivable positions and payables have also made good progress in returning to more normalized levels from where we finished fiscal 2011.
Free cash flow for the first half looked very strong at $1.1 billion, up significantly from last year. As previously discussed, the biggest driver of the first half free cash flow increase was the reversal of year-end timing differences in several key working capital items. We believe we are still on track to hit our free cash flow target for the year of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The cash generative nature of our business continued to be one of the key strengths of our model.
During the quarter, we also continued share repurchase activity. Total repurchases during the first half of the year totaled $863 million, which reflects 29.2 million shares or approximately 7% of our outstanding shares.
Looking back at the first half of the year, while the environment remained challenging, we feel good about the solid progress we have made on our key growth initiatives. We will continue to invest and push forward on these opportunities for profitable growth and improve shareholder returns.
Our outlook for the year has evolved. Based on what we have seen so far from both the consumer and in the profile of our margins year-to-date. Based on these factors and our expectations for the balance of the year, we have modified our full year earnings expectations. We continue to expect full year revenue in the range of $51 billion to $52.5 billion with full year comps of flat to down 3%. Specifically, in the second half, we're expecting continued strong growth in tablet from industry growth and from the benefit of our Tablet Central work. We expect strong growth of Best Buy Mobile from significant device launches and the continued strength of our differentiated model. We also expect meaningful improvement in the gaming industry from a stronger lineup of software title releases and the progression in our pre-order and pre-owned capabilities. Our expectation for the second half has not assumed a significant improvement in the trends of 2 of our largest categories, TVs and notebooks, consistent with our outlook at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, another item that impacts full year total revenue is the inclusion of the 53rd week during the fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate that the 53rd week will favorably impact full year total revenue growth by approximately 1.5% to 2%. 
Moving onto gross profit rate expectation for the year which is the most significant driver in our updated outlook, the first half gross profit rate was down 50 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by targeted promotional activity to drive revenue, several non-recurring items in Q1 and the impact of new tech support services which temporarily lowered our margin rates. In the second half, we expect gross profit rate trend to improve, driven primarily by improved performance in mobile phones based on anticipated sales increases and solutions attached, improvements in gaming driven by stronger title releases and a higher mix of pre-owned gaming software and improved attach rates and solution sales in our mobile computing space. For the full year, we now expect that our gross profit rate will be modestly down. 
We have also lowered our annual spending profile and SG&A and now expect SG&A to be up 3% to 4% excluding FX or approximately 1% to 2%, excluding the impact of higher incentive comp and the 53rd week. The reduction in SG&A growth reflects lower discretionary and project spending as we prudently manage our spending in this environment, striking an important balance of pushing forward on the possible growth areas while managing our spending into more uncertain near term. 
So rolling it all up, we anticipate the total operating income dollars for the year will be in the range of a 5% decline to 2% growth, reflecting the impact of lower expected gross profit rate partially mitigated by lower SG&A spend. 
We are updating our annual EPS guidance range to $3.35 to $3.65. For clarity, this range now includes the impact of $1.5 billion of expected share repurchases for this fiscal year or approximately $0.20 to $0.25 depending upon where earnings finalize for the year. As a reminder, our original fiscal 2012 EPS guidance of $3.30 to $3.55 excluded fiscal '12 share repurchases. 
So in closing, while we expected to see continued volatility in consumer behavior in the second half of the year given the uncertainties in the macro, we continue to be fluid and purposeful with our plans and will follow customers where they need us to go. We will focus our resources on driving the profitable strategic growth opportunities we see in the business. We are confident that our unique combination of multichannel assets, service capabilities and strong financial foundation coupled with our biggest differentiator, our outstanding people, puts us in a position to drive shareholder returns over time. 
So with that, Alicia, we are ready for questions."

I'd be happy to talk a little bit more about the components under our International segment performance. You rightly pointed out that our operating profit in Q1 in International increased significantly year-over-year. When you would take a look at what happened in Q2, we saw many of the same trends and improved operating profits that we saw in Q1 actually happened in Q2 as well. The primary difference in our operating income performance in Q2 for International was driven by the result in our European business. When I look at the performance of our business in Canada, Five Star and Mexico coupled with the restructuring activities we did in Turkey and China, our profits actually increased pretty dramatically in the International segment. Europe profits were actually down significantly in Q2 after being up in Q1, primarily driven by 2 factors. Very difficult macro environments in consumer spending in Europe similar to what we've seen in other parts of the world. Quite frankly, that environment is more difficult than what we're experiencing in the U.S. market from a consumer standpoint. The other thing not to be underestimated and that is the commentary that both Brian and I provided on what's going on with mobile phone connections in Europe specifically in the U.K.. About 1.5 years ago, the carriers in that market switched from 18-month contracts for customers to 24-month contracts. We are now in the middle of that low period were typically we would have more contracts that are coming up for renewal that aren't available for the marketplace to basically upgrade those customers. So we'll start to see that later towards the tail end of this year but a combination of the macro environment in Europe and that significant change in contract terms that kind of being in that value right now is what's driving our European operating profit down."

And what we've seen also is as we've been more aggressive on our pricing in categories that do well online like digital imaging and MP3, our aggressive price actions there have really paid off. We're going to continue that as we move to the second half and we expect the second half to be as competitive as it did in the past years and the situation that we're seeing today. As far as labor is concerned, when Jim talked about the SG&A changes that we've been making, we've been very point-ful to not be making any material reductions in our store labor. In fact, just the opposite. We're making investments in our store labor areas by having key labor investments in our gaming area, in our computer, in tablet area, in Best Buy Mobile. All the places where we're seeing the growth, that's where we're putting our labor there. And as far as our inventory is concerned, we've made very good progress in reducing our inventory and getting it in line with what our expectations are on our days of supply and our inventory position both at the end of each of the next 2 quarters would be commensurate with the days of supply we'd expect for those periods in time."

You correctly pointed out that the model that we have launched within Best Buy and the roughly 10 stores that we had there wasn't giving the type of benefit that we had expected. We certainly think that there's opportunities that remain in China under some type of Best Buy branded business. But the reason we started to test there in the first place is to figure out where we could provide a meaningful level of differentiation over time that makes a sense for the current customer there. So we haven't given up on Best Buy in China. As a matter of fact, we think we have other opportunities there. But we are absolutely focused on growing the opportunity that we have right in front of us in the profitable Five Star business in the here and now. In Europe specifically, as I look at the run rate change of operating profit, Q1 to Q2, the biggest driver of that performance is not the big box performance, it's actually the performance of our roughly 2,400 small box stores driven by once again the macro environment and the carrier contract changes we talked about. As we launched those big box stores in the U.K., we purposely said we want to test to see how that value proposition works with customers. We certainly as has the rest of the market had been met with a very challenging macro setup in that space and we certainly like all of our tests, we continue to evaluate what makes the most sense in that marketplace from a multichannel approach. And quite candidly, we need to make sure, as we do on all of our businesses both domestically and internationally, that each of those businesses earn this right to future capital in the space. So things we know for sure. We know for sure that our teams in the U.K. have done a great job of landing a model in that place where customers recognize the value that a service environment provides and a customer experience that's differentiated. We're very pleased with what our team had landed there from a customer and service perspective. We haven't come to a conclusion yet on what the long-term model should look like for multichannel and big box but, David, we absolutely look at it all the time and think about the best bets that we make to grow the portfolio profitably over time."

If the trend from the second quarter continued, which we don't -- we're not planning that it will, it would have lower gross margin rate than what we outlined in the outlook. What I tried to laid out in the commentary and through the follow-up on Q&A, the key things that we see influencing the run rate of gross profit in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half of the year is really that increased sales mix of mobile phones, higher mix of gaming titles given industry trends and the things that we've done from a pre-order and a new gaming business which carries higher margin in our portfolio. And specifically, what we're doing around utilizing that labor attachment that Mike -- that labor investment that Mike Vitelli talked about to improve our attachment rate, solution sales both in mobile phones, gaming and in our computing business overall. We'll see how the mix of sales pans out in the back half of the year with customers. But I'd also remind you that our margin rate comparison gets much easier in the back half of the year than what we saw in the first half of the year as well. So a combination of those factors domestically. Internationally, the biggest change in the expected gross profit rate is really coming from the European business as more of those available upgrades become available. We're going to start to hit the end of that window of the value of the 18 to 24-month cycle. We'll see the margins in the U.K. business improve as well. That will be a different phenomenon than what we saw in the first half."

My comments this morning will focus on our second quarter performance, how we're progressing on our strategic priorities and how we see the rest of the year playing out. But before I jump into my comments on the quarter, I would like to thank our employees for another quarter of outstanding effort in bringing the Connected World to life for our customers across all of our channels and geographies. I'm especially proud of the way our teams in London pulled together to ensure the safety of their employees and customers during the riots in London last month and how our U.S. employees helped their communities and each other through the extreme difficulties of Hurricane Irene and the recent battering of the East Coast. We continue to execute on our strategy in times of challenge and continue to see opportunity. We're responding to the needs of our customers in each segment and channel where we conduct business. 
Before I turn it over to Jim for more specific details, I want to put our results and outlook in the context of our overall business strategy. As you know, our strategy is to drive the 3 elements: one, our financial strength and flexibility; two, a unique multichannel approach that allows us to connect wherever and whenever people shop; and three, optimizing our scale to drive growth through new categories, new store formats and share gains in key categories. 
Let's begin our look at the financial strength that is enabling us to continue to invest and return value to our shareholders. Looking at the big picture worldwide, we're still facing an uncertain macro environment with volatile consumer shopping behavior, and this was evident in our results for the second quarter. Despite that, we generated significantly more cash in Q2 and ended the quarter with more than $2 billion of cash on hand. Our free cash flow was $1.1 billion in the first half. This has helped us to continue to fuel our share repurchase strategy and we were on target -- we are on target to buy back approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. We remain disciplined in our use of capital while continuing to invest for growth geographically, by channel and by category.
Geographically, in China, we are continuing our rapid rollout of Five Star stores. We added 7 more stores in the second quarter, taking us to a total of 178. In addition, Five Star's continuing operations were once again a highlight of the quarter, delivering 7% comps and increased margins. In Canada, where we are facing a challenging economic environment very similar to that of the U.S., the team did a great job of delivering solid gross margin rate improvement. And we continue to see solid performance in Mexico. While the contributions of our Mexican operations are still relatively small within the context of our enterprise, we are pleased with the growth in revenue and gross profit rate the team posted this quarter. Our performance in Europe reflected the challenging economic situation and the resulting effect on consumer spending. 
In our Domestic segment, we've made solid progress on the strategic initiatives we introduced earlier this year while prudently managing our business. Beginning with our channels, last week we launched the Best Buy Marketplace. That allows third-party sellers to offer thousands of additional products through BestBuy.com and enables us to expand our range of assortments, price points and brands. Marketplace is one step in our plan to double our domestic online revenue in the next 3 to 5 years. 
Also under the heading of channels, we continue to invest in expanding the portfolio in our Services business, which delivered its third consecutive quarter of positive comps, including more than 3% in Q2. I'll provide more detail shortly on both of these multichannel initiatives that will help us drive revenue and margin in the future. 
By category, we are continuing to see positive momentum from our investments in the 2 hottest consumer electronics products: tablets and mobile phones. The rapid growth in tablets was the primary catalyst that drove the strong momentum in mobile computing during the quarter. iPad sales were strong in the quarter as we expected, but sales of Android devices also were solid and better than we expected. Going forward, we continue to be bullish on the growth of this new computing form factor and are encouraged by the new models in the pipeline over the next several months that will offer our customers even more choice, both online and in stores. We believe Tablet Central, fueled by smart friendly Blue Shirts that will help customers select a device with the right operating system, accessories and connections to get the most of their purchase, has positioned us well to capitalize on the momentum this new product category is bringing the industry.
The mobile phone industry was facing difficult comparisons, with no major phone launches in the second quarter compared with several new models in the summer of 2010. While the lack of traffic driving launches led to a year-over-year decline in comps, our mobile teams were able to overcome the industry's situation and deliver share growth. With the product cycle shifting from summer to fall, we expect several iconic devices to hit the market in the back half and drive customers into our stores and online as they look to upgrade their phones. And we're ready for that expected uptick as we continued to invest to expand our points of presence by adding 25 mobile standalone stores across the country in Q2, bringing our total to 222 to complement with the mobile stores already located in our 1,100 big box stores and our online mobile presence. Our mobile expansion strategy is just one example of our second strategic imperative, our multichannel business model. 
The TV industry continues to be challenged and our TV comps in Q2 were down low double digits. However, we continue to progress well on our strategy to drive sales of larger screen TVs. Jim will provide more detail on this category in his remarks.
The second strategic imperative I mentioned earlier is our multichannel approach to serving customer needs. As you know, we intend to double our Domestic online business in the next 3 to 5 years. While we're pleased with the continued double-digit revenue growth we've been seeing, we're even more pleased with the new digital capabilities we're deploying, unique tools, platforms and promotional strategies that capitalize on the evolving shopping habits and expectations of today's tech-savvy multichannel customers. 
Earlier, I mentioned the launch last week of Best Buy Marketplace. It's good for our customers, who get access to a broader, deeper pool of products. It's good for our partners, who are able to leverage the power of our brand in the 800 million visits a year to our e-commerce site. And it's great for us. We expand our online assortment, drive incremental traffic and revenue, and create opportunities to attach additional products and services. Best Buy receives a percentage commission on each Marketplace sale, incremental income that falls to the bottom line. This is an element of our multichannel strategy that provides us with the ability to grow margin, revenue and/or share, depending on the channel. We will continue to update you on the progress of Marketplace in the quarters to come.
We are also creating new innovative digital marketing strategies. Our recently launched Deal of the Day program is one example. Deal of the Day is a promotion we have on BestBuy.com in which customers sign up to be notified of a great new deal via e-mail, text or by visiting the site on a specific product each day. The objectives of the program are to drive additional traffic and new customers to BestBuy.com, improve conversion and also to add to our database of customers with whom we regularly communicate. We have also significantly enhanced our own online assortment to the tune of 20,000 new online SKUs this fiscal year.
Finally, customers continue to value the option of picking up their online order in stores. In the second quarter, in-store pickup accounted for over 40% of our domestic online sales volume, up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. 
These multichannel initiatives are critical in helping us grow in new categories, gain share in existing categories and develop new store formats aimed at helping us differentiate our business and optimize sales to drive growth.
That leads me to the third element of our strategy that I discussed at the front end: optimizing our scale to drive growth. One of our greatest differentiators and one which offers both revenue and margin growth opportunities is our Services business. We've committed to expanding our Services portfolio and I'll provide just a few high-level examples of work we've done to test the growth of the model. 
We've expanded our new Geek Squad Tech Support program which offers customers 1 or 2 years of comprehensive computer service via remote chat session, a store visit, phone call or e-mail, a true example of a multichannel value proposition. Even though it's been available for a fairly short period, our attach rate has been significantly better than we expected. This program creates connections with our customers that extend well beyond the initial purchase. We provide help with their product regardless of where they purchased it in whatever way is most convenient to them. 
Our Buy Back Program, which was launched at the beginning of the year, has resonated well, especially with our mobile phone customers. 
Appliances is another category where we're using our considerable size and scale to deliver growth. This category had its third quarter in a row of positive comps, a particularly impressive performance by our team as we were up against difficult comparisons from last year. We're very pleased with the continued strong performance and market share gains in the category, which we believe provide a long runway of growth for Best Buy.
Next, gaming. Gaming is an area of significant opportunity for us. We have completed the physical and operational transformation of the gaming departments throughout our stores and are pleased with our progress in trade-in volume and pre-order volume. One data point that illustrates the momentum we've had in gaming, our Reward Zone Gamer's Club membership grew 25% in the last year and now totals 2.6 million members. This number is very important as we build our base of core gamer customers, who are the most active purchasers of both new and pre-owned titles. The gaming industry experienced softness in the first half of this year due to a lack of new titles and this impacted our results in the second quarter. While there is a stream of new titles coming in the months ahead, it remains unclear where the customer will choose to spend. Regardless of the state of the industry, however, we are confident we have the people and promotions to continue growing share and making progress in this category. 
As I mentioned earlier, we knew this year was going to be a volatile and uncertain consumer environment. While we have updated our outlook for the year, we continue to believe in our multichannel approach and are cautiously optimistic about the back half for a number of reasons. We are taking action to invest in areas where we believe we can grow returns and where customers expect and need us to be. As we see more examples of what connections can do for consumers, we become increasingly convinced of the strength of our multichannel position in the areas where we plan to win. 
We also believe there is a lot to be excited about this upcoming holiday. I'll provide a brief, high-level rundown of what's coming. We see tremendous opportunity for Best Buy Mobile and expect several iconic products to be launched in the next few weeks and months. We are on track to deliver our annual target of 10 million total connections in our Domestic segment. We expect tablets will be big and believe BestBuy.com and Tablet Central will continue to be the destination for tablet choice. As I noted earlier, we believe we are well positioned for the new title releases in the gaming category, and we're introducing compelling offers across all of our product categories and channels that we believe will continue to add value for our customers. 
Our strategic approach remains clear and the fundamentals of our business are strong. Our multichannel advantages, including the progress we're making in digital platforms and promotions, differentiate us from competitors. We offer competitive pricing, selection and services for customers. And we remain disciplined in our use of capital and we're a financially strong, cash-generative business. And we continue to ensure we are prudently managing our costs. That financial strength and the differentiation of our multichannel business model are big assets for us in these uncertain economic times. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Jim."

Today, I'd like to cover the financial highlights of our second quarter results and provide you with a progress update on several of our key initiatives for the year. I will also discuss some of the background around the changes we announced to our annual EPS outlook this morning based on what we have observed so far this year. 
Earlier, Brian touched on what we are seeing in the macro environment and its dampening impact on consumer spending and the CE industry. Together, we have seen this play out through the first half in various industry data points as well as in the commentary of some of our vendor partners and competitors. Viewed in the context of these current macro and industry headwinds, our business faired comparatively well. But still, our Q2 results were below our original expectations. With this as important context, our second quarter revenue came in about flat to last year. The favorable impact of foreign currency and new store growth were offset by a comparable store sales decline of 2.8%. 
In the Domestic segment, sales declined 1.5% and comparable store sales were down 2.7%. These results were relatively consistent with the sales trends we experienced in the first quarter of the year. The biggest positive drivers in the Domestic comp included tablets, appliances and e-readers. 
Total mobile computing had strong comparable store sales growth of 9% in the quarter. The growth was driven by a very strong tablet sales supported by the benefits of implementing our Tablet Central model, which leverages a broad assortment of devices side by side with dedicated expert labor. Also in computing, it's worth noting that traditional notebook comp trends, while still negative, improved again during the quarter. 
Appliances continued its momentum with strong comp sales of 12% on top of positive comps in the prior year. We believe the benefits of both the operational changes we made in the appliance area and improved competitive offers have helped us grow market share on this business. 
Another product category worth noting is e-readers, which once again delivered triple-digit comps and had a meaningful impact on the total Domestic segment. These products, along with mobile phones and tablets, highlight the continuing consumer appetite for mobile technologies and the revenue growth that can be derived by bringing the complete mobile experience together, along with a broad assortment of products and employees who can provide advice to help customers select the best solution for their individual needs. 
Let's also spend a moment on the performance of the Best Buy Mobile business in Q2. As noted in the release this morning, mobile phone sales performance in Q2 decelerated from the strong growth trends experienced in the recent quarters due to shifting product cycles of new handset launches by vendors. Specifically, Q2 lacked the type of significant device launches like iPhone 4 and the HTC EVO that were a major catalyst during Q2 in the prior year. Putting our sales into context compared to the broader mobile phone industry, we estimate that we continued to gain significant share during the quarter compared to last year. 
As we've discussed before, in Best Buy Mobile the sales comp only tells part of the financial story. While the timing shift of major smartphone launches adversely impacted ASPs and postpaid connection volumes, our overall connection volumes in Best Buy Mobile continued to grow during Q2, driven by strong growth in prepaid phones and additional Best Buy Mobile standalone store locations. As Brian discussed, we anticipate a stronger lineup of new handsets in the second half and continue to expect that this business will deliver its top line and profit goals for the year.
TV comps in Q2 finished down low double digits, a result similar to the previous 2 quarters and very much in line with overall industry trends. As you recall, we went into this year with the expectation that the TV business would be soft. But given what the industry experienced with last year and the continued macro headwinds, accordingly, we focused our plans this year on helping customers with their purchase decisions on larger screen sizes with more advanced features. So far this year, our sales mix of larger screen sizes had been growing with nearly 60% of our business coming from screen sizes 46 inches and up. This represented double-digit unit growth on large screens during the quarter. In serving the premium home theater enthusiasts, our Magnolia Home Theater business, which is in 385 of our U.S. stores, continues to perform very well and delivered mid-double-digit comparable store sales gains during the quarter. 
In our gaming business, we had planned for stronger sales performance in the quarter. We believe that the softness in gaming was driven by the lack of major software title launches during the period. We remain on track in delivering the enhanced capabilities to our customers via improvements in pre-order and pre-owned title capabilities coupled with additional labor investments we made in the space to help customers with their purchase decisions. 
Sales in our International segment increased approximately 5%, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency and new store growth, which offset a 3.2% comparable store sales decline. Our Five Star business in China continued its solid growth with a comparable store sales gain of 7%, which was on top of almost a 22% comp last year. We remain on track for 40 to 50 new Five Star openings this year in this important market for the future. Canada and Best Buy Europe experienced high and low single-digit comparable store sales declines, respectively.
Turning to gross profit. Second quarter gross profit dollars of $2.9 billion were down 2%. Within the Domestic segment, the gross profit rate declined 50 basis points on a difficult comparison to the previous year, when gross profit rate was up 150 basis points. This will be our most difficult comparison period of the year.
There were several factors that influenced the rate decline in Q2. Consistent with Q1, we continued to take competitive action to successfully drive revenue improvements in key categories like appliances, computing and gaming. Additionally, the new Geek Squad Tech Support service offering that Brian discussed earlier had a negative impact on our gross profit rate in the second quarter. Under this program, customers enter into an ongoing service relationship with us for 1 to 2 years. Accordingly, we recognize the revenue and profits over the life of the agreement. In the past, if a customer purchased a service product for assistance with a onetime repair, we recognized the profit at full at the time of the service. If this program continues to prove successful, we would expect the Tech Support membership sales to drive both increased margin dollars and improved rate over time. Partially offsetting the items that negatively impacted gross margin was rate strength in mobile phones, largely from increased sales of accessory and service solutions as well as handset mix.
Within the International segment, we had a 4% increase in gross profit dollars driven largely by FX. Overall, the International gross profit margin rate was 25.4%, a slight decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by a more promotional environment in the mobile phone business in Europe that's facing a backdrop of reduced upgrade volume in the industry, due to the migration of U.K. customers from 18-month to 24-month contracts which began taking place roughly 1.5 years ago. We are very pleased with the progress made by our businesses in Canada and Five Star to improve their gross margin rates in Q2. The rate improvement in Canada was driven by increased promotional effectiveness, operating model changes made by the business to focus on driving profitable sales and the growth in the mix of mobile phones. Five Star margins increased based on improved cost programs with vendors. 
Given the lower sales environment we experienced in the second quarter, we also took action to reduce expenses while maintaining focus on areas which will provide benefits in the second half and beyond. 
Excluding the impact of FX, total company SG&A increased 1% during the quarter. The modest increase year-over-year in SG&A spending was driven primarily by the addition of new stores and increased advertising, mostly offset by proactive adjustments to our spending profile during the quarter. For the first half of the year, total SG&A expense was essentially flat excluding FX.
Since we're talking about expenses, this is also a good opportunity to provide you with a quick update on the progress we have made with our initiative to reduce our Domestic big box square footage. As you will recall, we are making plans to evolve the operating model in our U.S. big box stores to better support the increased growth opportunities we see in connected businesses and to improve our overall experience for customers and employees. As a part of this work, we are planning to reduce our big box square footage by 10% over the next 3 to 5 years. Our test results so far in this space continue to indicate that a store prototype which combines the enhanced operating model with reduced space and lower operating cost has not materially lowered our sales volumes in these stores.
With almost 40% of our leases set to expire over the next 5 years, we have a significant opportunity to execute a portion of these planned space reductions at the natural end of the lease, which of course is very cost effective. Additionally, we are actively pursuing options to both sublease and return space to landlords where opportunities exist. By way of example, in FY '12, we estimate that in total that we will work with landlords on approximately 30 store locations. We currently expect to reduce space in well over 50% of these locations to achieve a total square footage reduction of 10% to 15% against this entire tranche of 30 stores. To be clear, we still have work to do with subleasing all of these sites to achieve the full financial benefit, but we continue to be encouraged by our discussions to date with prospective tenants. As these plans continue to develop, we look forward to updating you on our progress.
A few more items I wanted to touch on before discussing our guidance for the year. We have actively managed our inventory to lower balances from where we started the year. Domestic comp store inventories finished down 5% in the second quarter. In addition, our receivable positions and payables have also made good progress in returning to more normalized levels from where we finished fiscal 2011.
Free cash flow for the first half was very strong at $1.1 billion, up significantly from last year. As previously discussed, the biggest driver of the first half free cash flow increase was the reversal of year-end timing differences in several key working capital items. We believe we are still on track to hit our free cash flow target for the year of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The cash generation -- the cash generative nature of our business continues to be one of the key strengths of our model.
During the quarter, we also continued share repurchase activity. Total repurchases during the first half of the year totaled $863 million, which reflects 29.2 million shares or approximately 7% of our outstanding shares.
Looking back at the first half of the year, while the environment remained challenging, we feel good about the solid progress we have made on our key growth initiatives. We will continue to invest and push forward on these opportunities for profitable growth and improve shareholder returns.
Our outlook for the year has evolved, based on what we have seen so far from both the consumer and in the profile of our margins year-to-date. Based on these factors and our expectations for the balance of the year, we have modified our full year earnings expectations. We continue to expect full year revenue in the range of $51 billion to $52.5 billion, with full year comps of flat to down 3%. Specifically, in the second half, we're expecting continued strong growth in tablets from industry growth and from the benefits of our Tablet Central work. We expect strong growth of Best Buy Mobile from significant device launches and the continued strength of our differentiated model. We also expect meaningful improvement in the gaming industry from a stronger lineup of software title releases and the progression in our pre-order and pre-owned capabilities. Our expectation for the second half has not assumed a significant improvement in the trends of 2 of our largest categories, TVs and notebooks, consistent with our outlook at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, another item that impacts full year total revenue is the inclusion of the 53rd week during the fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate that the 53rd week will favorably impact full year total revenue growth by approximately 1.5% to 2%. 
Moving onto gross profit rate expectation for the year, which is the most significant driver in our updated outlook, the first half gross profit rate was down 50 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by targeted promotional activity to drive revenue, several nonrecurring items in Q1 and the impact of new tech support services which temporarily lowered our margin rates. In the second half, we expect gross profit rate trend to improve, driven primarily by improved performance in mobile phones based on anticipated sales increases and solutions attach, improvements in gaming driven by stronger title releases and a higher mix of pre-owned gaming software, and improved attach rates and solution sales in our mobile computing space. For the full year, we now expect that our gross profit rate will be modestly down. 
We have also lowered our annual spending profile in SG&A and now expect SG&A to be up 3% to 4% excluding FX, or approximately 1% to 2% excluding the impact of higher incentive comp and the 53rd week. The reduction in SG&A growth reflects lower discretionary and project spending as we prudently manage our spending in this environment, striking an important balance of pushing forward on the profitable growth areas while managing our spending in the more uncertain near term. 
So rolling it all up, we anticipate that total operating income dollars for the year will be in the range of a 5% decline to 2% growth, reflecting the impact of lower expected gross profit rate partially mitigated by lower SG&A spend. 
We are updating our annual EPS guidance range to $3.35 to $3.65. For clarity, this range now includes the impact of $1.5 billion of expected share repurchases for this fiscal year, or approximately $0.20 to $0.25, depending upon where earnings finalize for the year. As a reminder, our original fiscal 2012 EPS guidance of $3.30 to $3.55 excluded fiscal '12 share repurchases. 
So in closing, while we expect to see continued volatility in consumer behavior in the second half of the year given the uncertainties in the macro, we continue to be fluid and purposeful with our plans and will follow customers where they need us to go. We will focus our resources on driving the profitable strategic growth opportunities we see in the business. We are confident that our unique combination of multichannel assets, service capabilities and strong financial foundation, coupled with our biggest differentiator, our outstanding people, puts us in a position to drive shareholder returns over time. 
So with that, Alicia, we are ready for questions."

But I guess it looked like in terms of an operating profit growth that it took a turn for the worse relative to Q1, where you did show nice improvement, and it seemed like it was SG&A dollars embedded in there. I'm wondering if you could just provide a little more discussion around what happened in International and if things changed within the last 6 months, or if you would anticipate that becomes more of a operating profit driver going forward here in the back half of the year."

I'd be happy to talk a little bit more about the components under our International segment performance. You rightly point out that our operating profits in Q1 in International increased significantly year-over-year. When you would take a look at what happened in Q2, we saw many of the same trends and improved operating profits that we saw in Q1 actually happen in Q2 as well. The primary difference in our operating income performance in Q2 for International was driven by the result in our European business. When I look at the performance of our business in Canada, Five Star and Mexico, coupled with the restructuring activities we did in Turkey and China, our profits actually increased pretty dramatically in the International segment. Europe profits were actually down significantly in Q2 after being up in Q1, primarily driven by 2 factors. Very difficult macro environments in consumer spending in Europe similar to what we've seen in other parts of the world. Quite frankly, that environment is more difficult than what we're experiencing in the U.S. market from a consumer standpoint. The other thing not to be underestimated, and that is the commentary that both Brian and I provided on what's going on with mobile phone connections in Europe, specifically in the U.K. About 1.5 years ago, the carriers in that market switched from 18-month contracts for customers to 24-month contracts. We are now in the middle of that lull period were typically we would have more contracts that are coming up for renewal that aren't available for the marketplace to basically upgrade those customers. So we'll start to see that later towards the tail end of this year, but a combination of the macro environment in Europe and that significant change in contract terms and kind of being in that valley right now is what's driving our European operating profit down."

We're going to continue that as we move to the second half and we expect the second half to be as competitive as it did in the past years and the situation that we're seeing today. As far as labor is concerned, when Jim talked about the SG&A changes that we've been making, we've been very point-ful to not be making any material reductions in our store labor. In fact, just the opposite. We're making investments in our store labor areas by having key labor investments in our gaming area, in our computer, in tablet area, in Best Buy Mobile. All the places where we're seeing the growth, that's where we're putting our labor there. And as far as our inventory is concerned, we've made very good progress in reducing our inventory and getting it in line with what our expectations are on our days of supply, and our inventory positions both at the end of each of the next 2 quarters would be commensurate with the days of supply we'd expect for those periods in time."

I'm happy to, David. So the first -- maybe a little more context on China. You correctly point out that the model that we had launched within Best Buy and the roughly 10 stores we had there wasn't giving the type of benefit that we had expected. We certainly think that there's opportunities that remain in China under some type of Best Buy-branded business. But the reason we started a test there in the first place is to figure out where we could provide a meaningful level of differentiation over time that makes a sense for the current customer there. So we haven't given up on Best Buy in China. As a matter of fact, we think we have other opportunities there. But we are absolutely focused on growing the opportunity that we have right in front of us in the profitable Five Star business in the here and now. In Europe specifically, as I look at the run rate change of operating profits, Q1 to Q2, the biggest driver of that performance is not the big box performance. It's actually the performance of our roughly 2,400 small box stores, driven by once again the macro environment and the carrier contract changes we talked about. As we launched those big box stores in the U.K., we purposely said we want to test to see how that value proposition works with customers. We certainly, as has the rest of the market, have been met with a very challenging macro setup in that space and we certainly -- like all of our tests, we continue to evaluate what makes the most sense in that marketplace from a multichannel approach. And quite candidly, we need to make sure, as we do in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally, that each of those businesses earn its right to future capital in the space. So things we know for sure. We know for sure that our teams in the U.K. have done a great job of landing a model in that place where customers recognize the value that a service environment provides and a customer experience that's differentiated. We're very pleased with what our teams had landed there from a customer and a service perspective. We haven't come to a conclusion yet on what the long-term model should look like for multichannel and big box but, David, we absolutely look at it all the time and think about the best bets that we make to grow the portfolio profitably over time."

We improved our share in that period as we're beginning to have a more compelling offer both with the ability to do pre-owned -- pre-order, rather, and do trade-in and start to sell pre-owned. Pre-owned itself was relatively modest in the first half in the second quarter. What's happening now is we are beginning to do trade-ins.

If the trend from the second quarter continued, which we don't -- we're not planning that it will, it would have lower gross margin rate than what we outlined in the outlook. What I tried to laid out in the commentary and through the follow-up on Q&A, the key things that we see influencing the run rate of gross profit in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half of the year is really that increased sales mix of mobile phones, higher mix of gaming titles given industry trends and the things that we've done from a pre-order and a used-gaming business, which carries higher margin in our portfolio. And specific things that we're doing around utilizing that labor attachment that Mike -- that labor investment that Mike Vitelli talked about to improve our attachment rates of solution sales both in mobile phones, gaming and in our computing business overall. We'll see how the mix of sales pans out in the back half of the year with customers. But I'd also remind you that our margin rate comparisons get much easier in the back half of the year than what we saw in the first half of the year as well. So a combination of those factors domestically. Internationally, the biggest change in the expected gross profit rate is really coming from the European business as more of those available upgrades become available. We're going to start to hit the end of that window of the valley of the 18 to 24-month cycle. We'll see the margins in the U.K. business improve as well. That will be a different phenomenon than what we saw in the first half."

My comments this morning will focus on our second quarter performance, how we're progressing on our strategic priorities and how we see the rest of the year playing out. But before I jump into my comments on the quarter, I would like to thank our employees for another quarter of outstanding effort in bringing the Connected World to life for our customers across all of our channels and geographies. I'm especially proud of the way our teams in London pulled together to ensure the safety of their employees and customers during the riots in London last month and how our U.S. employees helped their communities and each other through the extreme difficulties of Hurricane Irene and the recent battering of the East Coast. We continue to execute on our strategy in times of challenge and continue to see opportunity. We're responding to the needs of our customers in each segment and channel where we conduct business. 
Before I turn it over to Jim for more specific details, I want to put our results and outlook in the context of our overall business strategy. As you know, our strategy is to drive the 3 elements: one, our financial strength and flexibility; two, a unique multichannel approach that allows us to connect wherever and whenever people shop; and three, optimizing our scale to drive growth through new categories, new store formats and share gains in key categories. 
Let's begin our look at the financial strength that is enabling us to continue to invest and return value to our shareholders. Looking at the big picture worldwide, we're still facing an uncertain macro environment with volatile consumer shopping behavior, and this was evident in our results for the second quarter. Despite that, we generated significantly more cash in Q2 and ended the quarter with more than $2 billion of cash on hand. Our free cash flow was $1.1 billion in the first half. This has helped us to continue to fuel our share repurchase strategy and we were on target -- we are on target to buy back approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. We remain disciplined in our use of capital while continuing to invest for growth geographically, by channel and by category.
Geographically, in China, we are continuing our rapid rollout of Five Star stores. We added 7 more stores in the second quarter, taking us to a total of 178. In addition, Five Star's continuing operations were once again a highlight of the quarter, delivering 7% comps and increased margins. In Canada, where we are facing a challenging economic environment very similar to that of the U.S., the team did a great job of delivering solid gross margin rate improvement. And we continue to see solid performance in Mexico. While the contributions of our Mexican operations are still relatively small within the context of our enterprise, we are pleased with the growth in revenue and gross profit rate the team posted this quarter. Our performance in Europe reflected the challenging economic situation and the resulting effect on consumer spending. 
In our Domestic segment, we've made solid progress on the strategic initiatives we introduced earlier this year while prudently managing our business. Beginning with our channels, last week we launched the Best Buy Marketplace. That allows third-party sellers to offer thousands of additional products through BestBuy.com and enables us to expand our range of assortments, price points and brands. Marketplace is one step in our plan to double our domestic online revenue in the next 3 to 5 years. 
Also under the heading of channels, we continue to invest in expanding the portfolio in our Services business, which delivered its third consecutive quarter of positive comps, including more than 3% in Q2. I'll provide more detail shortly on both of these multichannel initiatives that will help us drive revenue and margin in the future. 
By category, we are continuing to see positive momentum from our investments in the 2 hottest consumer electronics products: tablets and mobile phones. The rapid growth in tablets was the primary catalyst that drove the strong momentum in mobile computing during the quarter. iPad sales were strong in the quarter as we expected, but sales of Android devices also were solid and better than we expected. Going forward, we continue to be bullish on the growth of this new computing form factor and are encouraged by the new models in the pipeline over the next several months that will offer our customers even more choice, both online and in stores. We believe Tablet Central, fueled by smart friendly Blue Shirts that will help customers select a device with the right operating system, accessories and connections to get the most of their purchase, has positioned us well to capitalize on the momentum this new product category is bringing the industry.
The mobile phone industry was facing difficult comparisons, with no major phone launches in the second quarter compared with several new models in the summer of 2010. While the lack of traffic driving launches led to a year-over-year decline in comps, our mobile teams were able to overcome the industry's situation and deliver share growth. With the product cycle shifting from summer to fall, we expect several iconic devices to hit the market in the back half and drive customers into our stores and online as they look to upgrade their phones. And we're ready for that expected uptick as we continued to invest to expand our points of presence by adding 25 mobile standalone stores across the country in Q2, bringing our total to 222 to complement with the mobile stores already located in our 1,100 big box stores and our online mobile presence. Our mobile expansion strategy is just one example of our second strategic imperative, our multichannel business model. 
The TV industry continues to be challenged and our TV comps in Q2 were down low double digits. However, we continue to progress well on our strategy to drive sales of larger screen TVs. Jim will provide more detail on this category in his remarks.
The second strategic imperative I mentioned earlier is our multichannel approach to serving customer needs. As you know, we intend to double our Domestic online business in the next 3 to 5 years. While we're pleased with the continued double-digit revenue growth we've been seeing, we're even more pleased with the new digital capabilities we're deploying, unique tools, platforms and promotional strategies that capitalize on the evolving shopping habits and expectations of today's tech-savvy multichannel customers. 
Earlier, I mentioned the launch last week of Best Buy Marketplace. It's good for our customers, who get access to a broader, deeper pool of products. It's good for our partners, who are able to leverage the power of our brand in the 800 million visits a year to our e-commerce site. And it's great for us. We expand our online assortment, drive incremental traffic and revenue, and create opportunities to attach additional products and services. Best Buy receives a percentage commission on each Marketplace sale, incremental income that falls to the bottom line. This is an element of our multichannel strategy that provides us with the ability to grow margin, revenue and/or share, depending on the channel. We will continue to update you on the progress of Marketplace in the quarters to come.
We are also creating new innovative digital marketing strategies. Our recently launched Deal of the Day program is one example. Deal of the Day is a promotion we have on BestBuy.com in which customers sign up to be notified of a great new deal via e-mail, text or by visiting the site on a specific product each day. The objectives of the program are to drive additional traffic and new customers to BestBuy.com, improve conversion and also to add to our database of customers with whom we regularly communicate. We have also significantly enhanced our own online assortment to the tune of 20,000 new online SKUs this fiscal year.
Finally, customers continue to value the option of picking up their online order in stores. In the second quarter, in-store pickup accounted for over 40% of our domestic online sales volume, up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. 
These multichannel initiatives are critical in helping us grow in new categories, gain share in existing categories and develop new store formats aimed at helping us differentiate our business and optimize sales to drive growth.
That leads me to the third element of our strategy that I discussed at the front end: optimizing our scale to drive growth. One of our greatest differentiators and one which offers both revenue and margin growth opportunities is our Services business. We've committed to expanding our Services portfolio and I'll provide just a few high-level examples of work we've done to test the growth of the model. 
We've expanded our new Geek Squad Tech Support program which offers customers 1 or 2 years of comprehensive computer service via remote chat session, a store visit, phone call or e-mail, a true example of a multichannel value proposition. Even though it's been available for a fairly short period, our attach rate has been significantly better than we expected. This program creates connections with our customers that extend well beyond the initial purchase. We provide help with their product regardless of where they purchased it in whatever way is most convenient to them. 
Our Buy Back Program, which was launched at the beginning of the year, has resonated well, especially with our mobile phone customers. 
Appliances is another category where we're using our considerable size and scale to deliver growth. This category had its third quarter in a row of positive comps, a particularly impressive performance by our team as we were up against difficult comparisons from last year. We're very pleased with the continued strong performance and market share gains in the category, which we believe provide a long runway of growth for Best Buy.
Next, gaming. Gaming is an area of significant opportunity for us. We have completed the physical and operational transformation of the gaming departments throughout our stores and are pleased with our progress in trade-in volume and pre-order volume. One data point that illustrates the momentum we've had in gaming, our Reward Zone Gamer's Club membership grew 25% in the last year and now totals 2.6 million members. This number is very important as we build our base of core gamer customers, who are the most active purchasers of both new and pre-owned titles. The gaming industry experienced softness in the first half of this year due to a lack of new titles and this impacted our results in the second quarter. While there is a stream of new titles coming in the months ahead, it remains unclear where the customer will choose to spend. Regardless of the state of the industry, however, we are confident we have the people and promotions to continue growing share and making progress in this category. 
As I mentioned earlier, we knew this year was going to be a volatile and uncertain consumer environment. While we have updated our outlook for the year, we continue to believe in our multichannel approach and are cautiously optimistic about the back half for a number of reasons. We are taking action to invest in areas where we believe we can grow returns and where customers expect and need us to be. As we see more examples of what connections can do for consumers, we become increasingly convinced of the strength of our multichannel position in the areas where we plan to win. 
We also believe there is a lot to be excited about this upcoming holiday. I'll provide a brief, high-level rundown of what's coming. We see tremendous opportunity for Best Buy Mobile and expect several iconic products to be launched in the next few weeks and months. We are on track to deliver our annual target of 10 million total connections in our Domestic segment. We expect tablets will be big and believe BestBuy.com and Tablet Central will continue to be the destination for tablet choice. As I noted earlier, we believe we are well positioned for the new title releases in the gaming category, and we're introducing compelling offers across all of our product categories and channels that we believe will continue to add value for our customers. 
Our strategic approach remains clear and the fundamentals of our business are strong. Our multichannel advantages, including the progress we're making in digital platforms and promotions, differentiate us from competitors. We offer competitive pricing, selection and services for customers. And we remain disciplined in our use of capital and we're a financially strong, cash-generative business. And we continue to ensure we are prudently managing our costs. That financial strength and the differentiation of our multichannel business model are big assets for us in these uncertain economic times. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Jim."

Today, I'd like to cover the financial highlights of our second quarter results and provide you with a progress update on several of our key initiatives for the year. I will also discuss some of the background around the changes we announced to our annual EPS outlook this morning based on what we have observed so far this year. 
Earlier, Brian touched on what we are seeing in the macro environment and its dampening impact on consumer spending and the CE industry. Together, we have seen this play out through the first half in various industry data points as well as in the commentary of some of our vendor partners and competitors. Viewed in the context of these current macro and industry headwinds, our business faired comparatively well. But still, our Q2 results were below our original expectations. With this as important context, our second quarter revenue came in about flat to last year. The favorable impact of foreign currency and new store growth were offset by a comparable store sales decline of 2.8%. 
In the Domestic segment, sales declined 1.5% and comparable store sales were down 2.7%. These results were relatively consistent with the sales trends we experienced in the first quarter of the year. The biggest positive drivers in the Domestic comp included tablets, appliances and e-readers. 
Total mobile computing had strong comparable store sales growth of 9% in the quarter. The growth was driven by a very strong tablet sales supported by the benefits of implementing our Tablet Central model, which leverages a broad assortment of devices side by side with dedicated expert labor. Also in computing, it's worth noting that traditional notebook comp trends, while still negative, improved again during the quarter. 
Appliances continued its momentum with strong comp sales of 12% on top of positive comps in the prior year. We believe the benefits of both the operational changes we made in the appliance area and improved competitive offers have helped us grow market share on this business. 
Another product category worth noting is e-readers, which once again delivered triple-digit comps and had a meaningful impact on the total Domestic segment. These products, along with mobile phones and tablets, highlight the continuing consumer appetite for mobile technologies and the revenue growth that can be derived by bringing the complete mobile experience together, along with a broad assortment of products and employees who can provide advice to help customers select the best solution for their individual needs. 
Let's also spend a moment on the performance of the Best Buy Mobile business in Q2. As noted in the release this morning, mobile phone sales performance in Q2 decelerated from the strong growth trends experienced in the recent quarters due to shifting product cycles of new handset launches by vendors. Specifically, Q2 lacked the type of significant device launches like iPhone 4 and the HTC EVO that were a major catalyst during Q2 in the prior year. Putting our sales into context compared to the broader mobile phone industry, we estimate that we continued to gain significant share during the quarter compared to last year. 
As we've discussed before, in Best Buy Mobile the sales comp only tells part of the financial story. While the timing shift of major smartphone launches adversely impacted ASPs and postpaid connection volumes, our overall connection volumes in Best Buy Mobile continued to grow during Q2, driven by strong growth in prepaid phones and additional Best Buy Mobile standalone store locations. As Brian discussed, we anticipate a stronger lineup of new handsets in the second half and continue to expect that this business will deliver its top line and profit goals for the year.
TV comps in Q2 finished down low double digits, a result similar to the previous 2 quarters and very much in line with overall industry trends. As you recall, we went into this year with the expectation that the TV business would be soft. But given what the industry experienced with last year and the continued macro headwinds, accordingly, we focused our plans this year on helping customers with their purchase decisions on larger screen sizes with more advanced features. So far this year, our sales mix of larger screen sizes had been growing with nearly 60% of our business coming from screen sizes 46 inches and up. This represented double-digit unit growth on large screens during the quarter. In serving the premium home theater enthusiasts, our Magnolia Home Theater business, which is in 385 of our U.S. stores, continues to perform very well and delivered mid-double-digit comparable store sales gains during the quarter. 
In our gaming business, we had planned for stronger sales performance in the quarter. We believe that the softness in gaming was driven by the lack of major software title launches during the period. We remain on track in delivering the enhanced capabilities to our customers via improvements in pre-order and pre-owned title capabilities coupled with additional labor investments we made in the space to help customers with their purchase decisions. 
Sales in our International segment increased approximately 5%, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency and new store growth, which offset a 3.2% comparable store sales decline. Our Five Star business in China continued its solid growth with a comparable store sales gain of 7%, which was on top of almost a 22% comp last year. We remain on track for 40 to 50 new Five Star openings this year in this important market for the future. Canada and Best Buy Europe experienced high and low single-digit comparable store sales declines, respectively.
Turning to gross profit. Second quarter gross profit dollars of $2.9 billion were down 2%. Within the Domestic segment, the gross profit rate declined 50 basis points on a difficult comparison to the previous year, when gross profit rate was up 150 basis points. This will be our most difficult comparison period of the year.
There were several factors that influenced the rate decline in Q2. Consistent with Q1, we continued to take competitive action to successfully drive revenue improvements in key categories like appliances, computing and gaming. Additionally, the new Geek Squad Tech Support service offering that Brian discussed earlier had a negative impact on our gross profit rate in the second quarter. Under this program, customers enter into an ongoing service relationship with us for 1 to 2 years. Accordingly, we recognize the revenue and profits over the life of the agreement. In the past, if a customer purchased a service product for assistance with a onetime repair, we recognized the profit at full at the time of the service. If this program continues to prove successful, we would expect the Tech Support membership sales to drive both increased margin dollars and improved rate over time. Partially offsetting the items that negatively impacted gross margin was rate strength in mobile phones, largely from increased sales of accessory and service solutions as well as handset mix.
Within the International segment, we had a 4% increase in gross profit dollars driven largely by FX. Overall, the International gross profit margin rate was 25.4%, a slight decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by a more promotional environment in the mobile phone business in Europe that's facing a backdrop of reduced upgrade volume in the industry, due to the migration of U.K. customers from 18-month to 24-month contracts which began taking place roughly 1.5 years ago. We are very pleased with the progress made by our businesses in Canada and Five Star to improve their gross margin rates in Q2. The rate improvement in Canada was driven by increased promotional effectiveness, operating model changes made by the business to focus on driving profitable sales and the growth in the mix of mobile phones. Five Star margins increased based on improved cost programs with vendors. 
Given the lower sales environment we experienced in the second quarter, we also took action to reduce expenses while maintaining focus on areas which will provide benefits in the second half and beyond. 
Excluding the impact of FX, total company SG&A increased 1% during the quarter. The modest increase year-over-year in SG&A spending was driven primarily by the addition of new stores and increased advertising, mostly offset by proactive adjustments to our spending profile during the quarter. For the first half of the year, total SG&A expense was essentially flat excluding FX.
Since we're talking about expenses, this is also a good opportunity to provide you with a quick update on the progress we have made with our initiative to reduce our Domestic big box square footage. As you will recall, we are making plans to evolve the operating model in our U.S. big box stores to better support the increased growth opportunities we see in connected businesses and to improve our overall experience for customers and employees. As a part of this work, we are planning to reduce our big box square footage by 10% over the next 3 to 5 years. Our test results so far in this space continue to indicate that a store prototype which combines the enhanced operating model with reduced space and lower operating cost has not materially lowered our sales volumes in these stores.
With almost 40% of our leases set to expire over the next 5 years, we have a significant opportunity to execute a portion of these planned space reductions at the natural end of the lease, which of course is very cost effective. Additionally, we are actively pursuing options to both sublease and return space to landlords where opportunities exist. By way of example, in FY '12, we estimate that in total that we will work with landlords on approximately 30 store locations. We currently expect to reduce space in well over 50% of these locations to achieve a total square footage reduction of 10% to 15% against this entire tranche of 30 stores. To be clear, we still have work to do with subleasing all of these sites to achieve the full financial benefit, but we continue to be encouraged by our discussions to date with prospective tenants. As these plans continue to develop, we look forward to updating you on our progress.
A few more items I wanted to touch on before discussing our guidance for the year. We have actively managed our inventory to lower balances from where we started the year. Domestic comp store inventories finished down 5% in the second quarter. In addition, our receivable positions and payables have also made good progress in returning to more normalized levels from where we finished fiscal 2011.
Free cash flow for the first half was very strong at $1.1 billion, up significantly from last year. As previously discussed, the biggest driver of the first half free cash flow increase was the reversal of year-end timing differences in several key working capital items. We believe we are still on track to hit our free cash flow target for the year of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The cash generation -- the cash generative nature of our business continues to be one of the key strengths of our model.
During the quarter, we also continued share repurchase activity. Total repurchases during the first half of the year totaled $863 million, which reflects 29.2 million shares or approximately 7% of our outstanding shares.
Looking back at the first half of the year, while the environment remained challenging, we feel good about the solid progress we have made on our key growth initiatives. We will continue to invest and push forward on these opportunities for profitable growth and improve shareholder returns.
Our outlook for the year has evolved, based on what we have seen so far from both the consumer and in the profile of our margins year-to-date. Based on these factors and our expectations for the balance of the year, we have modified our full year earnings expectations. We continue to expect full year revenue in the range of $51 billion to $52.5 billion, with full year comps of flat to down 3%. Specifically, in the second half, we're expecting continued strong growth in tablets from industry growth and from the benefits of our Tablet Central work. We expect strong growth of Best Buy Mobile from significant device launches and the continued strength of our differentiated model. We also expect meaningful improvement in the gaming industry from a stronger lineup of software title releases and the progression in our pre-order and pre-owned capabilities. Our expectation for the second half has not assumed a significant improvement in the trends of 2 of our largest categories, TVs and notebooks, consistent with our outlook at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, another item that impacts full year total revenue is the inclusion of the 53rd week during the fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate that the 53rd week will favorably impact full year total revenue growth by approximately 1.5% to 2%. 
Moving onto gross profit rate expectation for the year, which is the most significant driver in our updated outlook, the first half gross profit rate was down 50 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by targeted promotional activity to drive revenue, several nonrecurring items in Q1 and the impact of new tech support services which temporarily lowered our margin rates. In the second half, we expect gross profit rate trend to improve, driven primarily by improved performance in mobile phones based on anticipated sales increases and solutions attach, improvements in gaming driven by stronger title releases and a higher mix of pre-owned gaming software, and improved attach rates and solution sales in our mobile computing space. For the full year, we now expect that our gross profit rate will be modestly down. 
We have also lowered our annual spending profile in SG&A and now expect SG&A to be up 3% to 4% excluding FX, or approximately 1% to 2% excluding the impact of higher incentive comp and the 53rd week. The reduction in SG&A growth reflects lower discretionary and project spending as we prudently manage our spending in this environment, striking an important balance of pushing forward on the profitable growth areas while managing our spending in the more uncertain near term. 
So rolling it all up, we anticipate that total operating income dollars for the year will be in the range of a 5% decline to 2% growth, reflecting the impact of lower expected gross profit rate partially mitigated by lower SG&A spend. 
We are updating our annual EPS guidance range to $3.35 to $3.65. For clarity, this range now includes the impact of $1.5 billion of expected share repurchases for this fiscal year, or approximately $0.20 to $0.25, depending upon where earnings finalize for the year. As a reminder, our original fiscal 2012 EPS guidance of $3.30 to $3.55 excluded fiscal '12 share repurchases. 
So in closing, while we expect to see continued volatility in consumer behavior in the second half of the year given the uncertainties in the macro, we continue to be fluid and purposeful with our plans and will follow customers where they need us to go. We will focus our resources on driving the profitable strategic growth opportunities we see in the business. We are confident that our unique combination of multichannel assets, service capabilities and strong financial foundation, coupled with our biggest differentiator, our outstanding people, puts us in a position to drive shareholder returns over time. 
So with that, Alicia, we are ready for questions."

I'd be happy to talk a little bit more about the components under our International segment performance. You rightly point out that our operating profits in Q1 in International increased significantly year-over-year. When you would take a look at what happened in Q2, we saw many of the same trends and improved operating profits that we saw in Q1 actually happen in Q2 as well. The primary difference in our operating income performance in Q2 for International was driven by the result in our European business. When I look at the performance of our business in Canada, Five Star and Mexico, coupled with the restructuring activities we did in Turkey and China, our profits actually increased pretty dramatically in the International segment. Europe profits were actually down significantly in Q2 after being up in Q1, primarily driven by 2 factors. Very difficult macro environments in consumer spending in Europe similar to what we've seen in other parts of the world. Quite frankly, that environment is more difficult than what we're experiencing in the U.S. market from a consumer standpoint. The other thing not to be underestimated, and that is the commentary that both Brian and I provided on what's going on with mobile phone connections in Europe, specifically in the U.K. About 1.5 years ago, the carriers in that market switched from 18-month contracts for customers to 24-month contracts. We are now in the middle of that lull period were typically we would have more contracts that are coming up for renewal that aren't available for the marketplace to basically upgrade those customers. So we'll start to see that later towards the tail end of this year, but a combination of the macro environment in Europe and that significant change in contract terms and kind of being in that valley right now is what's driving our European operating profit down."

We're going to continue that as we move to the second half and we expect the second half to be as competitive as it did in the past years and the situation that we're seeing today. As far as labor is concerned, when Jim talked about the SG&A changes that we've been making, we've been very point-ful to not be making any material reductions in our store labor. In fact, just the opposite. We're making investments in our store labor areas by having key labor investments in our gaming area, in our computer, in tablet area, in Best Buy Mobile. All the places where we're seeing the growth, that's where we're putting our labor there. And as far as our inventory is concerned, we've made very good progress in reducing our inventory and getting it in line with what our expectations are on our days of supply, and our inventory positions both at the end of each of the next 2 quarters would be commensurate with the days of supply we'd expect for those periods in time."

I'm happy to, David. So the first -- maybe a little more context on China. You correctly point out that the model that we had launched within Best Buy and the roughly 10 stores we had there wasn't giving the type of benefit that we had expected. We certainly think that there's opportunities that remain in China under some type of Best Buy-branded business. But the reason we started a test there in the first place is to figure out where we could provide a meaningful level of differentiation over time that makes a sense for the current customer there. So we haven't given up on Best Buy in China. As a matter of fact, we think we have other opportunities there. But we are absolutely focused on growing the opportunity that we have right in front of us in the profitable Five Star business in the here and now. In Europe specifically, as I look at the run rate change of operating profits, Q1 to Q2, the biggest driver of that performance is not the big box performance. It's actually the performance of our roughly 2,400 small box stores, driven by once again the macro environment and the carrier contract changes we talked about. As we launched those big box stores in the U.K., we purposely said we want to test to see how that value proposition works with customers. We certainly, as has the rest of the market, have been met with a very challenging macro setup in that space and we certainly -- like all of our tests, we continue to evaluate what makes the most sense in that marketplace from a multichannel approach. And quite candidly, we need to make sure, as we do in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally, that each of those businesses earn its right to future capital in the space. So things we know for sure. We know for sure that our teams in the U.K. have done a great job of landing a model in that place where customers recognize the value that a service environment provides and a customer experience that's differentiated. We're very pleased with what our teams had landed there from a customer and a service perspective. We haven't come to a conclusion yet on what the long-term model should look like for multichannel and big box but, David, we absolutely look at it all the time and think about the best bets that we make to grow the portfolio profitably over time."

It seems like the trend would be pretty steady going forward unless you expect to get a Kindle tablet or something like that."

That's where the industry were. We actually did better than the industry. We improved our share in that period as we're beginning to have a more compelling offer both with the ability to do pre-owned -- pre-order, rather, and do trade-in and start to sell pre-owned. Pre-owned itself was relatively modest in the first half in the second quarter. What's happening now is we are beginning to do trade-ins. We're doing that successfully by having a really compelling offer on our price points of what we offer for trade-in, that we're starting to build that inventory that will allow us to have those sales in the second half. And the ability to pre-order on new iconic games is going to be impactful. So that's what we see gaming being very different for us in the second half as well as the industry being different, as it has a lot of new releases in the second half. On the tablet question, what we're looking for is continued triple-digit growth that we're seeing there as both the existing products, one that you named and additional products, come to market in the second half. And this has proven to be a very strong second half and holiday item. And that's part of our plan that we have for this year. We're seeing that with -- being one of the places, we have the most tablets that you can see both in our stores and a significant online-only set of SKUs as well. So we're the place where the operating systems come out from different people in the space. We're going to be a great place to be."

If the trend from the second quarter continued, which we don't -- we're not planning that it will, it would have lower gross margin rate than what we outlined in the outlook. What I tried to laid out in the commentary and through the follow-up on Q&A, the key things that we see influencing the run rate of gross profit in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half of the year is really that increased sales mix of mobile phones, higher mix of gaming titles given industry trends and the things that we've done from a pre-order and a used-gaming business, which carries higher margin in our portfolio. And specific things that we're doing around utilizing that labor attachment that Mike -- that labor investment that Mike Vitelli talked about to improve our attachment rates of solution sales both in mobile phones, gaming and in our computing business overall. We'll see how the mix of sales pans out in the back half of the year with customers. But I'd also remind you that our margin rate comparisons get much easier in the back half of the year than what we saw in the first half of the year as well. So a combination of those factors domestically. Internationally, the biggest change in the expected gross profit rate is really coming from the European business as more of those available upgrades become available. We're going to start to hit the end of that window of the valley of the 18 to 24-month cycle. We'll see the margins in the U.K. business improve as well.

My comments this morning will focus on our third quarter performance and what we have seen at this early stage in this holiday season.",1699,"Good morning, everyone, and happy holidays, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings conference call. My comments this morning will focus on our third quarter performance and what we have seen at this early stage in this holiday season. First, I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their world-class execution this quarter. I am especially proud of their extraordinary efforts and serving our customers during Black Friday weekend.
For me, the key takeaways of the quarter were we took the size of actions to drive our business, specifically in revenue and market share, both in-store and aggressively online. These actions, while negatively impacting gross margin, significantly resonated with customers and resulted in improved traffic and comp sales, including a significant increase in our online growth. We still have most of the holiday season in front of us, and we are on track to deliver both our revenue and earnings guidance for the year as adjusted. We remain committed to utilizing our strong cash flow to both invest in the profitable segments of our business and improve returns via share repurchases. 
I'd also like to highlight the strategic announcements we made on November 7. These structural changes are critical elements in driving our strategy in the future and improving returns for our shareholders. All of these actions are expected to be accretive to adjusted operating income and EPS next year and beyond.
On balance, we continue to execute well on and benefit from the 3 foundational elements of our strategy: one, our unique multichannel approach that allows us to connect with customers wherever and whenever they want to shop; two, optimizing our scale to drive growth to new categories, new store formats and to gain share in key categories; and three, leveraging our financial strength and flexibility.
In a moment, we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results in the context of this strategy. But first, I want to comment briefly on what we saw in the marketplace. We were at the early stage of the holiday season. But as we've all observed so far, retail has been very promotional and consumers have been value-conscious. As we'll talk about later, we purposely plan to take a leadership stance in the marketplace and stepped up our promotional efforts to do so. In terms of our Domestic sales performance, our Domestic comp was up 1% for the quarter and was strengthened by November's performance. Our in-store comps on Black Friday were strong, helping us to deliver an overall comp of 7% for the day. We're pleased that traffic in comp sales were up across all channels for the quarter, including at the store level and very strong growth in our dot com channel.
As I mentioned earlier, we took a number of actions to drive our business, including running effective promotions across multiple channels, significantly expanding our online assortment and ensuring we are competitively priced. During Black Friday, we delivered a number of records in our Domestic business, the number of people in line outside the stores, as well as overall traffic, sales and transactions. According to third-party customer surveys, Best Buy was the #1 place to shop and CE and technology, and for all of retail, Best Buy ranked #2 in initial shopping destination. In addition, BestBuy.com was the third most visited U.S. retail website on Black Friday, up from fourth last year. 
Our multichannel strategy clearly paid dividends in the quarter. As you know, we have a target to double our online business in the next 3 to 5 years, and our third quarter online sales were a significant driver of the quarter's total comp growth.
Our Domestic online comp was up 20% for the quarter compared to online growth of 13% for the first half of the year. For November, our online business was up over 30%, which was double the online growth of the overall industry according to comp score. 
There were several important factors driving this performance. We had a strong and deliberate online plan to reach customers, drive traffic and improve conversion, all of which we plan to execute throughout the season and beyond. We delivered a meaningful increase in our online conversion rate, on top of higher customer traffic. We offered free shipping for all items during the holiday season, and we are early to the market of this powerful value message, and we continue to enhance our own online assortment. We've more than doubled our online only SKU count to approximately 50,000 products since last year. We continue to be pleased with our growing assortment in our online only SKUs where we're already having a material impact on our revenue in this channel.
It is also important to note that more than 1.4 million customers chose to pick up their online orders at the store location this quarter, representing approximately 40% growth versus the prior year, a testament to the importance of our multichannel approach. As we entered the second half of our fiscal year, we highlighted mobile phones, tablets, eReaders, appliances and gaming as the key anticipated drivers of Domestic comp store sales for the back half. I'll provide you with a brief update on each of those categories. 
Best Buy Mobile posted positive comp growth in the quarter, following the introduction of the iPhone 4 as in mid-October. And we continued to expand our points of presence by adding more than 100 of our profitable mobile stand-alone stores across the country year to date, bringing our total to more than 280 stores. Tablets have been very popular so far this holiday, with continued triple digit growth in the category, resulting in significant share gains for us. This growth is coming from the continued strength of iPads, coupled with the increasing popularity of Android-based models. We believe our Tablet Central strategy has positioned us to capitalize in the momentum this new product is bringing the industry. Importantly, we anticipate that tablets will we be one of the first areas where we leverage our expanded connection strategy as we grow profitable connections revenue beyond just mobile phones.
eReaders are seeing similar trends as tablets and are proving to be very popular gift items this season. We have been leveraging the introduction of the new Kindle Fire in the Nook to drive triple digit growth, new customers and share gains in eReaders. Appliances continued its strong momentum, with the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comps and continued share gains. As we discussed last quarter, we expected the gaming industry would improve with more new titles in the second half. However, industry sales have been weaker than we anticipated so far in the second half. While we're pleased with the strong demand we saw over Black Friday weekend, we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. 
As you recall, with our conservative assumptions for TVs for this year, based on consumer demand, the good news is that TVs did pickup compared to expectations. Our total TV units grew over 10% in the quarter, delivering a TV comp that was down slightly. Growth was stronger in large screen sizes. Units in this segment were up more than 15% and comps were in the positive mid-single digits. Additionally, our Magnolia Home Theater business continued to deliver mid-double-digit comparable store sales gains. While we're not yet ready to declare a new trend in TVs, our third quarter performance represents a significant change compared to the declines we have the industry experienced for the last several quarters. We have also stabilized TV share and have actually driven share gains through October.
Connections are a key component to our growth strategy, and overall connections grew 8% in the quarter, driven by Best Buy Mobile. As an example of the potential for expanding connections beyond phones, mobile postpaid broadband cards grew 30% in Q3 and 60% during Black Friday weekend.
Moving on to our International business this quarter. Our International business delivered strong gross margin improvement and operating income growth of over 80%. The highlight was the very strong margin performance from our business in Canada. Our International performance also reflects the benefit of restructuring in Turkey and China from earlier this year. And we expect to see continued positive impact in our International segment as a result of our strategic actions announced November 7.
Five Star flat comps for the quarter, driven largely by lower industry appliance sales. Five Star continues to be an important part of our International strategy, and we continue to build our footprint of stores in China.
Through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, we've generated $2 billion in free cash flow, on track to meeting our adjusted free cash flow objective of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the end of the year. This year, you have seen us continue to deploy cash to make investments in proven and profitable businesses like Best Buy Mobile, services and Five Star. We are on target to purchase approximately $1.5 billion of our stock for fiscal year 2012. Given our strong cash flow, current valuation and the existing board authorization, we intend to continue buybacks going forward. 
Rolling up the quarter, I'm especially pleased with the improved momentum in Q3 and our success in driving the top line. As I mentioned earlier, given the current landscape, value-conscious consumers and in a competitive promotional environment, we are making purposeful decisions that focus on revenue and market share while still planning to achieve our earnings commitment for the year. We will continue to focus on lowering costs.
We've also accelerated our efforts to grow operating income with strategic expansion in more profitable areas, such as connections and services in a very capital-efficient way. 
To summarize, while it's still early the holiday season, we're pleased with our start. We're excited about momentum we've seen in hot products like mobile phones, tablets and eReaders for the rest of the holiday season. And we remain confident about our ability to execute on our strategy, deliver our key objectives and meet our earnings outlook.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for more details in our financial performance."

Today, I plan on covering the financial highlights of our third quarter results, along with some additional  context on our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Before we get into the details of the quarter,",2181,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I plan on covering the financial highlights of our third quarter results, along with some additional  context on our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Before we get into the details of the quarter, for the benefit of our listeners who might be newer to the Best Buy story, it's worth mentioning that the Q3 results we are discussing today will either reflect 2 different periods of consumer purchase behavior. 
First, is a non-holiday period including activity in September and October; and second is the beginnings of the important holiday selling season in November, especially the big Black Friday kickoff weekend. Looking back on the past several years, we have learned that it is important to assess the performance for the full November and December period to get a more complete view of customer behavior and performance for the holidays. For Best Buy, this is especially relevant considering the significant waiting of earnings derived from the month of December. This was also part of the rationale to change our fiscal year, which will result in the month of November, December and January being reported together in our new Q4 next year. Given that as important context, as we look at our Q3 results and current expectations for the fourth quarter, we believe that we remain on track to deliver both the revenue and adjusted earnings performance for the year, consistent with the guidance ranges that we discussed on last quarter's call.
Moving into the highlights from the third quarter, our Domestic business delivered both positive store traffic and comparable store sales growth. This was the first period that we've seen positive Domestic comps since the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In-store traffic is growing for the first time since Q3 of FY '10. Customer response to our multichannel offers was strong, and we performed well in the most popular CE categories for the holidays. Our online sales performance also accelerated significantly in the quarter as Brian discussed earlier.
We were pleased with our top line results and the improvements in our traffic metrics during the quarter. The investments we made to improve sales and market share, coupled with customer purchases that were more heavily weighted towards value and promotional items, resulted in a lower gross profit rate in the quarter. I'll provide more color on that in a minute, but the big takeaway is that these activities paid off in positive comparable store sales growth of 1% for the quarter that were strengthened by November and concluded with a plus 7% sales growth on Black Friday.
The biggest positive sales drivers in the Q3 Domestic comp included tablets, appliances, eReaders, mobile phones and movies. Total mobile computing had very strong comparable store sales growth of 16% in the quarter. Within this performance, notebook comp sales trends improved for the third straight quarter, delivering a mid-single-digit decline that was slightly ahead of our plan for the quarter. Appliances continued its momentum with comparable store sales growth of 14%. The operational changes we've made in the appliance area and the improved competitive offers continue to help us grow our market share in this business.
eReaders products delivered triple digit comps that once again had a meaningful impact on the total Domestic segment revenue growth. Consistent with our commentary in the second quarter call, the mobile phone business benefited from the launch of the new iPhone 4S halfway through our third quarter as well as other new devices introduced during the period. These new devices were a key driver of the 9% comparable store sales gain achieved during the quarter in mobile phones. We expect even stronger growth in mobile phones during our fourth quarter given that these products will be available for the full quarter.
The movies category also delivered comparable store sales growth as we drove strong promotional activity in this area to improve traffic. Movie sales also benefited from a stronger lineup of new releases that occurred during the quarter. As Brian highlighted earlier, our online channel was critical in driving growth throughout the quarter and especially in November and Black Friday weekend. The 20% increase in Q3 online sales was led by double-digit growth across nearly all key product categories, with tablets, televisions and laptops having the biggest impact.
Television comparable store sales trends improved significantly, down low single digits versus the double-digit declines in previous quarters. This was above our plan and represents an important improvement on one of our largest businesses. Notable areas of Domestic segment comparable store sales declined during the quarter, included digital imaging and gaming. Digital imaging's revenue decline was due to continued overall industry softness and the decline in gaming was driven by industry weakness, primarily on gaming hardware. Total gaming comparable store sales digital meaningful improvement from the prior quarter, led by high single-digit growth in gaming software, driven by strength in both new and preowned titles. 
Sales in our International segment increased 1%, with favorable impact of foreign currency and net new store growth, offset by a 1.5% -- 1.7% comparable store sales decline. Our Five Star business in China delivered flat comparable store sales, which included a strong Golden Week performance. Best Buy Europe experienced mid-single-digit comp declines similar to the trend experienced in Q2. In Canada, comp sales were flat number, reflecting a strong sequential improvement from the prior quarter when comps were down high single digits.
Key improvements versus the prior quarter came in areas like gaming, software computing and televisions. Turning now to gross profit performance in the quarter, total gross profit of $2.9 billion was down 1%. Domestic gross profit dollars declined 3% as the rate declined 130 basis points after being up approximately 90 basis points in the previous year. From a macro perspective, the decline in the Domestic gross profit rate was driven by a combination of investments we made in promotional activity in key categories and customers purchasing more value-orientated items.
Getting into the specifics, 130 point basis reduction was driven by much stronger promotional activity, in mobile computing, televisions and movies versus the previous year. Within the television and computing categories, consumers also purchased a relatively higher mix of value-orientated priced items. We also saw strong consumer demand in mobile computing products, which have lower gross margin rate on average. And finally, similar to last quarter, our successful tech support service offering had a negative impact on our year-over-year gross profit rate. 
As discussed last quarter, revenue and profits from this program are recognized over the life of the agreement, which is typically 1 to 2 years. While that explains the key drivers of the rate decline from last year, the appropriate follow-up question is why was the decline larger than was anticipated at the beginning of the quarter? Our original plans for Q3 anticipated the Domestic gross profit rate that would be down less than this. I would point to 3 key areas, which drove the majority of the difference between our actual and expected results. First, during the quarter, we made incremental decisions to invest in additional promotional activity. We focused these actions on areas with competitive opportunities like computing, television and movies, and we're satisfied with the strong response we saw from consumers. Second, consistent with my earlier comments, consumer purchases mixed more heavily into promotional and value items. Consumers' response was strong in lower margin computing and promoted televisions and movies. And lastly, a higher mix of our sales during the quarter took place in the month of November and especially Black Friday, which is more promotional by nature.
Within the International segment, gross profit dollars increased 4%. This dollar growth was the result of foreign currency exchange rates and a rate increase of 80 basis points. Rate strength was driven by continued work by our Canadian team to improve promotional effectiveness in large categories like notebooks and televisions. We are also benefiting from the actions we've taken in our International portfolio to exit the lower margin big box test stores in China and Turkey.
Another key story from Q3 is the continued progress we have made to lower expenses and help fund the pricing and promotional investments discussed above. Excluding the impact of FX, total company SG&A was actually flat during the quarter. We have driven spending reductions in discretionary areas and have improved labor effectiveness while increasing our TV and online advertising to build traffic and awareness. Fiscal year-to-date, total SG&A expense versus the prior year excluding FX is essentially flat.
Strong International operating growth of over 80% in the quarter and excellent SG&A cost control partially mitigated the total company operating income declined to 50% in the quarter. The overall decline was driven almost entirely by the lower gross profit rate in the Domestic business. 
We continue to generate significant cash. Free cash flows through the third quarter was very strong at $2 billion. FY '12 cash flow has benefited from the reversal of year-end timing items that we have previously discussed and from proactive management of our inventory. In fact, our Domestic comparable store inventories finished down 11% in the third quarter. As Brian said, we are currently on track to deliver our adjusted free cash flow target for the year of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
Before we move onto our outlook, I also wanted to call your attention to a couple of other items included in our Q3 results. During the quarter, we incurred a total of $150 million of pretax restructuring costs that were largely associated with the planned closure of the 11 big box pilot stores in the U.K. These charges were consistent with our previous announcement on this matter.
Also, within the quarter, we sold our investments in the shares of TalkTalk group plc and Carphone Warehouse Group plc. The $55 million pretax gain associated with these transactions or $0.13 of EPS has been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.47 for the third quarter. 
With the Q3 summary behind us, let's move on to talk about our outlook for the balance of the year. As I mentioned upfront, we continue to expect adjusted annual diluted EPS in the range of $3.35 to $3.65, consistent with the previous guidance when excluding the items outlined in today's release and by Bill at the outset of this call.
Based on where we see the consumer, the competitive environment and our expectations for the balance of the year, we are updating a couple of items in our full year outlook to arrive at the adjusted EPS range for our outlook. Summarizing the key elements of our updated outlook, our revenue range has remained unchanged for the entire year at $51 billion to $52.5 billion, representing full year comp sales of flat to down 3%. Based on our year-to-date sales and our expectations for Q4, we currently expect to finish around the midpoint of this dollar range. We now expect the full year gross profit rate to decline approximately 50 basis points. This includes a fourth quarter gross profit rate that is a modest decline compared to the prior year and better than the rate decline in Q3. The improvement in the sequential Q4 rate is based on a few key items. First, an improved Domestic rate in computing as promotional investments were more heavily weighted to Q3. Also in computing, we have reduced inventory transition costs due to lower levels of inventory this year. And the impact of tech support is expected to be less of a drag given the timing recognition of deferred revenue on this program. 
Also within Domestic, we anticipate a lower mix of gain in sales and reduced year-over-year promotions in movies, both of which should improve the rates relative to Q3. Finally, we also expect to improve International gross margins, primarily a function of easier comparisons and from the impact of incremental than the programs both in Europe and Five Star in Q4.
To offset the impact of lower gross margin expectations, we have also lowered our SG&A for the year. We now expect full year SG&A dollar growth to be approximately 2%. Excluding the impact to the 53rd week in FY '12 and FX, SG&A is now planned to be slightly down for the full year. So rolling it all up, our expectations on total operating income dollars remained within our prior range, which was a 5% decline to 2% growth. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.65 represents a range of down 2% to up 6%. 
In closing, we were pleased with the traffic and sales improvement in the quarter and the successful execution of the Black Friday weekend. The holiday season is just getting started and we clearly have a lot of business still in front of us this year. We believe that we have taken strong and aggressive steps to position ourselves for the balance of the holidays and to deliver our performance commitments for the year.
So with that, Alicia, we are taking ready to take the questions."

And just recall that we had planned for operating profit to be down year-to-date through Q3. And certainly, given the late in the waiting of our earnings in Q4, we had planned operating profit to be up in Q4. We still expect it to be up in Q4. But I think the core point of your first question is where do we see the opportunities in the business to grow both the top line and to grow the gross margin dollars in the business. And consistent with Brian's response, Michael, we are investing into higher margins around connections and services. And actually, we saw some comparable store sales growth in Q3. the key for us is to make sure that our relevance stays high with consumers and we get the opportunity to grow those businesses given the footsteps we will have both in-store and online. So we've got to bring that mix to the right level of top line growth and margin growth. But one thing's for certain, we're not going to be able to us execute our strategies and growing connections and services without the strong foot traffic and brand relevance that comes along with it. And secondly, in order to grow operating income, we've got to sell the more profitable mix of products, and we're seeing progress in that space, to Brian's point, around what's happening in mobility and services. We also have significant opportunities to continue to work on our cost structure, which you've also seen great progress on this year. So it's going to take combination of all those factors, but we're certainly encouraged by where we're starting to see some of our biggest business display. As we mentioned upfront, we had very conservative assumptions for what the notebook category was going to do this year and the television category, and year-to-date, we're exceeding our expectations of both of those 2 very big businesses. So in light of the macro headwinds and what we see in the CE industry, we're using this time to make sure that we may remain relevant with customers from a traffic standpoint while focusing on the profitable growth opportunities that will actually grow op income growing for will. Longer answer you're looking for but I appreciate the question up about finding that balance and make sure we drive op income going forward."

And we have done work and rationalizing some of our square footage. But again, I need to remind the audience, Gary, we believe that installed base of stores is a huge advantage with us. The way customers are leveraging our website, the way customers are gravitating to an in-store pickup type environment, the way the services this business and the connections business is growing, and I'll just remind everybody in the call that connections business, about $150 billion of it is addressable by us a year, and we have about a 1% share of that. We see that as a massive growth opportunity. Those stores are a very important place for us to do that customer acquisition and make those connections with customers. We are doing a lot of work in getting our stores rightsized where we think that makes sense. So for me, it's not about closing huge tranches of stores. It's about being where the customer needs us to be, online, in stores, on the phone and it's about us being priced competitively so that we can get into the world of connections and attachments and services that help customers put this technology and service of what it is they're trying to do.

We continue to be on track to deliver the square footage reduction that we've talked about over the 3- to 5-year window. Last quarter, I gave a little update on the progress we had made on the first tranches of stores. We're actually doing a few more stores this year than we have planned, and we remain on track to see anywhere between 10% to 15% square footage reduction in those stores. But just back to Brian's broader point, that work is being done operating model better, the efficiencies that we'll get out of the SG&A cost. That's a small portion of the story.

It's Jim. Looking at that from a couple different perspective, one of the things we've continued to see in the quarter is that our relative attach rate of services across the board is primarily driven by the price points people are purchasing at or above computing items and television items. When we look at the attachment rate across those price points, they have actually held pretty stable and in some cases have actually grown year-over-year. My comments around the mix of what people are buying in lower dollar value in more promotional items. As they skew more into those, those generally come with a lower attach rate. So by ASP, we've seen attach rates pretty consistent with previous years and actually growth in a number of the categories. But when our mix shifts to lower ASP items we see that they'll less attach in that space. The comment Mike Vitelli made earlier also it's beginning to more promotional period around November. Those are typically just lower attach months, in general, just given the velocity with which we're moving traffic through the store during -- especially the Black Friday promotional weekend."

There's a number of different things going on. Let me impact that for you a little bit. First and foremost, we're very pleased with the way that we've managed the balance sheet this year, especially that inventory levels within the business. If you recall last year in Q3, inventories grew pretty substantially based on a softer level of sales than we anticipated last year. So a lot of the improvement that you're seeing year-over-year in inventory is based on we had too high inventories in the end of the last Q3. We've done more effective job and it stronger sales this year that's 1 component of it. And other component of it is related to some of the timing differences we talked about at year end around our payables and receivable positions. We knew that we had benefits coming in Q1 and Q2 of this year, which we've been talking about all year long. That's lifting the cash, free cash flow from those items. The other item that you mentioned specifically is the growth in accounts receivable, principally driven by 2 things. As our mobile phone business continues to grow, the bounties that were due from the carriers are at a higher percentage of our receivables overall. That's 1 part of the growth. The other anomaly that's a little bit in Q3 has just given the strength of our Black Friday sales. A lot of the credit card receivables we generated over the Black Friday we can don't get collected until the next big. So we get a little bit is about a timing issue at the year end, at the quarter end of Q3 around that these. So those are the 2 biggest pieces that explain what's going on in the receivable balance. In general, though, as we look forward to the end of the year, we're going to be in a much better accounts payable position than we were at year end. Our inventories won't be down as much as they are in Q3 because by the time we got to the end of Q4 last year, we got managed down a lot of the inventories. But we are still going to be in that free cash flow $2 billion to $2.5 billion. So we're very happy and satisfied with the progress the teams have made on driving our cash flow for the year."

We have 2 speakers today, Brian Dunn, our CEO; and Jim Muehlbauer, our CFO. And after our prepared remarks, we should have plenty of time for your questions.
Before I hand the call over to Brian, I'd like to take care of a few housekeeping items. [Operator Instructions] Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.
You will also note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures excluding the gain on sale of investments as well as the impact of restructuring charges, which are largely related to the restructuring activities we announced on November 7. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release and in the GAAP numbers we report in our 10-Q. In addition, the 2012 fiscal year adjusted guidance we will be discussing today excludes the gain on sale of investments and the impact from restructuring charges, estimated impairment charges and the purchase of CPW share of the Mobile profit share agreement.
For a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release. Also, we refer to free cash flow in today's results in our discussion today. Our definition of free cash flow is operating cash flow minus CapEx. With those housekeeping items aside, I would like to turn the call over to Brian Dunn."

My comments this morning will focus on our third quarter performance and what we have seen at this early stage in this holiday season.",1694,"Good morning, everyone, and happy holidays, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings conference call. My comments this morning will focus on our third quarter performance and what we have seen at this early stage in this holiday season. First, I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their world-class execution this quarter. I am especially proud of their extraordinary efforts in serving our customers during Black Friday weekend.
For me, the key takeaways of the quarter were: we took the size of actions to drive our business, specifically in revenue and market share, both in-store and aggressively online. These actions, while negatively impacting gross margin, significantly resonated with customers and resulted in improved traffic and comp sales, including a significant increase in our online growth. We still have most of the holiday season in front of us, and we are on track to deliver both our revenue and earnings guidance for the year as adjusted. We remain committed to utilizing our strong cash flow to both invest in the profitable segments of our business and improve returns via share repurchases. 
I'd also like to highlight the strategic announcements we made on November 7. These structural changes are critical elements in driving our strategy in the future and improving returns for our shareholders. All of these actions are expected to be accretive to adjusted operating income and EPS next year and beyond.
On balance, we continue to execute well on, and benefit from, the 3 foundational elements of our strategy: one, our unique multichannel approach that allows us to connect with customers wherever and whenever they want to shop; two, optimizing our scale to drive growth to new categories, new store formats and to gain share in key categories; and three, leveraging our financial strength and flexibility.
In a moment, we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results in the context of this strategy. But first, I want to comment briefly on what we saw in the marketplace. We were at the early stage of the holiday season. But as we've all observed so far, retail has been very promotional and consumers have been value-conscious. As we'll talk about later, we purposely plan to take a leadership stance in the marketplace and stepped up our promotional efforts to do so. 
In terms of our Domestic sales performance, our Domestic comp was up 1% for the quarter and was strengthened by November's performance. Our in-store comps on Black Friday were strong, helping us to deliver overall comp of 7% for the day. We're pleased that traffic and comp sales were up across all channels for the quarter, including at the store level and very strong growth in our dot com channel.
As I mentioned earlier, we took a number of actions to drive our business, including running effective promotions across multiple channels, significantly expanding our online assortment and ensuring we are competitively priced. During Black Friday, we delivered a number of records in our Domestic business, the number of people in line outside the stores, as well as overall traffic, sales and transactions. According to third-party customer surveys, Best Buy was the #1 place to shop in CE and technology, and for all of retail, Best Buy ranked #2 in initial shopping destination. In addition, BestBuy.com was the third most visited U.S. retail website on Black Friday, up from fourth last year. 
Our multichannel strategy clearly paid dividends in the quarter. As you know, we have a target to double our online business in the next 3 to 5 years, and our third quarter online sales were a significant driver of the quarter's total comp growth.
Our Domestic online comp was up 20% for the quarter compared to online growth of 13% for the first half of the year. For November, our online business was up over 30%, which was double the online growth of the overall industry according to ComScore. 
There were several important factors driving this performance. We had a strong and deliberate online plan to reach customers, drive traffic and improve conversion, all of which we plan to execute throughout the season and beyond. We delivered a meaningful increase in our online conversion rate, on top of higher customer traffic. We offered free shipping for all items during the holiday season, and we're early in the market with this powerful value message, and we continue to enhance our own online assortment. 
We've more than doubled our online only SKU count to approximately 50,000 products since last year. We continue to be pleased with our growing assortment. In our online only SKUs we're already having a material impact on our revenue in this channel.
It is also important to note that more than 1.4 million customers chose to pick up their online orders at the store location this quarter, representing approximately 40% growth versus the prior year, a testament to the importance of our multichannel approach. As we entered the second half of our fiscal year, we highlighted mobile phones, tablets, eReaders, appliances and gaming as the key anticipated drivers of Domestic comp store sales for the back half. I'll provide you with a brief update on each of those categories. 
Best Buy Mobile posted positive comp growth in the quarter, following the introduction of the iPhone 4 as in mid-October. And we continue to expand our points of presence by adding more than 100 of our profitable mobile stand-alone stores across the country year-to-date, bringing our total to more than 280 stores. Tablets have been very popular so far this holiday, with continued triple digit growth in the category, resulting in significant share gains for us. This growth is coming from the continued strength of iPads, coupled with the increasing popularity of Android-based models. 
We believe our Tablet Central strategy has positioned us to capitalize in the momentum this new product is bringing the industry. Importantly, we anticipate that tablets will we be one of the first areas where we leverage our expanded connection strategy, as we grow profitable connections revenue beyond just mobile phones.
eReaders are seeing similar trends as tablets and are proving to be very popular gift items this season. We have been leveraging the introduction of the new Kindle Fire and the Nook to drive triple digit growth, new customers and share gains in eReaders. Appliances continued its strong momentum, with the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comps and continued share gains. As we discussed last quarter, we expected the gaming industry would improve with more new titles in the second half. However, industry sales have been weaker than we anticipated so far in the second half. While we're pleased with the strong demand we saw over Black Friday weekend, we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. 
As you recall, with our conservative assumptions for TVs for this year, based on consumer demand, the good news is that TVs did pickup compared to expectations. Our total TV units grew over 10% in the quarter, delivering a TV comp that was down slightly. Growth was stronger in large screen sizes. Units in this segment were up more than 15% and comps were in the positive mid-single digits. Additionally, our Magnolia Home Theater business continued to deliver mid-double-digit comparable store sales gains. While we're not yet ready to declare a new trend in TVs, our third quarter performance represents a significant change compared to the declines we and the industry experienced the last several quarters. We have also stabilized TV share and have actually driven share gains through October.
Connections are a key component to our growth strategy, and overall connections grew 8% in the quarter, driven by Best Buy Mobile. As an example of the potential for expanding connections beyond phones, mobile postpaid broadband cards grew 50% in Q3 and 60% during Black Friday weekend.
Moving on to our International business this quarter. Our International business delivered strong gross margin improvement and operating income growth of over 80%. The highlight was the very strong margin performance from our business in Canada. Our International performance also reflects the benefit of restructuring in Turkey and China from earlier this year. And we expect to see continued positive impact in our International segment as a result of our strategic actions announced November 7.
Five Star flat comps for the quarter, driven largely by lower industry appliance sales. Five Star continues to be an important part of our International strategy, and we continue to build our footprint of stores in China.
Through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, we generated $2 billion in free cash flow, on track to meeting our adjusted free cash flow objective of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the end of the year. This year, you have seen us continue to deploy cash to make investments in proven and profitable businesses like Best Buy Mobile, services and Five Star. We are on target to purchase approximately $1.5 billion of our stock for the fiscal year 2012. Given our strong cash flow, current valuation and the existing board authorization, we intend to continue buybacks going forward. 
Rolling up the quarter, I'm especially pleased with the improved momentum in Q3 and our success in driving the top line. As I mentioned earlier, given the current landscape, value-conscious consumers and in a competitive promotional environment, we are making purposeful decisions that focus on revenue and market share, while still planning to achieve our earnings commitment for the year. We will continue to focus on lowering costs.
We've also accelerated our efforts to grow operating income with strategic expansion in more profitable areas, such as connections and services in a very capital-efficient way. 
To summarize, while it's still early in the holiday season, we're pleased with our start. We're excited about momentum we've seen in hot products like mobile phones, tablets and eReaders for the rest of the holiday season. And we remain confident about our ability to execute on our strategy, deliver our key objectives and meet our earnings outlook.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for more details on our financial performance."
255397,144179296,201289,"Best Buy Co. Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 13, 2011",2011-12-13,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I plan on covering the financial highlights of our third quarter results, along with some additional  context on our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Before we get into the details of the quarter,",2176,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I plan on covering the financial highlights of our third quarter results, along with some additional  context on our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Before we get into the details of the quarter, for the benefit of our listeners who might be newer to the Best Buy story, it's worth mentioning that the Q3 results we are discussing today really reflect 2 different periods of consumer purchase behavior. 
First is a non-holiday period, including activity in September and October; and second is the beginnings of the important holiday selling season in November, especially the big Black Friday kickoff weekend. Looking back on the past several years, we have learned that it is important to assess the performance for the full November and December period to get a more complete view of customer behavior and performance for the holidays. For Best Buy, this is especially relevant considering the significant weighting of earnings derived from the month of December. This was also part of the rationale to change our fiscal year, which will result in the month of November, December and January being reported together in our new Q4 next year. Given that as important context, as we look at our Q3 results and current expectations for the fourth quarter, we believe that we remain on track to deliver both the revenue and adjusted earnings performance for the year, consistent with the guidance ranges that we discussed on last quarter's call.
Moving into the highlights from the third quarter. Our Domestic business delivered both positive store traffic and comparable store sales growth. This was the first period that we've seen positive Domestic comps since the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In-store traffic is growing for the first time since Q3 of FY '10. Customer response to our multichannel offers was strong, and we performed well in the most popular CE categories for the holidays. Our online sales performance also accelerated significantly in the quarter as Brian discussed earlier.
We were pleased with our top line results and the improvements in our traffic metrics during the quarter. The investments we made to improve sales and market share, coupled with customer purchases that were more heavily weighted towards value and promotional items, resulted in a lower gross profit rate in the quarter. I'll provide more color on that in a minute, but the big takeaway is that these activities paid off in positive comparable store sales growth of 1% for the quarter that were strengthened by November and concluded with a plus 7% sales growth on Black Friday.
The biggest positive sales drivers in the Q3 Domestic comp included tablets, appliances, eReaders, mobile phones and movies. Total mobile computing had very strong comparable store sales growth of 16% in the quarter. Within this performance, notebook comp sales trends improved for the third straight quarter, delivering a mid-single-digit decline that was slightly ahead of our plan for the quarter. Appliances continued its momentum with comparable store sales growth of 14%. The operational changes we've made in the appliance area and the improved competitive offers continue to help us grow our market share in this business.
eReader products delivered triple digit comps that once again had a meaningful impact on the total Domestic segment revenue growth. Consistent with our commentary in the second quarter call, the mobile phone business benefited from the launch of the new iPhone 4S halfway through our third quarter, as well as other new devices introduced during the period. These new devices were a key driver of the 9% comparable store sales gain achieved during the quarter in mobile phones. We expect even stronger growth in mobile phones during our fourth quarter given that these products will be available for the full quarter.
The movies category also delivered comparable store sales growth as we drove strong promotional activity in this area to improve traffic. Movie sales also benefited from a stronger lineup of new releases that occurred during the quarter. As Brian highlighted earlier, our online channel was critical in driving growth throughout the quarter and especially in November and Black Friday weekend. The 20% increase in Q3 online sales was led by double-digit growth across nearly all key product categories, with tablets, televisions and laptops having the biggest impact.
Television comparable store sales trends improved significantly, down low-single digits versus the double-digit declines in previous quarters. This was above our plan and represents an important improvement on one of our largest businesses. Notable areas of Domestic segment comparable store sales declined during the quarter, included digital imaging and gaming. Digital imaging's revenue decline was due to continued overall industry softness and the decline in gaming was driven by industry weakness, primarily on gaming hardware. Total gaming comparable store sales did show meaningful improvement from the prior quarter, led by high single-digit growth in gaming software, driven by strength in both new and pre-owned titles. 
Sales in our International segment increased 1%, with favorable impact of foreign currency and net new store growth, offset by a 1.7% comparable store sales decline. Our Five Star business in China delivered flat comparable store sales, which included a strong Golden Week performance. Best Buy Europe experienced mid-single-digit comp declines similar to the trend experienced in Q2. In Canada, comp sales were flat, reflecting a strong sequential improvement from the prior quarter when comps were down high single digits.
Key improvements versus the prior quarter came in areas like gaming, software computing and televisions. 
Turning now to gross profit performance in the quarter. Total gross profit of $2.9 billion was down 1%. Domestic gross profit dollars declined 3% as the rate declined 130 basis points after being up approximately 90 basis points in the previous year. From a macro perspective, the decline in the Domestic gross profit rate was driven by a combination of investments we made in promotional activity in key categories and customers purchasing more value-orientated items.
Getting into the specifics, 130 point basis reduction was driven by much stronger promotional activity, notably in mobile computing, televisions and movies versus the previous year. Within the television and computing categories, consumers also purchased a relatively higher mix of value-orientated priced items. We also saw strong consumer demand in mobile computing products, which have lower gross margin rate on average. And finally, similar to last quarter, our successful tech support service offering had a negative impact on our year-over-year gross profit rate. 
As discussed last quarter, revenue and profits from this program are recognized over the life of the agreement, which is typically 1 to 2 years. While that explains the key drivers of the rate decline from last year, the appropriate follow-up question is, why was the decline larger than was anticipated at the beginning of the quarter? Our original plans for Q3 anticipated the Domestic gross profit rate that would be down less than this. I would point to 3 key areas, which drove the majority of the difference between our actual and expected results. 
First, during the quarter, we made incremental decision to invest in additional promotional activity. We focused these actions on areas with competitive opportunities like computing, television and movies, and we're satisfied with the strong response we saw from consumers. Second, consistent with my earlier comments, consumer purchases mixed more heavily into promotional and value items. Consumers' response was strongest in lower margin computing and promoted televisions and movies. And lastly, a higher mix of our sales during the quarter took place in the month of November, and especially Black Friday, which is more promotional by nature.
Within the International segment, gross profit dollars increased 4%. This dollar growth was the result of foreign currency exchange rates and a rate increase of 80 basis points. Rate strength was driven by continued work by our Canadian team to improve promotional effectiveness in large categories like notebooks and televisions. We are also benefiting from the actions we've taken in our International portfolio to exit the lower margin big box test stores in China and Turkey.
Another key story from Q3 is the continued progress we have made to lower expenses and help fund the pricing and promotional investments discussed above. Excluding the impact of FX, total company SG&A was actually flat during the quarter. We have driven spending reductions in discretionary areas and have improved labor effectiveness while increasing our TV and online advertising to build traffic and awareness. Fiscal year-to-date, total SG&A expense versus the prior year, excluding FX, is essentially flat.
Strong International operating growth of over 80% in the quarter and excellent SG&A cost control partially mitigated the total company operating income declined of 15% in the quarter. The overall decline was driven almost entirely by the lower gross profit rate in the Domestic business. 
We continue to generate significant cash. Free cash flow through the third quarter was very strong at $2 billion. FY '12 cash flow has benefited from the reversal of year-end timing items that we have previously discussed and from proactive management of our inventory. In fact, our Domestic comparable store inventories finished down 11% in the third quarter. As Brian said, we are currently on track to deliver our adjusted free cash flow target for the year of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
Before we move on to our outlook, I also wanted to call your attention to a couple of other items included in our Q3 results. During the quarter, we incurred a total of $150 million of pretax restructuring costs that were largely associated with the planned closure of the 11 big box pilot stores in the U.K. These charges were consistent with our previous announcement on this matter.
Also, within the quarter, we sold our investments in the shares of TalkTalk Group plc and Carphone Warehouse Group plc. The $55 million pretax gain associated with these transactions, or $0.13 of EPS, has been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.47 for the third quarter. 
With the Q3 summary behind us, let's move on to talk about our outlook for the balance of the year. As I mentioned upfront, we continue to expect adjusted annual diluted EPS in the range of $3.35 to $3.65, consistent with the previous guidance when excluding the items outlined in today's release and by Bill at the outset of this call.
Based on where we see the consumer, the competitive environment and our expectations for the balance of the year, we are updating a couple of items in our full year outlook to arrive at the adjusted EPS range for our outlook. Summarizing the key elements of our updated outlook, our revenue range has remained unchanged for the entire year at $51 billion to $52.5 billion, representing full year comp sales of flat to down 3%. Based on our year-to-date sales and our expectations for Q4, we currently expect to finish around the midpoint of this dollar range. 
We now expect the full year gross profit rate to decline approximately 50 basis points. This includes a fourth quarter gross profit rate that is a modest decline compared to the prior year and better than the rate decline in Q3. The improvement in the sequential Q4 rate is based on a few key items. First, an improved Domestic rate in computing as promotional investments were more heavily weighted to Q3. Also in computing, we have reduced inventory transition costs due to lower levels of inventory this year. And the impact of tech support is expected to be less of a drag given the timing recognition of deferred revenue on this program. 
Also within Domestic, we anticipate a lower mix of gain in sales and reduced year-over-year promotions in movies, both of which should improve the rates relative to Q3. Finally, we also expect to improve International gross margins, primarily a function of easier comparisons and from the impact of incremental vendor programs both in Europe and Five Star in Q4.
To offset the impact of lower gross margin expectations, we have also lowered our SG&A for the year. We now expect full year SG&A dollar growth to be approximately 2%. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in FY '12 and FX, SG&A is now planned to be slightly down for the full year. So rolling it all up, our expectations on total operating income dollars remained within our prior range, which was a 5% decline to 2% growth. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.65 represents a range of down 2% to up 6%. 
In closing, we were pleased with the traffic and sales improvement in the quarter and the successful execution of the Black Friday weekend. The holiday season is just getting started and we clearly have a lot of business still in front of us this year. We believe that we have taken strong and aggressive steps to position ourselves for the balance of the holidays and to deliver our performance commitments for the year.
So with that, Alicia, we're ready to take the questions."

And certainly, given the weighting of our earnings in Q4, we had planned operating profit to be up in Q4. We still expect it to be up in Q4. But I think the core point of your first question is where do we see the opportunities in the business to grow both the top line and to grow the gross margin dollars in the business. And consistent with Brian's response, Michael, we are investing into higher margins basis around connections and services. And actually, we saw some comparable store sales growth in Q3. The key for us is to make sure that our relevance stays high with consumers and we get the opportunity to grow those businesses given the footsteps we will have both in-store and online. So we've got to bring that mix to the right level of top line growth and margin growth. But one thing is for certain, we're not going to be able to execute our strategies in growing connections and services without the strong foot traffic and brand relevance that comes along with it. And secondly, in order to grow operating income, we've got to sell the more profitable mix of products, and we're seeing progress in that space, to Brian's point, around what's happening in mobility and services. We also have significant opportunities to continue to work on our cost structure, which you've also seen great progress on this year. So it's going to take a combination of all those factors but we're certainly encouraged by where we're starting to see some of our biggest business display. As we mentioned upfront, we had very conservative assumptions for what the notebook category was going to do this year and the television category, and year-to-date we're exceeding our expectations on both of those 2 very big businesses. So in light of the macro headwinds and what we see in the CE industry, we're using this time to make sure that we may remain relevant with customers from a traffic standpoint, while focusing on the profitable growth opportunities that will actually grow op income going forward. Probably a way longer answer than you're looking for, Mike, but I appreciate the question around about finding that balance and making sure we drive op income going forward."

And this year, really starting with the first quarter, you shifted to driving sales and a much greater willingness to use promotion. So just curious, at a very high level, what drove this shift? Was it a change in focus about what the competitive environment is? Was it the realization that perhaps the economy and the product cycle wasn't going to help you anytime soon? It seems very distinct and I was just curious what the, kind of, at the senior management level, what drove that distinct shift?"

Now that notebooks have come back in -- and I'm sorry tablets have come back in and reignited that industry, last year we actually saw a benefit to the overall company rate by selling fewer computers. This year, selling more computers is actually a drag on our rate.

We have been moving labor around very effectively within the stores, focusing on where we can provide the most help and assistance for customers and support our business models and being aggressive in places where the labor hasn't been providing the returns that we need. Also if you look at our cost structure, we have been trimming back on discretionary expenses and really focusing on those expenses that would drive the business most. We're very happy with the fact that we've been able to increase support in advertising our brand during that period while at the same time lowering expenses. And quite candidly, as we get sharper on what we have to invest to drive traffic so we can sell those connections and services, we're purposely going to pull back on those investments to fund some of those gross margins and pricing and promotional investments that we made in the quarter. So more to come on opportunities in that space, but we are certainly not priced for perfection yet on the SG&A line of the business, we've got work to do and I think you'll continue to see progress in that space."

The way customers are leveraging our website, the way customers are gravitating to an in-store pickup type environment, the way the services this business and the connections business is growing, and I'll just remind everybody in the call that connections business, about $150 billion of it is addressable by us a year, and we have about a 1% share of that. We see that as a massive growth opportunity. Those stores are a very important place for us to do that customer acquisition and make those connections with customers. We are doing a lot of work in getting our stores rightsized where we think that makes sense. So for me, it's not about closing huge tranches of stores. It's about being where the customer needs us to be, online, in stores, on the phone and it's about us being priced competitively so that we can get into the world of connections and attachments and services that help customers put this technology and service of what it is they're trying to do.

We're actually doing a few more stores this year than we have planned, and we remain on track to see anywhere between 10% to 15% square footage reduction in those stores. But just back to Brian's broader point, that work is being done in service of making the operating model better, the efficiencies that we'll get out of the SG&A cost.

Looking at that from a couple different perspective, one of the things we've continued to see in the quarter is that our relative attach rate of services across the board is primarily driven by the price points people are purchasing at or above computing items and television items. When we look at the attachment rate across those price points, they have actually held pretty stable and in some cases have actually grown year-over-year. My comments around the mix of what people are buying in lower dollar value in more promotional items, as they skew more into those, those generally come with a lower attach rate. So by ASPs by brand [ph] we've seen attach rates pretty consistent with previous years and actually growth in a number of the categories. But when our mix shifts to lower ASP items we see a little less attach in that space. To the comment Mike Vitelli made earlier also it's beginning to more promotional periods around November. Those are typically just lower attach months in general, just given the velocity with which we're moving traffic through the store during -- especially the Black Friday promotional weekend, weekend."

There's a number of different things going on there. Let me unpack that for you a little bit. First and foremost, we're very pleased with the way that we've managed the balance sheet this year, especially the inventory levels within the business. If you recall last year in Q3, inventories grew pretty substantially based on a softer level of sales than we anticipated last year. So a lot of the improvement that you're seeing year-over-year in inventory is based on we had too high inventories at the end of last Q3. We've done a much more effective job and it had stronger sales this year that's one component of it. Another component of it is related to some of the timing differences we talked about at year end around our payables and receivable positions. We knew that we had benefits coming in Q1 and Q2 of this year, which we've been talking about all year long. That's lifting the cash, free cash flow from those items. The other item that you mentioned specifically is the growth in accounts receivable, principally driven by 2 things. As our mobile phone business continues to grow, the bounties that were due from the carriers are a higher percentage of our receivables overall. That's one part of the growth. The other anomaly that sits a little bit in Q3 has just given the strength of our Black Friday sales. A lot of the credit card receivables we generated over the Black Friday weekend don't get collected until the next week. So we get a little bit of just a timing issue at the year end, at the quarter end of Q3 around that piece. So those are the 2 biggest pieces that explain what's going on in the receivable balance. In general, though, as we look forward to the end of the year, we're going to be in a much better accounts payable position than we were at year end. Our inventories won't be down as much as they are in Q3 because by the time we got to the end of Q4 last year, we had managed down a lot of the inventories. But we are still going to be in that camp of free cash flow $2 billion to $2.5 billion. So we're very happy and satisfied with the progress the teams have made on driving our cash flow for the year."

Part of our goal, obviously, is to manage that portfolio and hold expenses flat to bring them down while still funding those profitable growth levers in the business. We do see significant opportunities to continue to do that in the portfolio. The square footage reduction is just one element in doing that. But across the P&L, we see opportunities to be more efficient in our labor model and other things in the business."

My comments this morning will focus on our third quarter performance and what we have seen at this early stage in this holiday season. F",1689,"Good morning, everyone, and happy holidays and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings conference call. My comments this morning will focus on our third quarter performance and what we have seen at this early stage in this holiday season. First, I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their world-class execution this quarter. I am especially proud of their extraordinary efforts in serving our customers during Black Friday weekend.
For me, the key takeaways of the quarter were: we took decisive actions to drive our business, specifically in revenue and market share, both in-store and aggressively online. These actions, while negatively impacting gross margin, significantly resonated with customers and resulted in improved traffic and comp sales, including a significant increase in our online growth. We still have most of the holiday season in front of us, and we are on track to deliver both our revenue and earnings guidance for the year as adjusted. We remain committed to utilizing our strong cash flow to both invest in the profitable segments of our business and improve returns via share repurchases. 
I'd also like to highlight the strategic announcements we made on November 7. These structural changes are critical elements in driving our strategy in the future and improving returns for our shareholders. All of these actions are expected to be accretive to adjusted operating income and EPS next year and beyond.
On balance, we continue to execute well on, and benefit from, the 3 foundational elements of our strategy: one, our unique multichannel approach that allows us to connect with customers wherever and whenever they want to shop; two, optimizing our scale to drive growth to new categories, new store formats and to gain share in key categories; and three, leveraging our financial strength and flexibility.
In a moment, we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results in the context of this strategy. But first, I want to comment briefly on what we saw in the marketplace. We were at the early stage of the holiday season. But as we've all observed so far, retail has been very promotional and consumers have been value-conscious. As we'll talk about later, we purposely plan to take a leadership stance in the marketplace and step up our promotional efforts to do so. 
In terms of our Domestic sales performance, our Domestic comp was up 1% for the quarter and was strengthened by November's performance. Our in-store comps on Black Friday were strong, helping us to deliver overall comp of 7% for the day. We're pleased that traffic and comp sales were up across all channels for the quarter, including at the store level and very strong growth in our dot com channel.
As I mentioned earlier, we took a number of actions to drive our business, including running effective promotions across multiple channels, significantly expanding our online assortment and ensuring we are competitively priced. During Black Friday, we delivered a number of records in our Domestic business; the number of people in line outside the stores, as well as overall traffic, sales and transactions. According to third-party customer surveys, Best Buy was the #1 place to shop in CE and technology and for all of retail, Best Buy ranked #2 in initial shopping destination. In addition, BestBuy.com was the third most visited U.S. retail website on Black Friday, up from fourth last year. 
Our multichannel strategy clearly paid dividends in the quarter. As you know, we have a target to double our online business in the next 3 to 5 years and our third quarter online sales were a significant driver of the quarter's total comp growth.
Our Domestic online comp was up 20% for the quarter compared to online growth of 13% for the first half of the year. For November, our online business was up over 30%, which was double the online growth of the overall industry according to ComScore. 
There were several important factors driving this performance. We had a strong and deliberate online plan to reach customers, drive traffic and improve conversion, all of which we plan to execute throughout the season and beyond. We delivered a meaningful increase in our online conversion rate, on top of higher customer traffic. We offered free shipping for all items during the holiday season and we're early in the market with this powerful value message, and we continue to enhance our own online assortment. 
We've more than doubled our online only SKU count to approximately 50,000 products since last year. We continue to be pleased with our growing assortment. In our online only SKUs, we're already having a material impact on our revenue in this channel.
It is also important to note that more than 1.4 million customers chose to pick up their online orders at the store location this quarter, representing approximately 40% growth versus the prior year, a testament to the importance of our multichannel approach. As we entered the second half of our fiscal year, we highlighted mobile phones, tablets, eReaders, appliances and gaming as the key anticipated drivers of Domestic comp store sales for the back half. I'll provide you with a brief update on each of those categories. 
Best Buy Mobile posted positive comp growth in the quarter, following the introduction of the iPhone 4S in mid-October. And we continue to expand our points of presence by adding more than 100 of our profitable mobile stand-alone stores across the country year-to-date, bringing our total to more than 280 stores. Tablets have been very popular so far this holiday with continued triple digit growth in the category, resulting in significant share gains for us. This growth is coming from the continued strength of iPads, coupled with the increasing popularity of Android-based models. 
We believe our Tablet Central strategy has positioned us to capitalize on the momentum this new product is bringing the industry. Importantly, we anticipate that tablets will we be one of the first areas where we leverage our expanded connection strategy as we grow profitable connections revenue beyond just mobile phones.
eReaders are seeing similar trends as tablets and are proving to be very popular gift items this season. We have been leveraging the introduction of the new Kindle Fire and the Nook to drive triple digit growth, new customers and share gains in eReaders. Appliances continued its strong momentum, with the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comps and continued share gains. As we discussed last quarter, we expected the gaming industry would improve with more new titles in the second half. However, industry sales have been weaker than we anticipated so far in the second half. While we're pleased with the strong demand we saw over Black Friday weekend, we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. 
As you recall, we'd had conservative assumptions for TVs for this year, based on consumer demand. The good news is that TVs did pickup compared to expectations. Our total TV units grew over 10% in the quarter, delivering a TV comp that was down slightly. Growth was stronger in large screen sizes. Units in this segment were up more than 15% and comps were in the positive mid-single digits. Additionally, our Magnolia Home Theater business continued to deliver mid-double-digit comparable store sales gains. While we're not yet ready to declare a new trend in TVs, our third quarter performance represents a significant change compared to declines we and the industry experienced the last several quarters. We have also stabilized TV share and have actually driven share gains through October.
Connections are a key component to our growth strategy, and overall connections grew 8% in the quarter, driven by Best Buy Mobile. As an example of the potential for expanding connections beyond phones, mobile postpaid broadband cards grew 50% in Q3 and 60% during Black Friday weekend.
Moving on to our International business this quarter. Our International business delivered strong gross margin improvement and operating income growth of over 80%. The highlight was the very strong margin performance from our business in Canada. Our International performance also reflects the benefit of restructuring in Turkey and China from earlier this year. And we expect to see continued positive impact in our International segment as a result of our strategic actions announced November 7.
Five Star flat comps for the quarter, driven largely by lower industry appliance sales. Five Star continues to be an important part of our International strategy, and we continue to build our footprint of stores in China.
Through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, we generated $2 billion in free cash flow, on track to meeting our adjusted free cash flow objective of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the end of the year. This year, you have seen us continue to deploy cash to make investments in proven and profitable businesses like Best Buy Mobile, services and Five Star. We are on target to purchase approximately $1.5 billion of our stock for the fiscal year 2012. Given our strong cash flow, current valuation and the existing board authorization, we intend to continue buybacks going forward. 
Rolling up the quarter, I'm especially pleased with the improved momentum in Q3 and our success in driving the top line. As I mentioned earlier, given the current landscape, value-conscious consumers in a competitive promotional environment, we are making purposeful decisions that focus on revenue and market share, while still planning to achieve our earnings commitment for the year. We will continue to focus on lowering costs.
We've also accelerated our efforts to grow operating income with strategic expansion in more profitable areas, such as connections and services in a very capital-efficient way. 
To summarize, while it's still early in the holiday season, we're pleased with our start. We're excited about momentum we've seen in hot products like mobile phones, tablets and eReaders for the rest of the holiday season and we remain confident about our ability to execute on our strategy, deliver our key objectives and meet our earnings outlook.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for more details on our financial performance."
255397,144179296,201312,"Best Buy Co. Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 13, 2011",2011-12-13,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today I plan on covering the financial highlights of our third quarter results, along with some additional  context on our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Before we get into the details of the quarter, f",2175,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today I plan on covering the financial highlights of our third quarter results, along with some additional  context on our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Before we get into the details of the quarter, for the benefit of our listeners who might be newer to the Best Buy story, it's worth mentioning that the Q3 results we are discussing today really reflect 2 different periods of consumer purchase behavior. 
First is a non-holiday period, including activity in September and October; and second is the beginnings of the important holiday selling season in November, especially the big Black Friday kickoff weekend. Looking back on the past several years, we have learned that it is important to assess the performance for the full November and December period to get a more complete view of customer behavior and performance for the holidays. For Best Buy, this is especially relevant considering the significant weighting of earnings derived from the month of December. This was also part of the rationale to change our fiscal year, which will result in the month of November, December and January being reported together in our new Q4 next year. Given that as important context, as we look at our Q3 results and current expectations for the fourth quarter, we believe that we remain on track to deliver both the revenue and adjusted earnings performance for the year, consistent with the guidance ranges that we discussed on last quarter's call.
Moving into the highlights from the third quarter. Our Domestic business delivered both positive store traffic and comparable store sales growth. This was the first period that we've seen positive Domestic comps since the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In-store traffic is growing for the first time since Q3 of FY '10. Customer response to our multichannel offers were strong, and we performed well in the most popular CE categories for the holidays. Our online sales performance also accelerated significantly in the quarter as Brian discussed earlier.
We were pleased with our top line results and the improvements in our traffic metrics during the quarter. The investments we made to improve sales and market share, coupled with customer purchases that were more heavily weighted towards value and promotional items, resulted in a lower gross profit rate in the quarter. I'll provide more color on that in a minute, but the big takeaway is that these activities paid off in positive comparable store sales growth of 1% for the quarter that were strengthened by November and concluded with a plus 7% sales growth on Black Friday.
The biggest positive sales drivers in the Q3 Domestic comp included tablets, appliances, eReaders, mobile phones and movies. Total mobile computing had very strong comparable store sales growth of 16% in the quarter. Within this performance, notebook comp sales trends improved for the third straight quarter, delivering a mid-single-digit decline that was slightly ahead of our plan for the quarter. Appliances continued its momentum with comparable store sales growth of 14%. The operational changes we've made in the appliance area and the improved competitive offers continue to help us grow our market share in this business.
eReader products delivered triple digit comps that once again had a meaningful impact on the total Domestic segment revenue growth. Consistent with our commentary in the second quarter call, the mobile phone business benefited from the launch of the new iPhone 4S halfway through our third quarter, as well as other new devices introduced during the period. These new devices were a key driver of the 9% comparable store sales gain achieved during the quarter in mobile phones. We expect even stronger growth in mobile phones during our fourth quarter given that these products will be available for the full quarter.
The movies category also delivered comparable store sales growth as we drove strong promotional activity in this area to improve traffic. Movie sales also benefited from a stronger lineup of new releases that occurred during the quarter. As Brian highlighted earlier, our online channel was critical in driving growth throughout the quarter and especially in November and Black Friday weekend. The 20% increase in Q3 online sales was led by double-digit growth across nearly all key product categories, with tablets, televisions and laptops having the biggest impact.
Television comparable store sales trends improved significantly, down low-single digits versus the double-digit declines in previous quarters. This was above our plan and represents an important improvement on one of our largest businesses. Notable areas of Domestic segment comparable store sales declined during the quarter included digital imaging and gaming. Digital imaging's revenue decline was due to continued overall industry softness and the decline in gaming was driven by industry weakness, primarily on gaming hardware. Total gaming comparable store sales did show meaningful improvement from the prior quarter, led by high single-digit growth in gaming software, driven by strength in both new and pre-owned titles. 
Sales in our International segment increased 1%, with favorable impact of foreign currency and net new store growth offset by a 1.7% comparable store sales decline. Our Five Star business in China delivered flat comparable store sales, which included a strong Golden Week performance. Best Buy Europe experienced mid-single-digit comp declines similar to the trend experienced in Q2. In Canada comp sales were flat, reflecting a strong sequential improvement from the prior quarter when comps were down high single digits.
Key improvements versus the prior quarter came in areas like gaming, software computing and televisions. 
Turning now to gross profit performance in the quarter, total gross profit of $2.9 billion was down 1%. Domestic gross profit dollars declined 3% as the rate declined 130 basis points after being up approximately 90 basis points in the previous year. From a macro perspective, the decline in the Domestic gross profit rate was driven by a combination of investments we made in promotional activity in key categories and customers purchasing more value-orientated items.
Getting into the specifics, the 130-point basis reduction was driven by much stronger promotional activity, notably in mobile computing, televisions and movies versus the previous year. Within the television and computing categories, consumers also purchased a relatively higher mix of value-orientated priced items. We also saw strong consumer demand in mobile computing products, which have lower gross margin rate on average. And finally, similar to last quarter, our successful tech support service offering had a negative impact on our year-over-year gross profit rate. 
As discussed last quarter, revenue and profits from this program are recognized over the life of the agreement, which is typically 1 to 2 years. While that explains the key drivers of the rate decline from last year, the appropriate follow-up question is why was the decline larger than was anticipated at the beginning of the quarter? Our original plans for Q3 anticipated the Domestic gross profit rate that would be down less than this. I would point to 3 key areas which drove the majority of the difference between our actual and expected results. 
First, during the quarter we made incremental decisions to invest in additional promotional activity. We focused these actions on areas with competitive opportunities like computing, television and movies, and we're satisfied with the strong response we saw from consumers. Second, consistent with my earlier comments, consumer purchases mixed more heavily into promotional and value items. Consumers' response was strongest in lower margin computing and promoted televisions and movies. And lastly, a higher mix of our sales during the quarter took place in the month of November and especially Black Friday, which is more promotional by nature.
Within the International segment, gross profit dollars increased 4%. This dollar growth was the result of foreign currency exchange rates and a rate increase of 80 basis points. Rate strength was driven by continued work by our Canadian team to improve promotional effectiveness in large categories like notebooks and televisions. We are also benefiting from the actions we've taken in our International portfolio to exit the lower margin big box test stores in China and Turkey.
Another key story from Q3 is the continued progress we have made to lower expenses and help fund the pricing and promotional investments discussed above. Excluding the impact of FX, total company SG&A was actually flat during the quarter. We have driven spending reductions in discretionary areas and have improved labor effectiveness while increasing our TV and online advertising to build traffic and awareness. Fiscal year-to-date, total SG&A expense versus the prior year excluding FX is essentially flat.
Strong International operating growth of over 80% in the quarter and excellent SG&A cost control partially mitigated the total company operating income declined of 15% in the quarter. The overall decline was driven almost entirely by the lower gross profit rate in Domestic business. 
We continue to generate significant cash. Free cash flow through the third quarter was very strong at $2 billion. FY '12 cash flow has benefited from the reversal of year-end timing items that we have previously discussed and from proactive management of our inventory. In fact, our Domestic comparable store inventories finished down 11% in the third quarter. As Brian said, we are currently on track to deliver our adjusted free cash flow target for the year of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
Before we move on to our outlook, I also wanted to call your attention to a couple of other items included in our Q3 results. During the quarter, we incurred a total of $150 million of pretax restructuring costs that were largely associated with the planned closure of the 11 big box pilot stores in the U.K. These charges were consistent with our previous announcement on this matter.
Also within the quarter, we sold our investments in the shares of TalkTalk Group PLC and Carphone Warehouse Group PLC. The $55 million pretax gain associated with these transactions, or $0.13 of EPS, has been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.47 for the third quarter. 
With the Q3 summary behind us, let's move on to talk about our outlook for the balance of the year. As I mentioned upfront, we continue to expect adjusted annual diluted EPS in the range of $3.35 to $3.65, consistent with the previous guidance when excluding the items outlined in today's release and by Bill at the outset of this call.
Based on where we see the consumer, the competitive environment and our expectations for the balance of the year, we are updating a couple of items in our full year outlook to arrive at the adjusted EPS range for our outlook. Summarizing the key elements of our updated outlook, our revenue range has remained unchanged for the entire year at $51 billion to $52.5 billion, representing full year comp sales of flat to down 3%. Based on our year-to-date sales and our expectations for Q4, we currently expect to finish around the midpoint of this dollar range. 
We now expect the full year gross profit rate to decline approximately 50 basis points. This includes a fourth quarter gross profit rate that is a modest decline compared to the prior year and better than the rate decline in Q3. The improvement in the sequential Q4 rate is based on a few key items. First, an improved Domestic rate in computing as promotional investments were more heavily weighted to Q3. Also in computing, we have reduced inventory transition costs due to lower levels of inventory this year. And the impact of tech support is expected to be less of a drag given the timing recognition of deferred revenue on this program. 
Also within Domestic, we anticipate a lower mix of gain in sales and reduced year-over-year promotions in movies, both of which should improve the rates relative to Q3. Finally, we also expect to improve International gross margins, primarily a function of easier comparisons and from the impact of incremental vendor programs both in Europe and Five Star in Q4.
To offset the impact of lower gross margin expectations, we have also lowered our SG&A for the year. We now expect full year SG&A dollar growth to be approximately 2%. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in FY '12 and FX, SG&A is now planned to be slightly down for the full year. So rolling it all up, our expectations on total operating income dollars remained within our prior range, which was a 5% decline to 2% growth. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.65 represents a range of down 2% to up 6%. 
In closing, we were pleased with the traffic and sales improvement in the quarter and the successful execution of the Black Friday weekend. The holiday season is just getting started and we clearly have a lot of business still in front of us this year. We believe that we have taken strong and aggressive steps to position ourselves for the balance of the holidays and to deliver our performance commitments for the year.
So with that, Alicia, we're ready to take the questions."

And certainly given the weighting of our earnings in Q4, we had planned operating profit to be up in Q4. We still expect it to be up in Q4. But I think the core point of your first question is where do we see the opportunities in the business to grow both the top line and to grow the gross margin dollars in the business. And consistent with Brian's response, Michael, we are investing into higher margins basis around connections and services. And actually, we saw some comparable store sales growth in Q3. The key for us is to make sure that our relevance stays high with consumers and we get the opportunity to grow those businesses given the footsteps we will have both in-store and online. So we've got to bring that mix to the right level of top line growth and margin growth. But one thing is for certain, we're not going to be able to execute our strategies in growing connections and services without the strong foot traffic and brand relevance that comes along with it. And secondly, in order to grow operating income, we've got to sell the more profitable mix of products and we're seeing progress in that space, to Brian's point, around what's happening in mobility and services. We also have significant opportunities to continue to work on our cost structure, which you've also seen great progress on this year. So it's going to take a combination of all those factors, but we're certainly encouraged by where we're starting to see some of our biggest business display. As we mentioned upfront, we had very conservative assumptions for what the notebook category was going to do this year and the television category and year-to-date, we're exceeding our expectations on both of those 2 very big businesses. So in light of the macro headwinds and what we see in the CE industry, we're using this time to make sure that we may remain relevant with customers from a traffic standpoint, while focusing on the profitable growth opportunities that will actually grow op income going forward. Probably a way longer answer than you're looking for, Mike, but I appreciate the question around about finding that balance and making sure we drive op income going forward."

And we have done work on rationalizing some of our square footage. But again, I need to remind the audience, Gary, we believe that installed base of stores is a huge advantage with us. The way customers are leveraging our website, the way customers are gravitating to an in-store pickup type environment, the way the services business and the connections business is growing, and I'll just remind everybody on the call that connections business, about $150 billion of it is addressable by us a year, and we have about a 1% share of that. We see that as a massive growth opportunity. Those stores are a very important place for us to do that customer acquisition and make those connections with customers. We are doing a lot of work in getting our stores rightsized where we think that makes sense. So for me it's not about closing huge tranches of stores, it's about being where the customer needs us to be, online, in stores, on the phone and it's about us being priced competitively so that we can get into the world of connections and attachments and services that help customers put this technology and service of what it is they're trying to do.

As Brian talked about, the key focus of us resetting the stores to perform stronger in a connected world also gives us the opportunity as we focus on the big improvements that, that will drive to the operating model.

We continue to be on track to deliver the square footage reduction that we've talked about over the 3- to 5-year window. Last quarter, I gave a little update on the progress we had made on the first tranches of stores. We're actually doing a few more stores this year than we had planned, and we remain on track to see anywhere between 10% to 15% square footage reduction in those stores. But just back to Brian's broader point, that work is being done in service of making the operating model better, the efficiencies that we'll get out of the SG&A cost. That's a small portion of the story. The bigger portion of the story is the gains we'll see in growth and services and in connections while we increase those points of presence."

It's Jim. Looking at that from a couple different perspective, one of the things we've continued to see in the quarter is that our relative attach rate of services across the board is primarily driven by the price points people are purchasing at or above computing items and television items. When we look at the attachment rate across those price points, they have actually held pretty stable and in some cases have actually grown year-over-year. My comments around the mix of what people are buying in lower dollar value in more promotional items, as they skew more into those, those generally come with a lower attach rate. So by ASPs by brand [ph] we've seen attach rates pretty consistent with previous years and actually growth in a number of the categories. But when our mix shifts to lower ASP items, we see a little less attach in that space. To the comment Mike Vitelli made earlier, also it's beginning to more promotional periods around November. Those are typically just lower attach months in general, just given the velocity with which we're moving traffic through the store during -- especially the Black Friday promotional weekend, weekend."

There's a number of different things going on there. Let me unpack that for you a little bit. First and foremost, we're very pleased with the way that we've managed the balance sheet this year, especially the inventory levels within the business. If you recall last year in Q3, inventories grew pretty substantially based on a softer level of sales than we anticipated last year. So a lot of the improvement that you're seeing year-over-year in inventory is based on we had too high inventories at the end of last Q3. We've done a much more effective job and it had stronger sales this year that's one component of it. Another component of it is related to some of the timing differences we talked about at year end around our payables and receivable positions. We knew that we had benefits coming in Q1 and Q2 of this year, which we've been talking about all year long. That's lifting the cash, free cash flow from those items. The other item that you mentioned specifically is the growth in accounts receivable, principally driven by 2 things. As our mobile phone business continues to grow, the bounties that were due from the carriers are a higher percentage of our receivables overall. That's one part of the growth. The other anomaly that sits a little bit in Q3 is just given the strength of our Black Friday sales, a lot of the credit card receivables we generated over the Black Friday weekend don't get collected until the next week. So we get a little bit of just a timing issue at the year end, at the quarter end of Q3 around that piece. So those are the 2 biggest pieces that explain what's going on in the receivable balance. In general, though, as we look forward to the end of the year, we're going to be in a much better accounts payable position than we were at year end. Our inventories won't be down as much as they are in Q3 because by the time we got to the end of Q4 last year, we had managed down a lot of the inventories. But we are still going to be in that camp of free cash flow $2 billion to $2.5 billion. So we're very happy and satisfied with the progress the teams have made on driving our cash flow for the year."

Part of our goal, obviously, is to manage that portfolio and hold expenses flat to bring them down while still funding those profitable growth levers in the business.
