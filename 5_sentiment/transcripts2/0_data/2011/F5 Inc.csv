In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved strong revenue growth and operating results reflecting another quarter of solid execution. Revenue of $268.9 million increased 41% year-over-year and was within our guided range of $265 mil",723,"Thank you, John. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved strong revenue growth and operating results reflecting another quarter of solid execution. Revenue of $268.9 million increased 41% year-over-year and was within our guided range of $265 million to $270 million. GAAP EPS of $0.68 per diluted share was above our guidance range of $0.62 to $0.64. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per diluted share was also above our guidance of $0.80 to $0.82. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS results reflect the benefit of approximately $0.04 related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
Product revenue of $171.5 million grew 44% year-over-year and represented 64% of total revenue. Service revenue of $97.4 million grew 35% year-over-year and accounted for 36% of total revenue. Book to bill for the quarter was less than one. By region, the Americas represented 59% of revenue; EMEA accounted for 22%; APAC, 13%; and Japan, 6%.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $261.7 million. As a reminder, we are now including FirePass product as a component of our ADN [Application Delivery Networking] revenue results. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization products was $7.2 million, essentially flat with the prior quarter and up 27% year-over-year.
During Q1, the financial vertical accounted for 19% of sales; telco was 21%; and technology was also 21%. Total government was 12% including 7% from U.S. federal.
In Q1, we had one greater than 10% distributor, Avnet, which represented 18.8% of total revenue. Moving down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 81.8%. Excluding approximately $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 82.6%.
GAAP operating expenses of $140.1 million were within our target range of $137 million to $141 million. Excluding $20.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $119.4 million.
GAAP operating margin was 29.7%. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 38.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 32.4%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.5%. These rates were lower than our guidance of 36.5% for GAAP and 35% for non-GAAP due to the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. And Q1 rates reflect both the tax benefit of Q1 as well as the retroactive impact of the R&D tax credit applied to quarters two, three and four of fiscal 2010.
On the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $103.1 million contributing to total cash and investments of $952.3 million at quarter end. DSO at the end of Q1 was 48 days. Inventories at quarter end were $18.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% sequentially to $287.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.5 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was up $5.3 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,130 employees, an increase of 120 from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 198,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.43 for a total of $25 million. Approximately 213 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase programs.
Looking ahead to Q2. We see our core drivers continuing to generate significant growth opportunity going forward, and we anticipate continued momentum in Q2 and through the remainder of the year. For the current quarter, we are targeting revenue in the range of $275 million to $280 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 81% to 82%. Including approximately $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $142 million to $146 million. This includes approximately $20 million of stock-based compensation expense. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.65 to $0.67 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.84 to $0.86 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 36%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect  non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid-40-day range. We expect inventory levels in the range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $90 million, which includes the impact of two large tax payments due in Q2 for our normal tax payments schedule. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John Adams."

The F5 team delivered a large set of solid results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. All our major geographic regions produced strong year-over-year and quarterly sequential revenue growth. The star of the qu",883,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. The F5 team delivered a large set of solid results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. All our major geographic regions produced strong year-over-year and quarterly sequential revenue growth. The star of the quarter was the Asia-Pacific region, which produced over 60% year-over-year growth. Japan's growth over last year was just under 35%, and the Americas growth was over 40%. The EMEA region, which delivered a very strong quarter in Q1 last year, was up 29% from a year ago.
Once again, our Services business delivered stellar results, 35% year-over-year services growth and 9% sequential growth combined with a 36% year-over-year increase to deferred revenue all point to future services revenue growth throughout fiscal 2011. As Andy indicated, our overall financial metrics are very strong in Q1. Cash from operations was at an all-time high of $103 million and our non-GAAP operating margin was about 38%.
From a product perspective, our ADC business continued to be the main driver of our overall growth. We had very strong sales of our flagship VIPRION product line last quarter. Sales of our application security module, ASM [Application Security Manager], were also very solid as customers around the world focused more attention and resources on security at the application level. Sales of Edge, our next generation multitask offering, APM, our optimized access cloud management solution and our one optimization module continues to generate significant interest from our customer base. We believe this interest will translate into significant revenue growth for this exciting solutions throughout the year.
Q1 revenue from our ARX file utilization product line was essentially flat over last quarter and was below our internal expectations. Towards the end of last quarter, we had a number of forecasted deals pushed out into Q2, and we expect to see improvement and sequential growth on ARX sales this coming quarter. 
Last quarter, we announced some very important products to supplement ARX product family. The ARX cloud extender is an add on to ARX and significantly expands our existing file treating solutions by allowing customers to intelligently tier to the cloud. We have now support for the intelligent tiering of files to Amazon SD cloud services as well as natively supporting Iron Mountain's DSS, a net app storage-based solutions. We expect similar support from other major cloud services throughout the year. 
We are also developing a software-only version of the ARX, the ARX virtualization. ARX VE should promote an increase in proof of concept trials for our ARX products as well as providing the opportunity to enlist more strategic partners for this software-only solution. We are also on track to release two new midrange platforms, the ARX 1500 and the ARX 2500, both of which are exceeding our performance expectations.
Overall, we have made good progress with the product roadmap and expect to deliver some very significant products to market this year. We expect to begin beta-test this quarter on our Victoria project. Victoria marks the introduction of VIPRION capabilities into the midrange of our product line. TMOS version 11 is also expected to transition to beta testing where we will begin to validate in customer environment a number of new features including Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing, VCMP, a new module on the visibility of application performance, AVR, a new generation version of our application templates that provide a new management tier to scale and manage applications called IR, as well as a sophisticated range of clustered management capabilities. These exciting new features will allow F5 customers to implement, manage, optimize and expand large-scale data centers by leveraging cloud-based architectures and virtualization.
TMOS version 11 will introduce the virtual additions of our ASM and GDM products. V11 also includes a number of new features targeted at mobile and service provider markets such as additional support for IPV 6 and new service provider oriented iRule. In addition, we plan to release version of the BIG-IP 1150 and the VIPRION PV 200 blade. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, I feel very optimistic about our business prospects for the remainder of fiscal 2011. As we stated at the beginning of this fiscal year, we expect to deliver sequential growth in each quarter of fiscal 2011. We entered Q2 with a robust pipeline of future business, which continues to grow and includes a number of multimillion dollar opportunities. 
In addition, we have made significant investments in growing our sales team headcount, which should produce productivity gains as we progress throughout the year. The market growth drivers for our business remain very much intact and includes continued increase in storage requirements, global data center consolidation projects, growth in mobile data and mobile applications and increasing awareness of the importance and need for application security and secure policy driven accessibility and the evolving opportunity with cloud architecture solutions.
Also we are seeing continued growth opportunity associated with virtualization, and F5 is increasingly being recognized as the de facto ADC solution for virtualization initiatives. F5 solutions occupies strategic control points across global data centers. And we are extremely well-positioned to take advantage of these market drivers. In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter. 
And with that, we're going to hand the call over for Q&A."

In terms of the bigger picture with the ADC revenue, we did see some disparity in October, especially in the last week of the month of October, which was much lower than normal than what we would normally see. And November and December were pretty much on track from what we tend to expect. Although we saw some deal slip, frankly, it wasn't significantly beyond what we would normally expect but at the beginning of October, the last week in October month, we thought we'd catch up maybe with some budget loss but that didn't happen."

So it's taking a lot of the benefits that we get out of the VIPRION architecture, our chassis base, being able to VoIP if you need more capacity, all the high-availability and scale for manipulation that you need and bringing that into mid level of the our product range. And we believe that will be a different significant differentiator for us, certainly within the enterprise and convert all our competitors out there. And we'll bring some very, very good things. For a lot of the application level modules that we offer out there on the security side and the acceleration side. So required after on that."

We've put a lot of effort into it the last couple of weeks, looking at the pipeline, analyzing it, the face-to-face meeting that I talked about. We are assuming a book to bill equal to one in our guidance, and we are assuming hopefully a conservative close rate in the pipeline. In fact, slightly reduced close rates from last quarter, which are in fact the previous three quarters. So we'll see where that ends up. I think our guidance is realistic."

The question is whether that you think the product growth rate could go back up to this 10% level? And whether we should model it this way or not. So that's question number two, I know we don't have time and maybe we can take it offline. But the question is the decline in growth rate, is it because the underlying growth in the market is slowing down?

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved strong revenue growth and operating results reflecting another quarter of solid execution. Revenue of $268.9 million increased 41% year-over-year and was within our guided range of $265 million to $270 million. GAAP EPS of $0.68 per diluted share was above our guidance range of $0.62 to $0.64. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per diluted share was also above our guidance of $0.80 to $0.82. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS results reflect the benefit of approximately $0.04 related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
Product revenue of $171.5 million grew 44% year-over-year and represented 64% of total revenue. Service revenue of $97.4 million grew 35% year-over-year and accounted for 36% of total revenue. Book to bill for the quarter was less than one. By region, the Americas represented 59% of revenue; EMEA accounted for 22%; APAC, 13%; and Japan, 6%.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $261.7 million. As a reminder, we are now including FirePass product as a component of our ADN [Application Delivery Networking] revenue results. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization products was $7.2 million, essentially flat with the prior quarter and up 27% year-over-year.
During Q1, the financial vertical accounted for 19% of sales; Telco was 21%; and technology was also 21%. Total government was 12% including 7% from U.S. federal. In Q1, we had one greater than 10% distributor, Avnet, which represented 18.8% of total revenue. 
Moving down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 81.8%. Excluding approximately $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 82.6%.
GAAP operating expenses of $140.1 million were within our target range of $137 million to $141 million. Excluding $20.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $119.4 million.
GAAP operating margin was 29.7%. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 38.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 32.4%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.5%. These rates were lower than our guidance of 36.5% for GAAP and 35% for non-GAAP due to the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. And Q1 rates reflect both the tax benefit on Q1 as well as the retroactive impact of the R&D tax credit applied to quarters two, three and four of fiscal 2010.
On the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $103.1 million contributing to total cash and investments of $952.3 million at quarter end. DSO at the end of Q1 was 48 days. Inventories at quarter end were $18.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% sequentially to $287.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.5 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was up $5.3 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,130 employees, an increase of 120 from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 198,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.43 per share for a total of $25 million. Approximately 213 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase programs.
Looking ahead to Q2. We see our core drivers continuing to generate significant growth opportunity going forward, and we anticipate continued momentum in Q2 and through the remainder of the year. For the current quarter, we are targeting revenue in the range of $275 million to $280 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 81% to 82%. Including approximately $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $142 million to $146 million. This includes approximately $20 million of stock-based compensation expense. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.65 to $0.67 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.84 to $0.86 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 36%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid-40-day range. We expect inventory levels in the range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $90 million, which includes the impact of two large tax payments due in Q2 for our normal tax payments schedule. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

All our major geographic regions produced strong year-over-year and quarterly sequential revenue growth. The star of the quarter was the Asia-Pacific region, which produced over 60% year-over-year growth. Japan's growth over last year was just under 35%, and the Americas growth was over 40%. The EMEA region, which delivered a very strong quarter in Q1 last year, was up 29% from a year ago.
Once again, our Services business produced stellar results, 35% year-over-year services growth and 9% sequential growth combined with a 36% year-over-year increase to deferred revenue all point to future services revenue growth throughout fiscal 2011. As Andy indicated, our overall financial metrics are very strong in Q1. Cash from operations was at an all-time high of $103 million and our non-GAAP operating margin was about 38%.
From a product perspective, our ADC business continued to be the main driver of our overall growth. We had very strong sales of our flagship VIPRION product line last quarter. Sales of our application security module, ASM [Application Security Manager], were also very solid as customers around the world focused more attention and resources on security at the application level. Sales of Edge, our next generation multitask offering, APM, our optimized Access Policy Management solution and our one optimization module continues to generate significant interest from our customer base. We believe this interest will translate into significant revenue growth for this exciting solutions throughout the year.
Q1 revenue from our ARX file utilization product line was essentially flat over last quarter and was below our internal expectations. Towards the end of last quarter, we had a number of forecasted deals pushed out into Q2, and we expect to see improvement and sequential growth on ARX sales this coming quarter. 
Last quarter, we announced some very important products to supplement ARX product family. The ARX cloud extender is an add on to ARX and significantly expands our existing file tiering solutions by allowing customers to intelligently tier to the cloud. We are now in support for the intelligent tiering of files to Amazon SD cloud services as well as natively supporting Iron Mountain's VSS, a net app storage-based solutions. We expect similar support from other major cloud storage services throughout the year. 
We are also developing a software-only version of the ARX, the ARX virtualization. ARX VE should promote an increase in proof of concept trials for our ARX products as well as providing the opportunity to enlist more strategic partners for this software-only solution. We are also on track to release two new mid-range platforms, the ARX 1500 and the ARX 2500, both of which are exceeding our performance expectations.
Overall, we have made good progress with the product roadmap and expect to deliver some very significant products to market this year. We expect to begin beta-test this quarter on our Victoria project. Victoria marks the introduction of VIPRION chassis capabilities into the midrange of our product line. TMOS version 11 is also expected to transition to beta testing where we will begin to validate in customer environment a number of new features including Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing, VCMP, a new module on the visibility of application performance, AVR, a new generation version of our application templates that provide a new management tier to scale and manage applications called IR, as well as a sophisticated range of clustered management capabilities. These exciting new features will allow F5 customers to implement, manage, optimize and expand large-scale data centers by leveraging cloud-based architectures and virtualization.
TMOS version 11 will introduce the virtual additions of our ASM and GTM products. V11 also includes a number of new features targeted as a mobile and service provider markets such as additional support for IPv6, a new service provider oriented iRules. In addition, we plan to release version of the BIG-IP 1150 and the VIPRION PB200 blade. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, I feel very optimistic about our business prospects for the remainder of fiscal 2011. As we stated at the beginning of this fiscal year, we expect to deliver sequential growth in each quarter of fiscal 2011. We entered Q2 with a robust pipeline of future business, which continues to grow and includes a number of multi-million dollar opportunities. 
In addition, we have made significant investments in growing our sales team headcount, which should produce productivity gains as we progress throughout the year. The market growth drivers for our business remain very much intact and includes continued increase in storage requirements, global data center consolidation projects, growth in mobile data and mobile applications and increasing awareness of the importance and need for application security and secure policy-driven accessibility and the evolving opportunity with cloud architecture solutions.
Also, we are seeing continued growth opportunity associated with virtualization, and F5 is increasingly being recognized as the de facto ADC solution for virtualization initiatives. F5 solutions occupies strategic control points across global data centers. And we are extremely well positioned to take advantage of these market drivers. In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter. 
And with that, we're going to hand the call over for Q&A."

And whether we should model it this way or not. So that's question number one. Question number two, I know we don't have time and maybe we can take it offline.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved strong revenue growth and operating results reflecting another quarter of solid execution. Revenue of $268.9 million increased 41% year-over-year and was within our guided range of $265 million to $270 million. GAAP EPS of $0.68 per diluted share was above our guided range of $0.62 to $0.64. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per diluted share was also above our guidance of $0.80 to $0.82. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS results reflect the benefit of approximately $0.04 related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
Product revenue of $171.5 million grew 44% year-over-year and represented 64% of total revenue. Service revenue of $97.4 million grew 35% year-over-year and accounted for 36% of total revenue. Book to bill for the quarter was less than one. By region, the Americas represented 59% of revenue; EMEA accounted for 22%; APAC, 13%; and Japan, 6%.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $261.7 million. As a reminder, we are now including FirePass product as a component of our ADN [Application Delivery Networking] revenue results. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization products was $7.2 million, essentially flat with the prior quarter and up 27% year-over-year.
During Q1, the financial vertical accounted for 19% of sales; Telco was 21%; and technology was also 21%. Total government was 12% including 7% from U.S. federal. In Q1, we had one greater than 10% distributor, Avnet, which represented 18.8% of total revenue. 
Moving down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 81.8%. Excluding approximately $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 82.6%.
GAAP operating expenses of $140.1 million were within our target range of $137 million to $141 million. Excluding $20.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $119.4 million.
GAAP operating margin was 29.7%. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 38.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 32.4%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.5%. These rates were lower than our guidance of 36.5% for GAAP and 35% for non-GAAP due to the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. And Q1 rates reflect both the tax benefit on Q1 as well as the retroactive impact of the R&D tax credit applied to quarters two, three and four of fiscal 2010.
On the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $103.1 million contributing to total cash and investments of $952.3 million at quarter end. DSO at the end of Q1 was 48 days. Inventories at quarter end were $18.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% sequentially to $287.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.5 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.3 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,130 employees, an increase of 120 from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 198,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.43 per share for a total of $25 million. Approximately 213 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase programs.
Looking ahead to Q2. We see our core drivers continuing to generate significant growth opportunity going forward, and we anticipate continued momentum in Q2 and through the remainder of the year. For the current quarter, we are targeting revenue in the range of $275 million to $280 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 81% to 82%. Including approximately $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $142 million to $146 million. This includes approximately $20 million of stock-based compensation expense. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.65 to $0.67 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.84 to $0.86 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 36%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid-40-day range. We expect inventory levels in the range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $90 million, which includes the impact of two large tax payments due in Q2 for our normal tax payment schedule. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

The star of the qu",885,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. The F5 team delivered another set of solid results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. All our major geographic regions produced strong year-over-year and quarterly sequential revenue growth. The star of the quarter was the Asia-Pacific region, which produced over 60% year-over-year growth. Japan's growth over last year was just under 35%, and the Americas growth was over 40%. The EMEA region, which delivered a very strong quarter in Q1 last year, was up 29% from a year ago.
Once again, our Services business produced stellar results, 35% year-over-year services growth and 9% sequential growth combined with a 36% year-over-year increase to deferred revenue all point to future services revenue growth throughout fiscal 2011. As Andy indicated, our overall financial metrics are very strong in Q1. Cash from operations was at an all-time high of $103 million and our non-GAAP operating margin was about 38%.
From a product perspective, our ADC business continued to be the main driver of our overall growth. We had very strong sales of our flagship VIPRION product line last quarter. Sales of our application security module, ASM [Application Security Manager], were also very solid as customers around the world focused more attention and resources on security at the application level. Sales of Edge, our next generation multitask offering, APM, our optimized Access Policy Management solution and our one optimization module continues to generate significant interest from our customer base. We believe this interest will translate into significant revenue growth for these exciting solutions throughout the year.
Q1 revenue from our ARX file virtualization product line was essentially flat over last quarter and was below our internal expectations. Towards the end of last quarter, we had a number of forecasted deals pushed out into Q2, and we expect to see improvement and sequential growth on ARX sales this coming quarter. 
Last quarter, we announced some very important products to supplement ARX product family. The ARX cloud extender is an add on to ARX and significantly expands our existing file tiering solutions by allowing customers to intelligently tier to the cloud. We announced support for the intelligent tiering of files to Amazon SD cloud services as well as natively supporting Iron Mountain's VSS, a net app storage-based solutions. We expect to announce similar support for other major cloud storage services throughout the year. 
We are also developing a software-only version of the ARX, the ARX virtualization. ARX VE should promote an increase in proof of concept trials for our ARX products as well as providing the opportunity to enlist more strategic partners for this software-only solution. We are also on track to release two new mid-range platforms, the ARX 1500 and the ARX 2500, both of which are exceeding our performance expectations.
Overall, we have made good progress with the product roadmap and expect to deliver some very significant products to market this year. We expect to begin beta-tests this quarter on our Victoria project. Victoria marks the introduction of VIPRION chassis capabilities into the midrange of our product line. TMOS version 11 is also expected to transition to beta testing where we will begin to validate in customer environments a number of new features including Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing, VCMP, a new module on the visibility of application performance, AVR, a new generation version of our application templates that provide a new management tier to scale and manage applications called IR, as well as a sophisticated range of clustered management capabilities. These exciting new features will allow F5 customers to implement, manage, optimize and expand large-scale data centers by leveraging cloud-based architectures and virtualization.
TMOS version 11 will introduce the virtual additions of our ASM and GTM products. V11 also includes a number of new features targeted at the mobile and service provider markets such as additional support for IPv6, a new service provider oriented iRules. In addition, we plan to release [indiscernible] (27:13) version of the BIG-IP 1150 and the VIPRION PB200 blade. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, I feel very optimistic about our business prospects for the remainder of fiscal 2011. As we stated at the beginning of the fiscal year, we expect to deliver sequential growth in each quarter of fiscal 2011. We entered Q2 with a robust pipeline of future business, which continues to grow and includes a number of multi-million dollar opportunities. 
In addition, we have made significant investments in growing our sales team headcount, which should produce productivity gains as we progress throughout the year. The market growth drivers for our business remain very much intact and includes continued increase in storage requirements, global data center consolidation projects, growth in mobile data and mobile applications and increasing awareness of the importance and need for application security and secure policy-driven accessibility and the evolving opportunity with cloud architecture solutions.
Also, we are seeing continued growth opportunities associated with virtualization, and F5 is increasingly being recognized as the de facto ADC solution for virtualization initiatives. F5 solutions occupies strategic control points across global data centers. And we are extremely well positioned to take advantage of these market drivers. In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. 
And with that, we’ll now hand the call over for Q&A."

And November and December were pretty much on track for what we tend to expect. Although we saw some deals slip, and frankly, it wasn't significantly beyond what we would normally expect.

So I wonder if you could talk about what your thinking there is. Also, I wanted to follow up on Brian's question on new products. It does feel an awful lot like with the confidence you guys have in H2, there is some Osborne effect going on. And so I just wondered if you could comment on the type of pipeline you think you've got for H2. Is it for these new products or is it just normal pipeline stuff that's going on? And lastly, on DSOs, I just wondered, you guys said that Asia really drove the quarter. Was that particular deal where you're not getting payment until later, was that an Asian deal?

We've put a lot of effort into it in the last couple of weeks, looking at the pipeline, analyzing it, the face-to-face meetings that I talked about. We are assuming a book to bill equal to one on our guidance, and we are assuming hopefully a conservative close rate in the pipeline. In fact, slightly reduced close rates from last quarter, which are in fact down from the previous three quarters. So we'll see where that ends up. I think our guidance is realistic."

Then I'm making the same question to you. You've grown your product revenues in the last five quarters anywhere at the bottom between 9% to 14%, a pretty nice range. And this quarter is 4%. The guidance for the next quarter or the implied is about 4% again. The question is whether that you think that the product growth rate could go back up to this 10% level? And whether we should model it this way or not. So that's question number one. Question number two, I know we don't have time and maybe we can take it offline. But the question is the decline in growth rate, is it because the underlying growth in the market is slowing down? Or is it because you've taken so much share from others that there's just not much share to take and that's what the market share data is suggesting?

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved strong revenue growth and operating results reflecting another quarter of solid execution. Revenue of $268.9 million increased 41% year-over-year and was within our guided range of $265 million to $270 million. 
GAAP EPS of $0.68 per diluted share was above our guided range of $0.62 to $0.64. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per diluted share was also above our guidance of $0.80 to $0.82. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS results reflect the benefit of approximately $0.04 related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
Product revenue of $171.5 million grew 44% year-over-year and represented 64% of total revenue. Service revenue of $97.4 million grew 35% year-over-year and accounted for 36% of total revenue. Book to bill for the quarter was less than one. By region, the Americas represented 59% of revenue; EMEA accounted for 22%; APAC, 13%; and Japan, 6%.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $261.7 million. As a reminder, we are now including FirePass product as a component of our ADN [Application Delivery Networking] revenue results. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization products was $7.2 million, essentially flat with the prior quarter and up 27% year-over-year.
During Q1, the financial vertical accounted for 19% of sales, Telco was 21% and technology was also 21%. Total government was 12% including 7% from U.S. federal. In Q1, we had one greater than 10% distributor, Avnet, which represented 18.8% of total revenue. 
Moving down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 81.8%. Excluding approximately $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 82.6%.
GAAP operating expenses of $140.1 million were within our target range of $137 million to $141 million. Excluding $20.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $119.4 million.
GAAP operating margin was 29.7%. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 38.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 32.4%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.5%. These rates were lower than our guidance of 36.5% for GAAP and 35% for non-GAAP due to the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. And Q1 rates reflect both the tax benefit on Q1 as well as the retroactive impact of the R&D tax credit applied to quarters two, three and four of fiscal 2010.
On the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $103.1 million contributing to total cash and investments of $952.3 million at quarter end. DSO at the end of Q1 was 48 days. Inventories at quarter end were $18.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% sequentially to $287.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.5 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.3 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,130 employees, an increase of 120 from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 198,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.43 per share for a total of $25 million. Approximately 213 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase programs.
Looking ahead to Q2. We see our core drivers continuing to generate significant growth opportunity going forward, and we anticipate continued momentum in Q2 and through the remainder of the year. For the current quarter, we are targeting revenue in the range of $275 million to $280 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 81% to 82%, including approximately $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $142 million to $146 million. This includes approximately $20 million of stock-based compensation expense. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.65 to $0.67 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.84 to $0.86 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 36%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid-40-day range. We expect inventory levels in a range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $90 million, which includes the impact of two large tax payments due in Q2 for our normal tax payment schedule. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

The F5 team delivered another set of solid results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. All our major geographic regions produced strong year-over-year and quarterly sequential revenue growth. The star of the qu",888,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. The F5 team delivered another set of solid results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. All our major geographic regions produced strong year-over-year and quarterly sequential revenue growth. The star of the quarter was the Asia-Pacific region, which produced over 60% year-over-year growth. Japan's growth over last year was just under 35%, and the Americas growth was over 40%. The EMEA region, which delivered a very strong quarter in Q1 last year, was up 29% from a year ago.
Once again, our Services business produced stellar results. 35% year-over-year services growth and 9% sequential growth combined with a 36% year-over-year increase to deferred revenue all point to future services revenue growth throughout fiscal 2011. As Andy indicated, our overall financial metrics are very strong in Q1. Cash from operations was at an all-time high of $103 million and our non-GAAP operating margin was about 38%.
From a product perspective, our ADC business continued to be the main driver of our overall growth. We had very strong sales of our flagship VIPRION product line last quarter. Sales of our application security module, ASM [Application Security Manager], were also very solid as customers around the world focused more attention and resources on security at the application level. Sales of Edge, our next generation multitask offering; APM, our optimized Access Policy Management solution; and our one optimization module continues to generate significant interest from our customer base. We believe this interest will translate into significant revenue growth for these exciting solutions throughout the year.
Q1 revenue from our ARX file virtualization product line was essentially flat over last quarter and was below our internal expectations. Towards the end of last quarter, we had a number of forecasted deals pushed out into Q2, and we expect to see improvement and sequential growth on ARX sales this coming quarter. 
Last quarter, we announced some very important products to supplement ARX product family. The ARX cloud extender is an add-on to ARX and significantly expands our existing file tier-ing solutions by allowing customers to intelligently tier to the cloud. We announced support for the intelligent tier-ing of files to Amazon S3 cloud services as well as natively supporting Iron Mountain's VFS and NetApp StorageGrid solutions. We expect to announce similar support for other major cloud storage services throughout the year. 
We are also developing a software-only version of the ARX, the ARX Virtual Edition. ARX VE should promote an increase in proof of concept trials for our ARX products as well as providing the opportunity to enlist more strategic partners for this software-only solution. We are also on track to release two new mid-range platforms, the ARX-1500 and the ARX-2500, both of which are exceeding our performance expectations.
Overall, we have made good progress with the product roadmap and expect to deliver some very significant products to market this year. We expect to begin beta tests this quarter on our Victoria project. Victoria marks the introduction of VIPRION chassis capabilities into the midrange of our product line. TMOS version 11 is also expected to transition to beta testing where we will begin to validate in customer environments a number of new features including Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing, VCMP [ph]; a new module on the visibility of application performance, AVR [ph]; a new generation version of our application templates that provide a new management tier to scale and manage applications called IR [ph]; as well as a sophisticated range of clustered management capabilities. These exciting new features will allow F5 customers to implement, manage, optimize and expand large-scale data centers by leveraging cloud-based architectures and virtualization.
TMOS version 11 will introduce the virtual additions of our ASM and GTM products. V11 also includes a number of new features targeted at the mobile and service provider markets such as additional support for IPv6, a new service provider oriented iRules. In addition, we plan to release [indiscernible] (27:13) version of the BIG-IP 1150 (sic) [11050] and the VIPRION PB200 blade. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, I feel very optimistic about our business prospects for the remainder of fiscal 2011. As we stated at the beginning of the fiscal year, we expect to deliver sequential growth in each quarter of fiscal 2011. We entered Q2 with a robust pipeline of future business, which continues to grow and includes a number of multi-million dollar opportunities. 
In addition, we have made significant investments in growing our sales team headcount, which should produce productivity gains as we progress throughout the year. The market growth drivers for our business remain very much intact and include continued increase in storage requirements, global data center consolidation projects, growth in mobile data and mobile applications and increasing awareness of the importance and need for application security and secure policy-driven accessibility and the evolving opportunity with cloud architecture solutions.
Also, we are seeing continued growth opportunities associated with virtualization, and F5 is increasingly being recognized as the de facto ADC solution for virtualization initiatives. F5 solutions occupies strategic control points across global data centers. And we are extremely well positioned to take advantage of these market drivers.

In terms of, obviously, surprises, I mean we did mention that ARX was flat, and that was slipped deals that happened towards the end of the quarter.

In terms of the bigger picture with the ADC revenue, we did see some disparity in October, especially in the last week of the month of October, which was much lower than we'd normally see. And November and December were pretty much on track for what we tend to expect. So although we saw some deals slip, and frankly, it wasn't significantly beyond what we would normally expect.

First, when Cisco described what happened to them in the quarter they used kind of hiccup and words that tried to explain that it's temporary, and then they expected the growth rate to go back right after into normal growth rate. Then I'm making the same question to you. You've grown your product revenues in the last five quarters anywhere at the bottom between 9% to 14%, a pretty nice range. And this quarter is 4%. The guidance for the next quarter or the implied is about 4% again. The question is whether that you think that the product growth rate could go back up to this 10% level? And whether we should model it this way or not. So that's question number one. Question number two, I know we don't have time and maybe we can take it offline. But the question is the decline in growth rate, is it because the underlying growth in the market is slowing down? Or is it because you've taken so much share from others that there's just not much share to take and that's what the market share data is suggesting? So I’m trying to make the distinction between share gains and underlying growth in the market."

During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid revenue growth and operating results. Revenue of $277.6 million, which increased 35% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, was within our guided range of $275 million to $280 million. 
GAAP EPS of $0.68 per diluted share was above our guided range of $0.65 to $0.67. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per diluted share was also above our guidance of $0.84 to $0.86.
Product revenue of $173.7 million grew 34% year-over-year and represented 63% of total revenue. Service revenue of $103.9 million grew 36% year-over-year and accounted for 37% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was equal to 1.
Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by strong performance in the Americas and APAC. The Americas grew 38% year-over-year, and 4% from Q1 and accounted for 59% of total revenue. APAC grew 68% year-over-year, 10% sequentially, and accounted for 14% of total revenue.
EMEA revenue, which was essentially flat with the prior quarter grew 22% year-over-year, and accounted for 22% of revenue. Japan accounted for 6% of total revenue, was down 6% sequentially and flat with the second quarter a year ago.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $270.5 million, up from $261.7 million in Q1. Revenue from our ARX filed virtualization products was essentially flat with the prior quarter at $7.1 million.
During Q2, the financial vertical accounted for 20% of revenue, Telco was 19%, and technology was 24%. Total government revenue was 10%, including 6% from U.S. federal. 
In Q2, we had one greater than 10% distributor, Avnet, which represented 19.6% of total revenue.
Moving down the income statement. GAAP gross margins in Q2 was 81.7%, excluding approximately $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margins was 82.5%.
GAAP operating expenses of $143.7 million were within our target range of $142 million to $146 million. Excluding $19.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $124.1 million.
GAAP operating margin was 30%. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, expense, was 37.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 34.4%.  Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.9%.
On the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $91.2 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $997.2 million at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $85 million. DSO at the end of Q2 was 46 days.
Inventories at quarter end were $18.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 9% sequentially to $313.3 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.2 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.3 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,255 employees, an increase of 125 from the prior quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 405,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $114.85 per share for a total of $46.5 million. Approximately 166 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
Looking ahead to Q3. We are encouraged by the continued momentum we see in our key drivers with large projects, data center consolidation and virtualization continuing to push our business. This, combined with our strong product offerings and our operational strength and efficiency, give us confidence we will grow sequentially and sustain our current level of profitability through the remainder of fiscal year 2011.
Nevertheless, the uncertain impact of Japan has inclined us to be somewhat cautious in assessing our near-term prospects. With that in mind, we are targeting Q3 revenue in the range of $287 million to $292 million. We expect GAAP gross margins in the 81% to 82% range, including approximately $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $147 million to $151 million. This includes approximately $20 million of stock-based compensation expense. 
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.69 to $0.71 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.89 to $0.91 per diluted share.
We are forecasting and effective tax rate of 35.5%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid-40 day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $18 million to $20 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $95 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Overall, I was very pleased with F5's team's performance in Q2. In the Americas, revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and Asia Pacific revenue increased 68% year-over-year, helped by a strongly linearity in the early part of the quarter, Japan revenue was essentially flat year-over-year. A tremendous achievement considering the enormous difficulties they faced in the latest stages of the quarter.
Revenue from EMEA grew 22% year-over-year, below our internal expectations. Once again, we improved our balance sheet significantly, with cash flow from operations at approximately $91 million, and closed the quarter with $997 million in cash and investments, and no debt.
Our services business achieved a significant milestone, with revenue of $100 million in the quarter, and continues to be key growth driver and a strong profit contributor to our business model. Most important, we have been able to achieve these outstanding financial results while containing customer satisfaction of world-class levels.
From a product perspective, our ADC business continues to be the fundamental driver of our overall growth. The application fluency we provide with our unique fuel proxy TMOS architecture, and the flexibility of iRules have given our customers and partners the ability to rapidly optimize and secure applications with minimum disruption and cost.
Our online users community, Dell Central, continues to grow in popularity, with both membership and activity hitting all-time highs. This highlights how customers are integrating our products more deeply with our architectures and their applications.
The application fluency capabilities of our products continue to be critical to the important partnerships we have built with global applications solutions providers like Microsoft and Oracle. 
In addition, the modular architecture of TMOS has able the continued expansion of our solution modules and a significant increase in our addressable market. More than 30% of our sales last quarter were heavily influenced by solution modules, such as ASM, our Application Security Module, AG and ATM, our Optimized Secure Acces and Policy Modules, as well as one acceleration and optimization module solutions.
Nearly all of the solution modules were derived from the technology acquisitions we have made over the last few years.
During the quarter, our virtual appliance strategy continues to have a positive impact on sales. And just the year since we introduced our virtualization of BIG-IP for local traffic management, we will have added six new virtual appliances. These virtual appliances have been instrumental in driving trial and broader adoption of F5 solutions within new parts of enterprise organizations, service providers and different geographies.
During Q2, we also introduced our virtualization of our ARX product. In addition, we launched ARX code extender and we are seeing growing interest from customers and channel partners in both of these solutions. Within the next six months, we plan to introduce two new ARX platforms, which will significantly enhance the price performance of the ARX solutions.
We are confident that our recent and future product introductions will continue to enhance our competitive position, which is the strongest it has ever been. 
In particular, we believe that Victoria, our midway to chassis platform, and TMOS version 11 will be well accepted by the market. Victoria will provide significant price performance advantages, increase solutions flexibility, and enhance availability creative abilities with the chassis-based architecture.
TMOS version 11 includes over 115 new sophisticated management and scalability features to enhance data center consolidation in code architectures. version 11 also includes new application visibility and management features, specific solutions for the telco market and significant software and firmware performance enhancements to many of our software modules. 
As far as the overall business over to, I feel very confident about our prospects for the second half of the fiscal year. The key drivers for our business including data center consolidation, virtualization, cloud-based services, the growth of mobile applications and data, and the increasing requirement for sophisticated application security solutions, all continued to produce a strong and expanding market opportunity for F5 products.
In the context of several global microeconomic issues, we delivered solid sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in Q2. Until those issues are resolved however, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. We are anticipating a sequential decline in Japan, and I believe we have included an appropriately, conservative assumption for the Japan business in our Q3 guidance.
Nevertheless, as our guidance indicate, we expect to continue revenues in Q3. During the remainder of FY '11, we are confident our market opportunities and competitive position, our technology leadership and our ability to maintain and expand our leadership position will enable us to achieve solid sequential and year-over-year revenue gains.
As a result, we plan to continue hiring to further strengthen our sales and marketing, service and development organization, and enhance our prospects for future growth.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the F5 team, our partners and our customers for the support last quarter, and we'll now pass the call over for Q&A."

So we're expecting a lot of benefits from these particular customers that have built out these things. I think the other thing you have to recognize is our sales growth in the cloud infrastructure providers was really triple digits year-over-year. Companies like Rackspace, Salesforce.com, Microsoft, du jour, the growth was pretty impressive there. Deals are much bigger, so we've seen them building out. We actually don't call these guys telco in this percentage.

So all the Telco because we're talking about 11, those are driven by the customer base themselves, and a lot of these were, initially iRules, that are implemented on site, I mean hundreds of iRules, in some cases, that we've gone in products side. And there's some other things that we've done, say an IPv6, to do some hardening, a qualification, things like DNS explorer. There's a bunch of areas in the network side that we're making it easier for the telco guys to adopt the platforms. But there's a lot of work also going on iRules. I mean it's a broad attack. And it's not just one, any one feature we're talking about in telco, really. So we think it makes it easier with Centaur, that's on track with our internal project schedules. The performance is looking where we expected to be with that, or we'll continue to look forward to that. It doubles up the performance of the existing PV 200 blades on the chassis, and our customers are looking for that."

For example, we had a very large transaction last year that was pretty significant in size, that we talked about publicly. We've done a lot of business and the account is quite typical. And the second part of the question, market share. Well, I think we make the market, significantly. I think, that's why we're hiring aggressively. We talked a lot about something we felt strongly about for a number of years that we've got great market opportunity, the geography level, the vertical level and the account level, we think is pretty under penetrated and that's how I see the growth coming.

We think we're in a good position in there, and we'll continue to be in a good position. One of the things that we have talked about internally is that, remember, we tend to lag infrastructure paid spending. And so if you're building a big LTE, until it gets ready to actually go into operations, because really we tend to lag back that in terms of spending, and I think there's some issues there. There are some big projects as they're not getting skills in those businesses that are up there, and you're going to see some lumpiness. You want to just talk about some of the solutions that we see? 
Absolutely, Alex. You might remember back in November, actually, we put an announcement out, really targeted at the Service Provider segment introducing the notion of service delivery networking. And our release out of for big thing is that were part of it. One, we're talking about how we're doing policy-based traffics with our products. So just based on the knowledge of the traffic that we have, how service providers can use information on who the users are, where they're coming from, what they're up to, and use that to create and apply again to either create new services, new lines of businesses for themselves, or drive costs down. And we're seeing a lot of that around. The second one is scaling IP services and touch and it's a little bit earlier. But as these guys are just monsters in amounts of traffic, growing and growing every quarter, we're looking for more efficient ways to deal with it. It's a great example is something simple like network address translation, where our systems are able to do them at about 1/3 of the cost of doing it in a firewall, which is traditionally how some of the service providers have been doing it. Third place would be IPv6, being able to support that easily in conjunction with IPv4 and for structure, sort of you can do both simultaneously and easily. And then the last area, I guess if we sort of improving user experience and improving security as well. So an example there would be people using us to secure their DNS infrastructure, and DNS is the front door for applications and services that they provide out there, and it's massively important. Not all that sometimes but very susceptible to things like service attacks. And now people are starting to roll out support for DNS sets to better secure their DNS infrastructure. We give them ways to do that very, very easily. So we're seeing a lot of activity across all those fronts, not only in the U.S. but around the world. So I'm pretty amped up about it."

During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid revenue growth and operating results. Revenue of $277.6 million, which increased 35% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, was within our guided range of $275 million to $280 million. 
GAAP EPS of $0.68 per diluted share was above our guided range of $0.65 to $0.67. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per diluted share was also above our guidance of $0.84 to $0.86.
Product revenue of $173.7 million grew 34% year-over-year and represented 63% of total revenue. Service revenue of $103.9 million grew 36% year-over-year and accounted for 37% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was equal to 1.
Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by strong performance in the Americas and APAC. The Americas grew 38% year-over-year and 4% from Q1 and accounted for 59% of total revenue. APAC grew 68% year-over-year, 10% sequentially and accounted for 14% of total revenue.
EMEA revenue, which was essentially flat with the prior quarter, grew 22% year-over-year and accounted for 22% of revenue. Japan accounted for 6% of total revenue, was down 6% sequentially and flat with the second quarter a year ago.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $270.5 million, up from $261.7 million in Q1. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization products was essentially flat with the prior quarter at $7.1 million.
During Q2, the financial vertical accounted for 20% of revenue, telco was 19% and technology was 24%. Total government revenue was 10%, including 6% from U.S. federal. In Q2, we had one greater than 10% distributor, Avnet, which represented 19.6% of total revenue.
Moving down the income statement. GAAP gross margins in Q2 was 81.7%. Excluding approximately $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 82.5%. GAAP operating expenses of $143.7 million were within our target range of $142 million to $146 million. Excluding $19.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $124.1 million.
GAAP operating margin was 30%. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, expense, was 37.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 34.4%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.9%.
On the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $91.2 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $997.2 million at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $85 million. DSO at the end of Q2 was 46 days.
Inventories at quarter end were $18.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 9% sequentially to $313.3 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.2 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.3 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,255 employees, an increase of 125 from the prior quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 405,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $114.85 per share for a total of $46.5 million. Approximately $166 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
Looking ahead to Q3. We are encouraged by the continued momentum we see in our key drivers with large projects, data center consolidation and virtualization continuing to push our business. This, combined with our strong product offerings and our operational strength and efficiency, give us confidence we will grow sequentially and sustain our current level of profitability through the remainder of fiscal year 2011.
Nevertheless, the uncertain impact of Japan has inclined us to be somewhat cautious in assessing our near-term prospects. With that in mind, we are targeting Q3 revenue in the range of $287 million to $292 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 81% to 82% range, including approximately $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $147 million to $151 million. This includes approximately $20 million of stock-based compensation expense. 
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.69 to $0.71 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.89 to $0.91 per diluted share.
We are forecasting and effective tax rate of 35.5%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid-40 day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $18 million to $20 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $95 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

In the Americas, revenues grew 38% year-over-year, and Asia Pacific revenue increased 68% year-over-year. Helped by a strong linearity in the early part of the quarter, Japan revenue was essentially flat year-over-year, a tremendous achievement considering the enormous difficulties they faced in the latest stages of the quarter.
Revenue from EMEA grew 22% year-over-year, below our internal expectations. Once again, we improved our balance sheet significantly, with cash flow from operations at approximately $91 million, and closed the quarter with $997 million in cash and investments and no debt.
Our Services business achieved a significant milestone, with revenue of up $100 million in the quarter, and continues to be a key growth driver and a strong profit contributor to our business model. Most important, we have been able to achieve these outstanding financial results while containing customer satisfaction at world-class levels.
From a product perspective, our ADC business continues to be the fundamental driver of our overall growth. The application fluency we provide with our unique full proxy TMOS architecture and the flexibility of iRules have given our customers and partners the ability to rapidly optimize and secure their applications with minimum disruption and cost.
Our online users community, DevCentral, continues to grow in popularity, with both membership and activity hitting all-time highs. This highlights how customers are integrating our products more deeply with our architectures and their applications.
The application fluency capabilities of our products continue to be critical to the important partnerships we have built with global application solution providers like Microsoft and Oracle. 
In addition, the modular architecture of TMOS has enabled the continued expansion of our solution modules and the significant increase in our addressable market. More than 30% of our sales last quarter were heavily influenced by solution modules, such as ASM, our Application Security Module; Edge and APM, our Optimized Secure Access and Policy Modules; as well as our WAN acceleration and optimization module solutions. Nearly all of these solution modules were derived from the technology acquisitions we have made over the last few years.
During the quarter, our virtual appliance strategy continued to have a positive impact on sales. And just a year since we introduced our virtualization of BIG-IP for local traffic management, we will have added six new virtual appliances. These virtual appliances have been instrumental in driving trial and broader adoption of F5 solutions within new parts of enterprise organizations, service providers and different geographies.
During Q2, we also introduced our virtualization of our ARX product. In addition, we launched ARX Cloud Extender, and we are seeing growing interest from customers and channel partners in both these solutions. Within the next six months, we plan to introduce two new ARX platforms, which will significantly enhance the price performance of the ARX solutions.
We are confident that our recent and future product introductions will continue to enhance our competitive position, which is the strongest it has ever been. In particular, we believe that Victoria, our mid-range chassis platform, and TMOS version 11 will be well accepted by the market. Victoria will provide significant price performance advantages, increase solution flexibility and enhance availability capabilities with the chassis-based architecture.
TMOS version 11 includes over 115 new sophisticated management and scalability features to enhance data center consolidation and cloud architectures. Version 11 also includes new application visibility and management features, specific solutions for the telco market and significant software and firmware performance enhancements to many of our software modules. 
As far as the overall business outlook is concerned, I feel very confident about our prospects for the second half of the fiscal year. The key drivers for our business including data center consolidation, virtualization, cloud-based services, the growth of mobile applications and data, and the increasing requirement for sophisticated application security solutions, all continued to produce a strong and expanding market opportunity for F5 products.
In the context of several global microeconomic issues, we delivered solid sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in Q2. Until those issues are resolved, however, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. We are anticipating a sequential decline in Japan, and I believe we have included an appropriately conservative assumption for the Japan business in our Q3 guidance.
Nevertheless, as our guidance indicates, we expect to continue to grow revenues sequentially in Q3. During the remainder of FY '11, we are confident our market opportunities, our competitive position, our technology leadership and our ability to maintain and expand our leadership position will enable us to achieve solid sequential and year-over-year revenue gains. As a result, we plan to continue hiring to further strengthen our sales and marketing, service and development organization, and enhance our prospects for future growth.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the F5 team, our partners and our customers for the support last quarter, and I'll now pass the call over for Q&A."

You might remember back in November, actually, we put an announcement out, really targeted at the Service Provider segment, introducing the notion of service delivery networking. And the really sort of four big things that were part of it. One, we're talking about how we're doing policy-based traffics with our products. So just based on the knowledge of the traffic that we have, how service providers can use information on who the users are, where they're coming from, what they're up to, and use that to create and apply policies against it to either create new services, new lines of business for themselves or drive costs down. Those are one big thing. We're seeing a lot of that around. The second one is scaling IP services, and call touched on this a little bit earlier. And these guys are basically just monsters amounts of traffic, growing and growing every quarter, we're looking for more efficient ways to deal with it. It's a great example of something simple like network address translation, where our systems are able to do them at about 1/3 of the cost of doing it in a firewall, which is traditionally how some of the service providers have been doing it. Third place would be IPv6, being able to support that easily in conjunction with an IPv4 infrastructure, sort of you can do both simultaneously and easily. And then the last area, I guess, would be sort of improving user experience and improving security as well. So an example there would be people using us to secure their DNS infrastructure, and DNS is the front door for applications and services that they provide out there, and it's massively important. Not all that is hefty. Sometimes they're very susceptible to things like denial of service attacks. And now that people are starting to roll out support for DNSSEC to better secure their DNS infrastructure. We give them ways to do that very, very easily. So we're seeing a lot of activity across all those fronts, not only in the U.S. but around the world. So I'm pretty amped up about it."

We're seeing interesting uses come through in things like with our virtual additions of our products, even getting deployed in places within the enterprise and geographies that we probably wouldn't touch, or up to simply get on the street.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid revenue growth and operating results.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid revenue growth and operating results. Revenue of $277.6 million, which increased 35% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, was within our guided range of $275 million to $280 million. 
GAAP EPS of $0.68 per diluted share was above our guided range of $0.65 to $0.67. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 per diluted share was also above our guidance of $0.84 to $0.86.
Product revenue of $173.7 million grew 34% year-over-year and represented 63% of total revenue. Service revenue of $103.9 million grew 36% year-over-year and accounted for 37% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was equal to 1.
Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by strong performance in the Americas and APAC. The Americas grew 38% year-over-year and 4% from Q1 and accounted for 59% of total revenue. APAC grew 68% year-over-year, 10% sequentially and accounted for 14% of total revenue.
EMEA revenue, which was essentially flat with the prior quarter, grew 22% year-over-year and accounted for 22% of revenue. Japan accounted for 6% of total revenue, was down 6% sequentially and flat with the second quarter a year ago.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $270.5 million, up from $261.7 million in Q1. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization products was essentially flat with the prior quarter at $7.1 million.
During Q2, the financial vertical accounted for 20% of revenue, telco was 19% and technology was 24%. Total government revenue was 10%, including 6% from U.S. federal. In Q2, we had one greater than 10% distributor, Avnet, which represented 19.6% of total revenue.
Moving down the income statement. GAAP gross margins in Q2 was 81.7%. Excluding approximately $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 82.5%. GAAP operating expenses of $143.7 million were within our target range of $142 million to $146 million. Excluding $19.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $124.1 million.
GAAP operating margin was 30%. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, expense, was 37.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 34.4%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.9%.
On the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $91.2 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $997.2 million at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $85 million. DSO at the end of Q2 was 46 days.
Inventories at quarter end were $18.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 9% sequentially to $313.3 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.2 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.3 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,255 employees, an increase of 125 from the prior quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 405,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $114.85 per share for a total of $46.5 million. Approximately $166 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
Looking ahead to Q3. We are encouraged by the continued momentum we see in our key drivers with large projects, data center consolidation and virtualization continuing to push our business. This, combined with our strong product offerings and our operational strength and efficiency, give us confidence we will grow sequentially and sustain our current level of profitability through the remainder of fiscal year 2011.
Nevertheless, the uncertain impact of Japan has inclined us to be somewhat cautious in assessing our near-term prospects. With that in mind, we are targeting Q3 revenue in the range of $287 million to $292 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 81% to 82% range, including approximately $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $147 million to $151 million. This includes approximately $20 million of stock-based compensation expense. 
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.69 to $0.71 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.89 to $0.91 per diluted share.
We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35.5%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid-40 day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $18 million to $20 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $95 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

In the Americas, revenues grew 38% year-over-year, and Asia Pacific revenue increased 68% year-over-year. Helped by a strong linearity in the early part of the quarter, Japan revenue was essentially flat year-over-year, a tremendous achievement considering the enormous difficulties they faced in the latest stages of the quarter.
Revenue from EMEA grew 22% year-over-year, below our internal expectations. Once again, we improved our balance sheet significantly, with cash flow from operations at approximately $91 million, and closed the quarter with $997 million in cash and investments and no debt.
Our Services business achieved a significant milestone, with revenue above $100 million in the quarter, and continues to be a key growth driver and a strong profit contributor to our business model. Most important, we have been able to achieve these outstanding financial results while containing customer satisfaction at world-class levels.
From a product perspective, our ADC business continues to be the fundamental driver of our overall growth. The application fluency we provide with our unique full proxy TMOS architecture and the flexibility of iRules have given our customers and partners the ability to rapidly optimize and secure their applications with minimum disruption and cost.
Our online users’ community, DevCentral, continues to grow in popularity, with both membership and activity hitting all-time highs. This highlights how customers are integrating our products more deeply with our architectures and their applications.
The application fluency capabilities of our products continued to be critical to the important partnerships we have built with global application solution providers like Microsoft and Oracle. 
In addition, the modular architecture of TMOS has enabled the continued expansion of our solution modules and a significant increase in our addressable market. More than 30% of our sales last quarter were heavily influenced by solution modules, such as ASM, our Application Security Module; Edge and APM, our Optimized Secure Access and Policy Modules; as well as our WAN acceleration and optimization module solutions. Nearly all of these solution modules were derived from the technology acquisitions we have made over the last few years.
During the quarter, our virtual appliance strategy continued to have a positive impact on sales. In just a year since we introduced our virtualization of BIG-IP for local traffic management, we will have added six new virtual appliances. These virtual appliances have been instrumental in driving trial and broader adoption of F5 solutions within new parts of enterprise organizations, service providers and different geographies.
During Q2, we also introduced our virtualization of our ARX product. In addition, we launched ARX Cloud Extender, and we are seeing growing interest from customers and channel partners in both these solutions. Within the next six months, we plan to introduce two new ARX platforms, which will significantly enhance the price performance of the ARX solutions.
We are confident that our recent and future product introductions will continue to enhance our competitive position, which is the strongest it has ever been. In particular, we believe that Victoria, our mid-range chassis platform, and TMOS version 11 will be well accepted by the market. Victoria will provide significant price performance advantages, increase solution flexibility and enhance availability capabilities with the chassis-based architecture.
TMOS version 11 includes over 150 new sophisticated management and scalability features to enhance data center consolidation and cloud architectures. Version 11 also includes new application visibility and management features, specific solutions for the telco market and significant software and firmware performance enhancements to many of our software modules. 
As far as the overall business outlook is concerned, I feel very confident about our prospects for the second half of the fiscal year. The key drivers for our business including data center consolidation, virtualization, cloud-based services, the growth of mobile applications and data, and the increasing requirement for sophisticated application security solutions, all continued to produce a strong and expanding market opportunity for F5 products.
In the context of several global microeconomic issues, we delivered solid sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in Q2. Until those issues are resolved, however, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. We are anticipating a sequential decline in Japan, and I believe we have included an appropriately conservative assumption for the Japan business in our Q3 guidance.
Nevertheless, as our guidance indicates, we expect to continue to grow revenues sequentially in Q3. During the remainder of FY '11, we are confident our market opportunities, our competitive position, our technology leadership and our ability to maintain and expand that leadership position will enable us to achieve solid sequential and year-over-year revenue gains. As a result, we plan to continue hiring to further strengthen our sales and marketing, service and development organization, and enhance our prospects for future growth.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the F5 team, our partners and our customers for the support last quarter, and I'll now pass the call over for Q&A."

You might remember back in November, actually, we put an announcement out, really targeted at the Service Provider segment, introducing the notion of service delivery networking. And there really sort of four big things that were part of it. One, we're talking about how we're doing policy-based traffics steering with our products. So just based on the knowledge of the traffic that we have, how service providers can use information on who the users are, where they're coming from, what they're up to, and use that to create and apply policies against it to either create new services, new lines of business for themselves or drive costs down. So that’s sort of one big thing. We're seeing a lot of that around. The second one is scaling IP services, and Karl touched on this a little bit earlier. But these guys are basically just monsters amounts of traffic, growing and growing every quarter, we're looking for more efficient ways to deal with it. So a great example of something simple like network address translation, where our systems are able to do them at about 1/3 of the cost of doing it in a firewall, which is traditionally how some of the service providers have been doing it. Third place would be IPv6, being able to support that easily in conjunction with an IPv4 infrastructure, so it will let them do both simultaneously and easily. And then the last area, I guess, would be sort of improving user experience and improving security as well. So an example there would be people using us to secure their DNS infrastructure, and DNS is the front door for applications and services that they provide out there, and it's massively important. Not all that is hefty. Sometimes they're very susceptible to things like denial of service attacks.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth. Revenue of $290.7 million was at the high end of our $287 million to $292 million guided range, grew 5% from the prior quarter and grew 26% compared to a very strong Q3 a year ago. GAAP EPS of $0.77 per diluted share was above our guided range of $0.69 to $0.71. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 per diluted share was also above our guided range of $0.89 to $0.91.
The strong EPS results reflect additional R&D tax credit benefits of approximately $0.05 per share, recognized in the current quarter.
Product revenue of $179.3 million grew 22% year-over-year and represented 62% of total revenue. Service revenue of $111.4 million grew 34% year-over-year and accounted for 38% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one.
Both APAC and Japan delivered strong revenue growth during the quarter. APAC, which represented 16% of total revenue, grew 58% year-over-year. And Japan at 7% of total revenue was up 42% year-over-year. EMEA, representing 20% of total revenue, grew 15% from the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and was down sequentially.
Accounting for 57% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up slightly compared to the prior quarter and grew 22% year-over-year. During Q3, our core Application Delivery Networking business accounted for $282.5 million compared to $270.5 million in Q2. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $8.3 million, up 16% from Q2 and 32% from the third quarter year ago. Both the telco and technology verticals represented 21% of total revenue in Q3. The financial vertical accounted for 19%. Total government revenue was 10%, including 5% from U.S. federal.
In Q3, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors, Avnet, which represented 16.4% of total revenue and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 10.6%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 ticked up slightly to 82%. Excluding approximately $2.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin also moved up to 82.8%.
GAAP operating expenses of $150 million were within our target range of $147 million to $151 million. Excluding $20.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $129.5 million.
GAAP operating margins was 30.4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensate expense, was 38.2%.
Reflecting the R&D tax benefit I mentioned earlier, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 30.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 29.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $101.1 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $92.2 million. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $1.57 billion. DSO at the end of Q3 was 48 days. Inventories were $17.9 million. Deferred revenue increased 3% sequentially to $321.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.8 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.2 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,350 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 472,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $105.96 per share for a total of $50 million.
Looking ahead to Q4. While we remain cautious about the impact the ongoing financial uncertainty in Europe might have on our EMEA business, we are seeing strength within our North American enterprise business. And we believe our U.S. federal business will reflect the seasonal strength we typically see in Q4. We believe the key drivers of our business remained intact, and that we will continue to achieve solid, sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4.
With that in mind, our revenue targets for Q4 is $307 million to $312 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to remain strong in the 81% to 82% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $156 million to $160 million. This includes approximately $21.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.75 to $0.77 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.97 to $0.99 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid-40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $18 million to $20 million. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

The Asia-Pacific, Japan region with the start quarter was a year-over-year growth rate over 50%. The Americas year-over-year growth rate of 22% was constrained a bit by some project spending delays in the U.S. federal market, as well as some project spending delays particularly in the financial vertical. 
The EMEA region year-over-year growth of 13% was clearly impacted by the economic challenges currently present in that region. We passed a significant milestone on our stellar balance sheet with cash and investments surpassing the $1 billion mark, currently at $1.06 billion having repurchased $50 million worth of common stock in the quarter. 
Our services business, once again, produced solid results with 34% growth in revenue, along with strong contribution to our overall profitability. Our non-GAAP operating margin was very solid at 38.2%, which is our highest level to date. We also saw improvement in our ARX sales in Q3, with ARX revenue growing 16% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. We started shipping our new VIPRION 2400 product, known as the Victoria, towards the end of the quarter. The VIPRION 2400 leverages the significant success of our current VIPRION solution by providing industry-leading functionality at a very attractive price point. With the VIPRION 2400 based architecture, customers enjoy enhanced features and the flexibility to scale the ADC infrastructures without changing network, application or device configurations, leading to a dramatically reduced operating expenditures.
As we mentioned in our press release announcing availability of this new product, the VIPRION 2400 is shipping initially with TMOS version 10.2.2. And we'll support version 11 of TMOS when it is released. Initial sales and customer interest in the VIPRION 2400 has been very high. And we expect the level of interest to continue to increase during Q4 and continue additional momentum in fiscal 2012 as customers interest accelerate.
TMOS version 11, which is targeted to ship in the current quarter includes over 150 new sophisticated management and scalability features to enhance data center consolidation and cloud architectures. Version 11 also includes new application visibility and management features, specific solutions for the telco market and significant software and firmware performance enhancements to many of our software modules.
Version 11 also includes our sophisticated version cluster multiprocessing technology, VCMP. That combines virtualization and multichannel capabilities to help customers consolidate and efficiently manage application delivery services. VCMP enables multiple instances of BIG-IP software to run in 1 device and provides enterprises the unprecedented ability to have complete logical separation of software version and instances on a single highly scalable device.
This capability is critically important for large enterprises and cloud and other services, who we need on-demand scalability and the ability to ensure that each group's resources and network traffic are fully isolated from one another.
As far as the overall business outlook is concerned, I feel very confident about our prospects both in the short term as we move into the final quarter of fiscal year 2011 and for fiscal year 2012. At our last investor conference call, we highlighted our application delivery controller technology is a starting point to address other major market opportunities such as security and service provider. The key to this expansion is TMOS and their ability to deliver application level intelligence at network speeds. Version 11 contains significant enhancements that directly address these markets.
For example, the majority of money spent on security to date has been targeted at protecting the network. F5's market-leading and award winning application final solution, the Application Security Manager, is becoming increasingly vital to our customers as attacks to their IT infrastructure have become significantly more sophisticated, targeting not only the network but applications directly.
The recent high-profile hacking exploits against major banks, governments and other corporations demonstrate the inherent weakness of traditional firewall and IT solutions, and highlight the need for a security solution that not only protects the assets of the network but of the application as well. ASM, coupled with the core capabilities of TMOS, allows our customers to block this new generation of sophisticated hacker exploit. We have major Fortune 500 customers replacing traditional network firewalls entirely with BIG-IP.
Along with the significant additional security functionality in the 11, our short-term product roadmap include additional classification, enhanced network firewall capabilities and broader application protection that should further accelerate the opportunity to expand our presence in the security market. We believe this opportunity, coupled with our strategic footprint in the data center, will significantly expand the addressable market in fiscal year 2012 and beyond.
In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered strong sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. And as we stated last quarter, we continue to believe this prudent remain cautious in the short term. Having said that, we believe that the real growth opportunities for F5 in the foreseeable future, and we plan to continue aggressively hiring to expand our sales and marketing service and development organization and enhance our prospects for future sustained growth.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the F5 team, our customers for their support last quarter and I will hand the call over to Q&A."

That said, you listen to the companies in the networking space and IT space, and many have been pointing out that despite federal budgets being approved, there are still lingering delays. And despite some of the project, specific projects being approved, there's still dollars that are not flowing. For example, net scout had a massive preannouncement because of that. IBM in its commentary, just this past Monday, talked about the government channel again for second quarter in a row being even weaker than they planned.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth. Revenue of $290.7 million was at the high end of our $287 million to $292 million guided range, grew 5% from the prior quarter and grew 26% compared to a very strong Q3 a year ago. GAAP EPS of $0.77 per diluted share was above our guided range of $0.69 to $0.71. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 per diluted share was also above our guided range of $0.89 to $0.91. The strong EPS results reflect additional R&D tax credit benefits of approximately $0.05 per share, recognized in the current quarter.
Product revenue of $179.3 million grew 22% year-over-year and represented 62% of total revenue. Service revenue of $111.4 million grew 34% year-over-year and accounted for 38% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one.
Both APAC and Japan delivered strong revenue growth during the quarter. APAC, which represented 16% of total revenue, grew 58% year-over-year. And Japan, at 7% of total revenue, was up 42% year-over-year. EMEA, representing 20% of total revenue, grew 15% from the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and was down sequentially. Accounting for 57% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up slightly compared to the prior quarter and grew 22% year-over-year. 
During Q3, our core Application Delivery Networking business accounted for $282.5 million compared to $270.5 million in Q2. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $8.3 million, up 16% from Q2 and 32% from the third quarter a year ago. 
Both the telco and technology verticals represented 21% of total revenue in Q3. The financial vertical accounted for 19%. Total government revenue was 10%, including 5% from U.S. federal. 
In Q3, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors, Avnet, which represented 16.4% of total revenue, and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 10.6%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 ticked up slightly to 82%. Excluding approximately $2.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin also moved up to 82.8%. GAAP operating expenses of $150 million were within our target range of $147 million to $151 million. Excluding $20.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $129.5 million. GAAP operating margins was 30.4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 38.2%. Reflecting the R&D tax benefit I mentioned earlier, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 30.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 29.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $101.1 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $92.2 million. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $1.057 billion. DSO at the end of Q3 was 48 days. Inventories were $17.9 million. Deferred revenue increased 3% sequentially to $321.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.8 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.2 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,350 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 472,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $105.96 per share, for a total of $50 million.
Looking ahead to Q4. While we remain cautious about the impact the ongoing financial uncertainty in Europe might have on our EMEA business, we are seeing strength within our North America enterprise business, and we believe our U.S. federal business will reflect the seasonal strength we typically see in Q4. We believe the key drivers of our business remain intact, and that we will continue to achieve solid, sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4.
With that in mind, our revenue target for Q4 is $307 million to $312 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to remain strong in the 81% to 82% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $156 million to $160 million. This includes approximately $21.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.75 to $0.77 per diluted share. Excluding stock [stock-based] compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.97 to $0.99 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $18 million to $20 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

The Americas year-over",881,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. The F5 team delivered another solid performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The Asia-Pacific, Japan region with the start of the quarter was a year-over-year growth rate over 50%. The Americas year-over-year growth rate of 22% was constrained a bit by some project-spending delays in the U.S. federal market, as well as some project-spending delays particularly in the financial vertical. The EMEA's region year-over-year growth of 15% was clearly impacted by the economic challenges currently present in that region. 
We passed a significant milestone on our stellar balance sheet, with cash and investments surpassing the $1 billion mark, currently at $1.06 billion, having repurchased $50 million worth of common stock in the quarter. 
Our services business, once again, produced solid results with 34% growth in revenue, along with strong contribution to our overall profitability. Our non-GAAP operating margin was very solid at 38.2%, which is our highest level to date. We also saw improvement in our ARX sales in Q3, with ARX revenues growing 16% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. 
We started shipping our new VIPRION 2400 product, known in family as Victoria, towards the end of the quarter. The VIPRION 2400 leverages the significant success of our current VIPRION solution by providing industry-leading functionality at a very attractive price point. With the VIPRION 2400 chassis-based architecture, customers enjoy enhanced availability features and the flexibility to scale the ADC infrastructures without change -- without changing network, application or device configurations, leading to a dramatically reduced operating expenditures.
As we mentioned in our press release announcing availability of this new product, the VIPRION 2400 is shipping initially with TMOS v. 10.2.2 and will support version 11 of TMOS when it is released. Initial sales and customer interest in the VIPRION 2400 has been very high, and we expect the level of interest to continue to increase during Q4 and continue additional momentum in fiscal 2012 as customer's option of version 11 accelerates.  
TMOS v. 11, which is target to ship in this coming quarter, includes over 150 new sophisticated management and scalability features to enhance data center consolidation and cloud architectures. Version 11 also includes new application visibility and management features, specific solutions for the telco market and significant software and firmware performance enhancements to many of our software modules. 
Version 11 also includes our sophisticated Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing technology, vCMP. That combines virtualization and multi-tenancy capabilities to help customers consolidate and efficiently manage application delivery services. VCMP enables multiple instances of BIG-IP software to run in one device and provides enterprises the unprecedented ability to have complete logical separation of software version and instances on a single highly scalable device. This capability is critically important for large enterprises and cloud and other service providers, who we need on-demand scalability and the ability to ensure that each group's resources and network traffic are fully isolated from one another.
As far as the overall business outlook is concerned, I feel very confident about our prospects, both in the short term, as we move into the final quarter of fiscal year 2011, and for fiscal year 2012. 
At our last investor conference call, we highlighted our application delivery controller technology as a starting point to address other major market opportunities, such as security and service provider. The key to this expansion is TMOS and their ability to deliver application level intelligence at network speeds. Version 11 contains significant enhancements that directly address these markets. For example, the majority money spent on security to date has been targeted at protecting the network. F5's market-leading and award-winning application firewall solution, the Application Security Manager, is becoming increasingly vital to our customers as attacks on their IT infrastructure have become significantly more sophisticated, targeting not only the network but applications directly.
The recent high-profile hacking exploits against major banks, governments and other corporations demonstrate the inherent weakness of traditional firewall and IT solutions, and highlight the need for a security solution that not only protects the assets of the network but of the application as well. ASM, coupled with the core capabilities of TMOS, allows our customers to block this new generation of sophisticated hacker exploit. We have major Fortune 500 customers replacing traditional network firewalls entirely with BIG-IP.
Along with a significant additional security functionality in the v. 11, our short-term product roadmap include additional classification, enhanced network firewall capabilities and broader application protection that should further accelerate the opportunity to expand our presence in the security market. We believe this opportunity, coupled with our strategic footprint in the data center, will significantly expand the addressable market in fiscal year 2012 and beyond.
In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered strong sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. And as we stated last quarter, we continue to believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. Having said that, we believe there are real growth opportunities for F5 in the foreseeable future, and we plan to continue aggressively hiring to expand our sales and marketing service and development organization and enhance our prospects for future sustained growth.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter and will now hand the call over for Q&A."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth. Revenue of $290.7 million was at the high end of our $287 million to $292 million guided range, grew 5% from the prior quarter and grew 26% compared to a very strong Q3 a year ago. GAAP EPS of $0.77 per diluted share was above our guided range of $0.69 to $0.71. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 per diluted share was also above our guided range of $0.89 to $0.91. The strong EPS results reflect additional R&D tax credit benefits of approximately $0.05 per share, recognized in the current quarter.
Product revenue of $179.3 million grew 22% year-over-year and represented 62% of total revenue. Service revenue of $111.4 million grew 34% year-over-year and accounted for 38% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one.
Both APAC and Japan delivered strong revenue growth during the quarter. APAC, which represented 16% of total revenue, grew 58% year-over-year. And Japan, at 7% of total revenue, was up 42% year-over-year. EMEA, representing 20% of total revenue, grew 15% from the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and was down sequentially. Accounting for 57% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up slightly compared to the prior quarter and grew 22% year-over-year. 
During Q3, our core Application Delivery Networking business accounted for $282.5 million compared to $270.5 million in Q2. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $8.3 million, up 16% from Q2 and 32% from the third quarter a year ago. 
Both the telco and technology verticals represented 21% of total revenue in Q3. The financial vertical accounted for 19%. Total government revenue was 10%, including 5% from U.S. Federal. 
In Q3, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors, Avnet, which represented 16.4% of total revenue, and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 10.6%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 ticked up slightly to 82%. Excluding approximately $2.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin also moved up to 82.8%. GAAP operating expenses of $150 million were within our target range of $147 million to $151 million. Excluding $20.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $129.5 million. GAAP operating margins was 30.4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 38.2%. Reflecting the R&D tax benefit I mentioned earlier, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 30.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 29.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $101.1 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $92.2 million. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $1.057 billion. DSO at the end of Q3 was 48 days. Inventories were $17.9 million. Deferred revenue increased 3% sequentially to $321.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.8 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.2 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,350 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 472,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $105.96 per share, for a total of $50 million.
Looking ahead to Q4. While we remain cautious about the impact the ongoing financial uncertainty in Europe might have on our EMEA business, we are seeing strength within our North America enterprise business, and we believe our U.S. federal business will reflect the seasonal strength we typically see in Q4. We believe the key drivers of our business remain intact, and that we will continue to achieve solid, sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4.
With that in mind, our revenue target for Q4 is $307 million to $312 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to remain strong in the 81% to 82% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $156 million to $160 million. This includes approximately $21.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.75 to $0.77 per diluted share. Excluding stock [stock-based] compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.97 to $0.99 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $18 million to $20 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

The Americas year-over",879,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. The F5 team delivered another solid performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The Asia-Pacific, Japan region with the start of the quarter was a year-over-year growth rate over 50%. The Americas year-over-year growth rate of 22% was constrained a bit by some project-spending delays in the U.S. Federal market, as well as some project-spending delays particularly in the financial vertical. The EMEA's region year-over-year growth of 15% was clearly impacted by the economic challenges currently present in that region. 
We passed a significant milestone on our stellar balance sheet, with cash and investments surpassing the $1 billion mark, currently at $1.06 billion, having repurchased $50 million worth of common stock in the quarter. 
Our services business, once again, produced solid results with 34% growth in revenue, along with strong contribution to our overall profitability. Our non-GAAP operating margin was very solid at 38.2%, which is our highest level to date. We also saw improvement in our ARX sales in Q3, with ARX revenues growing 16% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. 
We started shipping our new VIPRION 2400 product, known in family as Victoria, towards the end of the quarter. The VIPRION 2400 leverages the significant success of our current VIPRION solution by providing industry-leading functionality at a very attractive price point. With the VIPRION 2400 chassis-based architecture, customers enjoy enhanced availability features and the flexibility to scale the ADC infrastructures without change -- without changing network, application or device configurations, leading to dramatically reduced operating expenditures.
As we mentioned in our press release announcing availability of this new product, the VIPRION 2400 is shipping initially with TMOS v. 10.2.2 and will support version 11 of TMOS when it is released. Initial sales and customer interest in the VIPRION 2400 has been very high, and we expect the level of interest to continue to increase during Q4 and continue additional momentum in fiscal 2012 as customer's option of version 11 accelerates.  
TMOS v. 11, which is target to ship in this coming quarter, includes over 150 new sophisticated management and scalability features to enhance data center consolidation and cloud architectures. Version 11 also includes new application visibility and management features, specific solutions for the telco market and significant software and firmware performance enhancements to many of our software modules. 
Version 11 also includes our sophisticated Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing technology, VCMP. That combines virtualization and multi-tenancy capabilities to help customers consolidate and efficiently manage application delivery services. VCMP enables multiple instances of BIG-IP software to run in one device and provides enterprises the unprecedented ability to have complete logical separation of software version and instances on a single highly scalable device. This capability is critically important for large enterprises and cloud and other service providers, who need on-demand scalability and the ability to ensure that each group's resources and network traffic are fully isolated from one another.
As far as the overall business outlook is concerned, I feel very confident about our prospects, both in the short term, as we move into the final quarter of fiscal year 2011, and for fiscal year 2012. 
At our last investor conference, we highlighted our application delivery controller technology as a starting point to address other major market opportunities, such as security and service provider. The key to this expansion is TMOS and their ability to deliver application level intelligence at network speeds. Version 11 contains significant enhancements that directly address these markets. For example, the majority of money spent on security to date has been targeted at protecting the network. F5's market-leading and award-winning application firewall solution, the Application Security Manager, is becoming increasingly vital to our customers as attacks on their IT infrastructure have become significantly more sophisticated, targeting not only the network but applications directly.
The recent high-profile hacking exploits against major banks, governments and other corporations demonstrate the inherent weakness of traditional firewall and IT solutions, and highlight the need for a security solution that not only protects the assets of the network but of the application as well. ASM, coupled with the core capabilities of TMOS, allows our customers to block this new generation of sophisticated hacker exploit. We have major Fortune 500 customers replacing traditional network firewalls entirely with BIG-IP.
Along with a significant additional security functionality in the v. 11, our short-term product roadmap include additional classification, enhanced network firewall capabilities and broader application protection that should further accelerate the opportunity to expand our presence in the security market. We believe this opportunity, coupled with our strategic footprint in the data center, will significantly expand the addressable market in fiscal year 2012 and beyond.
In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered solid sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. And as we stated last quarter, we continue to believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. Having said that, we believe there are real growth opportunities for F5 in the foreseeable future, and we plan to continue aggressively hiring to expand our sales and marketing service and development organization and enhance our prospects for future sustained growth.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter and will now hand the call over for Q&A."

We do feel good about the forecast that we've been given, and I -- actually, the pipeline is pretty good. But of course, you can see a pipeline growing when you get projects that get pushed. But overall, we feel okay about it. How long it'll last, it's hard to tell. In terms of federal, yes, we did see some deals slip.

It seems like you're hanging your hat on this thing kind of happening here in the September quarter, and I'm trying to understand sort of what is their process and methodology by which you get this high confidence that this will still happen, even though it didn't happen for you for this third quarter."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth. Revenue of $290.7 million was at the high end of our $287 million to $292 million guided range, grew 5% from the prior quarter and grew 26% compared to a very strong Q3 a year ago. GAAP EPS of $0.77 per diluted share was above our guided range of $0.69 to $0.71. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 per diluted share was also above our guided range of $0.89 to $0.91. The strong EPS results reflect additional R&D tax credit benefits of approximately $0.05 per share, recognized in the current quarter.
Product revenue of $179.3 million grew 22% year-over-year and represented 62% of total revenue. Service revenue of $111.4 million grew 34% year-over-year and accounted for 38% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one.
Both APAC and Japan delivered strong revenue growth during the quarter. APAC, which represented 16% of total revenue, grew 58% year-over-year. And Japan, at 7% of total revenue, was up 42% year-over-year. EMEA, representing 20% of total revenue, grew 15% from the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and was down sequentially. Accounting for 57% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up slightly compared to the prior quarter and grew 22% year-over-year. 
During Q3, our core Application Delivery Networking business accounted for $282.5 million compared to $270.5 million in Q2. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $8.3 million, up 16% from Q2 and 32% from the third quarter a year ago. 
Both the telco and technology verticals represented 21% of total revenue in Q3. The financial vertical accounted for 19%. Total government revenue was 10%, including 5% from U.S. federal. 
In Q3, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors, Avnet, which represented 16.4% of total revenue, and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 10.6%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 ticked up slightly to 82%. Excluding approximately $2.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin also moved up to 82.8%. GAAP operating expenses of $150 million were within our target range of $147 million to $151 million. Excluding $20.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $129.5 million. GAAP operating margins was 30.4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 38.2%. Reflecting the R&D tax benefit I mentioned earlier, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 30.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 29.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $101.1 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $92.2 million. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $1.057 billion. DSO at the end of Q3 was 48 days. Inventories were $17.9 million. Deferred revenue increased 3% sequentially to $321.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.8 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.2 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,350 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 472,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $105.96 per share, for a total of $50 million.
Looking ahead to Q4. While we remain cautious about the impact the ongoing financial uncertainty in Europe might have on our EMEA business, we are seeing strength within our North America enterprise business, and we believe our U.S. federal business will reflect the seasonal strength we typically see in Q4. We believe the key drivers of our business remain intact, and that we will continue to achieve solid, sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4.
With that in mind, our revenue target for Q4 is $307 million to $312 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to remain strong in the 81% to 82% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $156 million to $160 million. This includes approximately $21.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.75 to $0.77 per diluted share. Excluding stock [stock-based] compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $0.97 to $0.99 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35%. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the mid 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $18 million to $20 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

The Americas year-over",879,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. The F5 team delivered another solid performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The Asia-Pacific, Japan region with the start of the quarter was a year-over-year growth rate over 50%. The Americas year-over-year growth rate of 22% was constrained a bit by some project-spending delays in the U.S. federal market, as well as some project-spending delays particularly in the financial vertical. The EMEA's region year-over-year growth of 15% was clearly impacted by the economic challenges currently present in that region. 
We passed a significant milestone on our stellar balance sheet, with cash and investments surpassing the $1 billion mark, currently at $1.06 billion, having repurchased $50 million worth of common stock in the quarter. 
Our services business, once again, produced solid results with 34% growth in revenue, along with strong contribution to our overall profitability. Our non-GAAP operating margin was very solid at 38.2%, which is our highest level to date. We also saw improvement in our ARX sales in Q3, with ARX revenues growing 16% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. 
We started shipping our new VIPRION 2400 product, known in family as Victoria, towards the end of the quarter. The VIPRION 2400 leverages the significant success of our current VIPRION solution by providing industry-leading functionality at a very attractive price point. With the VIPRION 2400 chassis-based architecture, customers enjoy enhanced availability features and the flexibility to scale the ADC infrastructures without change -- without changing network, application or device configurations, leading to dramatically reduced operating expenditures.
As we mentioned in our press release announcing availability of this new product, the VIPRION 2400 is shipping initially with TMOS v. 10.2.2 and will support version 11 of TMOS when it is released. Initial sales and customer interest in the VIPRION 2400 has been very high, and we expect the level of interest to continue to increase during Q4 and continue additional momentum in fiscal 2012 as customer's option of version 11 accelerates.  
TMOS v. 11, which is target to ship in this coming quarter, includes over 150 new sophisticated management and scalability features to enhance data center consolidation and cloud architectures. Version 11 also includes new application visibility and management features, specific solutions for the telco market and significant software and firmware performance enhancements to many of our software modules. 
Version 11 also includes our sophisticated Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing technology, vCMP. That combines virtualization and multi-tenancy capabilities to help customers consolidate and efficiently manage application delivery services. vCMP enables multiple instances of BIG-IP software to run in one device and provides enterprises the unprecedented ability to have complete logical separation of software version and instances on a single highly scalable device. This capability is critically important for large enterprises and cloud and other service providers, who need on-demand scalability and the ability to ensure that each group's resources and network traffic are fully isolated from one another.
As far as the overall business outlook is concerned, I feel very confident about our prospects, both in the short term, as we move into the final quarter of fiscal year 2011, and for fiscal year 2012. 
At our last investor conference, we highlighted our application delivery controller technology as a starting point to address other major market opportunities, such as security and service provider. The key to this expansion is TMOS and their ability to deliver application level intelligence at network speeds. Version 11 contains significant enhancements that directly address these markets. For example, the majority of money spent on security to date has been targeted at protecting the network. F5's market-leading and award-winning application firewall solution, the Application Security Manager, is becoming increasingly vital to our customers as attacks on their IT infrastructure have become significantly more sophisticated, targeting not only the network but applications directly.
The recent high-profile hacking exploits against major banks, governments and other corporations demonstrate the inherent weakness of traditional firewall and IT solutions, and highlight the need for a security solution that not only protects the assets of the network but of the application as well. ASM, coupled with the core capabilities of TMOS, allows our customers to block this new generation of sophisticated hacker exploit. We have major Fortune 500 customers replacing traditional network firewalls entirely with BIG-IP.
Along with a significant additional security functionality in the v. 11, our short-term product roadmap include additional classification, enhanced network firewall capabilities and broader application protection that should further accelerate the opportunity to expand our presence in the security market. We believe this opportunity, coupled with our strategic footprint in the data center, will significantly expand the addressable market in fiscal year 2012 and beyond.
In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered solid sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. And as we stated last quarter, we continue to believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. Having said that, we believe there are real growth opportunities for F5 in the foreseeable future, and we plan to continue aggressively hiring to expand our sales and marketing service and development organization and enhance our prospects for future sustained growth.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter and will now hand the call over for Q&A."

And that -- we've been pushing this for Mark and his team for actually a couple of years now, and we're starting to see some progress. So we saw VIPRION tight sales. We saw higher end.

In my comments, I will review our results",1124,"Thank you, John. Fiscal year 2011 represents a landmark year for F5 as we surpassed the $1 billion threshold in annual revenue, posted 31% year-over-year growth and ended the year with just under 2,500 employees. In my comments, I will review our results for our fourth quarter and for fiscal 2011. I will provide guidance for Q1 2012, and discuss our general planning assumptions and expectations for fiscal 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, revenue of $314.6 million was above our guided range of $307 million to $312 million, growing 8% from the prior quarter and 24% from the fourth quarter a year ago.
Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than 1. Q4 product revenue of $197.4 million was up 10% from the prior quarter, 20% from the fourth quarter of last year and represented 63% of revenue. Service revenue of $117.2 million increased 5% sequentially, 31% year-over-year and accounted for 37% of revenue.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $307.3 million compared to $282.5 million in Q3. ARX revenue was $7.3 million, down from $8.3 million in the prior quarter.
By geography, the Americas grew 25% year-over-year and represented 60% of revenue. EMEA grew 14% year-over-year, accounting for 20% of revenue. And APAC and Japan each grew 32% from a year ago, representing 13% and 7% of revenue, respectively.
By vertical, telco represented 26% of sales during the quarter, and technology and financial each accounted for 19%. Total government was 12% of sales, including 7% from U.S. Federal.
During Q4, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors, Avnet Technologies, which accounted for 17.8% of total revenue and Ingram Micro, which represented 12.3%. 
Continuing down to income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.2%. Excluding $2.6 million of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP gross margin was 83%.
Operating expenses were $159.4 million. Excluding $19.6 million of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP operating expenses were $139.8 million.
GAAP operating margin was 31.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%. Other income for the quarter was $4.1 million. This includes a $1.9 million foreign currency gains that was recognized during the quarter.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.1%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $67.6 million or $0.84 per diluted share, above our guided range of $0.75 to $0.77. Non-GAAP net income was $85.2 million or a $1.06 per diluted share, also above our guided range of $0.97 to $0.99.
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2011 was $1.15 billion, up 31% from fiscal 2010. Product revenue of $722 million was up 29% from the prior year, and accounted for 63% of total revenue. Service revenue of $430 million grew 34% during the year, and represented 37% of the total.
GAAP net income for fiscal 2011 was $241.4 million or $2.96 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $308.3 million or $3.78 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $121.5 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.01 billion at year end. For all of fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations totaled $416.9 million.
DSO was 47 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $17.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 7% sequentially to $343.3 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $9.9 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.2 million.
During the quarter, we added 140 employees, ending the year with approximately 2,490 full-time employees. For the fiscal year, we added 480 employees, an increase of 24%.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.91 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $78.37 per share for a total of $150 million. The Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $200 million for repurchase combined with the $166 million remaining from the board authorization in August, a total of $366 million is available for stock repurchase.
Now, I would like to discuss our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. As noted on several occasions this past year, we recognize that as we continue to grow the company, our sales exhibit the same first quarter fiscal year seasonality characteristic of many industry peers. This seasonality is reflected in our Q1 quarterly guidance. Factoring in the expected seasonality of our new fiscal year, we are targeting revenue in the range of $315 million to $320 million. We are forecasting GAAP gross margins of 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points, which includes approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expense of $161 million to $165 million, including approximately $20 million in stock compensation expense. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35% for the quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%.
Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $0.79 to $0.81 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $0.99 to $1.01 per share. We expect DSO in the mid-40-day range. We anticipate inventories in the range of $16 million to $18 million.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 100 employees during the quarter, and we believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $130 million.
Now I would like to provide some general comments and guidelines related to our expectations for fiscal 2012. Please note that these plan and guidelines are based on the current business climate, and assumes no significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. With this in mind, we expect to see sequential revenue growth throughout the year. We expect to see a return to product revenue growth acceleration in Q2, and we expect total revenue growth of at least 20% over fiscal 2011. We expect to see gross margins consistent with our Q1 guidance of 82%, plus or minus, 50 basis points through the year. We are targeting non-GAAP operating margins for the year to be at or around 38%. In light of the aforementioned revenue seasonality, operating margins will likely exhibit some seasonality as well, as we continue to invest in to our robust market opportunity. As such, operating margins may be seasonally lower in Q1. We expect stock-based compensation expense to approximate Q1 levels until our next annual grant in August. Capital expenditures are expected to be $6 million to $12 million per quarter with some quarter-to-quarter variability related to the timing of certain infrastructure investments, and we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 35% on a GAAP basis and 33.5% on a non-GAAP basis throughout the year.
As John mentioned, we will be holding our Analyst Investor Meeting in New York on November 3. We look forward to seeing you there. With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I will take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2011, talking more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2012.F5 su",1341,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2011, talking more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2012.
F5 surpassed a very significant milestone last year with over $1 billion in revenue. We closed the year well above $1 billion run rate with revenue up $314.6 million in Q4. We further increased our technology leadership and competitive positions with several product releases in the second half of fiscal 2011, which we believe will be strong growth drivers as we enter fiscal 2012.
The revolutionary VIPRION 2400 midrange chassis based architecture, combined with the introduction of TMOS version 11 will prove to be key components in enabling large-scale dynamic data centers with virtualization technologies and cloud-based architectures. We now have the most comprehensive portfolio of software versions of our TMOS solutions, as well as the industry-leading range of hardware products delivering both superior performance and functionality.
During fiscal 2011, we made significant enhancements to our ARX product portfolio. We announced the ARX cloud extender, which enables data pool automatically, securely and nondisruptively from file-based storage platforms to cloud-based storage architectures. We also added a new virtual ARX supply appliance gear. And last quarter, we introduced 2 new ARX platforms, ARX 1500 and 2500 appliances. These new platforms offer compelling performance capabilities at very attractive price points.
We made significant progress increasing our addressable market by delivering solutions to our core ADC platforms in adjacent markets including remote access control optimization and security. I will talk more about these future market expanding opportunities later when I review our prospect for fiscal 2012.
In addition, we continue to generate significant revenues from our partnerships with large application solution suppliers including Microsoft, Oracle and VMware for the ability of our products to optimize the performance of security and availability of mission-critical business applications is unparalleled. The new features in TMOS version 11 strengthen these partnerships even further, and increase the number and range of opportunities for our products and the deployment of these applications. For example, our new groundbreaking IR technology simplify deployment of applications, anything tend to 100x faster application delivery through the network.
Customers will not only enjoy a compelling ROI from the IR functionality, but will now also be able to manage dynamic data center architectures through the lens of application. This opens a pair of TMOS and F5 solutions to more groups within our customer organizations, and enhances the value of F5 strategic points of control in our customers architectures.
Our services business delivered strong performance consistently throughout fiscal 2011, and continue to be a significant profit and revenue growth contributor while maintaining customer satisfaction at world-class levels. We ended the fiscal year with a stellar balance sheet with over $1 billion in cash and investments, having repurchased approximately 272 million of common stock during 2011. Our overall year-over-year revenue growth were 31%, including 29% year-over-year growth from product sales and 34% growth from our services business. We also increased our profitability during 2011, achieving a record non-GAAP operating margin of 38% for the full year.
We accomplished this while investing significantly in addition of headcounts, increasing our total net headcount by approximately 480 employees, ending the year with just under 2,500 employees. We are also very proud to have been included in S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 during fiscal 2011.
As far as Q4 is concerned, I'm very pleased with our results including year-over-year revenue growth of 24% and 10% sequential product growth. From a geographic perspective, North America was the star of the quarter, driven by large multimillion dollar ADC project wins and strong performance in the service provider market. Sales bookings were strong across all of our major regions, and met or exceeded our internal forecast.
Overall, our Q4 financial performance was very strong. Quarterly free cash flow of almost $112 million was a record for the company, and our non-GAAP operating margins of almost 38.6% exceeded our internal targets. Our services business delivered yet another solid quarter. Deferred revenue continued to grow last quarter with a balance of $343 million, moving into fiscal 2012.
Q4 was a positive quarter of shipments over a midrange VIPRION 2400. The customer adoption of the 2400 has been fantastic, with shipments in Q4 well above our internal expectations. We also saw a strong demand for our high-end VIPRION 4400 particularly in the service provider market. Also, the customer reaction to our Q4 release of version 11 has been excellent. Functionality of IR and true virtual multiprocessing are real game changers in the industry. As far as the outlook is concerned, it's appropriate to be cautious about the global economic situation, and we remain committed to strong profitability.
There are some uncertainties present in the overall economy as we enter fiscal 2012. Obviously, as the current macroeconomic conditions weaken, then overall global IT spending could be reduced. Andy provided our projected revenue ranges as well as some of the higher-level expectations for fiscal 2012. As I mentioned several times during last year, we should expect to see seasonality in our business during Q1. This first quarter seasonality, which is normal in the technology market and is in line with our peers, is reflected in our guidance.
One of the most important financial objectives in fiscal 2012 is to deliver accelerating product revenue growth. Assuming no major change in the macroeconomic environment, we would expect to see our product revenue growth begin to accelerate in Q2. We also currently expect to achieve total year-over-year revenue growth of at least 20%. I remain very optimistic of the future of F5 as we enter fiscal 2012. We continue to enjoy a very strong competitive position. I am particularly excited about the opportunities that we have with our new products such as TMOS version 11 and the VIPRION 2400, as well as upcoming new products and features on our 2012 product roadmap. We will present the roadmap in detail on our upcoming Analyst Investor Meeting schedule for early November.
I have asserted many times in the past that F5 enjoys the position in being in the sweet spot of business and industry trends. Data center consolidation using virtualization technologies, cloud computing architectures and the continued explosive growth of both applications and data are all industry trends that continue to be significant growth drivers for F5 solutions. We expect to see healthy growth from our core ADC market solution, as well as incremental opportunities as we continue our success and expanding market areas such as service providers and the security market. As I mentioned in last quarter's conference call, F5's market-leading and award-winning application firewall solution, Application Security Manager, or AFM, is becoming increasingly vital to customers as attacks in their IT infrastructure have become significantly more sophisticated, targeting not only the network but the application directly.
ASM, coupled with the core abilities of TMOS, our customers block this new generation of sophisticated hacker exploit. We have major Fortune 500 customers replacing traditional network firewalls entirely with BIG-IP. Along with the significant additional security functionality in TMOS version 11, our short-term product roadmap includes additional classification, enhanced network firewall capabilities and broader application protection that should further accelerate the opportunity to expand our presence in the security market. We believe this opportunity, coupled with our strategic footprint in the data center will significantly expand the addressable market in fiscal year 2012 and beyond.
We will also continue to aggressively invest in our sales associates to expand into new and existing geographic regions, as well as investing in key vertical market opportunities. The F5 team should be proud of our progress in the company sales during fiscal 2011. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team under partners for their tremendous efforts last year, and I look forward to the continued to support of fiscal 2012.
And with that, we would now hand the call over for Q&A."

It's all in retrospect, giving guidance for the full year as far as growth. And today, with, I would say, the environment being a little bit more inconsistent or unknown, you actually feel comfortable giving us a full year guidance for 2012. So what it is that's different today versus a year ago?

If it deteriorates by definition, we will have issues there. So there's no question about that. But if it stays in the same -- and there's no reason to think it will change apart from watching television and listening to the news in terms of our pipeline metric, they look very strong. In terms of looking forward to the year, it's very straight forward for us. Number one priority from a financial perspective is to reaccelerate product revenue growth. As I say that we believe we can do that in Q2. We looked at the sales productivity. We've looked at our pipeline, and we think we have a good time handle on that. Obviously, ADC and the VIPRION 5400 and TMOS 11 are big deal for us moving into the year as well, as they are expanding markets scenarios with areas like service provider and securities. So that's the quick summary. That's really what I said in the script, but it's a quick summary of the question."

And then also, as we take some of the technologies and choices that have been announced today, we've seen approaches where people are up to install servers there, multiple times now market in the past, and I don't expect that pattern to change anytime soon, and we will compete vigorously with anybody that comes in the ADC market."

When we talk about our core ADC platform and we talk about adjacent markets, the solutions to those adjacent markets fit within our core ADC platforms. So, for example, ASM has been growing dramatically actually over the last couple of years in a very strong year in 2011. But we don't report that because ASM is part of the solution based on the platform that we've got. We'll probably be doing web acceleration of the first time. They're very important that the part of the overall solution that we gave. It's very difficult to actually put numerics beside it. Having said that we look at the service providers and security market in particular piece of that remark. We do believe that the chunk of the firewall market especially that we can go for. Again, it will be supported as ADC revenue. But because of the ability to understand the application, the fluency of our application product, because of the ability to handle high firewall, high connections per second, the firewalls just can't do because you actually see that market increasing as well. And then as a service provider, we've talked about that. We've talked about the opportunities with traffic steering, with LTE, some of the stuff in the roadmap.

Fiscal year 2011 represents a landmark year for F5 as we surpassed the $1 billion threshold in annual revenue, posted 31% year-over-year growth and ended the year with just under 2,500 employees. In my comments, I will review our results for our fourth quarter and for fiscal 2011. I will provide guidance for Q1 2012, and discuss our general planning assumptions and expectations for fiscal 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, revenue of $314.6 million was above our guided range of $307 million to $312 million, growing 8% from the prior quarter and 24% from the fourth quarter a year ago.
Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than 1. Q4 product revenue of $197.4 million was up 10% from the prior quarter, 20% from the fourth quarter of last year and represented 63% of revenue. Service revenue of $117.2 million increased 5% sequentially, 31% year-over-year and accounted for 37% of revenue.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $307.3 million compared to $282.5 million in Q3. ARX revenue was $7.3 million, down from $8.3 million in the prior quarter.
By geography, the Americas grew 25% year-over-year and represented 60% of revenue. EMEA grew 14% year-over-year, accounting for 20% of revenue. And APAC and Japan each grew 32% from a year ago, representing 13% and 7% of revenue, respectively.
By vertical, telco represented 26% of sales during the quarter, and technology and financial each accounted for 19%. Total government was 12% of sales, including 7% from U.S. Federal.
During Q4, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors, Avnet Technologies, which accounted for 17.8% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which represented 12.3%. 
Continuing down to income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.2%. Excluding $2.6 million of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP gross margin was 83%.
Operating expenses were $159.4 million. Excluding $19.6 million of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP operating expenses were $139.8 million. GAAP operating margin was 31.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%. Other income for the quarter was $4.1 million. This includes a $1.9 million foreign currency gain that was recognized during the quarter.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.1%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $67.6 million or $0.84 per diluted share, above our guided range of $0.75 to $0.77. Non-GAAP net income was $85.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share, also above our guided range of $0.97 to $0.99.
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2011 was $1.15 billion, up 31% from fiscal 2010. Product revenue of $722 million was up 29% from the prior year, and accounted for 63% of total revenue. Service revenue of $430 million grew 34% during the year, and represented 37% of the total.
GAAP net income for fiscal 2011 was $241.4 million or $2.96 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $308.3 million or $3.78 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $121.5 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.01 billion at year end. For all of fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations totaled $416.9 million.
DSO was 47 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $17.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 7% sequentially to $343.3 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $9.9 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.2 million.
During the quarter, we added 140 employees, ending the year with approximately 2,490 full-time employees. For the fiscal year, we added 480 employees, an increase of 24%.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.91 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $78.37 per share for a total of $150 million. The Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $200 million for repurchase, combined with the $166 million remaining from the board authorization in August, a total of $366 million is available for stock repurchase.
Now I would like to discuss our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. As noted on several occasions this past year, we recognize that as we continue to grow the company, our sales exhibit the same first quarter fiscal year seasonality characteristic of many industry peers. This seasonality is reflected in our Q1 quarterly guidance.
Factoring in the expected seasonality of our new fiscal year, we are targeting revenue in the range of $315 million to $320 million. We are forecasting GAAP gross margins of 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points, which includes approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expense of $161 million to $165 million, including approximately $20 million in stock compensation expense. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35% for the quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%.
Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $0.79 to $0.81 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $0.99 to $1.01 per share. We expect DSO in the mid-40-day range. We anticipate inventories in the range of $16 million to $18 million.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 100 employees during the quarter, and we believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $130 million.
Now I would like to provide some general comments and guidelines related to our expectations for fiscal 2012. Please note that these planning guidelines are based on the current business climate, and assume no significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment.
With this in mind, we expect to see sequential revenue growth throughout the year. We expect to see a return to product revenue growth acceleration in Q2, and we expect total revenue growth of at least 20% over fiscal 2011. We expect to see gross margins consistent with our Q1 guidance of 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points through the year. We are targeting non-GAAP operating margins for the year to be at or around 38%.
In light of the aforementioned revenue seasonality, operating margins will likely exhibit some seasonality as well, as we continue to invest into our robust market opportunity. As such, operating margins may be seasonally lower in Q1. We expect stock-based compensation expense to approximate Q1 levels until our next annual grant in August. Capital expenditures are expected to be $6 million to $12 million per quarter with some quarter-to-quarter variability related to the timing of certain infrastructure investments. And we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 35% on a GAAP basis, and 33.5% on a non-GAAP basis throughout the year.
As John mentioned, we will be holding our Analyst Investor Meeting in New York on November 3. We look forward to seeing you there. With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I will take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2011, talking more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2012.F5 su",1350,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2011, talking more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2012.
F5 surpassed a very significant milestone last year, with over $1 billion in revenue. We closed the year well above $1 billion run rate, with revenue up $314.6 million in Q4. We further increased our technology leadership and competitive positions with several product releases in the second half of fiscal 2011, which we believe will be strong growth drivers as we enter fiscal 2012.
The revolutionary VIPRION 2400 midrange chassis-based architecture, combined with the introduction of TMOS version 11, will prove to be key components in enabling large-scale dynamic data centers with virtualization technologies and cloud-based architectures. We now have the most comprehensive portfolio of software-only versions of our TMOS solutions, as well as the industry-leading range of hardware products, delivering both superior performance and functionality.
During fiscal 2011, we made significant enhancements to our ARX product portfolio. We announced the ARX Cloud Extender, which enables data pool automatically, securely and non-disruptively from file-based storage platforms to cloud-based storage architectures. We also added a new virtual ARX appliance during the year. And last quarter, we introduced 2 new ARX platforms: The ARX 1500 and 2500 appliances. These new platforms offer compelling performance capabilities at very attractive price points.
We made significant progress in increasing our addressable market by delivering solutions to our core ADC platforms in adjacent markets, including remote access control optimization and security. I will talk more about these future market expanding opportunities later when I review our prospect for fiscal 2012.
In addition, we continue to generate significant revenues from our partnerships with large application solution suppliers including Microsoft, Oracle and VMware, for the ability of our products to optimize the performance, security and availability of mission-critical business applications is unparalleled.
The new features in TMOS version 11 should strengthen these partnerships even further, and increase the number and range of opportunities for our products and the deployment of these applications. For example, our new groundbreaking iApp technology, simplified deployment of applications, enabling 10 to 100x faster application delivery through the network.
Customers will not only enjoy a compelling ROI from the iApp functionality, but will now also be able to manage dynamic data center architectures through the lens of the application. This opens the pearl of TMOS and F5 solutions to more groups within our customer organizations, and enhances the value of F5 strategic points of control in our customers' architectures.
Our Services business delivered strong performance consistently throughout fiscal 2011, and continued to be a significant profit and revenue growth contributor, while maintaining customer satisfaction at world-class levels. We ended the fiscal year with a stellar balance sheet with over $1 billion in cash and investments, having repurchased approximately 272 million of common stock during 2011.
Our overall year-over-year revenue growth were 31%, including 29% year-over-year growth from product sales and 34% growth from our Services business. We also increased our profitability during 2011, achieving a record non-GAAP operating margin of 38% for the full year.
We accomplished this while investing significantly in additional headcounts, increasing our total net headcount by approximately 480 employees, ending the year with just under 2,500 employees. We are also very proud to have been included in the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ 100 during fiscal 2011.
As far as Q4 is concerned, I'm very pleased with our results including year-over-year revenue growth of 24% and 10% sequential product growth. From a geographic perspective, North America was the star of the quarter, driven by large multimillion dollar ADC project wins and strong performance in the service provider market. Sales bookings were strong across all of other major regions, and met or exceeded our internal forecast.
Overall, our Q4 financial performance was very strong. Quarterly free cash flow of almost $112 million was a record for the company, and our non-GAAP operating margins of almost 38.6% exceeded our internal targets. Our Services business delivered yet another solid quarter. Deferred revenue continued to grow last quarter with a balance of $343 million, moving into fiscal 2012.
Q4 was a positive quarter of shipments over a midrange VIPRION 2400. The customer adoption of the 2400 has been fantastic, with shipments in Q4 well above our internal expectations. We also saw a strong demand for our high-end VIPRION 4400, particularly in the service provider market.
Also, the customer reaction to our Q4 release of version 11 has been excellent. Functionality like iApp and true Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing are real game changers in the industry. As far as the outlook is concerned, it's appropriate to be cautious about the global economic situation, and we remain committed to strong profitability.
Clearly, there are numerous uncertainties present in the overall economy as we enter fiscal 2012. Obviously, as the current macroeconomic conditions weaken, then overall global IT spending could be reduced. Andy provided our projected revenue ranges, as well as some of the higher-level expectations for fiscal 2012. As I mentioned several times during last year, we should expect to see seasonality in our business during Q1. This first quarter seasonality, which is normal in the technology market and is in line with our peers, is reflected in our guidance.
One of the most -- one other important financial objectives in fiscal 2012 is to deliver accelerating product revenue growth. Assuming no major change in the macroeconomic environment, we would expect to see our product revenue growth begin to accelerate in Q2. We also currently expect to achieve overall year-over-year total revenue growth of at least 20%. 
I remain very optimistic of the future of F5 as we enter fiscal 2012. We continue to enjoy a very strong competitive position. I am particularly excited about the opportunities that we have with our new products such as TMOS version 11 and the VIPRION 2400, as well as upcoming new products and features on our 2012 product roadmap. We will present our roadmap in detail at our upcoming Analyst/Investor Meeting schedule for early November.
I have asserted many times in the past, that F5 enjoys the position of being in the sweet spot of business and industry trends. Data center consolidation using virtualization technologies, cloud computing architectures and the continued explosive growth of mobile applications and data, are all industry trends which continue to be significant growth drivers for F5 solutions.
We expect to see healthy growth from our core ADC market solutions, as well as incremental opportunities as we continue to our success and expanding market areas, such as service providers and the security market. As I mentioned in last quarter's conference call, F5's market-leading and award-winning application firewall solution, Application Security Manager or ASM, is becoming increasingly vital to customers as attacks in their IT infrastructure have become significantly more sophisticated, targeting not only the network but the application directly.
ASM, coupled with the core capabilities of TMOS, alert our customers to block this new generation of sophisticated hacker exploit. We have major Fortune 500 customers replacing traditional network firewalls entirely with BIG-IP. Along with the significant additional security functionality in TMOS version 11, our short-term product roadmap includes additional classification, enhanced network firewall capabilities and broader application protection that should further accelerate the opportunity to expand our presence in the security market. We believe this opportunity, coupled with our strategic footprint in the data center will significantly expand the addressable market in fiscal year 2012 and beyond.
We will also continue to aggressively invest in our sales associates to expand into new and existing geographic regions, as well as investing in key vertical market opportunities. The F5 team should be proud of our progress and accomplishments during fiscal 2011. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team under partners for their tremendous efforts last year, and I look forward to the continued to support of fiscal 2012.
And with that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

So first of all, let me give you a caveat once more, that we read out, which is that in terms of the annual growth that were the guidance that we've given, that is absolutely based on the macroeconomy, staying in the same conditions, as it deteriorates by definition, we will have issues there. So there's no question about that. But if it stays in the same -- and we've no reason to think it will change, apart from watching television and listening to the news, in terms of our pipeline metric, they look very strong. In terms of looking forward to the year, it's very straightforward for us. The number one priority from a financial perspective is to reaccelerate product revenue growth. And as I say that, we believe we can do that in Q2. We've looked at the sales productivity. We've looked at our pipeline, and we think we have a good handle on that. Obviously, AD is like ADC and the VIPRION 2400 and TMOS 11, are big deals as far as moving into the year as well, as the expanding markets scenarios with areas like service provider and securities.

And then, to take on the competitive front, yes, fully, we obviously saw the announcement today as well.

Also, we're seeing very nice adoption, very happy with the growth rates and sales of our virtual additions, although we're not breaking that out, but I'm very pleased with it.

It's the fact that this virtual environment with faster servers, people are putting more and more applications across more virtual machines. And each one of these things represent essentially a virtual address for us to deal with. That's why we do really well and consolidate very well, and iApp and other functionality is just another step in improving that consolidation piece.

Fiscal year 2011 represents a landmark year for F5 as we surpassed the $1 billion threshold in annual revenue, posted 31% year-over-year growth and ended the year with just under 2,500 employees. In my comments, I will review our results for our fourth quarter and for fiscal 2011. I will provide guidance for Q1 2012, and discuss our general planning assumptions and expectations for fiscal 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, revenue of $314.6 million was above our guided range of $307 million to $312 million, growing 8% from the prior quarter and 24% from the fourth quarter a year ago.
Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than 1. Q4 product revenue of $197.4 million was up 10% from the prior quarter, 20% from the fourth quarter of last year and represented 63% of revenue. Service revenue of $117.2 million increased 5% sequentially, 31% year-over-year and accounted for 37% of revenue.
Revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $307.3 million compared to $282.5 million in Q3. ARX revenue was $7.3 million, down from $8.3 million in the prior quarter.
By geography, the Americas grew 25% year-over-year and represented 60% of revenue. EMEA grew 14% year-over-year, accounting for 20% of revenue. And APAC and Japan each grew 32% from a year ago, representing 13% and 7% of revenue, respectively.
By vertical, telco represented 26% of sales during the quarter, and technology and financial each accounted for 19%. Total government was 12% of sales, including 7% from U.S. Federal.
During Q4, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors: Avnet Technologies, which accounted for 17.8% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which represented 12.3%. 
Continuing down to income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.2%. Excluding $2.6 million of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP gross margin was 83%.
Operating expenses were $159.4 million. Excluding $19.6 million of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP operating expenses were $139.8 million. GAAP operating margin was 31.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%. Other income for the quarter was $4.1 million. This includes a $1.9 million foreign currency gain that was recognized during the quarter.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.1%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $67.6 million or $0.84 per diluted share, above our guided range of $0.75 to $0.77. Non-GAAP net income was $85.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share, also above our guided range of $0.97 to $0.99.
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2011 was $1.15 billion, up 31% from fiscal 2010. Product revenue of $722 million was up 29% from the prior year, and accounted for 63% of total revenue. Service revenue of $430 million grew 34% during the year, and represented 37% of the total.
GAAP net income for fiscal 2011 was $241.4 million or $2.96 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $308.3 million or $3.78 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $121.5 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.01 billion at year end. For all of fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations totaled $416.9 million.
DSO was 47 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $17.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 7% sequentially to $343.3 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $9.9 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.2 million.
During the quarter, we added 140 employees, ending the year with approximately 2,490 full-time employees. For the fiscal year, we added 480 employees, an increase of 24%.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.91 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $78.37 per share for a total of $150 million. The Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $200 million for repurchase, combined with the $166 million remaining from the board authorization in August, a total of $366 million is available for stock repurchase.
Now I would like to discuss our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. As noted on several occasions this past year, we recognize that as we continue to grow the company, our sales exhibit the same first quarter fiscal year seasonality characteristic of many industry peers. This seasonality is reflected in our Q1 quarterly guidance.
Factoring in the expected seasonality of our new fiscal year, we are targeting revenue in a range of $315 million to $320 million. We are forecasting GAAP gross margins of 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points, which includes approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
We anticipate GAAP operating expense of $161 million to $165 million, including approximately $20 million in stock compensation expense. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35% for the quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%.
Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $0.79 to $0.81 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $0.99 to $1.01 per share. We expect DSO in the mid-40-day range. We anticipate inventories in the range of $16 million to $18 million.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 100 employees during the quarter, and we believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $130 million.
Now I would like to provide some general comments and guidelines related to our expectations for fiscal 2012. Please note that these planning guidelines are based on the current business climate, and assume no significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment.
With this in mind, we expect to see sequential revenue growth throughout the year. We expect to see a return to product revenue growth acceleration in Q2, and we expect total revenue growth of at least 20% over fiscal 2011. We expect to see gross margins consistent with our Q1 guidance of 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points through the year. We are targeting non-GAAP operating margins for the year to be at or around 38%.
In light of the aforementioned revenue seasonality, operating margins will likely exhibit some seasonality as well, as we continue to invest into our robust market opportunity. As such, operating margins may be seasonally lower in Q1. We expect stock-based compensation expense to approximate Q1 levels until our next annual grant in August. Capital expenditures are expected to be $6 million to $12 million per quarter with some quarter-to-quarter variability related to timing of certain infrastructure investments. And we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 35% on a GAAP basis, and 33.5% on a non-GAAP basis throughout the year.
As John mentioned, we will be holding our Analyst Investor Meeting in New York on November 3. We look forward to seeing you there. With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I will take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2011, talk in more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2012.F5 su",1354,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2011, talk in more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2012.
F5 surpassed a very significant milestone last year, with over $1 billion in revenue. We closed the year well above $1 billion run rate, with revenue of $314.6 million in Q4. We further increased our technology leadership and competitive positions with several product releases in the second half of fiscal 2011, which we believe will be strong growth drivers as we enter fiscal 2012.
The revolutionary VIPRION 2400 midrange chassis-based architecture, combined with the introduction of TMOS version 11, will prove to be key components in enabling large-scale dynamic data centers with virtualization technologies and cloud-based architectures. We now have the most comprehensive portfolio of software-only versions of our TMOS solutions, as well as the industry-leading range of hardware products, delivering both superior performance and functionality.
During fiscal 2011, we made significant enhancements to our ARX product portfolio. We announced the ARX Cloud Extender, which enables data flow automatically, securely and non-disruptively from file-based storage platforms to cloud-based storage architectures. We also added a new virtual ARX appliance during the year. And last quarter, we introduced 2 new ARX platforms: The ARX 1500 and 2500 appliances. These new platforms offer compelling performance capabilities at very attractive price points.
We made significant progress in increasing our addressable market by delivering solutions to our core ADC platforms in adjacent markets, including remote access control optimization and security. I will talk more about these future market expanding opportunities later when I review our prospect for fiscal 2012.
In addition, we continue to generate significant revenues from our partnerships with large application solution suppliers including Microsoft, Oracle and VMware, for the ability of our products to optimize the performance, security and availability of mission-critical business applications is unparalleled.
The new features in TMOS version 11 should strengthen these partnerships even further, and increase the number and range of opportunities for our products and the deployment of these applications. For example, our new groundbreaking iApp technology, simplified deployment of applications, enabling 10 to 100x faster application delivery through the network.
Customers will not only enjoy a compelling ROI from the iApp functionality, but will now also be able to manage dynamic data center architectures through the lens of the application. This opens the pair of TMOS and F5 solutions to more groups within our customer organizations, and enhances the value of F5 strategic points of control in our customers' architectures.
Our Services business delivered strong performance consistently throughout fiscal 2011, and continued to be a significant profit and revenue growth contributor, while maintaining customer satisfaction at world-class levels. We ended the fiscal year with a stellar balance sheet with over $1 billion in cash and investments, having repurchased approximately 272 million of common stock during 2011.
Our overall year-over-year revenue growth was 31%, including 29% year-over-year growth from product sales and 34% growth from our Services business. We also increased our profitability during 2011, achieving a record non-GAAP operating margin of 38% for the full year.
We accomplished this while investing significantly in additional headcounts, increasing our total net headcount by approximately 480 employees, ending the year with just under 2,500 employees. We are also very proud to have been included in the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ 100 during fiscal 2011.
As far as Q4 is concerned, I'm very pleased with our results including year-over-year revenue growth of 24% and 10% sequential product growth. From a geographic perspective, North America was the star of the quarter, driven by large multimillion dollar ADC project wins and strong performance in the service provider market. Sales bookings were strong across all of other major regions, and met or exceeded our internal forecast.
Overall, our Q4 financial performance was very strong. Quarterly free cash flow of almost $112 million was a record for the company, and our non-GAAP operating margins of almost 38.6% exceeded our internal targets. Our Services business delivered yet another solid quarter. Deferred revenue continued to grow last quarter with a balance of $343 million, moving into fiscal 2012.
Q4 was the first full quarter of shipments of a midrange VIPRION 2400. The customer adoption of the 2400 has been fantastic, with shipments in Q4 well above our internal expectations. We also saw a strong demand for our high-end VIPRION 4400, particularly in the service provider market.
Also, the customer reaction to our Q4 release of version 11 has been excellent. Functionality like iApp and true Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing are real game changers in the industry. As far as the outlook is concerned, it's appropriate to be cautious about the global economic situation, and we remain committed to strong profitability.
Clearly, there are numerous uncertainties present in the overall economy as we enter fiscal 2012. Obviously, as the current macroeconomic conditions weaken, then overall global IT spending could be reduced. Andy provided our projected revenue ranges, as well as some of the higher-level expectations for fiscal 2012. As I mentioned several times during last year, we should expect to see seasonality in our business during Q1. This first quarter seasonality, which is normal in the technology market and is in line with our peers, is reflected in our guidance.
One of the most -- one of our important financial objectives in fiscal 2012 is to deliver accelerating product revenue growth. Assuming no major change in the macroeconomic environment, we would expect to see our product revenue growth begin to accelerate in Q2. We also currently expect to achieve overall year-over-year total revenue growth of at least 20%. 
I remain very optimistic of the future of F5 as we enter fiscal 2012. We continue to enjoy a very strong competitive position. I am particularly excited about the opportunities that we have with our new products such as TMOS version 11 and the VIPRION 2400, as well as upcoming new products and features on our 2012 product roadmap. We will present our roadmap in detail at our upcoming Analyst/Investor Meeting schedule for early November.
I have asserted many times in the past that F5 enjoys the position of being in the sweet spot of business and industry trends. Data center consolidation using virtualization technologies, cloud computing architectures and the continued explosive growth of mobile applications and data, are all industry trends which continue to be significant growth drivers for F5 solutions.
We expect to see healthy growth from our core ADC market solutions, as well as incremental opportunities as we continue to -- our success and expanding market areas, such as service providers and the security market. As I mentioned in last quarter's conference call, F5's market-leading and award-winning application firewall solution, Application Security Manager or ASM, is becoming increasingly vital to customers as attacks in their IT infrastructure have become significantly more sophisticated, targeting not only the network but the applications directly.
ASM, coupled with the core capabilities of TMOS, alert our customers to block this new generation of sophisticated hacker exploit. We have major Fortune 500 customers replacing traditional network firewalls entirely with BIG-IP. Along with the significant additional security functionality in TMOS version 11, our short-term product roadmap includes additional classification, enhanced network firewall capabilities and broader application protection that should further accelerate the opportunity to expand our presence in the security market. We believe this opportunity, coupled with our strategic footprint in the data center will significantly expand the addressable market in fiscal year 2012 and beyond.
We will also continue to aggressively invest in our sales resources to expand into new and existing geographic regions, as well as investing in key vertical market opportunities. The F5 team should be proud of our progress and accomplishments during fiscal 2011. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their tremendous efforts last year, and I look forward to their continued support in fiscal 2012.
And with that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A."

So first of all, let me give you a caveats, once more, that we read out, which is that in terms of the annual growth that we're -- guidance that we've given, that is absolutely based on the macroeconomy staying in the same condition as it is. If it deteriorates, by definition, we would have issues there. So there's no question about that. But if it stays in the same -- and we've no reason to think it will change, apart from watching television and listening to the news, in terms of our pipeline metrics, they look very strong. In terms of looking forward to the year, it's very straightforward for us. The number one priority from a financial perspective is to reaccelerate product revenue growth. And as I say that, we believe we can do that in Q2. We've looked at the sales productivity. We've looked at our pipeline, and we think we have a good handle on that. Obviously, AD is like ADC and the VIPRION 2400 and TMOS 11 are big deals as far as moving into the year as well, as the expanding markets scenarios with areas like service provider and securities. So that's a quick summary. It's really what I said in the script, but it's a quick summary of the question."

Also, driving the server capacity is a good thing for us as well, because more traffic, more stuff on the network helps us. Okay? Yes. And then also, more virtual. So one of the things that's been very successful for us with consolidation is the fact that this virtual environments with faster servers, people are putting more and more applications across more virtual machines. And each one of these things represents essentially a virtual address for us to deal with. That's why we do really well and consolidate very well, and iApp and our other functionality is just another step in improving that consolidation piece. With regards to traffic steering, I mean this is something we get used for today, quite frankly, especially with the optimization guys. And in fact, we'll be spending a lot more time talking about that next week, when we talk about the roadmap."

And with iApp, you're going to see that growing as well. So I wouldn't expect to see a massive difference in our verticals moving forward.
