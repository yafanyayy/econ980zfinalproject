I'm pleased to report our business growth continued in the fourth quarter and that 2010 was another strong year for McDonald's. We continue to build our business, grow our market share and strengthen our connection with the customer.
2010 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our Plan to Win business strategy. Global comparable sales were up 5% for the quarter and for the year. And while we don't like to single out weather, in December, we experienced a severe impact. It's always difficult to quantify it but our best estimates are that the December comp was negatively impacted by 5% in Europe and slightly more than 2% in the United States. But in all indicates that our underlying trends remain strong. Despite these conditions, December global comparable sales were up 3.7%.
In January, global comparable sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%. In constant currencies excluding impairment and other in last year's Redbox gain, operating income grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the year. While EPS increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the year.
Overall, the global economy is recovering slowly but it remains challenging and consumers are still cautious. We continue to succeed by understanding our customers and aggressively executing the right strategies of optimizing our menu with a range of consumer-driven offerings; modernizing the experience for our customers and crew through service upgrades and reimaged restaurants; and broadening our accessibility with more restaurants, convenient hours and outstanding value.
This is our system-wide focus on the Plan to Win and it's what helped drive our success around the world in 2010. It is this proven strategy and our underlying focus on the customer that will drive the business in 2011 in the years to come.
Looking at the U.S., comp sales increased 4.4% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year with operating income up 1% and 7%, respectively. These results were achieved despite a tough economy and slow growth in the informal eating-out market. We continue to grow share, outpacing the competition on comparable sales and we continue to achieve all-time highs for comparable guest count growth during the period, when the overall industry traffic was contracting. 
We drove results with a strong focus on value, menu relevance and convenience. We benefited from our Dollar Menu at breakfast which has been in place for over a year now and has increased morning traffic. This addition to our traditional Dollar Menu offering has boosted our position as a value leader across all dayparts. 
Our extended beverage program continues to bring in customers throughout the day and sales of our new fruit smoothies and frappes during the quarter continued to do well. This, coupled with the strong Lipton and hot McCafe offerings, including the additional caramel mocha, drove December McCafé units up 20% over last year.
U.S. also delivered results by featuring our popular pork products as well as our unique flavor, our famous McRib, which we offered for a limited time on a national level. Throughout the year, we featured our flagship products which offer great taste and value every day. December's focus on the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with cheese and the Angus burger also added increased unit movement. And for the first time ever, we partnered with Wal-Mart for our annual monopoly promotion, resulting in a larger and more relevant price pool. Monopoly lifted sales of featured core products like Big Mac and McNuggets as well as high-margin smoothies and frappes. And it drove Extra Value Meal units by more than 15%.
Now as we begin 2011, we're excited about our latest new menu offering, oatmeal, which we launched nationally this month. This great tasting product is an example of how we are continuing to grow our nutrition profile and meet our customers' evolving tastes. Also this year, the U.S. will continue rolling out our new point-of-sale system which simplifies the order taking process, improves accuracy and allows the crew to provide better service our customers. It's currently in about a third of our stores and we plan to have it rolled out throughout the U.S. by the end of the year.
Now turning to Europe. Comparable sales were up 3.4% for the quarter and 4.4% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year. In 2010, Europe reached an all-time high in informal eating out market share at 9.5% and served 200 million more customers than the year before. We continue to take share with the overall market declining.
The segment drove results with a compelling menu signature of signature offerings and new products across all price tiers, as well as through breakfast and by modernizing the restaurant experience. Europe is leveraging learnings from across the system and growing its breakfast business. The U.K. finished the year with breakfast sales up more than 12% largely driven by a sustained quality campaign around coffee. In Germany, the continued promotion around breakfast under the tagline ""easy morning"" helped build sales and drive traffic during that daypart.
McCafé is now at almost 1,300 restaurants in Europe is helping to boost our breakfast in a locally relevant way.  In markets like Italy, where we now have more than 100 McCafés, our espresso-based coffee and pastry offerings are delivering exactly what the Italians are looking for at breakfast. In 2011, Europe will continue to expand McCafé in many markets.
On the menu front, France is a great example of meeting our European customers expectations for value and variety. During the quarter, France drove sales with a Double Cheeseburger promotion in the introduction of its Tour du Mont [ph] (22:37) premium burgers with their variety of ethnic flavors. New food news and premium offerings also contributed to results in the U.K. and Germany. In the U.K., food events highlighting the big tasty Chicken Legend sandwiches each performed well. In Germany, the recently launched chicken and beef McWraps continued their strong sales. And sales results were above expectations for the new 1955 Sandwich [ph] (23:00), a premium burger with a homemade look and a gourmet bun.
Meanwhile, our service scores improved across Europe due largely to our new customer order displays which improved accuracy and speed at the drive through. Europe also remains leader in our reimaging efforts with nearly 70% of interiors and about 40% of exteriors remodeled, making our brand more contemporary and relevant. As I look to 2011, I'm confident that our strategies around service,,, value and optimizing our menu will continue to connect with consumers and drive our momentum well into the future.
Shifting to Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa or APMEA, for the quarter and year comp sales were up 5.5% and 6%, respectively. Operating income also continued to grow, up 10% for the quarter and 11% for the year in constant currencies. We're driving growth across the regions through convenience, value and breakfast along with core offerings and compelling new menu news. 
Building on our leadership position and value, many of our key markets are offering a Value Lunch program that fits the need of today's consumers. And the entire segment remains a system leader in customer satisfaction scores, helping us differentiate McDonald's in the areas of food, quality and customer experience. Australia continued to build on last year's strong comp sales as it achieved success with new items, including the November rollout of the Chicken McBites, which are a great-tasting sandwich for snacking and customers on-the-go.
Early sales have exceeded expectations and are largely incremental to our popular McNuggets. In addition, Australia continue to grow sales in traffic at breakfast with the help of their Mighty McMuffin and new Breakfast Wrap, both of which delivered great tasting ways to start the day.
In Japan, while the economic environment and informal eating out market remain challenging, our strategies are delivering positive results, as evidenced by Japan's 4.5% comps sales increase in 2010. Value breakfast launched mid-the year, featuring Sausage McMuffin and McGriddle, maintained its momentum into the fourth quarter and continued to grow sales and discounts.  In December, Texas Burger helped Japan deliver a strong finish to the year. 
Turning to China, we remain committed and confident in our long-term success in this market. In 2010 we opened 166 restaurants, bringing the total to nearly 1,300. In 2011, we will grow the base of restaurants by about 15% or 16% toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants in China by the end of 2013.
China's comparable sales growth in the quarter was primarily driven by value and the ongoing success of our Value Lunch program. Additional drivers included breakfast and greater convenience through initiatives such as delivering, dessert kiosks and extended hours. Our efforts are resonating with Chinese consumers. During a time when the informal eating out market remains soft, we continue to increase our share of visits in our five major markets. As we invest in China, we intend to stay focused on gaining even greater relevance in the marketplace, from building drive-throughs, reimaging our restaurants and continuing to deliver a compelling menu of global offerings. 
So those are a few highlights of our continued business momentum around the world. And as we begin this year, I want to reiterate our financial targets and capital management philosophy. We are confident that we will continue to deliver on our long-term average annual targets of 3% to 5% sales growth, 6% to 7% operating income growth, and return on incremental invested capital in the high teens.
We believe these targets are right for a company of our size and maturity and keep us focused on making the best this decisions for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Achieving these targets delivers significant cash flow and our philosophy for the use of this cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business. After that, we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors.
For 2011, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase.
Let me just say that overall, I am proud to say that 2010 was another strong year. Our owner operators, suppliers, employees strength and alignment have proven again to be a key competitive advantage. At a time of lingering economic uncertainty and slow growth, we continue to gain market share, attract more customers to our brand and fortify our financial strength. Our Plan to Win and its unrelenting focus on the customer has been a proven strategy in every kind of environment and it will continue to serve us well in 2011 and beyond. Thank you. 
And now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Pete Benson."
139488,116795514,94410,"McDonald's Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2011",2011-01-24,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim and hello, everyone. As our fourth quarter and full year performance demonstrates, our system's collective focus on the Plan to Win continues to deliver strong results despite challenging economic conditions. It's a battle for market share and",1675,"Thanks, Jim and hello, everyone. As our fourth quarter and full year performance demonstrates, our system's collective focus on the Plan to Win continues to deliver strong results despite challenging economic conditions. It's a battle for market share and McDonald's is clearly winning. Over the past year, we again exceeded our long-term financial targets. System-wide sales grew 6% in constant currencies. Operating income grew 10% in constant currencies, excluding the impact of impairments and other charges, and our one- and three-year returns on incremental invested capital, while not yet finalized, should be well above our high teens target.
Exceeding these targets have positive implications for our investors who enjoyed an overall return on investment of nearly 27% in 2010, ranking us third among the Dow companies. Positive comparable sales for the year in nearly all of our 117 markets, combined  with expense control and favorable commodity cost, drove a 90 basis point improvement in combined operating margin. At 31%, our operating margin compares quite favorably to other large, global consumer companies. 
Looking at restaurant margins, our consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 8% for the full year to $6.5 billion. The consolidated franchise margin percent grew 30 basis points to 82.4% for both the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by solid comparable sales growth in each area of the world.
Consolidated Company-operated margins rose 20 basis points to 19% for the quarter as positive comparable sales more than offset higher labor and other costs. For the year, Company-operated margins increased 140 basis points to 19.6% driven by comparable sales increases and lower commodity costs primarily in the U.S. and Europe.
Turning now to segment performance, in the U.S., we delivered comparable sales growth and even higher comparable guest count growth in both fourth quarter and the full year by staying focused on the customer.
On a trailing 12-month basis through November, our IEO market share rose 50 basis points to 11.8%, the largest increase in five years, and our highest market share ever. This translated into over 550 million additional customer visits during this period. We drove this growth in a declining IEO market through a multifaceted approach that included relevant new product introductions like the frappes and smoothies, effective national promotions of iconic products like Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets; we expanded our value offerings to include Dollar Menu million with breakfast and broadened our accessibility through extended hours and more dual-lane drive-throughs. 
The increase in comparable sales generated significant top and bottom line gains at a restaurant level. On a beginning average annual store volume of nearly $2.4 million, it translated into over $90,000 of incremental sales in 2010. This was primarily accomplished through guest count increases as we essentially took no price increases during the year. These strong sales help drive our average on our operating cash flow per restaurant up nearly $50,000 or 16% to a record high $364,000 on a trailing 12-month basis through November. 
U.S. Company-operated margins grew 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and 190 basis points for the year. Positive comparable sales and relatively flat commodity cost in the fourth quarter and 4% lower commodity cost for the year more than offset higher labor costs. As we look to 2011, we project commodity cost increases of 2% to 2.5% in the U.S., which still puts our cost below 2009 levels. From a pricing standpoint, as commodity and other cost pressures become more pronounced as we move throughout the year, we will likely increase prices to offset some, but not necessarily all of these cost increases. Growing traffic and market share has been a key to our success these last few years. Accordingly, we will continue to maintain the balance of strong traffic momentum with any strategic pricing moves.
Turning to Europe, in the fourth quarter France and Germany continue to effectively promote the core menu, along with rotational fourth tier menu options. The U.K. also focused on menu variety and value, along with growing the Breakfast Daypart and Specialty Coffee business. We now have the leading market share of hot brewed coffee in the U.K. Increased sales partly offset by higher labor and slightly higher commodity costs contributed to the Company-operated margins increasing 30 basis points for the quarter to 19.5%. For the year, positive comparable sales along with a 2.5% decline in commodities partly offset by higher labor costs resulted in company operating margins increasing by 140 basis points to 19.8%. As we head into 2011, we face some headwinds that could impact both sales and margins. VAT increases and austerity measures could potentially pressure overall sales growth although to date, we have seen no change in customer behavior. 
In the U.K., we already increased our prices to cover the 2.5% VAT increase implemented January 1. We did this strategically, restaurant by restaurant, not simply across the board. We will be closely monitoring the U.K. and the rest of Europe to understand consumer reactions to these measures. We also expect other austerity measures and tax increases to pressure Europe's margin. Increased social charges, especially in Russia, could negatively impact Europe's Company-operated margins by more than $20 million or about 30 basis points. In addition, we're projecting commodity cost increases of 3.5% to 4.5% in 2011. 
Despite some of these near-term challenges, all of which are manageable, for our business in Europe remains very strong as is our fundamental operating model. We will continue to evaluate our pricing strategies and make adjustments when prudent while also balancing the need to grow guest counts. I'm confident that we have the right people and plans in place to continue to grow European sales, traffic and profitability in 2011 and beyond.
In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, virtually every country posted positive comparable sales for the quarter and the full year. Key convenience initiatives including delivery and drive-through, our increasing accessibility across all dayparts. convenience also means being open beyond the traditional workday. Nearly 2/3 of our restaurants in APMEA offer some form of extended hours, and over half are open than 24 hours. In addition, breakfast continues to be a growth platform and is offered in about 75% of our 8,400 restaurants. Relative to profitability, APMEA's Company-operated margin was flat for the quarter at 17.1% as positive comparable sales were offset by increased labor, occupancy and restaurant opening costs. 
For the year, Company-operated margins increased 100 basis points to 17.8%. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, APMEA enjoyed lower commodity cost along with strong comparable sales, which more than offset higher labor and other costs. For a perspective, APMEA's year end McOpCo margin is 690 basis points higher than five years ago. We are pleased with our progress in this key growth region and remains optimistic about our long-term potential. 
The final component of combined operating is G&A. In constant currency, G&A increased for the quarter and for the year in line with our expectations. Remember that the year included costs associated with the Vancouver Winter Olympics and by any worldwide owner operator convention. Importantly, G&A declined both as a percentage of sales and revenue for the fifth consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue in 2011.
I'd like to comment briefly on our tax rate, which we expect to be slightly higher in 2011. In the past couple of years, our effective tax rate benefited by approximately two percentage points from our ability to claim certain foreign tax credits. With the recent change in tax law, these credits are no longer available to us. Our economic engine, coupled with prudent financial management, continues to generate significant amounts of cash from operations. Our first use of that cash is to reinvest in our business to continue growing in generating strong returns.
In 2011, we expect to invest about $2.5 billion, half of which will be used to open approximately 1,100 new restaurants. The breakdown for openings in our largest geographic segment is as follows: 150 openings in the U.S.? 225 in Europe and 625 in APMEA, including 175 to 200 new openings in China.
The other half of our CapEx will be devoted to investing in our existing locations. The U.S. completed around 203 reimages in 2010 with our knowledge and experience growing, we expect to complete an additional 600 this year. Europe is planning to complete over 850 reimages while APMEA is projecting around 500. We manage our business for the long term. Reimaging is critical because it significantly enhances customer perceptions of our brand and helps drive sales over time. To remain relevant, I believe the decision to reimage is not a decision of if but rather of when. Our system is strong, our owner operators have both the financial capacity and willingness to reinvest, and we are taking share from the competition. All of which combine to make it an ideal time for McDonald's to seize this opportunity.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted our fourth quarter results by $0.02 while benefiting full year EPS by $0.01. At current exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2011 EPS to be positively impacted by about $0.01 with greater benefit for the full year. As always, take this as directional guidance only because I know rates will change as we move throughout 2011. 
As we enter the new year, the environment continues to change, posting both new opportunities and challenges. Our performance over the last couple of years gives me great confidence in the ability of the McDonald's system, our owner operators, suppliers and company employees, to successfully navigate these conditions. We're operating from a position of strength, our system is aligned with over 32,000 restaurants serving more than 62 million customers a day with high-quality food at a great value at the speed and convenience only McDonald's can offer. We are poised for future growth and well-positioned to participate fully as the economy begins to recover. 2011 will be another great year for the McDonald's system. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Cathy to begin our Q&A."

It's really been business as usual in the way we approach this relative to the supply chain and the treasury working together on some of the hedging and the out contracts relative to those things that impact the commodity cost, as you know, to lock in prices so that we have a reasonable expectation in the P&L for our franchisees. But with that, I'll let Pete talk specifically to what process look like or what our assumptions were."

So we look at our basket of goods as a -- if we look region by region, the U.S. we have more opportunity to lock in cost because of broader markets and more instruments available to our suppliers to do that hedging. And so we're not going to give specific percentages by each category. We're about as locked-in today as we were a year ago at this time and have a fair degree of confidence in that 2% to 2.5% increase. Probably the biggest variable in that will be beef. We built a substantial increase in our beef cost into that guidance but that's the one market that looks like it could be the most volatile for us. Same with Europe, beef is probably the biggest driver of our volatility there. Typically, less opportunity to lock in and hedge broadly across the continent, although each year, both in Europe and APMEA, we get more and more opportunity to get that done. So the U.S., at 2% or 2.5%, we feel pretty good about that in terms of our ability to raise prices where it makes sense to deal with that. But as we look at price as we've experienced these last couple of years, growing traffic is very important. So as I said in my remarks, we're going to look to balance traffic growth with recovering input costs and the same basically in the other two areas."

So food away from home is a huge component, which is related to CPI. But we look a little deeper than the CPI piece alone, so we'll look at the producer price index as a result of that. And then we look at food at home. And so one of the things we found in the U.S. quite a few years ago was that pricing to food away from home and below food away from home maintained a good value rating for us and to the point again made, a good sensitivity from consumers in terms of their ongoing purchasing tips. So that was a big point. The other thing though that we learned was that food at home does matter, so grocery store prices do matter. If you look at the U.S. this last year, you saw about a 1.3 in terms of food away from home. But interestingly enough, you only saw two tips increase for the food at home. So our pricing, we have to be able to flex around those points and make sure we have solid value. It is not based upon our competitors' pricing alone. A matter of fact, that's a very small portion of our consideration but we do look at the others. When you look around the rest of the world, it varies to Pete's point by market. You got markets that have higher inflations such as sometimes markets like Russia. You got other markets that have very low inflation, such as markets like the UK. And so even as we look at all of our pricing strategies, we have to take into account market-by-market those individual circumstances. And so we look at food away from home, food at home, and then we try to make sure that we continue to remain our value proposition, which to Pete's point is really around price stability especially around the value menus."

So from an input side, cost input side this year, this looks like a normal year for the U.S. Europe, our cost structure is a little higher and, typically, we need a three-plus to maintain margins there. And a couple of things: One, commodity costs are going to be a little bit higher than average this year in Europe and that increase in the social factors in Russia is that 30 basis-point drag on the segment's margin is adding some additional challenge. They have a social charge on wages there that's going from 26% to 34% of wages and about 20% of our McOpCo sales come out of Russia.

You're going to see benefit I think continuing relative to the way the market and calendars are structured, to continue to, on an ongoing fashion, talk about our McCafé line up. So we're not running away from those. We want to make sure we continue to market those effectively. But I wouldn't be as shortsighted as looking only at the beverage side. We continue to have great consumer reaction to our core products. So this past year, Big Macs and the nuggets, that Pete talked about and Jim talked about, the breakfast value keeping in mind that last year or 2010 was the first year we implemented breakfast value at a national level. All the markets it had something before, but with a concerted voice. So we continue to have that as it moves forward. We hope to see some economic benefit as recovery, but we don't count too much on that as of this point. But you got a great core and we've got the value that  we'll continue to talk about. You still got beverages. The U.S. will begin, in a more aggressive way, their reimaging programs this year, which always gives a list of the brand as we move that forward as well. Extended hours, the U.S. grew another couple of points last year so they still got some opportunity. It's in the high-30s versus being in the 50s when you look at 24/7 over in APMEA, so still room there. More room to grow in terms of drive-throughs as we look at drive-through optimization. And the third phase of that was side-by-side and dual lanes and all the investments that we and the franchisees continue to make. So those are some of the things and that's what I'm talking about the rest of the pipeline, which right now we have many of the markets around the world tapping into the global pipelines that we've established everything from refs to wings to Angus burgers and Angus snack wraps. So we feel pretty good about the menu pipeline and about our ability to continue to drive the business."

Relative to reimaging, what we think will happen in the U.S. is very similar to what we see. I'm glad you brought up some of the markets in Europe. I'll pick a couple of them we talked about before. France and Australia, if you look at Australia, it's been now about seven years since they actually began some of their reimaging. The market is now complete. We've continued to see great business movement in Australia and we continue to see great guest count movement really driving that. So demand is driving it. As we move into, if you look at France and look at the different decors, what we try to do in markets outside of France and Australia is learn from what they did. So in the U.S., one of the things that we held back on in 2010 was to get the design portfolio right so consumers would react to that portfolio in a positive way. And as a result of that, we've begun to do interiors and exteriors at the same time in the U.S. And so we think that there's -- we're going to see some really good benefit to both the designs themselves. The designs in Manhattan will be a little bit different than the designs in currently Missouri but the exteriors of the building will fit neighborhoods and the consumers that we see there. So we're pretty positive relative to reimaging. Incrementally, we are still seeing that 6% to 7% in terms of incremental sales, the returns are strong, but keeping in mind the returns are based not only on the investment and the cost there but also on a broader basis of where sales go in those marketplaces. So we have seen, when we get to a certain point, 30, 40 percentile in the markets that we see an additional brand lift in those marketplaces well."

What happens is if you get outside in those kind of guidelines, we have seen that can have some resistance. But if you look at our guest count growth, we have been able to manage this exceptionally well. If you look at the U.S. last year, they were very mindful of the price increase so they didn't take much at all. As a result, we had the highest guest count growth that we've seen historically on an annual basis for comp in recent history. So when you look at Europe, Europe managed it very, very well. They were able to take a little more price increase as a result of what's happened in areas like Russia, as Pete mentioned earlier. But nonetheless, great guest count growth. This was a really strong year for us in terms of guest count growth. You just heard the numbers on China. And knowing what the economy is in China, to see the results that we've seen there relative to guest count increases really bodes well especially as we move into the future. So those two points, food away from home, mindful of food at home, mindful of the competitive set all help us in terms of our pricing strategies."

We know that the drive-throughs give us additional sales and returns even though it's a slightly higher cost structure because of the amount of land required to put a drive through and we get stronger returns there.

And so if you look at the economy, we paid close attention to the consumer confidence in the United States, that has ticked down from November again. You know the unemployment levels as well as I do.

But when we go into 2011, I think we're sort of seeing this the same way. Whether or not we expect the informal eating out market to grow is -- maybe slightly in 2011. But quite frankly, we don't see a substantial change there. When you look at Europe, Europe continues to have fits and starts but, as Pete mentioned in his comments, we're really not seeing an impact from some of these austerity measures yet. And as I've said many times before, our business model operates fairly well in these environments and Europe's had fits and starts before, and we've managed through those over the years and we don't expect to see substantial impact from that relative to certainly the overall growth of McDonald's share against the informal eating-out. And the overall economies around the world though, I should say, are sort of where they were coming out of 2010 going into 2011. And don't see a whole lot of change there. But I do believe that GDP will be better in 2011 in the U.S. And I think countries in Europe remain to be seen. But we always have to remember that when we look at Europe, it's a number -- it's 50 countries, all operating at different levels of economic performance.

I'm pleased to report our business growth continued in the fourth quarter and that 2010 was another strong year for McDonald's. We continue to build our business, grow our market share and strengthen our connection with the customer.
2010 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our Plan to Win business strategy. Global comparable sales were up 5% for the quarter and for the year. And while we don't like to single out weather, in December, we experienced a severe impact. It's always difficult to quantify it but our best estimates are that the December comp was negatively impacted by 5% in Europe and slightly more than 2% in the United States. But in all indicates that our underlying trends remain strong. Despite these conditions, December global comparable sales were up 3.7%.
In January, global comparable sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%. In constant currencies excluding impairment and other in last year's Redbox gain, operating income grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the year. While EPS increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the year.
Overall, the global economy is recovering slowly but it remains challenging and consumers are still cautious. We continue to succeed by understanding our customers and aggressively executing the right strategies of optimizing our menu with a range of consumer-driven offerings; modernizing the experience for our customers and crew through service upgrades and reimaged restaurants; and broadening our accessibility with more restaurants, convenient hours and outstanding value.
This is our system-wide focus on the Plan to Win and it's what helped drive our success around the world in 2010. It is this proven strategy and our underlying focus on the customer that will drive the business in 2011 in the years to come.
Looking at the U.S., comp sales increased 4.4% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year with operating income up 1% and 7%, respectively. These results were achieved despite a tough economy and slow growth in the informal eating-out market. We continue to grow share, outpacing the competition on comparable sales and we continue to achieve all-time highs for comparable guest count growth during the period, when the overall industry traffic was contracting. 
We drove results with a strong focus on value, menu relevance and convenience. We benefited from our Dollar Menu at breakfast which has been in place for over a year now and has increased morning traffic. This addition to our traditional Dollar Menu offering has boosted our position as a value leader across all dayparts. 
Our extended beverage program continues to bring in customers throughout the day and sales of our new fruit smoothies and frappes during the quarter continued to do well. This, coupled with the strong Lipton and hot McCafe offerings, including the additional caramel mocha, drove December McCafé units up 20% over last year.
U.S. also delivered results by featuring our popular pork products as well as our unique flavor, our famous McRib, which we offered for a limited time on a national level. Throughout the year, we featured our flagship products which offer great taste and value every day. December's focus on the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with cheese and the Angus burger also added increased unit movement. And for the first time ever, we partnered with Wal-Mart for our annual monopoly promotion, resulting in a larger and more relevant price pool. Monopoly lifted sales of featured core products like Big Mac and McNuggets as well as high-margin smoothies and frappes. And it drove Extra Value Meal units by more than 15%.
Now as we begin 2011, we're excited about our latest new menu offering, oatmeal, which we launched nationally this month. This great tasting product is an example of how we are continuing to grow our nutrition profile and meet our customers' evolving tastes. Also this year, the U.S. will continue rolling out our new point-of-sale system which simplifies the order taking process, improves accuracy and allows the crew to provide better service our customers. It's currently in about a third of our stores and we plan to have it rolled out throughout the U.S. by the end of the year.
Now turning to Europe. Comparable sales were up 3.4% for the quarter and 4.4% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year. In 2010, Europe reached an all-time high in informal eating out market share at 9.5% and served 200 million more customers than the year before. We continue to take share with the overall market declining.
The segment drove results with a compelling menu signature of signature offerings and new products across all price tiers, as well as through breakfast and by modernizing the restaurant experience. Europe is leveraging learnings from across the system and growing its breakfast business. The U.K. finished the year with breakfast sales up more than 12% largely driven by a sustained quality campaign around coffee. In Germany, the continued promotion around breakfast under the tagline ""easy morning"" helped build sales and drive traffic during that daypart.
McCafé is now at almost 1,300 restaurants in Europe is helping to boost our breakfast in a locally relevant way.  In markets like Italy, where we now have more than 100 McCafés, our espresso-based coffee and pastry offerings are delivering exactly what the Italians are looking for at breakfast. In 2011, Europe will continue to expand McCafé in many markets.
On the menu front, France is a great example of meeting our European customers expectations for value and variety. During the quarter, France drove sales with a Double Cheeseburger promotion in the introduction of its Tour du Mont [ph] (22:37) premium burgers with their variety of ethnic flavors. New food news and premium offerings also contributed to results in the U.K. and Germany. In the U.K., food events highlighting the big tasty Chicken Legend sandwiches each performed well. In Germany, the recently launched chicken and beef McWraps continued their strong sales. And sales results were above expectations for the new 1955 Sandwich [ph] (23:00), a premium burger with a homemade look and a gourmet bun.
Meanwhile, our service scores improved across Europe due largely to our new customer order displays which improved accuracy and speed at the drive through. Europe also remains leader in our reimaging efforts with nearly 70% of interiors and about 40% of exteriors remodeled, making our brand more contemporary and relevant. As I look to 2011, I'm confident that our strategies around service,,, value and optimizing our menu will continue to connect with consumers and drive our momentum well into the future.
Shifting to Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa or APMEA, for the quarter and year comp sales were up 5.5% and 6%, respectively. Operating income also continued to grow, up 10% for the quarter and 11% for the year in constant currencies. We're driving growth across the regions through convenience, value and breakfast along with core offerings and compelling new menu news. 
Building on our leadership position and value, many of our key markets are offering a Value Lunch program that fits the need of today's consumers. And the entire segment remains a system leader in customer satisfaction scores, helping us differentiate McDonald's in the areas of food, quality and customer experience. Australia continued to build on last year's strong comp sales as it achieved success with new items, including the November rollout of the Chicken McBites, which are a great-tasting sandwich for snacking and customers on-the-go.
Early sales have exceeded expectations and are largely incremental to our popular McNuggets. In addition, Australia continue to grow sales in traffic at breakfast with the help of their Mighty McMuffin and new Breakfast Wrap, both of which delivered great tasting ways to start the day.
In Japan, while the economic environment and informal eating out market remain challenging, our strategies are delivering positive results, as evidenced by Japan's 4.5% comps sales increase in 2010. Value breakfast launched mid-the year, featuring Sausage McMuffin and McGriddle, maintained its momentum into the fourth quarter and continued to grow sales and discounts.  In December, Texas Burger helped Japan deliver a strong finish to the year. 
Turning to China, we remain committed and confident in our long-term success in this market. In 2010 we opened 166 restaurants, bringing the total to nearly 1,300. In 2011, we will grow the base of restaurants by about 15% or 16% toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants in China by the end of 2013.
China's comparable sales growth in the quarter was primarily driven by value and the ongoing success of our Value Lunch program. Additional drivers included breakfast and greater convenience through initiatives such as delivering, dessert kiosks and extended hours. Our efforts are resonating with Chinese consumers. During a time when the informal eating out market remains soft, we continue to increase our share of visits in our five major markets. As we invest in China, we intend to stay focused on gaining even greater relevance in the marketplace, from building drive-throughs, reimaging our restaurants and continuing to deliver a compelling menu of global offerings. 
So those are a few highlights of our continued business momentum around the world. And as we begin this year, I want to reiterate our financial targets and capital management philosophy. We are confident that we will continue to deliver on our long-term average annual targets of 3% to 5% sales growth, 6% to 7% operating income growth, and return on incremental invested capital in the high teens.
We believe these targets are right for a company of our size and maturity and keep us focused on making the best this decisions for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Achieving these targets delivers significant cash flow and our philosophy for the use of this cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business. After that, we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors.
For 2011, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase.
Let me just say that overall, I am proud to say that 2010 was another strong year. Our owner operators, suppliers, employees strength and alignment have proven again to be a key competitive advantage. At a time of lingering economic uncertainty and slow growth, we continue to gain market share, attract more customers to our brand and fortify our financial strength. Our Plan to Win and its unrelenting focus on the customer has been a proven strategy in every kind of environment and it will continue to serve us well in 2011 and beyond. Thank you. 
And now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Pete Benson."
139488,116795514,94411,"McDonald's Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2011",2011-01-24,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim and hello, everyone. As our fourth quarter and full year performance demonstrates, our system's collective focus on the Plan to Win continues to deliver strong results despite challenging economic conditions. It's a battle for market share and",1675,"Thanks, Jim and hello, everyone. As our fourth quarter and full year performance demonstrates, our system's collective focus on the Plan to Win continues to deliver strong results despite challenging economic conditions. It's a battle for market share and McDonald's is clearly winning. Over the past year, we again exceeded our long-term financial targets. System-wide sales grew 6% in constant currencies. Operating income grew 10% in constant currencies, excluding the impact of impairments and other charges, and our one- and three-year returns on incremental invested capital, while not yet finalized, should be well above our high teens target.
Exceeding these targets have positive implications for our investors who enjoyed an overall return on investment of nearly 27% in 2010, ranking us third among the Dow companies. Positive comparable sales for the year in nearly all of our 117 markets, combined  with expense control and favorable commodity cost, drove a 90 basis point improvement in combined operating margin. At 31%, our operating margin compares quite favorably to other large, global consumer companies. 
Looking at restaurant margins, our consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 8% for the full year to $6.5 billion. The consolidated franchise margin percent grew 30 basis points to 82.4% for both the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by solid comparable sales growth in each area of the world.
Consolidated Company-operated margins rose 20 basis points to 19% for the quarter as positive comparable sales more than offset higher labor and other costs. For the year, Company-operated margins increased 140 basis points to 19.6% driven by comparable sales increases and lower commodity costs primarily in the U.S. and Europe.
Turning now to segment performance, in the U.S., we delivered comparable sales growth and even higher comparable guest count growth in both fourth quarter and the full year by staying focused on the customer.
On a trailing 12-month basis through November, our IEO market share rose 50 basis points to 11.8%, the largest increase in five years, and our highest market share ever. This translated into over 550 million additional customer visits during this period. We drove this growth in a declining IEO market through a multifaceted approach that included relevant new product introductions like the frappes and smoothies, effective national promotions of iconic products like Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets; we expanded our value offerings to include Dollar Menu million with breakfast and broadened our accessibility through extended hours and more dual-lane drive-throughs. 
The increase in comparable sales generated significant top and bottom line gains at a restaurant level. On a beginning average annual store volume of nearly $2.4 million, it translated into over $90,000 of incremental sales in 2010. This was primarily accomplished through guest count increases as we essentially took no price increases during the year. These strong sales help drive our average on our operating cash flow per restaurant up nearly $50,000 or 16% to a record high $364,000 on a trailing 12-month basis through November. 
U.S. Company-operated margins grew 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and 190 basis points for the year. Positive comparable sales and relatively flat commodity cost in the fourth quarter and 4% lower commodity cost for the year more than offset higher labor costs. As we look to 2011, we project commodity cost increases of 2% to 2.5% in the U.S., which still puts our cost below 2009 levels. From a pricing standpoint, as commodity and other cost pressures become more pronounced as we move throughout the year, we will likely increase prices to offset some, but not necessarily all of these cost increases. Growing traffic and market share has been a key to our success these last few years. Accordingly, we will continue to maintain the balance of strong traffic momentum with any strategic pricing moves.
Turning to Europe, in the fourth quarter France and Germany continue to effectively promote the core menu, along with rotational fourth tier menu options. The U.K. also focused on menu variety and value, along with growing the Breakfast Daypart and Specialty Coffee business. We now have the leading market share of hot brewed coffee in the U.K. Increased sales partly offset by higher labor and slightly higher commodity costs contributed to the Company-operated margins increasing 30 basis points for the quarter to 19.5%. For the year, positive comparable sales along with a 2.5% decline in commodities partly offset by higher labor costs resulted in company operating margins increasing by 140 basis points to 19.8%. As we head into 2011, we face some headwinds that could impact both sales and margins. VAT increases and austerity measures could potentially pressure overall sales growth although to date, we have seen no change in customer behavior. 
In the U.K., we already increased our prices to cover the 2.5% VAT increase implemented January 1. We did this strategically, restaurant by restaurant, not simply across the board. We will be closely monitoring the U.K. and the rest of Europe to understand consumer reactions to these measures. We also expect other austerity measures and tax increases to pressure Europe's margin. Increased social charges, especially in Russia, could negatively impact Europe's Company-operated margins by more than $20 million or about 30 basis points. In addition, we're projecting commodity cost increases of 3.5% to 4.5% in 2011. 
Despite some of these near-term challenges, all of which are manageable, for our business in Europe remains very strong as is our fundamental operating model. We will continue to evaluate our pricing strategies and make adjustments when prudent while also balancing the need to grow guest counts. I'm confident that we have the right people and plans in place to continue to grow European sales, traffic and profitability in 2011 and beyond.
In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, virtually every country posted positive comparable sales for the quarter and the full year. Key convenience initiatives including delivery and drive-through, our increasing accessibility across all dayparts. convenience also means being open beyond the traditional workday. Nearly 2/3 of our restaurants in APMEA offer some form of extended hours, and over half are open than 24 hours. In addition, breakfast continues to be a growth platform and is offered in about 75% of our 8,400 restaurants. Relative to profitability, APMEA's Company-operated margin was flat for the quarter at 17.1% as positive comparable sales were offset by increased labor, occupancy and restaurant opening costs. 
For the year, Company-operated margins increased 100 basis points to 17.8%. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, APMEA enjoyed lower commodity cost along with strong comparable sales, which more than offset higher labor and other costs. For a perspective, APMEA's year end McOpCo margin is 690 basis points higher than five years ago. We are pleased with our progress in this key growth region and remains optimistic about our long-term potential. 
The final component of combined operating is G&A. In constant currency, G&A increased for the quarter and for the year in line with our expectations. Remember that the year included costs associated with the Vancouver Winter Olympics and by any worldwide owner operator convention. Importantly, G&A declined both as a percentage of sales and revenue for the fifth consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue in 2011.
I'd like to comment briefly on our tax rate, which we expect to be slightly higher in 2011. In the past couple of years, our effective tax rate benefited by approximately two percentage points from our ability to claim certain foreign tax credits. With the recent change in tax law, these credits are no longer available to us. Our economic engine, coupled with prudent financial management, continues to generate significant amounts of cash from operations. Our first use of that cash is to reinvest in our business to continue growing in generating strong returns.
In 2011, we expect to invest about $2.5 billion, half of which will be used to open approximately 1,100 new restaurants. The breakdown for openings in our largest geographic segment is as follows: 150 openings in the U.S.? 225 in Europe and 625 in APMEA, including 175 to 200 new openings in China.
The other half of our CapEx will be devoted to investing in our existing locations. The U.S. completed around 203 reimages in 2010 with our knowledge and experience growing, we expect to complete an additional 600 this year. Europe is planning to complete over 850 reimages while APMEA is projecting around 500. We manage our business for the long term. Reimaging is critical because it significantly enhances customer perceptions of our brand and helps drive sales over time. To remain relevant, I believe the decision to reimage is not a decision of if but rather of when. Our system is strong, our owner operators have both the financial capacity and willingness to reinvest, and we are taking share from the competition. All of which combine to make it an ideal time for McDonald's to seize this opportunity.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted our fourth quarter results by $0.02 while benefiting full year EPS by $0.01. At current exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2011 EPS to be positively impacted by about $0.01 with greater benefit for the full year. As always, take this as directional guidance only because I know rates will change as we move throughout 2011. 
As we enter the new year, the environment continues to change, posting both new opportunities and challenges. Our performance over the last couple of years gives me great confidence in the ability of the McDonald's system, our owner operators, suppliers and company employees, to successfully navigate these conditions. We're operating from a position of strength, our system is aligned with over 32,000 restaurants serving more than 62 million customers a day with high-quality food at a great value at the speed and convenience only McDonald's can offer. We are poised for future growth and well-positioned to participate fully as the economy begins to recover. 2011 will be another great year for the McDonald's system. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Cathy to begin our Q&A."

It's really been business as usual in the way we approach this relative to the supply chain and the treasury working together on some of the hedging and the out contracts relative to those things that impact the commodity cost, as you know, to lock in prices so that we have a reasonable expectation in the P&L for our franchisees. But with that, I'll let Pete talk specifically to what process look like or what our assumptions were."

So we look at our basket of goods as a -- if we look region by region, the U.S. we have more opportunity to lock in cost because of broader markets and more instruments available to our suppliers to do that hedging. And so we're not going to give specific percentages by each category. We're about as locked-in today as we were a year ago at this time and have a fair degree of confidence in that 2% to 2.5% increase. Probably the biggest variable in that will be beef. We built a substantial increase in our beef cost into that guidance but that's the one market that looks like it could be the most volatile for us. Same with Europe, beef is probably the biggest driver of our volatility there. Typically, less opportunity to lock in and hedge broadly across the continent, although each year, both in Europe and APMEA, we get more and more opportunity to get that done. So the U.S., at 2% or 2.5%, we feel pretty good about that in terms of our ability to raise prices where it makes sense to deal with that. But as we look at price as we've experienced these last couple of years, growing traffic is very important. So as I said in my remarks, we're going to look to balance traffic growth with recovering input costs and the same basically in the other two areas."

And as you know, we have a very comprehensive pricing tool that we use in every segment and we're pretty good at taking a look at all of those factors that are going to have an impact. But the most important factor is really, what about the elasticity that we have for pricing relative to the value orientation for our customers, which is the most important thing. And when we factor all of those things together, including inflation, we do have the opportunity to pass some of those costs along at price increases.

So food away from home is a huge component, which is related to CPI. But we look a little deeper than the CPI piece alone, so we'll look at the producer price index as a result of that. And then we look at food at home. And so one of the things we found in the U.S. quite a few years ago was that pricing to food away from home and below food away from home maintained a good value rating for us and to the point again made, a good sensitivity from consumers in terms of their ongoing purchasing tips. So that was a big point. The other thing though that we learned was that food at home does matter, so grocery store prices do matter. If you look at the U.S. this last year, you saw about a 1.3 in terms of food away from home. But interestingly enough, you only saw two tips increase for the food at home. So our pricing, we have to be able to flex around those points and make sure we have solid value. It is not based upon our competitors' pricing alone. A matter of fact, that's a very small portion of our consideration but we do look at the others. When you look around the rest of the world, it varies to Pete's point by market. You got markets that have higher inflations such as sometimes markets like Russia. You got other markets that have very low inflation, such as markets like the UK. And so even as we look at all of our pricing strategies, we have to take into account market-by-market those individual circumstances. And so we look at food away from home, food at home, and then we try to make sure that we continue to remain our value proposition, which to Pete's point is really around price stability especially around the value menus."

So this past year, Big Macs and the nuggets, that Pete talked about and Jim talked about, the breakfast value keeping in mind that last year or 2010 was the first year we implemented breakfast value at a national level. All the markets it had something before, but with a concerted voice. So we continue to have that as it moves forward. We hope to see some economic benefit as recovery, but we don't count too much on that as of this point. But you got a great core and we've got the value that  we'll continue to talk about. You still got beverages. The U.S. will begin, in a more aggressive way, their reimaging programs this year, which always gives a list of the brand as we move that forward as well. Extended hours, the U.S. grew another couple of points last year so they still got some opportunity. It's in the high-30s versus being in the 50s when you look at 24/7 over in APMEA, so still room there. More room to grow in terms of drive-throughs as we look at drive-through optimization. And the third phase of that was side-by-side and dual lanes and all the investments that we and the franchisees continue to make. So those are some of the things and that's what I'm talking about the rest of the pipeline, which right now we have many of the markets around the world tapping into the global pipelines that we've established everything from refs to wings to Angus burgers and Angus snack wraps. So we feel pretty good about the menu pipeline and about our ability to continue to drive the business."

Relative to reimaging, what we think will happen in the U.S. is very similar to what we see. I'm glad you brought up some of the markets in Europe. I'll pick a couple of them we talked about before. France and Australia, if you look at Australia, it's been now about seven years since they actually began some of their reimaging. The market is now complete. We've continued to see great business movement in Australia and we continue to see great guest count movement really driving that. So demand is driving it. As we move into, if you look at France and look at the different decors, what we try to do in markets outside of France and Australia is learn from what they did. So in the U.S., one of the things that we held back on in 2010 was to get the design portfolio right so consumers would react to that portfolio in a positive way. And as a result of that, we've begun to do interiors and exteriors at the same time in the U.S. And so we think that there's -- we're going to see some really good benefit to both the designs themselves. The designs in Manhattan will be a little bit different than the designs in currently Missouri but the exteriors of the building will fit neighborhoods and the consumers that we see there. So we're pretty positive relative to reimaging. Incrementally, we are still seeing that 6% to 7% in terms of incremental sales, the returns are strong, but keeping in mind the returns are based not only on the investment and the cost there but also on a broader basis of where sales go in those marketplaces. So we have seen, when we get to a certain point, 30, 40 percentile in the markets that we see an additional brand lift in those marketplaces well."

But if you look at our guest count growth, we have been able to manage this exceptionally well. If you look at the U.S. last year, they were very mindful of the price increase so they didn't take much at all. As a result, we had the highest guest count growth that we've seen historically on an annual basis for comp in recent history. So when you look at Europe, Europe managed it very, very well.

We feel good about our growth strategies in terms of -- many of you may have been over in China earlier this year and heard Kenneth [Chan] talk a little bit about our strategy, which is a ring strategy of focusing on the core cities. Then one of the things we have done is as we move out to the outer ring, we're focused on drive-through development more so now. We know that the drive-throughs give us additional sales and returns even though it's a slightly higher cost structure because of the amount of land required to put a drive through and we get stronger returns there. So our strategies did not change, focus on the core, move out from core, incorporate drive-throughs. And also at the same time be able to have full menu across the market.

And so if you look at the economy, we paid close attention to the consumer confidence in the United States, that has ticked down from November again. You know the unemployment levels as well as I do. So when you look at the job markets, I don't see a lot changing there. In the near term, there has been some slight growth and a little bit of change in the economy over the last six months. But when we go into 2011, I think we're sort of seeing this the same way. Whether or not we expect the informal eating out market to grow is -- maybe slightly in 2011. But quite frankly, we don't see a substantial change there. When you look at Europe, Europe continues to have fits and starts but, as Pete mentioned in his comments, we're really not seeing an impact from some of these austerity measures yet. And as I've said many times before, our business model operates fairly well in these environments and Europe's had fits and starts before, and we've managed through those over the years and we don't expect to see substantial impact from that relative to certainly the overall growth of McDonald's share against the informal eating-out. And the overall economies around the world though, I should say, are sort of where they were coming out of 2010 going into 2011. And don't see a whole lot of change there. But I do believe that GDP will be better in 2011 in the U.S. And I think countries in Europe remain to be seen. But we always have to remember that when we look at Europe, it's a number -- it's 50 countries, all operating at different levels of economic performance. And so we've managed through that one country at a time. Yes, the big three: U.K., Germany and France are big drivers of our business there and we certainly manage very well through those ups and downs in those countries as well."

One to your point, if you implement a value menu of sort, there are times we will see some slight erosion relative to the average check. We picked that up in terms of the total transactions and overall profitability is also higher. Having said that, there's more than the value components of average check. We also have implemented the beverage strategy. As a result, our items per transaction on a beverage purchase will be lower than items per transaction when you're buying an overall meal that includes sandwich, fries and the side, and then the drink. And so what we do see is because of those individual purchases, and also because of the benefit we get with those purchases later in the day, snack periods, et cetera, we have seen that the average check component that we've seen. Our average check is very, very healthy. The new products have performed very, very well, so we're good there.

I'm pleased to report our business growth continued in the fourth quarter and that 2010 was another strong year for McDonald's. We continue to build our business, grow our market share and strengthen our connection with the customer.
2010 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our Plan to Win business strategy. Global comparable sales were up 5% for the quarter and for the year. And while we don't like to single out weather, in December, we experienced a severe impact. It's always difficult to quantify, but our best estimates are that the December comp was negatively impacted by 5% in Europe and slightly more than 2% in the United States. But it all indicates that our underlying trends remain strong. Despite these conditions, December global comparable sales were up 3.7%.
In January, global comparable sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%. In constant currencies excluding impairment and other in last year's Redbox gain, operating income grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the year. While EPS increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the year.
Overall, the global economy is recovering slowly but it remains challenging and consumers are still cautious. We continue to succeed by understanding our customers and aggressively executing the right strategies of optimizing our menu with a range of consumer-driven offerings; modernizing the experience for our customers and crew through service upgrades and reimaged restaurants; and broadening our accessibility with more restaurants, convenient hours and outstanding value.
This is our system-wide focus on to the Plan to Win and it's what helped drive our success around the world in 2010. It is this proven strategy and our unrelenting focus on the customer that will drive the business in 2011 in the years to come.
Looking at the U.S., comp sales increased 4.4% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year with operating income up 1% and 7%, respectively. These results were achieved despite a tough economy and slow growth in the informal eating-out market. We continue to grow share, outpacing the competition on comparable sales and we continue to achieve all-time highs for comparable guest count growth during the period, when the overall industry traffic was contracting. 
We drove results with a strong focus on value, menu relevance and convenience. We benefited from our Dollar Menu at breakfast which has been in place for over a year now and has increased morning traffic. This addition to our traditional Dollar Menu offering has boosted our position as a value leader across all dayparts. 
Our extended beverage program continues to bring in customers throughout the day and sales of our new fruit smoothies and frappes during the quarter continued to do well. This, coupled with the strong Lipton and hot McCafé offerings, including the addition of caramel mocha, drove December McCafé units up 20% over last year.
U.S. also delivered results by featuring our popular pork products as well as our unique favorite, our famous McRib, which we offered for a limited time on a national level. Throughout the year, we featured our flagship products which offer great taste and value every day. December's focus on Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with cheese and the Angus burger also added increased unit movement. And for the first time ever, we partnered with Wal-Mart for our annual monopoly promotion, resulting in a larger and more relevant prize pool. Monopoly lifted sales of featured core products like Big Mac and McNuggets as well as high-margin smoothies and frappes. And it drove Extra Value Meal units by more than 15%.
Now as we begin 2011, we're excited about our latest new menu offering, oatmeal, which we launched nationally this month. This great tasting product is an example of how we are continuing to grow our nutrition profile and meet our customers' evolving tastes. Also this year, the U.S. will continue rolling out our new point-of-sale system which simplifies the order taking process, improves accuracy and allows the crew to provide better service to our customers. It's currently in about a third of our stores and we plan to have it rolled out throughout the U.S. by the end of the year.
Now turning to Europe. Comparable sales were up 3.4% for the quarter and 4.4% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year. In 2010, Europe reached an all-time high in informal eating-out market share at 9.5% and served 200 million more customers than the year before. We continue to take share with the overall market declining.
The segment drove results with a compelling menu of signature offerings and new products across all price tiers, as well as through breakfast and by modernizing the restaurant experience. Europe is leveraging learnings from across the system and growing its breakfast business. The U.K. finished the year with breakfast sales up more than 12% largely driven by a sustained quality campaign around coffee. In Germany, the continued promotion of breakfast under the tagline ""easy morning"" helped build sales and drive traffic during that daypart.
McCafé is now in almost 1,300 restaurants in Europe, is helping to boost our breakfast business in a locally relevant way. In markets like Italy, where we now have more than 100 McCafés, our espresso-based coffee and pastry offerings are delivering exactly what the Italians are looking for at breakfast. In 2011, Europe will continue to expand McCafé in many markets.
On the menu front, France is a great example of meeting our European customers' expectations for value and variety. During the quarter, France drove sales with a Double Cheeseburger promotion in the introduction of its Tour du Mont [ph] premium burgers with their variety of ethnic flavors. New food news and premium offerings also contributed to results in the U.K. and Germany. In the U.K., food events highlighting the Big Tasty and Chicken Legend sandwiches each performed well. In Germany, the recently launched chicken and beef McWraps continued their strong sales. And sales results were above expectations for the new 1955 Sandwich [ph], a premium burger with a homemade look and gourmet bun.
Meanwhile, our service scores improve across Europe due largely to our new customer order displays which improve accuracy and speed at the drive-thru. Europe also remains leader in our reimaging efforts with nearly 70% of interiors and about 40% of exteriors remodeled, making our brand more contemporary and relevant. As I look to 2011, I'm confident that our strategies around service, value and optimizing our menu will continue to connect with consumers and drive our momentum well into the future.
Shifting to Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa or APMEA, for the quarter and year comp sales were up 5.5% and 6%, respectively. Operating income also continued to grow, up 10% for the quarter and 11% for the year in constant currencies. We're driving growth across the regions through convenience, value and breakfast along with core offerings and compelling new menu news. 
Building on our leadership position and value, many of our key markets are offering a Value Lunch program that fits the need of today's consumers. And the entire segment remains a system leader in customer satisfaction scores, helping us differentiate McDonald's in the areas of food, quality and customer experience. Australia continued to build on last year's strong comp sales as it achieved success with new items, including the November rollout of its Chicken McBites, which are a great-tasting sandwich for snacking and customers on-the-go.
Early sales have exceeded expectations and are largely incremental to our popular McNuggets. In addition, Australia continued to grow sales in traffic at breakfast with the help of their Mighty McMuffin and new Breakfast Wrap, both of which deliver great tasting ways to start the day.
In Japan, while the economic environment and informal eating-out market remain challenging, our strategies are delivering positive results, as evidenced by Japan's 4.5% comps sales increase in 2010. Value breakfast launched mid-year, featuring Sausage McMuffin and McGriddle, maintained its momentum into the fourth quarter and continued to grow sales and guest counts. And December's re-hit of the popular Texas Burger helped Japan deliver a strong finish to the year. 
Turning to China, we remain committed and confident in our long-term success in this market. In 2010 we opened 166 restaurants, bringing the total to nearly 1,300. In 2011, we will grow the base of restaurants by about 15% or 16% toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants in China by the end of 2013.
China's comparable sales growth in the quarter was primarily driven by value and the ongoing success of our Value Lunch program. Additional drivers included breakfast and greater convenience through initiatives such as delivering, dessert kiosks and extended hours. Our efforts are resonating with Chinese consumers. During a time when the informal eating-out market remains soft, we continue to increase our share of visits in our five major markets. As we invest in China, we intend to stay focused on gaining even greater relevance in the marketplace, from building drive-thrus, reimaging our restaurants and continuing to deliver a compelling menu of core and local offerings.
So those are a few highlights of our continued business momentum around the world. And as we begin this year, I want to reiterate our financial targets and capital management philosophy. We are confident that we will continue to deliver on our long-term average annual targets of 3% to 5% sales growth, 6% to 7% operating income growth, and return on incremental invested capital in the high teens.
We believe these targets are right for a company of our size and maturity and keep us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Achieving these targets delivers significant cash flow and our philosophy for the use of this cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business. After that, we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors.
For 2011, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase.
Let me just say that overall, I am proud to say that 2010 was another strong year. Our owner operators, suppliers, employees' strength and alignment have proven again to be a key competitive advantage. At a time of lingering economic uncertainty and slow growth, we continue to gain market share, attract more customers to our brand and fortify our financial strength. Our Plan to Win and its unrelenting focus on the customer has been a proven strategy in every kind of environment and it will continue to serve us well in 2011 and beyond. Thank you. 
And now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Pete Benson."

As our fourth quarter and full year performance demonstrates, our system's collective focus on the Plan to Win continues to deliver strong results despite challenging economic conditions.

Positive comparable sales for the year in nearly all of our 117 markets, combined with expense control and favorable commodity cost, drove a 90 basis point improvement in combined operating margin. At 31%, our operating margin compares quite favorably to other large, global consumer companies. 
Looking at restaurant margins, our consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 8% for the full year to $6.5 billion. The consolidated franchise margin percent rose 30 basis points to 82.4% for both the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by solid comparable sales growth in each area of the world.
Consolidated Company-operated margins rose 20 basis points to 19% for the quarter as positive comparable sales more than offset higher labor and other costs. For the year, Company-operated margins increased 140 basis points to 19.6% driven by comparable sales increases and lower commodity costs primarily in the U.S. and Europe.
Turning now to segment performance, in the U.S., we delivered comparable sales growth and even higher comparable guest count growth in both fourth quarter and the full year by staying focused on the customer.
On a trailing 12-month basis through November, our IEO market share rose 50 basis points to 11.8%, the largest increase in five years, and our highest market share ever. This translated into over 550 million additional customer visits during this period. We drove this growth in a declining IEO market through a multifaceted approach that included relevant new product introductions like the frappes and smoothies, effective national promotions of iconic products like Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets; we expanded our value offerings to include Dollar Menu at breakfast and broadened our accessibility through extended hours and more dual-lane drive-thrus. 
The increase in comparable sales generated significant top and bottom line gains at a restaurant level. On a beginning average annual store volume of nearly $2.4 million, it translated into over $90,000 of incremental sales in 2010. This was primarily accomplished through guest count increases, as we essentially took no price increases during the year. These strong sales helped drive our average owner operator cash flow per restaurant up nearly $50,000 or 16% to a record high $364,000 on a trailing 12-month basis through November. 
U.S. Company-operated margins grew 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and 190 basis points for the year. Positive comparable sales and relatively flat commodity cost in the fourth quarter and 4% lower commodity cost for the year more than offset higher labor costs. As we look to 2011, we project commodity cost increases of 2% to 2.5% in the U.S., which still puts our cost below 2009 levels. From a pricing standpoint, as commodity and other cost pressures become more pronounced as we move throughout the year, we will likely increase prices to offset some, but not necessarily all, of these cost increases. Growing traffic and market share has been a key to our success these last few years. Accordingly, we will continue to maintain the balance of strong traffic momentum with any strategic pricing moves.
Turning to Europe, in the fourth quarter France and Germany continue to effectively promote the core menu, along with rotational fourth tier menu options. The U.K. also focused on menu variety and value, along with growing the Breakfast Daypart and Specialty Coffee business. We now have the leading market share of hot brewed coffee in the U.K. Increased sales partly offset by higher labor and slightly higher commodity costs contributed to Company-operated margins increasing 30 basis points for the quarter to 19.5%. For the year, positive comparable sales along with a 2.5% decline in commodities, partly offset by higher labor costs, resulted in company operating margins increasing 140 basis points to 19.8%. As we head into 2011, we face some headwinds that could impact both sales and margins. VAT increases and austerity measures could potentially pressure overall retail sales growth, although to date, we have seen no change in customer behavior. 
In the U.K., we already increased our prices to cover the 2.5% VAT increase implemented January 1. We did this strategically, restaurant by restaurant, not simply across the board. We will be closely monitoring the U.K. and the rest of Europe to understand consumer reactions to these measures. We also expect other austerity measures and tax increases to pressure Europe's margin. Increased social charges, especially in Russia, could negatively impact Europe's Company-operated margins by more than $20 million or about 30 basis points. In addition, we're projecting commodity cost increases of 3.5% to 4.5% in 2011. 
Despite some of these near-term challenges, all of which are manageable, our business in Europe remains very strong, as is our fundamental operating model. We will continue to evaluate our pricing strategies and make adjustments when prudent while also balancing the need to grow guest counts. I'm confident that we have the right people and plans in place to continue to grow European sales, traffic and profitability in 2011 and beyond.
In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, virtually every country posted positive comparable sales for the quarter and the full year. Key convenience initiatives including delivery and drive-thru, are increasing accessibility across all dayparts. Convenience also means being open beyond the traditional workday. Nearly 2/3 of our restaurants in APMEA offer some form of extended hours, and over half are open 24 hours. In addition, breakfast continues to be a growth platform and is offered in about 75% of our 8,400 restaurants. Relative to profitability, APMEA's Company-operated margin was flat for the quarter at 17.1% as positive comparable sales were offset by increased labor, occupancy and restaurant opening costs. 
For the year, Company-operated margins increased 100 basis points to 17.8%. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, APMEA enjoyed lower commodity cost along with strong comparable sales, which more than offset higher labor and other costs. For a perspective, APMEA's year-end McOpCo margin is 690 basis points higher than five years ago. We are pleased with our progress in this key growth region and remains optimistic about our long-term potential. 
The final component of combined operating is G&A. In constant currency, G&A increased for the quarter and for the year in line with our expectations. Remember that the year included costs associated with the Vancouver Winter Olympics and Biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention. Importantly, G&A declined both as a percent of sales and revenue for the fifth consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue in 2011.
I'd like to comment briefly on our tax rate, which we expect to be slightly higher in 2011. In the past couple of years, our effective tax rate benefited by approximately two percentage points from our ability to claim certain foreign tax credits. With a recent change in tax law, these credits are no longer available to us. Our economic engine, coupled with prudent financial management, continues to generate significant amounts of cash from operations. Our first use of that cash is to reinvest in our business to continue growing and generating strong returns.
In 2011, we expect to invest about $2.5 billion, half of which will be used to open approximately 1,100 new restaurants. The breakdown for openings in our largest geographic segment is as follows: 150 openings in the U.S., 225 in Europe and 625 in APMEA, including 175 to 200 new openings in China.
The other half of our CapEx will be devoted to investing in our existing locations. The U.S. completed about 200 reimages in 2010. With our knowledge and experience growing, we expect to complete an additional 600 this year. Europe is planning to complete over 850 reimages while APMEA is projecting about 500. We manage our business for the long term. Reimaging is critical because it significantly enhances customer perceptions of our brand and helps drive sales over time. To remain relevant, I believe the decision to reimage is not a question of 'if' but rather of 'when'. Our system is strong, our owner operators have both the financial capacity and willingness to reinvest, and we are taking share from the competition. All of which combine to make it an ideal time for McDonald's to seize this opportunity.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.02 while benefiting full year EPS by $0.01. At current exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2011 EPS to be positively impacted by about $0.01 with a greater benefit for the full year. As always, take this as directional guidance only because I know rates will change as we move throughout 2011. 
As we enter the new year, the environment continues to change, posing both new opportunities and challenges. Our performance over the last couple of years gives a great confidence in the ability of the McDonald's system, our owner operators, suppliers and company employees, to successfully navigate these conditions. We are operating from a position of strength, our system is aligned with over 32,000 restaurants serving more than 62 million customers a day with high-quality food at a great value at the speed and convenience only McDonald's can offer. We are poised for future growth and well positioned to participate fully as the economy begins to recover. 2011 will be another great year for the McDonald's system. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Cathy to begin our Q&A."

So we look at our basket of goods as a -- if we look region by region, the U.S., we have more opportunity to lock in cost because of broader markets and more instruments available to our suppliers to do that hedging. And so we're not going to give specific percentages by each category. We're about as locked-in today as we were a year ago at this time and have a fair degree of confidence in that 2% to 2.5% increase. Probably the biggest variable in that will be beef. We built a substantial increase in our beef cost into that guidance but that's the one market that looks like it could be the most volatile for us. 
The same with Europe, beef is probably the biggest driver of our volatility there. Where, typically, less opportunity to lock in and hedge broadly across the continent, although each year, both in Europe and APMEA, we get more and more opportunity to get that done. So the U.S., at 2% or 2.5%, we feel pretty good about that in terms of our ability to raise prices where it makes sense to deal with that. But as we look at price as we've experienced these last couple of years, growing traffic is very important. So as I said in my remarks, we're going to look to balance traffic growth with recovering input costs and the same basically in the other two areas."

So food away from home is a huge component, which is related to CPI. But we look a little deeper than the CPI piece alone, so we'll look at the producer price index as a result of that. And then we look at food at home. And so one of the things we found in the U.S. quite a few years ago was that pricing to food away from home and below food away from home maintained a good value rating for us and to the point again made, a good sensitivity from consumers in terms of their ongoing purchase intent. So that was a big point. The other thing though that we learned was that food at home does matter, so grocery store prices do matter. If you look at the U.S. this last year, you saw about a 1.3 in terms of food away from home. But interestingly enough, you only saw 2/10 increase in food at home. So our pricing, we have to be able to flex around those points and make sure we have solid value. It is not based upon our competitors' pricing alone. Matter of fact, that's a very small portion of our consideration but we do look at the others. When you look around the rest of the world, it varies to Pete's point by market. You got markets that have higher inflation, such as sometimes markets like Russia. You've got other markets that have very low inflation, such as markets like the UK. And so even as we look at all of our pricing strategies, we have to take into account market-by-market those individual circumstances. And so we look at food away from home, food at home, and then we try to make sure that we continue to remain our value proposition, which to Pete's point is really around price stability especially around the value menus."

So we're not running away from those. We want to make sure we continue to market those effectively. But I wouldn't be as shortsighted as looking only at the beverage side. We continue to have great consumer reaction to our core products. So this past year, Big Macs and the nuggets, that Pete talked about and Jim talked about, the breakfast value keeping in mind that last year or 2010 was the first year we implemented breakfast value at a national level. All the markets had, had something before, but with a concerted voice. So we continue to have that as it moves forward. We hope to see some economic benefit as recovery, but we don't count too much on that as of this point. But you've got a great core and we've got the value that we'll continue to talk about. You still got beverages. The U.S. will begin, in a more aggressive way, their reimaging programs this year, which always gives a lifts to the brand as we move that forward as well. Extended hours, the U.S. grew another couple of points last year so they still got some opportunity. It's in the high-30s versus being in the 50s when you look at 24/7 over in APMEA, so still room there. More room to grow in terms of drive-thrus as we look at drive-thru optimization. And the third phase of that was side-by-side and dual lanes and all the investments that we and the franchisees continue to make. So those are some of the things and that's without talking about the rest of the pipeline, which right now we have many of the markets around the world tapping into the global pipelines that we've established, everything from wraps to wings to Angus burgers and Angus snack wraps.

I'll pick a couple of them we've talked about before. France and Australia, if you look at Australia, it's been now about seven years since they actually began some of their reimaging. The market is now complete. We've continued to see great business movement in Australia and we continue to see great guest count movement really driving that. So demand is driving it. As we move into, if you look at France and look at the different decors, what we try to do in markets outside of France and Australia is learn from what they did. So in the U.S., one of the things that we held back on in 2010 was to get the design portfolio right so consumers would react to that portfolio in a positive way. And as a result of that, we've begun to do interiors and exteriors at the same time in the U.S. And so we think that we're going to see some really good benefit to both the designs themselves. The designs in Manhattan will be a little bit different than the designs in Kearney, Missouri but the exteriors of the building will fit the neighborhoods and the consumers that we see there. So we're pretty positive relative to reimaging. Incrementally, we are still seeing that 6% to 7% in terms of incremental sales, the returns are strong, but keeping in mind the returns are based not only on the investment and the cost there but also on a broader base of where sales go in those marketplaces. So we have seen when we get to a certain point, 30, 40 percentile in the markets that we see an additional brand lift in those marketplaces as well."

And the last quarter you had mentioned that you're expecting some margin pressures beyond that just due to the normal course of inflation.

And then just separately on China, I know your prepared remarks talked about the informal eating-out market remains soft. Just wondering whether you could touch on whether you view that as still -- at what point do you take that from a short-term concern to maybe a longer-term concern and perhaps how the cost pressures play out there.

But if you look at our guest count growth, we have been able to manage this exceptionally well.

As a result, we had the highest guest count growth that we've seen historically on an annual basis for comp in recent history. So when you look at Europe, Europe managed it very, very well.

And so if you look at the economy, we pay close attention to the consumer confidence in the United States, that has ticked down from November again. You know the unemployment levels as well as I do. So when you look at the job markets, I don't see a lot changing there, in the near term. There has been some slight growth and a little bit of change in the economy over the last six months. But when we go into 2011, I think we're sort of seeing this the same way. Whether or not we expect the informal eating-out market to grow is, maybe slightly in 2011. But quite frankly, we don't see a substantial change there. When you look at Europe, Europe continues to have fits and starts but, as Pete mentioned in his comments, we're really not seeing an impact from some of these austerity measures yet. And as I've said many times before, our business model operates fairly well in these environments and Europe's had fits and starts before, and we've managed through those over the years and we don't expect to see substantial impact from that relative to certainly the overall growth of McDonald's share against the informal eating-out. And the overall economies around the world though, I should say, are sort of where they were coming out of 2010 going into 2011. And don't see a whole lot of change there. But I do believe that GDP will be better in 2011 in the U.S. And I think countries in Europe remain to be seen. But we always have to remember that when we look at Europe, it's 50 countries, all operating at different levels of economic performance. And so we've managed through that one country at a time. Yes, the big three: U.K., Germany and France are big drivers of our business there and we certainly manage very well through those ups and downs in those countries as well."

One to your point, if you implement a value menu of sorts, there are times when we will see some slight erosion relative to the average check. We picked that up in terms of the total transactions and overall profitability is also higher. Having said that, there's more than the value components of average check. We also have implemented the beverage strategy. As a result, our items per transaction on a beverage purchase will be lower than items per transaction when you're buying an overall meal that includes sandwich, fries or side, and then the drink. And so what we do see is because of those individual purchases, and also because of the benefit we get with those purchases later in the day, snack periods, et cetera, we have seen that the average check component that we've seen. Our average check is very, very healthy. The new products have performed very, very well, so we're good there. When you ask a question about McCafé relative to the hot and the cold, we have seen good growth across beverages based upon the numbers we came out initially with McCafé.

I'm pleased to report our business growth continued in the fourth quarter and that 2010 was another strong year for McDonald's. We continue to build our business, grow our market share and strengthen our connection with the customer.2010 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our Plan to Win business strategy. 
Global comparable sales were up 5% for the quarter and for the year. And while we don't like to single out weather, in December, we experienced a severe impact. It's always difficult to quantify, but our best estimates are that the December comp was negatively impacted by 5% in Europe and slightly more than 2% in the United States. But it all indicates that our underlying trends remain strong. Despite these conditions, December global comparable sales were up 3.7%. In January, global comparable sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%. In constant currencies excluding impairment and other in last year's Redbox gain, operating income grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the year. While EPS increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the year. Overall, the global economy is recovering slowly but it remains challenging and consumers are still cautious.
We continue to succeed by understanding our customers and aggressively executing the right strategies of optimizing our menu with a range of consumer-driven offerings; modernizing the experience for our customers and crew through service upgrades and reimaged restaurants; and broadening our accessibility with more restaurants, convenient hours and outstanding value. This is our system-wide focus on to the Plan to Win and it's what helped drive our success around the world in 2010. It is this proven strategy and our unrelenting focus on the customer that will drive the business in 2011 and the years to come. 
Looking at the U.S., comp sales increased 4.4% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year with operating income up 1% and 7%, respectively. These results were achieved despite a tough economy and slow growth in the informal eating-out market. We continue to grow share, outpacing the competition on comparable sales and we continue to achieve all-time highs for comparable guest count growth during the period, when the overall industry traffic was contracting. 
We drove results with a strong focus on value, menu relevance and convenience. We benefited from our Dollar Menu at breakfast which has been in place for over a year now and has increased morning traffic. This addition to our traditional Dollar Menu offering has boosted our position as a value leader across all dayparts. 
Our expanded beverage program continues to bring in customers throughout the day and sales of our new fruit smoothies and frappes during the quarter continued to do well. This, coupled with the strong lift in hot McCafé offerings, including the addition of Caramel Mocha, drove December McCafé units up 20% over last year. 
U.S. also delivered results by featuring our popular core products as well as our unique favorite, our famous McRib, which we offered for a limited time on a national level. Throughout the year, we featured our flagship products which offer great taste and value every day. December's focus on Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese and the Angus burger also added increased unit movement. And for the first time ever, we partnered with Walmart for our annual MONOPOLY promotion, resulting in a larger and more relevant prize pool. MONOPOLY lifted sales of featured core products like Big Mac and McNuggets as well as high-margin smoothies and frappes. And it drove Extra Value Meal units by more than 15%. 
Now as we begin 2011, we're excited about our latest new menu offering, oatmeal, which we launched nationally this month. This great tasting product is an example of how we are continuing to grow our nutrition profile and meet our customers' evolving tastes. Also this year, the U.S. will continue rolling out our new point-of-sale system which simplifies the order taking process, improves accuracy and allows the crew to provide better service to our customers. It's currently in about a third of our stores and we plan to have it rolled out throughout the U.S. by the end of the year. 
Now turning to Europe. Comparable sales were up 3.4% for the quarter and 4.4% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year. In 2010, Europe reached an all-time high in informal eating-out market share at 9.5% and served 200 million more customers than the year before. We continue to take share with the overall market declining. The segment drove results with a compelling menu of signature offerings and new products across all price tiers, as well as through breakfast and by modernizing the restaurant experience. 
Europe is leveraging learnings from across the system and growing its breakfast business. The U.K. finished the year with breakfast sales up more than 12%, largely driven by a sustained quality campaign around coffee. In Germany, the continued promotion of breakfast under the tagline ""easy morning"" helped build sales and drive traffic during that daypart. 
McCafé is now in almost 1,300 restaurants in Europe and is helping to boost our breakfast business in a locally relevant way. In markets like Italy, where we now have more than 100 McCafés, our espresso-based coffee and pastry offerings are delivering exactly what the Italians are looking for at breakfast. In 2011, Europe will continue to expand McCafé in many markets. 
On the menu front, France is a great example of meeting our European customers' expectations for value and variety. During the quarter, France drove sales with a Double Cheeseburger promotion in the introduction of its Tour Demain [ph] premium burgers with their variety of ethnic flavors. New food news and premium offerings also contributed to results in the U.K. and Germany. In the U.K., food events highlighting the Big Tasty and Chicken Legend sandwiches each performed well. In Germany, the recently launched chicken and beef McWraps continued their strong sales. And sales results were above expectations for the new 1955 sandwich, a premium burger with a homemade look and gourmet bun. 
Meanwhile, our service scores improve across Europe due largely to our new customer order displays which improve accuracy and speed at the drive-thru. Europe also remains leader in our reimaging efforts with nearly 70% of interiors and about 40% of exteriors remodeled, making our brand more contemporary and relevant. As I look to 2011, I'm confident that our strategies around service, value and optimizing our menu will continue to connect with consumers and drive our momentum well into the future. 
Shifting to Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa or APMEA, for the quarter and year, comp sales were up 5.5% and 6%, respectively. Operating income also continued to grow, up 10% for the quarter and 11% for the year in constant currencies. We're driving growth across the region through convenience, value and breakfast along with core offerings and compelling new menu news. 
Building on our leadership position and value, many of our key markets are offering a Value Lunch program that fits the need of today's consumers. And the entire segment remains a system leader in customer satisfaction scores, helping us differentiate McDonald's in the areas of food quality and customer experience. 
Australia continued to build on last year's strong comp sales as it achieved success with new items, including the November rollout of its Chicken McBites, which are a great-tasting sandwich for snacking and customers on-the-go. Early sales have exceeded expectations and are largely incremental to our popular McNuggets. In addition, Australia continued to grow sales in traffic at breakfast with the help of their Mighty McMuffin and new Breakfast Wrap, both of which deliver great tasting ways to start the day. 
In Japan, while the economic environment and informal eating-out market remain challenging, our strategies are delivering positive results, as evidenced by Japan's 4.5% comps sales increase in 2010. Value breakfast launched mid-year, featuring Sausage McMuffin and McGriddle, maintained its momentum into the fourth quarter and continued to grow sales and guest counts. And December's re-hit of the popular Texas Burger helped Japan deliver a strong finish to the year. 
Turning to China, we remain committed and confident in our long-term success in this market. In 2010 we opened 166 restaurants, bringing the total to nearly 1,300. In 2011, we will grow the base of restaurants by about 15% or 16% toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants in China by the end of 2013. China's comparable sales growth in the quarter was primarily driven by value and the ongoing success of our Value Lunch program. Additional drivers included breakfast and greater convenience through initiatives such as delivering, dessert kiosks and extended hours. Our efforts are resonating with Chinese consumers. During a time when the informal eating-out market remains soft, we continue to increase our share of visits in our five major markets. As we invest in China, we intend to stay focused on gaining even greater relevance in the marketplace, from building drive-thrus, reimaging our restaurants and continuing to deliver a compelling menu of core and local offerings. 
So those are a few highlights of our continued business momentum around the world. And as we begin this year, I want to reiterate our financial targets and capital management philosophy. We are confident that we will continue to deliver on our long-term average annual targets of 3% to 5% sales growth, 6% to 7% operating income growth, and return on incremental invested capital in the high teens. We believe these targets are right for a company of our size and maturity and keep us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. 
Achieving these targets delivers significant cash flow and our philosophy for the use of this cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business. After that, we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors. For 2010, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. 
Let me just say that overall, I am proud to say that 2010 was another strong year. Our owner operators, suppliers, employees' strength and alignment have proven again to be a key competitive advantage. At a time of lingering economic uncertainty and slow growth, we continue to gain market share, attract more customers to our brand and fortify our financial strength. Our Plan to Win and its unrelenting focus on the customer has been a proven strategy in every kind of environment and it will continue to serve us well in 2011 and beyond. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Pete Bensen."
139488,116795514,97682,"McDonald's Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2011",2011-01-24,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. As our fourth quarter and full year performance demonstrates, our system's collective focus on the Plan to Win continues to deliver strong results despite challenging economic conditions. It's a battle for market share an",1672,"Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. As our fourth quarter and full year performance demonstrates, our system's collective focus on the Plan to Win continues to deliver strong results despite challenging economic conditions. It's a battle for market share and McDonald's is clearly winning. Over the past year, we again exceeded our long-term financial targets. System-wide sales grew 6% in constant currencies. Operating income grew 10% in constant currencies, excluding the impact of impairment and other charges, and our one- and three-year returns on incremental invested capital, while not yet finalized, should be well above our high teens target. Exceeding these targets have positive implications for our investors who enjoyed an overall return on investment of nearly 27% in 2010, ranking us third among the Dow companies. 
Positive comparable sales for the year in nearly all of our 117 markets, combined with expense control and favorable commodity cost, drove a 90 basis point improvement in combined operating margin. At 31%, our operating margin compares quite favorably to other large, global consumer companies. 
Looking at restaurant margins, our consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 8% for the full year to $6.5 billion. The consolidated franchise margin percent rose 30 basis points to 82.4% for both the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by solid comparable sales growth in each area of the world. Consolidated Company-operated margins rose 20 basis points to 19% for the quarter as positive comparable sales more than offset higher labor and other costs. For the year, Company-operated margins increased 140 basis points to 19.6%, driven by comparable sales increases and lower commodity costs primarily in the U.S. and Europe. 
Turning now to segment performance. In the U.S., we delivered comparable sales growth and even higher comparable guest count growth in both fourth quarter and the full year by staying focused on the customer. On a trailing 12-month basis through November, our IEO market share rose 50 basis points to 11.8%, the largest increase in five years, and our highest market share ever. This translated into over 550 million additional customer visits during this period. We drove this growth in a declining IEO market through a multifaceted approach that included relevant new product introductions like the frappes and smoothies, effective national promotions of iconic products like Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets; we expanded our value offerings to include Dollar Menu at breakfast and broadened our accessibility through extended hours and more dual-lane drive-thrus. 
The increase in comparable sales generated significant top and bottom line gains at a restaurant level. On a beginning average annual store volume of nearly $2.4 million, it translated into over $90,000 of incremental sales in 2010. This was primarily accomplished through guest count increases, as we essentially took no price increases during the year. These strong sales helped drive our average owner operator cash flow per restaurant up nearly $50,000 or 16% to a record high $364,000 on a trailing 12-month basis through November. 
U.S. Company-operated margins grew 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and 190 basis points for the year. Positive comparable sales and relatively flat commodity costs in the fourth quarter and 4% lower commodity costs for the year more than offset higher labor costs. As we look to 2011, we project commodity cost increases of 2% to 2 1/2% in the U.S., which still puts our cost below 2009 levels. From a pricing standpoint, as commodity and other cost pressures become more pronounced as we move throughout the year, we will likely increase prices to offset some, but not necessarily all, of these cost increases. Growing traffic and market share has been a key to our success these last few years. Accordingly, we will continue to maintain the balance of strong traffic momentum with any strategic pricing moves. 
Turning to Europe. In the fourth quarter, France and Germany continue to effectively promote the core menu, along with rotational fourth tier menu options. The U.K. also focused on menu variety and value, along with growing the Breakfast Daypart and Specialty Coffee business. We now have the leading market share of hot brewed coffee in the U.K. Increased sales partly offset by higher labor and slightly higher commodity costs contributed to Company-operated margins increasing 30 basis points for the quarter to 19.5%. 
For the year, positive comparable sales along with a 2.5% decline in commodities, partly offset by higher labor costs, resulted in company operating margins increasing 140 basis points to 19.8%. As we head into 2011, we face some headwinds that could impact both sales and margins. VAT increases and austerity measures could potentially pressure overall retail sales growth, although to date, we have seen no change in customer behavior. 
In the U.K., we already increased our prices to cover the 2.5% VAT increase implemented January 1. We did this strategically, restaurant by restaurant, not simply across the board. We will be closely monitoring the U.K. and the rest of Europe to understand consumer reactions to these measures. We also expect other austerity measures and tax increases to pressure Europe's margin. Increased social charges, especially in Russia, could negatively impact Europe's Company-operated margins by more than $20 million or about 30 basis points. In addition, we're projecting commodity cost increases of 3 1/2% to 4 1/2% in 2011. 
Despite some of these near-term challenges, all of which are manageable, our business in Europe remains very strong, as does our fundamental operating model. We will continue to evaluate our pricing strategies and make adjustments when prudent while also balancing the need to grow guest counts. I'm confident that we have the right people and plans in place to continue to grow European sales, traffic and profitability in 2011 and beyond. 
In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, virtually every country posted positive comparable sales for the quarter and the full year. Key convenience initiatives including delivery and drive-thru are increasing accessibility across all dayparts. 
Convenience also means being open beyond the traditional workday. Nearly 2/3 of our restaurants in APMEA offer some form of extended hours, and over half are open 24 hours. In addition, breakfast continues to be a growth platform and is offered in about 75% of our 8,400 restaurants. Relative to profitability, APMEA's Company-operated margin was flat for the quarter at 17.1% as positive comparable sales were offset by increased labor, occupancy and restaurant opening costs. For the year, Company-operated margins increased 100 basis points to 17.8%. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, APMEA enjoyed lower commodity costs along with strong comparable sales, which more than offset higher labor and other costs. For a perspective, APMEA's year-end McOpCo margin is 690 basis points higher than five years ago. We are pleased with our progress in this key growth region and remain optimistic about our long-term potential. 
The final component of combined operating margin is G&A. In constant currency, G&A increased for the quarter and the year in line with our expectations. Remember that the year included costs associated with the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our Biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention. Importantly, G&A declined both as a percent of sales and revenue for the fifth consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue in 2011. 
I'd like to comment briefly on our tax rate, which we expect to be slightly higher in 2011. In the past couple of years, our effective tax rate benefited by approximately two percentage points from our ability to claim certain foreign tax credits. With a recent change in tax law, these credits are no longer available to us. Our economic engine, coupled with prudent financial management, continues to generate significant amounts of cash from operations. Our first use of that cash is to reinvest in our business to continue growing and generating strong returns. 
In 2011, we expect to invest about $2.5 billion, half of which will be used to open approximately 1,100 new restaurants. The breakdown for openings in our largest geographic segments is as follows: 150 openings in the U.S., 225 in Europe and 625 in APMEA, including 175 to 200 new openings in China. The other half of our CapEx will be devoted to investing in our existing locations. 
The U.S. completed about 200 reimages in 2010. With our knowledge and experience growing, we expect to complete an additional 600 this year. Europe is planning to complete over 850 reimages while APMEA is projecting about 500. We manage our business for the long term. Reimaging is critical because it significantly enhances customer perceptions of our brand and helps drive sales over time. To remain relevant, I believe the decision to reimage is not a question of, if but rather of when. Our system is strong, our owner operators have both the financial capacity and willingness to reinvest, and we are taking share from the competition, all of which combine to make it an ideal time for McDonald's to seize this opportunity. 
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.02 while benefiting full year EPS by $0.01. At current exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2011 EPS to be positively impacted by about $0.01 with a greater benefit for the full year. As always, take this as directional guidance only because I know rates will change as we move throughout 2011. 
As we enter the new year, the environment continues to change, posing both new opportunities and challenges. Our performance over the last couple of years gives a great confidence in the ability of the McDonald's system, our owner operators, suppliers and company employees, to successfully navigate these conditions. We are operating from a position of strength, our system is aligned with over 32,000 restaurants serving more than 62 million customers a day with high-quality food at a great value at the speed and convenience only McDonald's can offer. We are poised for future growth and well positioned to participate fully as the economy begins to recover.2011 will be another great year for the McDonald's system. Thank you. 
Now I'll turn it over to Cathy to begin our Q&A."

It's really been business as usual in the way we approach this relative to the supply chain and the treasury working together on some of the hedging and the out contracts relative to those things that impact the commodity cost, as you know, to lock in prices so that we have a reasonable expectation in the P&L for our franchisees. But with that, I'll let Pete talk specifically to what that process looked like or what our assumptions were."

So we look at our basket of goods as a -- if we look region by region, the U.S., we have more opportunity to lock in cost because of broader markets and more instruments available to our suppliers to do that hedging. And so we're not going to give specific percentages by each category. We're about as locked-in today as we were a year ago at this time and have a fair degree of confidence in that 2% to 2.5% increase. Probably the biggest variable in that will be beef. We built a substantial increase in our beef cost into that guidance but that's the one market that looks like it could be the most volatile for us. The same with Europe, beef is probably the biggest driver of our volatility there. Where, typically, less opportunity to lock in and hedge broadly across the continent, although each year, both in Europe and APMEA, we get more and more opportunity to get that done. So the U.S., at 2% or 2.5%, we feel pretty good about that in terms of our ability to raise prices where it makes sense to deal with that. But as we look at price as we've experienced these last couple of years, growing traffic is very important. So as I said in my remarks, we're going to look to balance traffic growth with recovering input costs and the same basically in the other two areas."

So food away from home is a huge component, which is related to CPI. But we look a little deeper than the CPI piece alone, so we'll look at the producer price index as a result of that. And then we look at food at home. And so one of the things we found in the U.S. quite a few years ago was that pricing to food away from home and below food away from home maintained a good value rating for us and to the point again made, a good sensitivity from consumers in terms of their ongoing purchase intent. So that was a big point. The other thing though that we learned was that food at home does matter, so grocery store prices do matter. If you look at the U.S. this last year, you saw about a 1.3 in terms of food away from home. But interestingly enough, you only saw 2/10 increase in food at home. So our pricing, we have to be able to flex around those points and make sure we have solid value. It is not based upon our competitors' pricing alone. Matter of fact, that's a very small portion of our consideration but we do look at the others. When you look around the rest of the world, it varies to Pete's point by market. You got markets that have higher inflation, such as sometimes markets like Russia. You've got other markets that have very low inflation, such as markets like the UK. And so even as we look at all of our pricing strategies, we have to take into account market-by-market those individual circumstances. And so we look at food away from home, food at home, and then we try to make sure that we continue to remain our value proposition, which to Pete's point is really around price stability especially around the value menus."

And a couple things: One, commodity costs are going to be a little bit higher than average this year in Europe and that increase in the social taxes in Russia is that 30 basis-point drag on the segment's margin is adding some additional challenge. They have a social charge on wages there that's going from 26% to 34% of wages and about 20% of our McOpCo sales come out of Russia.

So we're not running away from those. We want to make sure we continue to market those effectively. But I wouldn't be as shortsighted as looking only at the beverage side. We continue to have great consumer reaction to our core products. So this past year, Big Macs and the nuggets, that Pete talked about and Jim talked about, the breakfast value keeping in mind that last year or 2010 was the first year we implemented breakfast value at a national level. All the markets had, had something before, but with a concerted voice. So we continue to have that as it moves forward. We hope to see some economic benefit as recovery, but we don't count too much on that as of this point. But you've got a great core and we've got the value that we'll continue to talk about. You still got beverages. The U.S. will begin, in a more aggressive way, their reimaging programs this year, which always gives a lifts to the brand as we move that forward as well. Extended hours, the U.S. grew another couple of points last year so they still got some opportunity. It's in the high-30s versus being in the 50s when you look at 24/7 over in APMEA, so still room there. More room to grow in terms of drive-thrus as we look at drive-thru optimization. And the third phase of that was side-by-side and dual lanes and all the investments that we and the franchisees continue to make. So those are some of the things and that's without talking about the rest of the pipeline, which right now we have many of the markets around the world tapping into the global pipelines that we've established, everything from wraps to wings to Angus burgers and Angus snack wraps. So we feel pretty good about the menu pipeline and about our ability to continue to drive the business."

Relative to reimaging, what we think will happen in the U.S. is very similar to what we've seen. I'm glad you brought up some of the markets in Europe. I'll pick a couple of them we've talked about before. France and Australia, if you look at Australia, it's been now about seven years since they actually began some of their reimaging. The market is now complete. We've continued to see great business movement in Australia and we continue to see great guest count movement really driving that. So demand is driving it. As we move into, if you look at France and look at the different decors, what we try to do in markets outside of France and Australia is learn from what they did. So in the U.S., one of the things that we held back on in 2010 was to get the design portfolio right so consumers would react to that portfolio in a positive way. And as a result of that, we've begun to do interiors and exteriors at the same time in the U.S. And so we think that we're going to see some really good benefit to both the designs themselves. The designs in Manhattan will be a little bit different than the designs in Kearney, Missouri but the exteriors of the building will fit the neighborhoods and the consumers that we see there. So we're pretty positive relative to reimaging. Incrementally, we are still seeing that 6% to 7% in terms of incremental sales, the returns are strong, but keeping in mind the returns are based not only on the investment and the cost there but also on a broader base of where sales go in those marketplaces. So we have seen when we get to a certain point, 30, 40 percentile in the markets that we see an additional brand lift in those marketplaces as well."

It was over 10% in terms of basically their version of the producer price index, and so we continue to look at that, but it really helps us relative to our execution strategy, which is around our value programs, our Value Lunch programs. We continue to build breakfast in China.

But if you look at our guest count growth, we have been able to manage this exceptionally well. If you look at the U.S. last year, they were very mindful of the price increase so they didn't take much at all. As a result, we had the highest guest count growth that we've seen historically on an annual basis for comp in recent history. So when you look at Europe, Europe managed it very, very well. They were able to take a little more price increase as a result of what's happened in areas like Russia, as Pete mentioned earlier. But nonetheless, great guest count growth.

When you look at Europe, Europe continues to have fits and starts but, as Pete mentioned in his comments, we're really not seeing an impact from some of these austerity measures yet.

When you ask a question about McCafé relative to the hot and the cold, we have seen good growth across beverages based upon the numbers we came out initially with McCafé. And we talked about $125,000 based upon all of the McCafé beverages, frappes and the smoothies, those numbers that we gave earlier, we've exceeded the expectations that we have for the numbers. And so we're solid both on the hot end and on the cold end relative to beverages."

I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest quarterly results, which reflects the continued strength of our business. The first quarter worldwide comparable sales were up 4.2%. Operating income increased 7% in constant currency and EPS reached $1.15, a 12% increase in cash and currencies. And our success continues to be a systemwide effort. In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter increased 2.9% oil operating income declined 2% as it was negatively impacted by a four percentage point decline on our operating gains against  2010.
Comparable sales in Europe rose a healthy 5.7% and operating income grew 12% in constant currencies. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, comp sales grew 3.2% and operating income rose 18% in constant currencies. 2010 charge for Japan's strategic restaurant closings benefited APMEA's 2011 growth rate by 12 percentage points and the consolidated growth rate by two percentage points. And our momentum is continuing into April with our global comparable sales trending in line or better than the first quarter.
These results were a testament to the continued relevance of our Plan to Win and its relentless focus on those five P's: people, products, price and promotion. On the economic climate is still less than ideal, from a slow and uneven recovery to a significantly rising commodity cost and fragile consumer confidence. But we continue to succeed by staying true to our proven plans and listening to concerns. We're elevating our business to meet their needs in a holistic way. With attention paid to each won of the growth priorities under our Plan to Win.
Optimizing the menu with right food and beverage offerings, modernizing the customer experience by upgrading every aspect of our restaurants from service to design, and broadening our accessibility through continued convenience and value initiatives. It's not just one initiative, but the combination of all of them that is driving our growth. This approach isn't revolutionary, it's evolutionary. We focus on improvements on top of an already strong and healthy base. The alignment of the McDonald's system around our global growth drivers and then scaling and executing against each of them is what will continue to grow our business and increase our market share. An area of menu we're delivering results by focusing on our core offerings, which drives a majority of our business. At the same time, we balance this with new food and beverage news around relevant products that our customers want. 
We're tapping an opportunities to further build key categories, from chicken and beef to beverages and breakfast, and we're already in a number of billion dollars brands as you know to leverage along the way. And with the benefit of shared learnings from markets around the world, we will continue to deliver a strong global pipeline for today and in the future. 
In chicken, we've taken a well-known well-known brand, McNuggets, and featured larger sharing portions with great success. In January, the United States drove double digit sales increases in the product with the promotion of 20-piece Chicken McNuggets, while the U.K. launched the 20-piece Share Box resulted in sales that were more than double in the initial projections. 
In Australia we continued to show success with its popular new chicken bites, a smaller bite size chicken offering, and they're testing several over-baked chicken offerings as part of our efforts to keep and abating in that category. These continues to provide opportunities with products like our iconic Big Mac and more recent additions like the Angus burger. 
Several markets celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Big Mac, and in France, the Double Cheeseburger continues to be a strong seller throughout the quarter. Line extensions and locally relevant limited time offers continue to drive gains across system. Europe has been doing this with great success and our other areas of the world are taking their learnings in applying them to grow their business. Japan hit the mark with its highly popular big America 2 burger campaign. In February, the U.S. entered the Chipotle and Bacon flavor to its line of Angus burger's Snack McWrap's, which drove total Angus burgers to their highest rate in nearly a years, an increase total unit movement by more than 30%. In this month Canada is launching its new line of Angus burgers.
U.S. is targeting additional opportunities for line extensions in limited time offerings in both beef and chicken as it explores the use of Artisan breads in a variety of toppings, and they're taking really a page out of Europe's playbook.
Turning to beverages, we're in the early stages of leveraging this platform around the world. In the U.S. the winter months helped to boost our growing line of hot McCafe offerings with sales of specialty coffees increasing 17% from a year ago. The U.S. will build on this momentum with the launch of the frozen strawberry lemonade in May along with the new unique smoothy flavor this summer and the re-hit of the popular value drinks. 
Beverages in the U.S. are $146 billion business and we have only scratched the surface on our opportunity there. Beverages are also important outside the United States. In China we have more than 1145 McCafe and in Europe more than 1,350. In other markets such as Canada and Australia, they are testing various product from the U.S. lineup of specialty coffees and blended ice drinks. 
Now let me wrap up the discussion on menu with Breakfast. In the United States, food news from the quarter was the launch of Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, which you all heard about, which strengthened our overall nutritional profile and gave customers another great tasting high-quality option, not only in breakfast but all day long.  In China and Japan both made gains in breakfast through a combination of compelling value and focus on strong menu offerings.
Now regarding Japan, our thoughts continue to be with the Japanese people as they work to put their the devastation behind them and rebuild their country. Our business in Japan was certainly impacted and continues to face some challenges, although the effect on our overall income, as you know,  is minor. Our foremost concern is to ensure the welfare of our people and then getting all of our restaurants back up and running.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the entire McDonald's system for its support in everyone on our Japan team for all they're doing to help their country and their business.
So in addition to menu, we're driving gains from making our restaurants even better and more relevant for our guests. We're staying focused on improved service through training, technology and the unyielding commitment operations excellence. All of this is helping to lift customer satisfaction across our system, especially in APMEA, with China and Japan continuing to lead the way in services and hospitality. 
In Australia, we score the highest customer satisfaction marks ever in January. In addition, one of the 70% of our APMEA markets have increased their peak hour guest counts through optimized operations and capacity initiatives. U.S. and Europe also achieved higher customer satisfaction scores, and Europe continues to make our dining experience more convenient than ever. 
France and Southern Europe are equipping an additional 250 restaurants with saltwater kiosks to deliver a  more convenient ordering experience, while the U.K. is bring a touch prepayment options to all of its 1,200 restaurants this summer, providing even greater speed and convenience for our customers. And the new more user-friendly POS system that we've talked about is now in 7,500 restaurants across the U.S., and it's easing the job of our crew so they can spend more time on customer service. We're also continuing to ramp up our system-wide imaging efforts, with all areas of the world focused on making our restaurants more contemporary and in tune with modern demands and tastes. 
Australia and Europe remained in front of this effort, with the U.S. making progress and planning to complete 603 reimages this year. In Europe, we're targeting 850 images and another 500 in Asia. We continue to see the desired results from our reimaging, which improved receptions of our brand and higher sales, differentiating McDonald's from the rest. Our brand, our business and our operators were all strong, making this the perfect time to invest in our future. 
Finally, we're driving the business by continuing to make our brand more accessible and instep with how customers work and live. In the U.S., we're delivering greater convenience and accessibility through extended hours, which also continue to drive sales and guest counts. 
In APMEA, we're building on our convenience by advancing our dessert kiosks and delivery service in Korea as well as China, where each platform  is achieving double-digit comp sales, and we're opening new restaurants in markets where the opportunity exists to strengthen penetration to expand our customer base, including China and many countries in Asia, as well as Russia, France and Italy. 
Meanwhile, we remain committed to value across our menu as consumers everywhere continue to count on McDonald's for every day brand and affordability. IN the United States, our Dollar Menu at breakfast continues to be a strong traffic driver of Dollar Menu, the rest of the day remains a consistent highly valued platform for our consumers. Across Europe, markets have put an emphasis on every day affordability like the U.K. Saver Menu a little Tasters that give consumers a wider range of menu and price options. And in APMEA, value remains an important part of our business with our popular Value Lunch program, driving strong results in numerous markets. 
Now those are a few highlights of how we've  maintained and strengthen the 2011 how we'll continue to drive success. Executing all these drivers and building the business for the long term is achieved through our world-class owner operations, suppliers, crew and staff. Together, we're committed to supporting the restaurants to serve our 64 billion customers every day, whether it's through our training classes in Hamburg university, which is celebrating its 50th year or by hiring new employees to better serve our growing customer base, as we did earlier this week in United States and Canada during national holidays. 
We also remain committed to our Plan to Win strategy, as well as our philosophy of financial discipline and enhanced shareholder value. We continue to have a healthy balance sheet, the highest credit rating in the industry and a robust business that generated $6.3 billion in cash from operations in 2010. 
After reinvesting the business, we remained committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. And in the first quarter, we bought back 18.4  million shares totaling $1.4 billion and paid a dividend of $0.61 per share for an additional $635 million. 
Now overall, I'm pleased our  first quarter  performance. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our entire system is in line wit our proven strategies and delivering the very best customer experience every time. 
And with that, will now turn it over to Pete Bensen."
139488,128121650,117033,"McDonald's Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. Our Plan to Win strategy, with the balance across the five P's, continues to deliver higher sales and improved profitability. Against the backdrop of tentative and if uneven improvement in the global economy, systemwide s",1349,"Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. Our Plan to Win strategy, with the balance across the five P's, continues to deliver higher sales and improved profitability. Against the backdrop of tentative and if uneven improvement in the global economy, systemwide sales increased 6% in constant currency in the first quarter. Operating income reached $1.8 billion, up 7% in constant currencies, and combined operating margin reached 29.9%. 
The largest driver of operating income is our franchise margins, representing nearly 70% of consolidated restaurant margin dollars. Franchise margin dollars rose to $1.6 billion, an 8% increase in constant currencies with each area of the world contributing.  Consolidated franchise margin percent rose 70 basis points to 81.9%, as positive comparable sales more than offset cost increases.
Before I turn to the company operating margins, I wanted to provide some perspective on our updated commodity cost outlook and how we view pricing in relation to some of the increased pressures on margins.
Since January, the global commodity markets have experienced significant increases. As a result, we expect additional pressure as we move throughout the year, especially in the U.S. We are seeing cost increases on virtually every item in our basket,with these accounting for about a third of the additional increase. Reduced herd sizes, increased demand and a weaker U.S. dollar driving up exports are all contributing to the increase in these costs. As a result, our U.S. grocery basket is now projected to be up about 4% to 4.5% for the year, with greater pressure being experienced in the second and third quarters. 
In Europe, our range of increase has narrowed as we now expect commodities to rise 4% to 4.5% this year. This is not significantly different from our previous guidance as many of the global factors impacting U.S. commodities are having a smaller impact in Europe. Our goal in managing our supply chain remains unchanged to maintain competitive and predictable prices to the restaurants and ultimately to our customers. With our scale, infrastructure and relationships, we believe our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for the McDonald's system. 
Balancing cost pressures with menu pricing and market share growth is not new to our system. We have successfully managed this in the past and are confident we can do so again. Considering the inflationary environment along with the strength of our business, we believe we have some pricing elasticity. We plan to offset some, but not necessarily all of the inflationary pressures with price increases, opting to take smaller increases over the course of the year to balance the impact on the consumer and our traffic. We look to keep increases below the Food Away from Home growth rate, while also being mindful of what's happening at the grocery stores. Our demand based pricing tool will guide this system in making the best pricing positions for the business.
Growing guest count and market share has been key to our success this past few years. Accordingly, in the current environment, we are willing to invest some margin in the short-term to continue to grow our business for the long term. Each area of the world has taken some price in 2011. In the U.S., we took a 1% price increase in early March, and will likely take additional increases during the year. Across Europe, we have also increased prices by about 1% in the first quarter. In addition, when the VAT increased in certain markets, additional increases were taken to cover the tax with no net benefit to sales. Further price increases, while likely, will be balanced the midst the many cost pressures and austerity environment in this region.
With that as a backdrop, let's discuss first quarter McOpCo margins. Global company operating margin dollars increased  4% in constant currencies to $736 million. Company operated margin percent declined 50 basis points to 17.7%, reflecting positive comparable sales that were more than offset by higher commodity, labor and other costs. 
In the U.S., our basket of goods was up nearly 1% for the quarter. This increase, along with small increases in many other costs, including labor, contributed to a 90 basis point decline in company operated margins for 19.5%. Despite some of the near term cost challenges, all of which are manageable, our U.S. business remains strong, and we continue to see market share growth.
Turning to Europe, the company operated margins decreased 10 basis points to 17.2%, as strong comparable sales mostly offset increased commodities and labor, including the increased social charges and Russia. Europe's gross rebuild was up 3.7% in the quarter.
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operating margins decreased 50 basis points to 17.5% primarily due to inflationary pressures in labor and commodities, partly offset by comparable sales growth. In addition, the acceleration of new restaurant openings in China is contributing to the lower margin percent as they initially experienced preopening and higher labor and training costs just like all other markets. China's new restaurant sales and margins then grows significantly over-time.
We continue to get leverage on G&A spending, which rose about 2% in constant currencies. This increase was in line with our expectations, and we are on track for full-year G&A to decrease about 2% in constant currencies. Similar to what we have experienced the last few quarters, the earnings contribution from other operating income declined in the first quarter. With fewer affiliated restaurants and the majority of re-franchising gains behind us, we will not be recognizing the significant levels of income that we have in recent years. 
As indicated in our February sales release, the first quarter tax rate of 28.8% was lower than the full year guidance due to a non-recurring deferred tax benefit related to our foreign operations. Our guidance for the year remains 30% to 32%, implying the subsequent quarter's effective tax rates will be at the high-end of our guidance.
We remain committed to building future returns and enhancing long term shareholder value through growing our business by adding new units and driving same-store sales at existing restaurants. We are on track to open 1,100 new restaurants this year, with 156 opened in the first quarter including 40 in China.
Reimaging will be a key differentiator for our existing restaurants in the years to come. We see tremendous opportunity to update our asset base, as only 20% of our exteriors and 45% of our interiors currently reflect a modern, contemporary look. This year, we plan to reimage another 7% of our restaurants for about 2,200 locations. We made good progress in the first quarter toward that goal. The U.S. completed almost 90 reimages, and has over 60 sites under construction. We're on track to completing 600 this year and are expecting to do more in 2012.
Europe continues to lead our we imaging efforts, particularly its major markets. Over 70% of our interiors have been reimaged, with the remainder to be reimaged by the end of 2012. About 40% of exteriors have been reimaged, so we'll take another few years to complete those. We completed 100 reimages in Europe in the first quarter.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which positively impacted first quarter results by $0.03. The U.S. dollar has recently weakened against most currencies, especially our four major currencies: The euro, pound, Australian and Canadian dollars. As a result, at current exchange rates, we expect second quarter EPS to be positively impacted by $0.06 to $0.07, with the full-year benefit of $0.15 to $0.17. Please take this as directional only because I know rates will change as we move throughout 2011.
McDonald's first quarter results are a testament to our systems focus on the customer and execution against the plan to win despite a volatility and unpredictable global environment. That focus and execution yielding long term value for our shareholders and our system. 
Looking ahead, our fundamentals are strong, our strategies are sound and our system is aligned. I'm confident our commitment to executing our plan will continue to deliver strong results.

On the cold side, in terms of question, various stood in terms of the question, but there's other weapons in the arsenal there. So not only frappes and smoothies, which were really, really big hits, to your point, iced coffee. But also don't forget the entire cold beverage movement in terms of dollar drinks, which typically are across the summer months. And so we've got quite a bit going on with those cold beverages. The U.S. also has quite in inventory in the pipeline relative to looking at things that are upcoming like strawberry lemonade, we've got another smoothies flavor that's coming out this year. So we've been able to be very successful and it has helped the business tremendously. However, we also want to make share we continue stay focused on the hot drinks.

We knew you would ask about the China comp, so we're prepared for that. 6.5% was the comp for the quarter compared to a 1.4 comp a year ago first quarter.  Regarding the U.S., the commodities were still the biggest. It's a couple of things. One, as I mentioned, we did a 1% price increase. But that was not until early March. And we haven't done another price increase since late 2009. So we had no benefit from pricing essentially in the quarter. We did have the food cost pressure and compared to the first quarter last year, we had, lets say, 150 basis points of benefit from lower food costs. Here, we had a 40 basis points drag from the higher food costs. And then every other line item it seem was going just slightly negative. So we had a 10 point hit from labor and a 10 basis points hit from higher promotional costs, which were some of the oatmeal giveaways and discounting. We had higher utilities, a little higher depreciation, a little higher snowfall expense in the first couple of months. We saw most of these other expenses higher in those first two months of the quarter when the sales were a little bit softer. And we didn't have a benefit from re-franchising that we have the last several quarters. So predominantly, it was the change in food cost that was the biggest driver. Yet we had a lot of these other small items that accumulated to the impact."

Right now, the U.S. is focused, and you guys will see in the next, I'll say, in a short time, you'll see more innovation relative to smoothie drinks. I think you probably already know we probably talked about pineapple mango, and there's a strawberry lemonade coming out on the Beverage side we've got additional nugget promotions, we got the revamping of the chicken line up in terms of the sandwiches that are there, the whole nugget piece has been phenomenal for us and I know the U.S. is going to hit that again, along with the ongoing support in restaurant clearly off is and the return of the Asian salad. So those are some the things that you're going to see in a relatively short period of time. if you look a little longer out, there's a few products, actually quite a few products that the U.S. has in test and will have to wait and see which of these major markets, but everything from spicy chicken sandwiches, we have some of those across APMEA, the U.S. is looking at those quite intently. There's a smaller product called McBites, a snaking type product that we're testing over in Australia. Actually it's rolled out in the market in Australia now. The U.S. is looking at. Clearly, they're looking at some of the sandwiches like Chicken, Legend that we had in Europe is looking at the fruit, the  frappe and the smoothies so there's quite a few things that are in the pipeline now. We had a discussion with U.S. team lasted relative to the pipeline and it looks solid."

Yet recognize that food away from home is projected to be up 3% to 4% this year. And so that's what gives us the opportunity to get some price. So we're going to balance all that.

So whether it's the strategy around, what we're marketing in that particular month or if the things that Dan talked about, menu coming up throughout the year, some of those are standard process. So if you take value drinks for example, and proven ratio some of the new drinks, that's an annual thing, and particularly in the United States. And of course, we view the opportunity to add relevance for our consumers around all of these things. So whether it's increasing the marketing around a particular premium menu item or every day affordability and the balance around all of that, I think it's business as usual as we go through 2011 because not much has changed regarding the consumer in 2011. Consumer confidence took a dip in March. We're head gone up in February, and the unemployment just under 9% and there's certain things going on in the marketplace that would lead you to believe, as Pete mentioned, the consumer's spending is expected to be up, but not substantially different than how it looked at the business over the last couple of years.

First off, a National Hiring Day, the intent really for us was to be able to -- in a solid voice, be able to leverage the McDonald's strength to be able to put a callout in terms of employment. We thought it would be good for us as McDonald's. We do and have continue to hire through some of the economic downturns. But we also thought it will be a more unified weigh to get the message out that McDonald's is hiring. Our focus internally is on leveraging that labor to continue to help us grow the business. We've grown guest counts tremendously. And so we want to make share that we're able to provide the same level of operational excellence in the restaurants that we've been able to provide. Now relative to specific focal points, we are very focused on our peak hours and how we continue to build our business during the peak our guest count timeframe. So we'll leverage primarily labor for that. However, we're also extending and expanding in terms of our extended hours. So we're going to use the labor whenever we need them in the business. So that's what's happening with the national hiring day. Relatives to China, just came back from China. And I tell you, I was -- it's my third visit, and I was extremely impressed with our development strategies and certainly impressed with the talent. We've brought on some really outstanding new talent in the development arena. The training that we have going on right now as we accelerate for the new openings and we accelerate openings, has been phenomenal. And these restaurants have opened up. And I saw quite a few of them in my three days in China, both in Shanghai, Beijing and even Tianjin. We are opening restaurants that look great and are operating at very high levels. So to do that, we've got to train our teams, and we train them in existing restaurants. And so we have an accelerated pace there, which is really working out well. In terms of things we do that others don't do, I can't speak to all that others due. I will say this, Our 6.5% is based upon all so a tremendous guest down growth, not just taking price. And having said that, what that means is that we're building quite a bit of breakfast traffic, we're building quite a bit of lunch traffic with our value strategies. Back in November, we went over that strategy for one month and saw a little business dip. So we've gone right back to our value messaging around lunch and breakfast and it's paying great dividends. And so when we take pricing China, we will take pricing China have taken some price but not at the scale possibly of some others. So we're going to continue to stay focused on discount building."

I'm just wondering inflation gets higher, what the detail is behind that kind of investing in the margin. Would you be willing to go a whole lot closer to that 3% to 4% or would you be cautious about? And then the actual question I had just on the European market, entering 2011 it seem like everyone's focus was on a austerity measures and how that would negatively impact everyone there including yourselves. I mean, you are now running a 5% plus comp. So I'm just wondering is there anything you're seeing across the menu or across day parts or have you changed your promotional campaign.

U.K., for example, you know have the 2.5% transfer increase in some other austerity measures in the country, they run nearly double-digit comp for the quarter. Very strong sales momentum and guest count growth. And across Europe, the strategies have been very similar in the first quarter to what we had in 2010 and prior. Promotion of premium products, rotating food events, at the same time, hitting every day affordability with the equivalent of their dollar menus and their mid-Tier menus, its the fourth tier.

At this stage of the game, there was a time when we were actually behind in terms of the wage rate game, and we were trying to catch up. As you know, the Chinese government has determined that they wanted to double the wages by the year 2015. At this date, we're above, actually, we're double-digit above the actual wage rates now and the way that they're planning on increasing. Part of the reason for that is to be able to: One, get the right of people that have in the restaurants and the right talent. And so as we move through the year we don't see this -- what's happening is that we accelerate the size more quickly, we're training more people. At some point, we'll get to steady-state. But right now, we're accelerating our growth. We have in inventory and a pipeline to build a lot more sites. This year, we're targeted as we've said to do between 175 to 200 when I was there. I Had a chance to review many of those sites with them, and look at the trading areas surveys, fantastic sites that we have. The challenge in China and it's knot as much of challenges as it is a business planning piece and that is we're going to many of these preplan, master planned communities, about a year to 1.5 years ahead of time, so that we can get a good stable footing. So what we're seeing first year sales are little bit softer. So in also same double-digit comps, which is exactly what we've seen historically. And those comps remained strong in the third year. So the development strategy right, Sam, we can manage the margins relative to labor, and we're is a really good position. Some of you other folks in the marketplace, I tried to catch up to the position we're at, there will be another wage increase coming up soon in China. It will not impact us as much as it's going to impact others."

So getting the franchisees or a lare part of the system to follow the lead of the company was really easy. In the first quarter for the first time, this program was like using a little margin to take some market share actually required to use a little margin to take some market share. And now with some acceleration in the inflation outlook, what I worry about here is there's great opportunity to continue this market gains, seizing increasing inflation, will the franchisees follow believe you feel confident that they'll follow your lead and stay kind of below that Food Away from Home pricing level? Or have they started to push for maybe more pricing or some change in strategy? What's their response of the actual use of margin for the first time?"

Thanks for the question. First of all, I think it's very important to understand how much we collaborate with the leadership of the franchisee committee regarding our strategies everything from how we execute at the front counter and drive-thru operationally, customer satisfaction expectations and all the way through how we market to the market and how we communicate to the business, as well as what we've decide to do on everyday affordability, as I mentioned earlier. And that collaboration has served us so well over the last number of years, and they also understand one thing. We are in this business for the long-haul. So whether you're talking about China and some of the investment the margin to grow the business over time is a long-haul view. It's not a quarterly view. It's not a 12 month view. Our franchisees are in the business for the long haul and they are onboard relative to our strategies around this and maintenance guest growth. Not that doesn't mean that you don't have people out there that are stressing and concerned just like we are in the company. But for the most part, they follow the company lead on the pricing and the expectation. Company lead, meaning a McOpCo is not about we have in the game in this issue as well as we start thinking about taking margin most of the time, that is in regard to how we price in McOpCo. But the franchisees typically follow our leads regarding that. And I see nothing out there relative to where we find ourselves in the business today, which, yes, we've got some headwinds. But just like in another six months, we may have some tailwinds and our consistent approach relative to how we manage the business and collaborate with the franchisees over the long term is a great benefit to our growth as a business."

I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest quarterly results, which reflect the continued strength of our business. The first quarter worldwide comparable sales were up 4.2%. Operating income increased 7% in constant currencies, and EPS reached $1.15, a 12% increase in constant currencies. 
And our success continues to be a systemwide effort. In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter increased 2.9%, while operating income declined 2% as it was negatively impacted by a 4 percentage point decline on our operating gains against 2010. Comparable sales in Europe rose a healthy 5.7%, and operating income grew 12% in constant currencies. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, comp sales grew 3.2%, and operating income rose 18% in constant currencies. The 2010 charge for Japan's strategic restaurant closings benefited APMEA's 2011 growth rate by 12 percentage points and the consolidated growth rate by 2 percentage points. And our momentum is continuing into April with our global comparable sales trending in line or better than the first quarter.
These results were a testament to the continued relevance of our Plan to Win and its relentless focus on those 5 P's: people, products, place, price and promotion. 
Now the economic climate is still less than ideal, from a slow and uneven recovery to significantly rising commodity cost and fragile consumer confidence. But we continue to succeed by staying true to our proven plans and listening to concerns. We're elevating our business to meet their needs in a holistic way with attention paid to each 1 of the growth priorities under our Plan to Win:  optimizing the menu with right food and beverage offerings, modernizing the customer experience by upgrading every aspect of our restaurants from service to design and broadening our accessibility through continued convenience and value initiatives. 
Now it's not just 1 initiative but the combination of all of them that is driving our growth. This approach isn't revolutionary, it's evolutionary. We focus on improvements on top of an already strong and healthy base. The alignment of the McDonald's system around our global growth drivers and then scaling and executing against each of them is what will continue to grow our business and increase our market share. 
In the area of menu, we're delivering results by focusing on our core offerings, which drives the majority of our business. At the same time, we balance this with new food and beverage news around relevant products that our customers want. We're tapping into opportunities to further build key categories, from chicken and beef to beverages and breakfast, and we're already in a number of billion-dollar brands, as you know, to leverage along the way. And with the benefit of shared learnings from markets around the world, we will continue to deliver a strong global pipeline for today and into the future. 
In chicken, we've taken a well-known brand, McNuggets, and featured larger sharing portions with great success. In January, the United States drove double-digit sales increases in the product with their promotion of 20-piece McNuggets. While the U.K. launched the 20-piece ShareBox resulted in sales that were more than double in the initial projections. And Australia continued to see success with its popular new chicken bites,  a smaller bite-size chicken offering. And they're testing several oven-baked chicken offerings as part of our efforts to keep innovating in that category. 
Beef continues to provide opportunities with products like our iconic Big Mac and more recent additions like the Angus burger. Several markets celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Big Mac. And in France, the Double Cheeseburger continues to be a strong seller throughout the quarter. 
Line extensions and locally relevant limited time offers continue to drive gains across the system. Europe has been doing this with great success, and our other areas of the world are taking the learnings and applying them to grow their business. 
Japan hit the mark with its highly popular big America 2 burger campaign. In February, the U.S. entered the Chipotle and Bacon flavor to its line of Angus burger and Snack Wraps, which drove total Angus burger sales to their highest rate in nearly a years and increased total unit movement by more than 30%. And this month, Canada is launching its new line of Angus burgers.
U.S. is targeting additional opportunities for line extensions and limited time offerings in both beef and chicken as it explores the use of Artisan breads and a variety of toppings, and they're taking really a page out of Europe's playbook.
Turning to beverages, we're in the early stages of leveraging this platform around the world. In the U.S., the winter months helped to boost our growing line of hot McCafé offerings with sales of specialty coffees increasing 17% from a year ago. The U.S. will build on this momentum with the launch of a frozen strawberry lemonade in May along with the new unique smoothie flavor this summer and a re-hit of the popular value drinks. 
Beverages in the U.S. are a $146 billion business, and we have only scratched the surface on our opportunity there. Beverages are also important outside the United States. In China, we have more than 145 McCafés and in Europe, more than 1,350. And in other markets such as Canada and Australia, they're testing various products from the U.S. lineup of specialty coffees and blended ice drinks. 
Now let me wrap up the discussion on menu with breakfast. In the United States, food news from the quarter was the launch of Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, which you all heard about, which strengthened our overall nutritional profile and gave customers another great-tasting, high-quality option not only at breakfast but all day long.  And China and Japan, both made gains at breakfast through a combination of compelling value and focus on strong menu offerings.
Now regarding Japan, our thoughts continue to be with the Japanese people as they work to put their devastation behind them and rebuild their country. Our business in Japan was certainly impacted and continues to face some challenges, although the effect on our overall income, as you know,  is minor. Our foremost concern is to ensure the welfare of our people and then getting all of our restaurants back up and running.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the entire McDonald's system for its support and everyone on our Japan team for all they're doing to help their people, their country and their business.
So in addition to menu, we're driving gains by making our restaurants even better and more relevant for our guests. We're staying focused on improved service through training, technology and an unyielding commitment to operations excellence. All of this is helping to lift customer satisfaction scores across our system, especially in APMEA, with China and Japan continuing to lead the way in service and hospitality and Australia, which scored its highest customer satisfaction marks ever in January. 
In addition, more than 70% of our APMEA markets have increased their peak hour guest counts through optimized operations and capacity initiatives. U.S. and Europe also achieved higher customer satisfaction scores, and Europe continues to make our dining experience more convenient than ever. 
France and Southern Europe are equipping an additional 250 restaurants with saltwater kiosks to deliver a more convenient ordering experience, while the U.K. is bring a touch prepayment option to all of its 1,200 restaurants this summer, providing even greater speed and convenience for our customers. And the new, more user-friendly POS system that we've talked about is now in 7,500 restaurants across the U.S., and it's easing the job of our crew so they can spend more time on customer service. 
We're also continuing to ramp up our systemwide reimaging efforts, with all areas of the world focused on making our restaurants more contemporary and in tune with modern demands and tastes. Australia and Europe remained out in front on this effort with the U.S. making progress and planning to complete 600 reimages this year. In Europe, we're targeting 850 reimages and another 500 in Asia. We continue to see the desired results from our reimaging with improved perceptions of our brand and higher sales differentiating McDonald's from the rest. Our brand, our business and our operators are all strong, making this the perfect time to invest in our future. 
Finally, we're driving the business by continuing to make our brand more accessible and in step with how customers work and live. In the U.S., we're delivering greater convenience and accessibility through extended hours, which also continue to drive sales and guest counts. In APMEA, we're building on our convenience by advancing our dessert kiosks and delivery service in Korea as well as China, where each platform is achieving double-digit comp sales. And we're opening new restaurants in markets where the opportunity exists to strengthen penetration to expand our customer base including China and many countries in Asia, as well as Russia, France and Italy. 
Meanwhile, we remain committed to value across our menu as consumers everywhere continue to count on McDonald's for everyday brand and affordability. In the United States, our Dollar Menu at breakfast continues to be a strong traffic driver. Our Dollar Menu the rest of the day remains a consistent highly valued platform for our consumers. Across Europe, markets have put an emphasis on everyday affordability, like the U.K. Saver Menu and Little Tasters that give consumers a wider range of menu and price options. And in APMEA, value remains an important part of our business with our popular Value Lunch program driving strong results in numerous markets. 
Now those are a few highlights of how we have  maintained our strength into 2011 and how we'll continue to drive success. Executing all these drivers and building the business for the long term is achieved through our world-class owner/operators, suppliers, crew and staff. Together, we're committed to supporting the restaurants that serve our 64 million customers every day, whether it's through our training classes in Hamburger University, which is celebrating its 50th year or by hiring new employees to better serve our growing customer base as we did earlier this week in the United States and Canada during National Hiring Days. 
We also remain committed to our Plan to Win strategy as well as our philosophy of financial discipline and enhanced shareholder value. We continue to have a healthy balance sheet, the highest credit rating in the industry and a robust business that generated $6.3 billion in cash from operations in 2010. 
After reinvesting in the business, we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through our combination of dividends and share repurchase. And in the first quarter, we bought back 18.4  million shares totaling $1.4 billion and paid a dividend of $0.61 per share for an additional $635 million. 
Now overall, I am pleased by our first quarter performance. The fundamentals of our business remains strong, and our entire system is aligned behind our proven strategies in delivering the very best customer experience every time. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Pete Bensen."

Our Plan to Win strategy, with a balance across the 5 P's, continues to deliver higher sales and improved profitability. Against the backdrop of tentative and uneven improvement in the global economy, systemwide sales increas",1344,"Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Our Plan to Win strategy, with a balance across the 5 P's, continues to deliver higher sales and improved profitability. Against the backdrop of tentative and uneven improvement in the global economy, systemwide sales increased 6% in constant currency in the first quarter. 
Operating income reached $1.8 billion, up 7% in constant currencies, and combined operating margin reached 29.9%. The largest driver of operating income is our franchise margins, representing nearly 70% of consolidated restaurant margin dollars. Franchise margin dollars rose to $1.6 billion, an 8% increase in constant currencies with each area of the world contributing.  Consolidated franchise margin percent rose 70 basis points to 81.9% as positive comparable sales more than offset cost increases.
Before I turn to company operating margins, I wanted to provide some perspective on our updated commodity cost outlook and how we view pricing in relation to some of the increased pressures on margins.
Since January, the global commodity markets have experienced significant increases. As a result, we expect additional pressure as we move throughout the year, especially in the U.S. We are seeing cost increases on virtually every item in our basket, with beef accounting for about 1/3 of the additional increase. Reduced herd sizes, increased demand and a weaker U.S. dollar driving up exports are all contributing to the increase in beef costs. As a result, our U.S. grocery basket is now projected to be up about 4% to 4.5% for the year with greater pressure to be experienced in the second and third quarters. 
In Europe, our range of increase has narrowed as we now expect commodities to rise 4% to 4.5% this year. This is not significantly different from our previous guidance as many of the global factors impacting U.S. commodities are having a smaller impact in Europe. Our goal in managing our supply chain remains unchanged to maintain competitive and predictable pricing to the restaurants and ultimately to our customers. With our scale, infrastructure and relationships, we believe our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for the McDonald's system. 
Balancing cost pressures with menu pricing and market share growth is not new to our system. We have successfully managed this in the past and are confident we can do so again. Considering the current inflationary environment along with the strength of our business, we believe we have some pricing elasticity. We plan to offset some but not necessarily all of the inflationary pressures with price increases, opting to take smaller increases over the course of the year to balance the impact on the consumer and our traffic. We look to keep increases below the ""food away from home"" growth rate, while also being mindful of what's happening at the grocery stores. Our demand-based pricing tool will guide the system in making the best pricing decisions for the business.
Growing guest count and market share has been key to our success these past few years. Accordingly, in the current environment, we are willing to invest some margin in the short term to continue to grow our business for the long term. 
Each area of the world has taken some price in 2011. In the U.S., we took a 1% price increase in early March and will likely take additional increases during the year. Across Europe, we have also increased prices by about 1% in the first quarter. In addition, when the VAT increased in certain markets, additional increases were taken to cover the tax with no net benefit to sales. Further price increases, while likely, will be balanced amidst the many cost pressures and austerity environment in this region.
With that as a backdrop, let's discuss first quarter McOpCo margins. Global company operating margin dollars increased 4% in constant currencies to $736 million. Company-operated margin percent declined 50 basis points to 17.7%, reflecting positive comparable sales that were more than offset by higher commodity, labor and other costs. 
In the U.S., our basket of goods was up nearly 1% for the quarter. This increase, along with small increases in many other costs including labor, contributed to a 90 basis point decline in company-operated margins to 19.5%. Despite some of the near-term cost challenges, all of which are manageable, our U.S. business remains strong, and we continue to see market share growth.
Turning to Europe. The company-operated margins decreased 10 basis points to 17.2% as strong comparable sales mostly offset increased commodities and labor, including the increased social charges and Russia. Europe's grocery bill was up 3.7% in the quarter.
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins decreased 50 basis points to 17.5% primarily due to inflationary pressures in labor and commodities, partly offset by comparable sales growth. In addition, the acceleration of new restaurant openings in China is contributing to the lower margin percent as they initially experienced preopening and higher labor and training costs just like all other markets. China's new restaurant sales and margins then grows significantly over time.
We continue to get leverage on G&A spending, which rose about 2% in constant currencies. This increase was in line with our expectations, and we are on track for our full year G&A to decrease about 2% in constant currencies. Similar to what we have experienced the last few quarters, the earnings contribution from other operating income declined in the first quarter. With fewer affiliated restaurants and the majority of re-franchising gains behind us, we will not be recognizing the significant levels of income that we have in recent years. 
As indicated in our February sales release, the first quarter tax rate of 28.8% was lower than the full year guidance due to a non-recurring deferred tax benefit related to our foreign operations. Our guidance for the year remains 30% to 32%, implying the subsequent quarters' effective tax rates will be at the high end of our guidance.
We remain committed to building future returns and enhancing long-term shareholder value through growing our business by adding new units and driving same-store sales at existing restaurants. We are on track to open 1,100 new restaurants this year, with 156 opened in the first quarter including 40 in China.
Reimaging will be a key differentiator for our existing restaurants in the years to come. We see tremendous opportunity to update our asset base as only 20% of our exteriors and 45% of our interiors currently reflect a modern, contemporary look. This year, we plan to reimage another 7% of our restaurants for about 2,200 locations. We made good progress in the first quarter toward that goal. The U.S. completed almost 90 reimages and has over 60 sites under construction. We're on track to completing 600 this year and are expecting to do more in 2012.
Europe continues to lead our reimaging efforts, particularly its major markets. Over 70% of our interiors have been reimaged with the remainder to be reimaged by the end of 2012. About 40% of exteriors have been reimaged, so we'll take another few years to complete those. We completed 100 reimages in Europe in the first quarter.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which positively impacted first quarter results by $0.03. The U.S. dollar has recently weakened against most currencies, especially our 4 major currencies: the euro, pound, Australian and Canadian dollars. As a result, at current exchange rates, we expect second quarter EPS to be positively impacted by $0.06 to $0.07, with a full year benefit of $0.15 to $0.17. Please take this as directional only, because I know rates will change as we move throughout 2011.
McDonald's first quarter results are a testament to our system's focus on the customer and execution against the Plan to Win despite a volatile and unpredictable global environment. That focus and execution is yielding long-term value for our shareholders and our system. 
Looking ahead, our fundamentals are strong, our strategies are sound and our system is aligned. I'm confident our commitment to executing our plan will continue to deliver strong results.

Even iced coffee, I remember it was sneaky big as a driver. And of course, you've had some hits as recently as last summer. It even looks like the seasonality of this beverage sort of lift has been a key reason for your gap to the industry numbers being wider in the summer than they are in the winter. Do you see it this way? Is this something that you continue to believe will occur with summer beverages perhaps widening your gap again?"

And we're still focused on the McCafé hot beverages. We did hot Mocha last year. I think the team's doing a solid job of advertising those. On the cold side, very astute in terms of the question, but there's other weapons in the arsenal there. So not only frappes and smoothies, which were really, really big hits, to your point, iced coffee, but also, don't forget the entire ice -- or the cold beverage movement in terms of dollar drinks, which typically are across the summer months. And so we've got quite a bit going on with those cold beverages. The U.S. also has quite an inventory in the pipeline relative to looking at things that are upcoming like strawberry lemonade. We've got another smoothie flavor that's coming out this year. So we've been able to be very successful, and it has helped the business tremendously. However, we also want to make sure we continue to stay focused on the hot drinks. Lastly, on the hot drink side, also we can't forget that the predominance of hot drinks is in drip coffee. And so we have quite a lot of business, clearly, as we've gone from just -- if you look at overall beverages in terms of the McCafé, 2% several years ago when we talk to over 6% today."

And we haven't done another price increase since late 2009. So we had no benefit from pricing, essentially, in the quarter. We did have the food cost pressure. And compared to the first quarter last year, we had, let's say, 150 basis points of benefit from lower food costs. Here, we had a 40-basis-point drag from the higher food costs. And then every other line item it seemed was going just slightly negative. So we had a 10-point hit from labor and a 10-basis-point hit from higher promotional costs, which were some of the Oatmeal giveaways and discounting. We had higher utilities, a little higher depreciation, a little higher snow plowing those first couple of months. We saw most of these other expenses higher in those first 2 months of the quarter when the sales were a little bit softer, and we didn't have a benefit from re-franchising that we'd had the last several quarters. So predominantly, it was the change in food cost that was the biggest driver, yet we had a lot of these other small items that accumulated to the impact."

We've got the revamping of the chicken lineup in terms of the sandwiches that are there.

We're not going to change our strategy around what we deliver to consumer on value. That's #1. Everyday affordability is a mainstay at McDonald's strategy regarding the menu, and the combination of all of the things that I talked about this morning is how we deliver consumer relevance. So whether it's the strategy around what we're marketing in that particular month or if the things that Don talked about, menu coming up throughout the year, some of those are standard process. So if you take value drinks for example and the proliferation of some of the new drinks, that's an annual thing and particularly, in the United States. And of course, we view the opportunity to add relevance for our consumers around all of these things. And so whether it's increasing the marketing around a particular premium item or everyday affordability and the balance around all of that, I think it's business as usual as we go through 2011, because not much has changed regarding the consumer in 2011. Consumer confidence took a dip in March where it had gone up in February, and the unemployment's just under 9%. And there's certain things going on in the marketplace that would lead you to believe that, as Pete mentioned, the consumer spending is expected to be up but not substantially different than how we've looked at the business over the last couple of years. It's a mix, and it's a balance, and we're pretty good at it."

We thought it would be good for us as McDonald's. We do and have continued to hire through some of the economic downturns, but we also thought it would be a more unified way to get the message out that McDonald's is hiring. Our focus internally is on leveraging that labor to continue to help us grow the business. We've grown guest counts tremendously. And so we want to make share that we're able to provide the same level of operational excellence in the restaurants that we've been able to provide. Now relative to specific focal points, we are very focused on our peak hours and how we continue to build our business during the peak-hour guest count timeframe. So we'll leverage, primarily, labor for that. However, we're also extending and expanding in terms of our extended hours. So we're going to use the labor wherever we need it in the business. So that's what's happening with the National Hiring Days. Relative to China -- just came back from China. And I tell you, I was -- it's my third visit, and I was extremely impressed with our development strategies and extremely impressed with the talent we've brought on, some really outstanding new talent in the development arena. The training that we have going on right now as we accelerate for the new openings and we accelerate openings has been phenomenal. And these restaurants have opened up, and I saw quite a few of them in my 3 days in China, both in Shanghai, Beijing and even Tianjin. We are opening restaurants that look great and are operating at very high levels. So to do that, we've got to train our teams, and we train them in existing restaurants. And so we have an accelerated pace there, which is really working out well. In terms of things we do that others don't do, I can't speak to all that others do. I will say this: our 6.5% is based upon also a tremendous guest count growth not just taking price. And having said that, what that means is that we are building quite a bit of breakfast traffic. We're building quite a bit of lunch traffic with our value strategies. Back in November, we went to offer that strategy for 1 month and saw a little business dip. So we've gone right back to our value messaging around lunch and breakfast, and it's paying great dividends. And so will we take price in China? We will take price in China, have taken some price but not at the scale, possibly, of some others. And so we're going to continue to stay focused on guest count building."

Clarification relates to the discussion on margins, and I think you said you got to make a conscious decision to invest some margin in the short term to grow the business in the long term. And as it relates to the U.S., it seems like you're running 1% of pricing now. You mentioned being cognizant in the food away from home being at 3% to 4%. So I'm just wondering, as inflation gets higher, what the detail is behind that kind of investing in the margin. Would you be willing to go a whole lot closer to that 3% to 4%? Or would you be cautious of that? And then the extra question is just on the European market. Entering 2011, it seemed like everyone's focus was on austerity measures and how that would negatively impact everyone there including yourselves. Meanwhile, you're now running a 5% plus comp. So I'm just wondering is there anything you're seeing across the menu or across day parts. Or have you changed your promotional campaign? It just seems like -- just any color in terms of how you've been able to put up those type numbers, whether there's more and less resilient type markets. Any kind of color would be great.

So we're going to continue to watch that as we move throughout the year. It's 1 of the inputs to our pricing. This is really more of an art than it is a science, but it definitely is an input that we're going to keep an eye on, as well as, like I said, what's happening at grocery stores and food at home and gas prices and some of those other things. But it will be a guide for us as we move throughout the year. Regarding Europe, we have not seen any significant change in consumer behavior as a result of some of the austerity measures going on. U.K., for example, they had the 2.5% VAT increase and some other austerity measures in the country. They ran nearly a double-digit comp for the quarter, very strong sales momentum and guest count growth. And across Europe, the strategies have been very similar in the first quarter to what we had in 2010 and prior: promotion of premium products, rotating food events at the same time, hitting everyday affordability with the equivalent of their Dollar Menus and their mid-tier menus, the fourth tier. It's been, again, a combination that has been relatively consistent this first quarter relative to 2010, and we're cautiously optimistic that, that environment will continue for us."

At this date, we're above -- actually, we're double digit above the actual wage rates now and the way that they're planning on increasing. Part of the reason for that is to be able to: 1, get the kind of people that we want to have in the restaurants and the right talent. And so as we move through the year, we don't see this -- what's happening is as we accelerate the sites, clearly, we're training more people. At some point, we'll get to a steady state, but right now, we're accelerating our growth. We have an inventory and a pipeline to build a lot more sites. This year, we're targeted, as we've said, to do between 175 to 200. When I was there, I had a chance to review many of those sites with them and look at the trading area surveys, fantastic sites that we have. The challenge in China -- and it's knot as much a challenge as it is really a business planning piece. And that is we going into many of these preplanned master plan communities about a year to 1.5 years ahead of time so that we can get a good, stable footing. So what we're seeing is -- so our first year sales are a little softer. Second year sales, we're seeing double-digit comps, which is exactly what we've seen historically, and those comps remain strong in the third year. So the development strategy right now is how we can manage the margins relative to labor, and we're in a really good position. Some of the other folks in the marketplace are trying to catch up to the position we're at. There will be another wage increase coming up soon in China.

So whether you're talking about China and some investment in the margin to grow the business over time, it's a long-haul view. It's not a quarterly view. It's not a 12-month view. Our franchisees are in the business for the long haul, and they are onboard relative to our strategies around this and maintaining guest count growth. Now that doesn't mean that you don't have people out there that are stressing and concerned just like we are in the company. But for the most part, they follow the company lead on the pricing and the expectation, company lead, meaning McOpCo. It's not about -- we have skin in the game in this issue as well. As we start thinking about taking margin, most of the time, that is in regard to how we price in McOpCo, but the franchisees typically follow our lead regarding that. And I see nothing out there relative to where we find ourselves in the business today, which -- yes, we've got some headwinds, but just like in another 6 months, we may have some tailwinds. And our consistent approach relative to how we manage the business and collaborate with the franchisees over the long term is a great benefit to our growth as a business."

There's a standing value team as a part of our APMEA organization. They continue to look at pricing on our value menus, margin, operating cash flow in the restaurants. We also have a supply chain management collaboration with the franchisees. So they're up to speed on this ramp-up in terms of commodities. As it ramps up, those teams will give feedback to the overall system, and that's in conjunction with our own folks. So these are not once-every-quarter meetings. These folks are meeting on a routine and a frequent basis. Also, our cash flows have been strong. This is not the first time we've been through this, 2007, part of it, 2008. We've seen commodity stresses and pressures before. Each time we have, we've gotten together to focus on what are the most critical things to make sure we manage the business for the long term. So these are some more commodity pressures, but to Pete's point, it was the same thing we saw -- we're at the same level that we were in 2009."

And that was a mistake, and we don't do it that way. The modernization of our restaurants really does not give us additional pricing power on the menu. And we do it because our restaurants either need to be re-modernized, or they're going to be built in a contemporary manner, but it has little to do with overall pricing power."

Our pricing elasticity in the brand moves up and down based on inflation, consumer spending, consumer confidence, all of those things that we have talked about many times before, and we're not worried. We have the capability to take price over this next number of months in the U.S., as Pete and Don have talked about. It's just a matter of timing and when it makes the most sense for us, always keeping an ever vigilant eye on everyday affordability, which is the most important thing for our consumers. I've said it many times before. They get pinched everywhere. They should not suffer the same fate at McDonald's. So this look that we have at food away from home and even food at home and paying attention to that relative to the long-term credibility with our customers and pricing. It's the most important thing that we do. And so the answer is no, we're not worried about that elasticity or that pricing power. We're -- but we're -- what we pay very close attention to it in the overall mix of how we decide to price going forward. And we never pass on directly all of our cost to the customers."

I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest quarterly results, which reflect the continued strength of our business. The first quarter worldwide comparable sales were up 4.2%. Operating income increased 7% in constant currencies, and EPS reached $1.15, a 12% increase in constant currencies. 
And our success continues to be a systemwide effort. In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter increased 2.9%, while operating income declined 2% as it was negatively impacted by a 4 percentage point decline on our operating gains against 2010. Comparable sales in Europe rose a healthy 5.7%, and operating income grew 12% in constant currencies. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, comp sales grew 3.2%, and operating income rose 18% in constant currencies. The 2010 charge for Japan's strategic restaurant closings benefited APMEA's 2011 growth rate by 12 percentage points and the consolidated growth rate by 2 percentage points. And our momentum is continuing into April with our global comparable sales trending in line or better than the first quarter.
These results are a testament to the continued relevance of our Plan to Win and its relentless focus on those five P's: people, products, place, price and promotion. 
Now the economic climate is still less than ideal, from a slow and uneven recovery to significantly rising commodity costs and fragile consumer confidence. But we continue to succeed by staying true to our proven plans and listening to consumers. We're elevating our business to meet their needs in a holistic way with attention paid to each 1 of the growth priorities under our Plan to Win:  optimizing the menu with right food and beverage offerings, modernizing the customer experience by upgrading every aspect of our restaurants from service to design and broadening our accessibility through continued convenience and value initiatives. 
Now it's not just 1 initiative but the combination of all of them that is driving our growth. This approach isn't revolutionary, it's evolutionary. We focus on improvements on top of an already strong and healthy base. The alignment of the McDonald's system around our global growth drivers and then scaling and executing against each of them is what will continue to grow our business and increase our market share. 
In the area of menu, we're delivering results by focusing on our core offerings, which drives the majority of our business. At the same time, we balance this with new food and beverage news around relevant products that our customers want. We're tapping into opportunities to further build key categories, from chicken and beef to beverages and breakfast, and we're already in a number of billion-dollar brands, as you know, to leverage along the way. And with the benefit of shared learnings from markets around the world, we will continue to deliver a strong global pipeline for today and into the future. 
In chicken, we've taken a well-known brand, McNuggets, and featured larger sharing portions with great success. In January, the United States drove double-digit sales increases in the product with their promotion of 20-piece McNuggets. While the U.K. launched the 20-piece ShareBox resulted in sales that were more than double in the initial projections. And Australia continued to see success with its popular new chicken bites,  a smaller bite-size chicken offering. And they're testing several oven-baked chicken offerings as part of our efforts to keep innovating in that category. 
Beef continues to provide opportunities with products like our iconic Big Mac and more recent additions like the Angus burger. Several markets celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Big Mac. And in France, the Double Cheeseburger continues to be a strong seller throughout the quarter. 
Line extensions and locally relevant limited time offers continue to drive gains across the system. Europe has been doing this with great success, and our other areas of the world are taking the learnings and applying them to grow their business. 
Japan hit the mark with its highly popular Big America 2 burger campaign. In February, the U.S. entered the Chipotle and Bacon flavor to its line of Angus burger and Snack Wraps, which drove total Angus burger sales to their highest rate in nearly a years and increased total unit movement by more than 30%. And this month, Canada is launching its new line of Angus burgers.
U.S. is targeting additional opportunities for line extensions and limited time offerings in both beef and chicken as it explores the use of Artisan breads and a variety of toppings, and they're taking really a page out of Europe's playbook.
Turning to beverages, we're in the early stages of leveraging this platform around the world. In the U.S., the winter months helped to boost our growing line of hot McCafé offerings with sales of specialty coffees increasing 17% from a year ago. The U.S. will build on this momentum with the launch of a frozen strawberry lemonade in May along with the new unique smoothie flavor this summer and a re-hit of the popular value drinks. 
Beverages in the U.S. are a $146 billion business, and we have only scratched the surface on our opportunity there. Beverages are also important outside the United States. In China, we have more than 145 McCafés and in Europe, more than 1,350. And in other markets such as Canada and Australia, they're testing various products from the U.S. lineup of specialty coffees and blended ice drinks. 
Now let me wrap up the discussion on menu with breakfast. In the United States, food news from the quarter was the launch of Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, which you all heard about, which strengthened our overall nutritional profile and gave customers another great-tasting, high-quality option not only at breakfast but all day long.  And China and Japan, both made gains at breakfast through a combination of compelling value and focus on strong menu offerings.
Now regarding Japan, our thoughts continue to be with the Japanese people as they work to put their devastation behind them and rebuild their country. Our business in Japan was certainly impacted and continues to face some challenges, although the effect on our overall income, as you know,  is minor. Our foremost concern is to ensure the welfare of our people and then getting all of our restaurants back up and running.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the entire McDonald's system for its support and everyone on our Japan team for all they're doing to help their people, their country and their business.
So in addition to menu, we're driving gains by making our restaurants even better and more relevant for our guests. We're staying focused on improved service through training, technology and an unyielding commitment to operations excellence. All of this is helping to lift customer satisfaction scores across our system, especially in APMEA, with China and Japan continuing to lead the way in service and hospitality and Australia, which scored its highest customer satisfaction marks ever in January. 
In addition, more than 70% of our APMEA markets have increased their peak hour guest counts through optimized operations and capacity initiatives. U.S. and Europe also achieved higher customer satisfaction scores, and Europe continues to make our dining experience more convenient than ever. 
France and Southern Europe are equipping an additional 250 restaurants with self order kiosks to deliver a more convenient ordering experience, while the U.K. is bring a touch prepayment option to all of its 1,200 restaurants this summer, providing even greater speed and convenience for our customers. And the new, more user-friendly POS system that we've talked about is now in 7,500 restaurants across the U.S., and it's easing the job of our crew so they can spend more time on customer service. 
We're also continuing to ramp up our systemwide reimaging efforts, with all areas of the world focused on making our restaurants more contemporary and in tune with modern demands and tastes. Australia and Europe remained out in front on this effort with the U.S. making progress and planning to complete 600 reimages this year. In Europe, we're targeting 850 reimages and another 500 in Asia. We continue to see the desired results from our reimaging with improved perceptions of our brand and higher sales differentiating McDonald's from the rest. Our brand, our business and our operators are all strong, making this the perfect time to invest in our future. 
Finally, we're driving the business by continuing to make our brand more accessible and in step with how customers work and live. In the U.S., we're delivering greater convenience and accessibility through extended hours, which also continue to drive sales and guest counts. In APMEA, we're building on our convenience by advancing our dessert kiosks and delivery service in Korea as well as China, where each platform is achieving double-digit comp sales. And we're opening new restaurants in markets where the opportunity exists to strengthen penetration to expand our customer base including China and many countries in Asia, as well as Russia, France and Italy. 
Meanwhile, we remain committed to value across our menu as consumers everywhere continue to count on McDonald's for everyday brand and affordability. In the United States, our Dollar Menu at breakfast continues to be a strong traffic driver. Our Dollar Menu the rest of the day remains a consistent highly valued platform for our consumers. Across Europe, markets have put an emphasis on everyday affordability, like the U.K. Saver Menu and Little Tasters that give consumers a wider range of menu and price options. And in APMEA, value remains an important part of our business with our popular Value Lunch program driving strong results in numerous markets. 
Now those are a few highlights of how we have  maintained our strength into 2011 and how we'll continue to drive success. Executing all these drivers and building the business for the long term is achieved through our world-class owner/operators, suppliers, crew and staff. Together, we're committed to supporting the restaurants that serve our 64 million customers every day, whether it's through our training classes in Hamburger University, which is celebrating its 50th year or by hiring new employees to better serve our growing customer base as we did earlier this week in the United States and Canada during National Hiring Days. 
We also remain committed to our Plan to Win strategy as well as our philosophy of financial discipline and enhanced shareholder value. We continue to have a healthy balance sheet, the highest credit rating in the industry and a robust business that generated $6.3 billion in cash from operations in 2010. 
After reinvesting in the business, we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through our combination of dividends and share repurchase. And in the first quarter, we bought back 18.4  million shares totaling $1.4 billion and paid a dividend of $0.61 per share for an additional $635 million. 
Now overall, I am pleased by our first quarter performance. The fundamentals of our business remains strong, and our entire system is aligned behind our proven strategies in delivering the very best customer experience every time. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Pete Bensen."

Our Plan to Win strategy, with a balance across the five Ps, continues to deliver higher sales and improved profitability.

Our Plan to Win strategy, with a balance across the five Ps, continues to deliver higher sales and improved profitability. Against the backdrop of tentative and uneven improvement in the global economy, systemwide sales increased 6% in constant currency in the first quarter. 
Operating income reached $1.8 billion, up 7% in constant currencies, and combined operating margin reached 29.9%. The largest driver of operating income is our franchise margins, representing nearly 70% of consolidated restaurant margin dollars. Franchise margin dollars rose to $1.6 billion, an 8% increase in constant currencies with each area of the world contributing.  Consolidated franchise margin percent rose 70 basis points to 81.9% as positive comparable sales more than offset cost increases.
Before I turn to company operating margins, I wanted to provide some perspective on our updated commodity cost outlook and how we view pricing in relation to some of the increased pressures on margins.
Since January, the global commodity markets have experienced significant increases. As a result, we expect additional pressure as we move throughout the year, especially in the U.S. We are seeing cost increases on virtually every item in our basket, with beef accounting for about 1/3 of the additional increase. Reduced herd sizes, increased demand and a weaker U.S. dollar driving up exports are all contributing to the increase in beef costs. As a result, our U.S. grocery basket is now projected to be up about 4% to 4.5% for the year with greater pressure to be experienced in the second and third quarters. 
In Europe, our range of increase has narrowed as we now expect commodities to rise 4% to 4.5% this year. This is not significantly different from our previous guidance as many of the global factors impacting U.S. commodities are having a smaller impact in Europe. Our goal in managing our supply chain remains unchanged to maintain competitive and predictable pricing to the restaurants and ultimately to our customers. With our scale, infrastructure and relationships, we believe our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for the McDonald's system. 
Balancing cost pressures with menu pricing and market share growth is not new to our system. We have successfully managed this in the past and are confident we can do so again. Considering the current inflationary environment along with the strength of our business, we believe we have some pricing elasticity. We plan to offset some but not necessarily all of the inflationary pressures with price increases, opting to take smaller increases over the course of the year to balance the impact on the consumer and our traffic. We look to keep increases below the ""food away from home"" growth rate, while also being mindful of what's happening at the grocery stores. Our demand-based pricing tool will guide the system in making the best pricing decisions for the business.
Growing guest count and market share has been key to our success these past few years. Accordingly, in the current environment, we are willing to invest some margin in the short term to continue to grow our business for the long term. 
Each area of the world has taken some price in 2011. In the U.S., we took a 1% price increase in early March and will likely take additional increases during the year. Across Europe, we have also increased prices by about 1% in the first quarter. In addition, when the VAT increased in certain markets, additional increases were taken to cover the tax with no net benefit to sales. Further price increases, while likely, will be balanced amidst the many cost pressures and austerity environment in this region.
With that as a backdrop, let's discuss first quarter McOpCo margins. Global company operating margin dollars increased 4% in constant currencies to $736 million. Company-operated margin percent declined 50 basis points to 17.7%, reflecting positive comparable sales that were more than offset by higher commodity, labor and other costs. 
In the U.S., our basket of goods was up nearly 1% for the quarter. This increase, along with small increases in many other costs including labor, contributed to a 90 basis point decline in company-operated margins to 19.5%. Despite some of the near-term cost challenges, all of which are manageable, our U.S. business remains strong, and we continue to see market share growth.
Turning to Europe. The company-operated margins decreased 10 basis points to 17.2% as strong comparable sales mostly offset increased commodities and labor, including the increased social charges and Russia. Europe's grocery bill was up 3.7% in the quarter.
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins decreased 50 basis points to 17.5% primarily due to inflationary pressures in labor and commodities, partly offset by comparable sales growth. In addition, the acceleration of new restaurant openings in China is contributing to the lower margin percent as they initially experienced preopening and higher labor and training costs just like all other markets. China's new restaurant sales and margins then grows significantly over time.
We continue to get leverage on G&A spending, which rose about 2% in constant currencies. This increase was in line with our expectations, and we are on track for our full year G&A to decrease about 2% in constant currencies. Similar to what we have experienced the last few quarters, the earnings contribution from other operating income declined in the first quarter. With fewer affiliated restaurants and the majority of re-franchising gains behind us, we will not be recognizing the significant levels of income that we have in recent years. 
As indicated in our February sales release, the first quarter tax rate of 28.8% was lower than the full year guidance due to a non-recurring deferred tax benefit related to our foreign operations. Our guidance for the year remains 30% to 32%, implying the subsequent quarters' effective tax rates will be at the high end of our guidance.
We remain committed to building future returns and enhancing long-term shareholder value through growing our business by adding new units and driving same-store sales at existing restaurants. We are on track to open 1,100 new restaurants this year, with 156 opened in the first quarter including 40 in China.
Reimaging will be a key differentiator for our existing restaurants in the years to come. We see tremendous opportunity to update our asset base as only 20% of our exteriors and 45% of our interiors currently reflect a modern, contemporary look. This year, we plan to reimage another 7% of our restaurants or about 2,200 locations. We made good progress in the first quarter toward that goal. The U.S. completed almost 90 reimages and has over 60 sites under construction. We're on track to completing 600 this year and are expecting to do more in 2012.
Europe continues to lead our reimaging efforts, particularly its major markets. Over 70% of our interiors have been reimaged with the remainder to be reimaged by the end of 2012. About 40% of exteriors have been reimaged, so we'll take another few years to complete those. We completed 100 reimages in Europe in the first quarter.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which positively impacted first quarter results by $0.03. The U.S. dollar has recently weakened against most currencies, especially our four major currencies: the euro, pound, Australian and Canadian dollars. As a result, at current exchange rates, we expect second quarter EPS to be positively impacted by $0.06 to $0.07, with a full year benefit of $0.15 to $0.17. Please take this as directional only, because I know rates will change as we move throughout 2011.
McDonald's first quarter results are a testament to our system's focus on the customer and execution against the Plan to Win despite a volatile and unpredictable global environment. That focus and execution is yielding long-term value for our shareholders and our system. 
Looking ahead, our fundamentals are strong, our strategies are sound and our system is aligned. I'm confident our commitment to executing our plan will continue to deliver strong results.

And we're still focused on the McCafé hot beverages. We did hot Mocha last year. I think the team's doing a solid job of advertising those. On the cold side, very astute in terms of the question, but there's other weapons in the arsenal there. So not only frappes and smoothies, which were really, really big hits, to your point, iced coffee, but also, don't forget the entire ice -- or the cold beverage movement in terms of dollar drinks, which typically are across the summer months. And so we've got quite a bit going on with those cold beverages. The U.S. also has quite an inventory in the pipeline relative to looking at things that are upcoming like strawberry lemonade. We've got another smoothie flavor that's coming out this year. So we've been able to be very successful, and it has helped the business tremendously. However, we also want to make sure we continue to stay focused on the hot drinks. Lastly, on the hot drink side, also we can't forget that the predominance of hot drinks is in drip coffee. And so we have quite a lot of business, clearly, as we've gone from just -- if you look at overall beverages in terms of the McCafé, 2% several years ago when we talk to over 6% today."

And we hadn't done another price increase since late 2009. So we had no benefit from pricing, essentially, in the quarter. We did have the food cost pressure. And compared to the first quarter last year, we had, let's say, 150 basis points of benefit from lower food costs. Here, we had a 40-basis-point drag from the higher food costs. And then every other line item it seemed was going just slightly negative. So we had a 10-point hit from labor and a 10-basis-point hit from higher promotional costs, which were some of the Oatmeal giveaways and discounting. We had higher utilities, a little higher depreciation, a little higher snow plowing expense those first couple of months. We saw most of these other expenses higher in those first 2 months of the quarter when the sales were a little bit softer, and we didn't have a benefit from refranchising that we'd had the last several quarters. So predominantly, it was the change in food cost that was the biggest driver, yet we had a lot of these other small items that accumulated to the impact."

We've got the revamping of the chicken lineup in terms of the sandwiches that are there.

If you look a little longer out, there's a few products, actually quite a few products, that the U.S. has in test, and we'll have to wait to see which of these make it to market. But everything from spicy chicken sandwiches -- we have some of those across APMEA. The U.S. is looking at those quite intently. There's a smaller product called McBites, a snacking-type product that we're testing over in Australia. Actually, it's rolled out in the market in Australia now. The U.S. is looking at it.

But you've hit on the things we're focused on, which is what is going to be the price increase and how to best manage the costs. But at the same time, as I did mention, in this environment, the last few years, we've been very successful at driving guest counts, and we don't want to do anything on the pricing side that's going to dramatically change that, yet recognize that food away from home is projected to be up 3% to 4% this year.

So if you take value drinks for example and the proliferation of some of the new drinks, that's an annual thing and particularly, in the United States. And of course, we view the opportunity to add relevance for our consumers around all of these things. And so whether it's increasing the marketing around a particular premium item or everyday affordability and the balance around all of that, I think it's business as usual as we go through 2011, because not much has changed regarding the consumer in 2011. Consumer confidence took a dip in March where it had gone up in February, and the unemployment's just under 9%.

We",488,"Sara, first off, on National Hiring Day, the intent really for us was to be able to -- in a solid voice, be able to leverage the McDonald's strength to be able to put a call out in terms of employment. We thought it would be good for us as McDonald's. We do and have continued to hire through some of the economic downturns, but we also thought it would be a more unified way to get the message out that McDonald's is hiring. Our focus internally is on leveraging that labor to continue to help us grow the business. We've grown guest counts tremendously. And so we want to make share that we're able to provide the same level of operational excellence in the restaurants that we've been able to provide. Now relative to specific focal points, we are very focused on our peak hours and how we continue to build our business during the peak-hour guest count timeframe. So we'll leverage, primarily, labor for that. However, we're also extending and expanding in terms of our extended hours. So we're going to use the labor wherever we need it in the business. So that's what's happening with the National Hiring Days. Relative to China -- just came back from China. And I tell you, I was -- it's my third visit, and I was extremely impressed with our development strategies and extremely impressed with the talent we've brought on, some really outstanding new talent in the development arena. The training that we have going on right now as we accelerate for the new openings and we accelerate openings has been phenomenal. And these restaurants have opened up, and I saw quite a few of them in my 3 days across China, both in Shanghai, Beijing and even Tianjin. We are opening restaurants that look great and are operating at very high levels. So to do that, we've got to train our teams, and we train them in existing restaurants. And so we have an accelerated pace there, which is really working out well. In terms of things we do that others don't do, I can't speak to all that others do. I will say this: our 6.5% is based upon also a tremendous guest count growth not just taking price. And having said that, what that means is that we are building quite a bit of breakfast traffic. We're building quite a bit of lunch traffic with our value strategies. Back in November, we went to off of that strategy for 1 month and saw a little business dip. So we've gone right back to our value messaging around lunch and breakfast, and it's paying great dividends. And so will we take price in China? We will take price in China, have taken some price but not at the scale, possibly, of some others. And so we're going to continue to stay focused on guest count building."

Pete, just 1 clarification on your earlier comment and then a separate question. Clarification relates to the discussion on margins, and I think you said you got to make a conscious decision to invest some margin in the short term to grow the business in the long term. And as it relates to the U.S., it seems like you're running 1% of pricing now. You mentioned being cognizant in the food away from home being at 3% to 4%. So I'm just wondering, as inflation gets higher, what the detail is behind that kind of investing in the margin. Would you be willing to go a whole lot closer to that 3% to 4%? Or would you be cautious of that? And then the extra question is just on the European market. Entering 2011, it seemed like everyone's focus was on austerity measures and how that would negatively impact everyone there including yourselves. Meanwhile, you're now running a 5% plus comp. So I'm just wondering is there anything you're seeing across the menu or across day parts. Or have you changed your promotional campaign? It just seems like -- just any color in terms of how you've been able to put up those type numbers, whether there's more and less resilient type markets. Any kind of color would be great.

So we're going to continue to watch that as we move throughout the year. It's 1 of the inputs to our pricing. This is really more of an art than it is a science, but it definitely is an input that we're going to keep an eye on, as well as, like I said, what's happening at grocery stores and food at home and gas prices and some of those other things. But it will be a guide for us as we move throughout the year. Regarding Europe, we have not seen any significant change in consumer behavior as a result of some of the austerity measures going on. U.K., for example, they had the 2.5% VAT increase and some other austerity measures in the country. They ran nearly a double-digit comp for the quarter, very strong sales momentum and guest count growth. And across Europe, the strategies have been very similar in the first quarter to what we had in 2010 and prior: promotion of premium products, rotating food events, at the same time hitting everyday affordability with the equivalent of their Dollar Menus and their mid-tier menus, the fourth tier. It's been, again, a combination that has been relatively consistent this first quarter relative to 2010, and we're cautiously optimistic that, that environment will continue for us."

It's been all of these factors that have impacted, to a significant degree in the course of just 3 months, virtually every item in our basket. So our supply chain had great visibility into matters at the time when they gave the forecast, and several significant things have happened, none to offset.

At this date, we're above -- actually, we're double digit above the actual wage rates now and the way that they're planning on increasing. Part of the reason for that is to be able to: 1, get the kind of people that we want to have in the restaurants and the right talent. And so as we move through the year, we don't see this -- what's happening is as we accelerate the sites, clearly, we're training more people. At some point, we'll get to a steady state, but right now, we're accelerating our growth. We have an inventory and a pipeline to build a lot more sites. This year, we're targeted, as we've said, to do between 175 to 200. When I was there, I had a chance to review many of those sites with them and look at the trading area surveys, fantastic sites that we have. The challenge in China -- and it's not as much a challenge as it is really a business planning piece. And that is we go into many of these preplanned master plan communities about a year to 1.5 years ahead of time so that we can get a good, stable footing. So what we're seeing is -- so our first year sales are a little softer. Second year sales, we're seeing double-digit comps, which is exactly what we've seen historically, and those comps remain strong in the third year. So the development strategy right now is how we can manage the margins relative to labor, and we're in a really good position. Some of the other folks in the marketplace are trying to catch up to the position we're at. There will be another wage increase coming up soon in China. It will not impact us as much as it's going to impact others."

And that collaboration has served us so well over the last number of years, and they also understand 1 thing: we are in this business for the long haul. So whether you're talking about China and some investment in the margin to grow the business over time, it's a long-haul view. It's not a quarterly view. It's not a 12-month view. Our franchisees are in the business for the long haul, and they are onboard relative to our strategies around this and maintaining guest count growth. Now that doesn't mean that you don't have people out there that are stressing and concerned just like we are in the company. But for the most part, they follow the company lead on the pricing and the expectation, company lead, meaning McOpCo. It's not about -- we have skin in the game in this issue as well. As we start thinking about taking margin, most of the time, that is in regard to how we price in McOpCo, but the franchisees typically follow our lead regarding that. And I see nothing out there relative to where we find ourselves in the business today, which -- yes, we've got some headwinds, but just like in another 6 months, we may have some tailwinds.

And I go back to many, many years ago when we used to think that because we had a modernized restaurant, that because we had ferns and grass that we could take an extra $0.05 in the big sandwiches or do whatever, because our customers would understand because of that wonderful environment that they're in that they ought to pay more for the sandwich. And that was a mistake, and we don't do it that way. The modernization of our restaurants really does not give us additional pricing power on the menu. And we do it because our restaurants either need to be re-modernized, or they're going to be built in a contemporary manner, but it has little to do with overall pricing power."

So we're going to continue to combine those, and the chefs are working on other blended drinks there.

And so I didn't mean to say that we don't have opportunity to grow the business. But it doesn't reflect directly on our ability to tell someone, ""Well, look. You're in a reimaged restaurant now so we get to price -- raise the prices."" Our pricing elasticity in the brand moves up and down based on inflation, consumer spending, consumer confidence, all of those things that we have talked about many times before, and we're not worried. We have the capability to take price over this next number of months in the U.S., as Pete and Don have talked about. It's just a matter of timing and when it makes the most sense for us, always keeping an ever vigilant eye on everyday affordability, which is the most important thing for our consumers. I've said it many times before. They get pinched everywhere. They should not suffer the same fate at McDonald's. So this look that we have at food away from home and even food at home and paying attention to that relative to the long-term credibility with our customers and pricing. It's the most important thing that we do. And so the answer is no, we're not worried about that elasticity or that pricing power. We're -- but we're -- what we pay very close attention to it in the overall mix of how we decide to price going forward. And we never pass on directly all of our costs to the customers."

I'm pleased to share our latest business results, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, global comparable sales were up 5.6%.

I'm pleased to share our latest business results, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, global comparable sales were up 5.6%. Operating income increased 11% in constant currencies and EPS reached $1.35, an 11% increase in constant currencies. We also returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. 
Our momentum continues, which allow global comparable Series expected to be about 4% to 5%. Our performance is broad-based. We continue to grow share in every area of the world sales despite an informal eating out market that remains relatively flat overall. 
Now that we have an opportunity to spend time in many of our major markets around the world over the past several months, and I'm pleased to say that we're focused on taking our business to the next level. The system is aligned around 3 global growth priorities that support our Plan to Win, and we're confident that our emphasis on optimizing and evolving our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our planned will continue to move our business forward.
Now when it comes to optimizing and evolving the menu, we're leveraging our iconic but products in Billion Dollar brands, for innovating in key menu categories like Beverages and Chicken, and we're elevating our food image around the world. 
Our second priority, which is modernizing the customer experience is really all about improving both how our restaurants look and feel, and how they operate. We keep looking for ways to create efficiencies and build capacity so that we can accommodate our continued guest count growth. 
In addition to reimaging our restaurants, we're leveraging technology to enhance the customer experience and make the jobs and of our managers and crew easier. For example, innovations like our new point-of-sale system and self order kiosks, enable restaurant employees to focus on what matters most, the customer experience at what we call the moment of truth. 
Our third priority, which is broadening accessibility to our brand, is about driving growth through value and convenience. You see, to us, value means a great customer experience delivered at a great price so that our customers get the biggest bang for their buck, their yen, euro or pound. 
The second component of accessibility, which is convenience, is about daypart expansion and continuing to open new restaurants when and where appropriate. Ensuring our plans focus on these 3 global priorities enables our team to be more effective in terms of integrating and aligning our initiatives under the Plan to Win. This is particularly important as we execute against our biggest opportunity by leveraging what of our core competency, operations excellence. Now I'd like to share a few highlights from each of the areas of the world.
Let's begin with the U.S., where comparable sales for the quarter increased 4.5% and operating income grew 6%. We continue to take share in the IEO marketplace even as the overall industry traffic has been relatively flat. These are strong results, especially in today's environment, where unemployment levels are still high and consumer confidence continues to waver. Our performance has been driven by a combination of everyday value, the introduction of compelling new menu items, a sustained focus on core favorites and an ongoing emphasis on improving restaurant operations. 
We continue to cash on even greater share of the Beverage market with the introduction of Frozen Strawberry Lemonade to our McCafé line up. To keep the news coming, we added another great tasting smoothies flavor, mango pineapple, at the end of June. Total McCafé Beverage sales rose 29% over second quarter 2010 on top of the gains realized last year. And we're still featuring dollars softdrinks and sweet tea in the majority of our restaurants. 
The U.S. is also promoting its flagship products that offer great taste and value. Advertising the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder drove unit sales up double digits. And the promotion of shareable 20 piece McNuggets and a new lineup of dipping sauces also delivered positive results. Now at the same time, customers appreciate the choices we provide during the early morning hours, with signature breakfast products like the Egg McMuffin, the Dollar Menu and our Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, breakfast continues to contribute to results. Our oatmeal is just one example of how we keep evolving the nutritionals of our menu. Another great example is the Premium chicken sandwiches that have been reinvented with the new marinate and are now served on a row with 8 grams of whole grain.  We're committed to continuing our focus on this important area and evolving as appropriate. 
Now we also continue to make progress with our modernization efforts on multiple fronts, from reimaging and rebuilding restaurants to exploring new ways to expand capacity. We just begun a test capacity opportunities with the addition of side-by-side drive-thrus. We now have about 2,200 in the U.S., in addition to a growing number of hand-held order takers that are also helping increase throughput in our drive-thrus.
The U.S. also continues to rollout a new point-of-sale system that simplifies the ordertaking process. It improves accuracy and it enables our crew to the better provide customer service. Today, it's in more than 10,000 restaurants in the U.S. The plan is to have it in virtually all of our restaurants in the U.S. by the end of the year. So let's switch over to Europe.
Comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.9% and operating income grew 10% in constant currencies. While the overall IEO market was flat, we continue to increase our market share around Europe. The Big 4 markets in Europe: France, the U.K., Russia and Germany, continue contributing to results. 
Now while austerity measures are pressuring consumers purchasing power, these markets and many more have continued to grow sales, guest counts and operating income. Results for this segment was driven by a compelling many of signature offerings, new products across price tiers, a growing breakfast the daypart and a continued emphasis on modernizing the restaurant experience. Our strongest count numbers in the region have reaffirming the fact that we're pulling the right the right levelers to remain a compelling destination.
For example, Premium products like McWrap, a new line of large chicken and beef wraps, are now in 17 countries in Europe. 11 markets are featuring the 1955, which is a burger topped with grilled onions, bacon and smoky barbecue sauce and served on a gourmet roll. This nostalgic taste has become Germany's best-performing premium sandwich. 
Midtier offerings like the Little Tasters in the U.K. and Snack Deluxe in Germany continue to elevate our position as the leader in great taste at midtier prices. Europe also continues to elevate our food image, as we increase our emphasis on telling our story. A great example of this is the UK's new A-Z quality campaign. Now this campaign celebrates the sheer quantity of great stories that we have to tell on topics including our farm fresh produce, local sourcing and the nutritional profile of our menu items. It's also a fun way for us to talk about the many other great things that we do as a company. 
And when it comes to restaurant modernization, Europe has led the system in evolving the look of our restaurants. And this effort has clearly benefited our results in Europe and globally. Our reimaging work is complemented by a concerted effort to simplify the customer experience. One example of this is the contactless payment technology that is rolled out in the U.K. and Switzerland, and is currently being deployed in Italy and Poland. 
I'd now like to shift over to Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa or APMEA, which delivered another strong quarter. Comparable skills for the quarter grew 5.2% and operating income increased 19% in constant currencies. The region's growth has been balanced with convenience, value and menu initiatives leading the way. 
A sustained focus on the drive-thru and delivery service strategies is paying dividends as the top sales driver among convenience tactics in markets including Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea. Another convenience is the nearly 1,700 dessert kiosks, many of which are in China, where disposable income become more widely spread these days, our kiosks provide a quick, convenient treat for loyal customers, while also serving as a great way to introduce new customers to our brand. 
And on the topical menu, Breakfast continues to deliver results. In China, the launch of a 2 item meal combo, featuring the new big crispy chicken muffin and coffee has driven early morning performance and contributed to more than half of China's total comp guest count growth. This daypart is approaching 8% of sales in China.
In Australia, a new breakfast menu that includes items like bagels, has made it made the region's strongest growing daypart. Now as all of you know, Australia has begun to feel some of the economic pressures that have been weighing in on much of the world these last few years. GDP contracted 1.2% in the first quarter. Its biggest fall in 20 years. The cost of living and the level of savings are both high and also contributing to concerns is the high Australian dollar. 
Recognizing the need to turn up our attention to entry-level value, our Australian team has launched the Value Lunch initiative. And it's similar to the one that we launched in China. Early results are promising. 
On the topical value, I'm pleased to report China's Value Lunch sales, which offer an Extra Value Meal at a discounted price for a set period of time during lunch have grown by 20% versus the same period last year.
Now on to Japan. A branded affordability platform at Japan at breakfast and a new Value Lunch initiative are driving sales and guest counts and growing our market share. I'd also like to provide a brief update on our operations in Japan. Our business there is holding steady and today all 17 out of 3,300 restaurants are open. Our team is doing an outstanding job managing through a very devastating situation. Although Japan is starting its recovery, the road is still unclear as the country begins efforts to address summer energy consumption levels, measures like the rolling closures of manufacturing facilities and work week changes may impact consumer behavior.
As we move past the midyear point, we remain very confident in our strategies as we continue to work towards becoming our customers favorite place to eat and drink. At McDonald's, we deliver a great experience to our customers. We deliver high-quality food at a great value and an increasingly modern atmosphere. This continues to resonate with our consumers, and that's why McDonald's is a destination for more than 64 million customers each and every day. I'm confident that we will continue to grow our market share while generating sustained profitable growth for our system and our shareholders. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Pete."

For the first 6 months of 2011, the McDonald's system has remained focused on executing the Plan to Win strategy and it's continuing to produce positive results. We are building sales, guest counts and market share in eve",1131,"Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. For the first 6 months of 2011, the McDonald's system has remained focused on executing the Plan to Win strategy and it's continuing to produce positive results. We are building sales, guest counts and market share in every area of the world despite a global economy facing rising costs and volatile consumer sentiment. Despite this environment, systemwide sales increased 6% in constant currencies for the 6 months ended June 30, and we continue to strengthen our profitability, with year-to-date combined operating margin up 30 basis points to 30.8%.
Our Franchise business model relies on the entrepreneurial spirit of the local businessmen and women who operate 80% of our restaurants around the world. For the quarter, franchise margins totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of $130 million in constant currencies, with every area of the world contributing. The margin percentage was up 40 basis points to 83.1%, driven by positive comparable sales. Franchise margins drive approximately 2/3 of our restaurant profits. 
Global company operating margin dollars grew $27 million in constant currencies to $891 million for the quarter, while the percent declined 90 basis points to 19%. Rising commodity, labor and other costs more than offset strong comparable sales. We are satisfied with these margins in this environment. For a perspective, a 19%, the 2011 second quarter margin is the second-highest of the past 10 years. In the U.S., company operating margins declined 150 basis points to 20.7% for the second quarter due primarily to 6% higher commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, higher labor and other costs.
The full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. Grocery basket remains at 4% to 4.5%. The cost increases were partly offset by strong guest count growth and a 1% price increase in March and a 1.4% increase at the end of May. As we move through the year, we will continue to consider future price increases, balancing our desire to maintain growth in guest count and market share amidst rising input costs. 
We remain mindful of Food at Home inflation, while striving to remain below from the Food Away From Home index to maintain our strong value proposition. Food at Home inflation is rising faster than Food Away From Home, providing us some room to take more pricing in the current environment. 
In Europe, second quarter company operated margins decreased 70 basis points to 19.6%, primarily impacted by 5% higher commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, higher labor and other costs. Europe's projected full year commodity cost increase also remains at 4% to 4.5%.
Europe is a collection of 39 different markets, so our price increases vary by market, with Russia at the high end due to it's significant inflation and all other markets averaging about 2% year-over-year. As we move to 2011, we will continue to evaluate pricing being sensitive to austerity measures and shrinking disposable income. 
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins for the quarter decreased 10 basis points to 17%, also reflecting inflationary pressures in commodity, labor and occupancy costs, offset by comparable sales increases.
Similar to last quarter, the acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the segment's margin percent. In terms of pricing, APMEA is averaging about 3% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, we will continue to assess our pricing in an effort to alleviate some of the inflationary pressures, while maintaining our guest count momentum.
Looking forward, given our commodity pressures, we expect third quarter consolidated margin comparisons to remain challenging, with comparisons easing into the fourth quarter.
G&A control remains a part of how we operate. Compared to second quarter 2010, which included our bi-annual worldwide convention, G&A spending declined $5 million or 1% in constant currencies. We remain on track for full year G&A to decrease about 2% in constant currencies.
On the other operating income line, the current quarter benefited from gains on partnership disolutions in the U.S., as well as comparisons to charges related to voluntary glassware recall last year. 
With half year behind us, we have tightened our full year effective tax rate guidance to 31% to 32%. Through June, the effective tax rate was approximately 30% implying that both third and fourth quarter rates will likely be above the annual guidance range.
Our strong operating results continue to generate significant amount of cash. Our first priority for this cash remains reinvestment in our reinvestment in our business to drive future growth and returns. About half of our CapEx is allocated to existing restaurants, with the other half to open new units. 
As Don mentioned, modernizing the customer experience is one of the pillars of our growth strategy and reimaging plays essential role. Refreshing our interiors and exteriors so customers easily notice the contemporary look and feel of our restaurants. 
Equally important, we are taking advantage of the opportunity to enhance operational efficiencies such as adding dual link drive-thrus, optimizing the spacing between the payment and present windows in the drive-thru or expanding the kitchen to increase capacity to name a few.
Through the first 6 months, we have completed 200 reimages in the U.S., and are confident that we will meet our target of 600 by year end. Our owner operators are enthusiastic about this initiative, and view it as a way to capture a sustainable, long term competitive advantage. 
The other half of our capital expenditures is allocated toward opening new restaurants. Over half of the projected 1,100 openings or about 650 will be in APMEA, a key growth region for us. China has opened 66 restaurants through the first half of the year, and we'll finish the year opening between 175 and 200. Broadening our accessibility remains a key strategy for us in this region, and we see significant opportunity for new units for many years to come.
Lastly, let me discuss foreign currency translation which positively impacted second quarter results by $0.10. At current exchange rates, we expect third quarter EPS to benefit $0.07 to $0.09, with a full year benefit of $0.23 to $0.25. But as usual, take this guidance as directional only, because rates will continue to change as we progress through the second half of the year.
McDonald's results for the second quarter underscore the strong foundation from which we are operating. The resilient strategy that operates effectively in any economic climate, a powerful alignment of our system around the key priorities that widen our gap versus the competition and an paralleled focus on execution that delivers a uniquely McDonald's experience to the 64 million customers served at our restaurants each day. We remain confident that this formula will continue to deliver strong results over the long term. 
Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Cathy to begin our Q&A."

And recently introducing a snacking value menu around RMB 7 and up from there. So all efforts to drive traffic. Yet that the same time, realizing that with input costs rising, we have to do something to maintain our profitability there. So we did, in July, look at adjusting prices. And when you take some of the products that move to the value menu, which effectively were price reductions with some of the other actions, it did net out into a net price increase.

For our business as we move forward, we just continue to focus on being able to have, first of all, value at each tier, bring forward some new, innovative news in terms of our menu, at the same time, make sure that from a convenience factor, we're there, and from a base value factor, we're right there for the consumers across Europe. Right now, still a mixed bag, second half of the year. It depends on what happens with some of the austerity measures, some of the markets like the Portugal are looking at increased VAT. So it's -- we do have to continue to watch what takes place with some of the austerity measures, and make sure we're prepared from a value perspective and from an operating perspective."

But again, some of mentioned earlier, we're going to be judicious about this and continue to read not only what's happened with the price increases we have taken, but what is the sentiment and expectation going forward. But it does feed into your second question. So we think for the year, our cost of goods, our basket is going to top out here in the third quarter, and we see relief in the fourth quarter. The 2012, it's still too early for me to give you a number, but directionally, my guess is we would see the basket up again in 2012. I think the anomaly of having a large decrease in our basket that we saw in 2010, I'm afraid those days are behind us for a while. And so as we think about price increases for the rest of this year, and we also have to think about what is coming in commodity cost in 2012 and beyond, our suppliers are, as they always do, looking at the markets and putting on positions where it makes appropriate to help lock-in and secure some of that predictability to our pricing in 2012. But at this point, it would be premature for me to put a number on that."

So it's something more than a 2% to 3% comp to maintain margins in this current environment. And so obviously, we're going to -- as we've said before, we're not solely going to monitor the company operating margin and focus solely on growing that.

We'll continue to focus on being smart and strategic in the current environment as we've talked about today, while always striving to deliver the best customer experience that we can in each of our 33,000 restaurants around the world. So thanks again, and have a great day."

I'm pleased to share our latest business results, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, global comparable sales were up 5.6%. Operating income increased 11% in constant currencies and EPS reached $",1829,"Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share our latest business results, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, global comparable sales were up 5.6%. Operating income increased 11% in constant currencies and EPS reached $1.35, an 11% increase in constant currencies. We also returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Our momentum continues, with July global comparable sales expected to be about 4% to 5%. 
Our performance is broad-based. We continue to grow share in every area of the world despite an informal eating-out market that remains relatively flat overall. 
Now I've had an opportunity to spend time in many of our major markets around the world over the past several months, and I'm pleased to say that we're focused on taking our business to the next level. The system is aligned around 3 global growth priorities that support our Plan to Win. And we're confident that our emphasis on optimizing and evolving our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our brand will continue to move our business forward.
Now when it comes to optimizing and evolving the menu, we are leveraging our iconic products and billion-dollar brands, we're innovating in key menu categories like beverages and chicken, and we're elevating our food image around the world. 
Our second priority, which is modernizing the customer experience, is really all about improving both how our restaurants look and feel and how they operate. We keep looking for ways to create efficiencies and build capacity so that we can accommodate our continued guest count growth. 
In addition to reimaging our restaurants, we're leveraging technology to enhance the customer experience to make the jobs of our managers and crew easier. For example, innovations like our new point-of-sale system and self-order kiosks, enable restaurant employees to focus on what matters most, the customer experience, and what we call the moment of truth.
Our third priority, which is broadening accessibility to our brand, is about driving growth through value and convenience. You see, to us, value means a great customer experience delivered at a great price so that our customers get the biggest bang for their buck, their yen, euro or pound. The second component of accessibility, which is convenience, is about daypart expansion and continuing to open new restaurants when and where appropriate. 
Ensuring our plan's focus on these 3 global priorities enables our teams to be more effective in terms of integrating and aligning their initiatives under the Plan to Win. This is particularly important as we execute against our biggest opportunities by leveraging one of our core competencies, operations excellence. 
Now I'd like to share a few highlights from each of the areas of the world. Let's begin with the U.S., where comparable sales for the quarter increased 4.5% and operating income grew 6%. We continue to take share in the IEO marketplace even as the overall industry traffic has been relatively flat. 
These are strong results, especially in today's environment, where unemployment levels are still high and consumer confidence continues to waver. Our performance has been driven by a combination of everyday value, the introduction of compelling new menu items, a sustained focus on core favorites and an ongoing emphasis on improving restaurant operations. 
We continue to capture an even greater share of the beverage market with the introduction of Frozen Strawberry Lemonade to our McCafé line up. To keep the news coming, we added another great tasting smoothie flavor, Mango Pineapple, at the end of June. 
Total McCafé beverage sales rose 29% over second quarter 2010 on top of the gains realized last year. And we're still featuring dollars soft drinks and sweet tea in a majority of our restaurants. 
The U.S. has also been promoting its flagship products that offer great taste and value. Advertising the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder drove unit sales up double digits. And the promotion of shareable 20 piece McNuggets and a new lineup of dipping sauces also delivered positive results. 
Now at the same time, customers appreciate the choices we provide during the early morning hours, with signature breakfast products like the Egg McMuffin, the Dollar Menu and our Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, breakfast continues to contribute to results. Our oatmeal is just one example of how we keep evolving the nutritionals of our menu. Another great example is the premium chicken sandwiches that have been reinvented with the new marinade and are now served on a roll with 8 grams of whole grain.  We're committed to continuing our focus on this important area and evolving as appropriate. 
Now we also continue to make progress with our modernization efforts on multiple fronts, from reimaging and rebuilding restaurants to exploring new ways to expand capacity. We just begun to tap capacity opportunities with the addition of side-by-side drive-thrus. We now have about 2,200 in the U.S., in addition to a growing number of hand-held order takers that are also helping increase throughput in our drive-thrus.
The U.S. also continues to rollout a new point-of-sale system that simplifies the order taking process. It improves accuracy and it enables our crew to better provide customer service. Today, it's in more than 10,000 restaurants in the U.S. The plan is to have it in virtually all of our restaurants in the U.S. by the end of the year. 
So let's switch over to Europe. Comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.9% and operating income grew 10% in constant currencies. While the overall IEO market was flat, we continue to increase our market share around Europe. The big 4 markets in Europe, France, the U.K., Russia and Germany, continue contributing to results. 
Now while austerity measures are pressuring consumers purchasing power, these markets and many across Europe have continued to grow sales, guest counts and operating income. Results for the segment were driven by a compelling menu of signature offerings, new products across price tiers, a growing breakfast daypart and a continued emphasis on modernizing the restaurant experience. Our strong guest count numbers in the region have reaffirmed the fact that we're pulling the right levers to remain a compelling destination.
For example, premium products like McWrap, a new line of large chicken and beef wraps, are now in 17 countries in Europe. 11 markets are featuring the 1955, which is a burger topped with grilled onions, bacon and smoky barbecue sauce and served on a gourmet roll. This nostalgic taste has become Germany's best-performing premium sandwich. 
Mid-tier offerings like the Little Tasters in the U.K. and Snack Deluxe in Germany continue to elevate our position as the leader in great taste at mid-tier prices. 
Europe also continues to elevate our food image as we increase our emphasis on telling our story. A great example of this is the UK's new A-Z quality campaign. Now this campaign celebrates the sheer quantity of great stories that we have to tell on topics including our farm fresh produce, local sourcing and the nutritional profile of our menu items. It's also a fun way for us to talk about the many other great things that we do as a company. 
And when it comes to restaurant modernization, Europe has led the system in evolving the look of our restaurants. And this effort has clearly benefited our results in Europe and globally. Our reimaging work is complemented by a concerted effort to simplify the customer experience. One example of this is the contactless payment technology that is rolled out in the U.K. and Switzerland, and is currently being deployed in Italy and Poland. 
I'd now like to shift over to Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, or APMEA, which delivered another strong quarter. Comparable sales for the quarter grew 5.2% and operating income increased 19% in constant currencies. The region's growth has been balanced with convenience, value and menu initiatives leading the way. 
A sustained focus on the drive-thru and delivery service strategies is paying dividends as the top sales driver among convenience tactics in markets including Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea. Another convenience is the nearly 1,700 dessert kiosks, many of which are in China, where disposable income becoming more widely spread these days, our kiosks provide a quick, convenient treat for loyal customers while also serving as a great way to introduce new customers to our brand. 
And on the topic of menu, breakfast continues to deliver results. In China, the launch of a 2-item meal combo, featuring the new big crispy chicken muffin and coffee has driven early morning performance and contributed to more than half of China's total comp guest count growth. This daypart is approaching 8% of sales in China.
And in Australia, a new breakfast menu that includes items like bagels, has made it the region's strongest growing daypart. Now as all of you know, Australia has begun to feel some of the economic pressures that have been weighing in on much of the world these last few years. GDP contracted 1.2% in the first quarter, it's biggest fall in 20 years. The cost of living and the level of savings are both high and also contributing to concerns is the high Australian dollar. 
Recognizing the need to turn up our attention to entry-level value, our Australian team has launched the Value Lunch initiative. And it's similar to the one that we launched in China. Early results are promising. 
On the topic of value, I'm pleased to report China's Value Lunch sales which offer an Extra Value Meal at a discounted price for a set period of time during lunch have grown by 20% versus the same period last year.
Now on to Japan. A branded affordability platform in Japan at breakfast and a new Value Lunch initiative are driving sales and guest counts and growing our market share. I'd also like to provide a brief update on our operations in Japan. Our business there is holding steady. And today, all but 17 out of 3,300 restaurants are open. Our team is doing an outstanding job managing through a very devastating situation. Although Japan is starting its recovery, the road is still unclear as the country begins efforts to address summer energy consumption levels, measures like the rolling closures of manufacturing facilities and work week changes may impact consumer behaviors.
As we move past the midyear point, we remain very confident in our strategies as we continue to work towards becoming our customers' favorite place in where to eat and drink. At McDonald's, we deliver a great experience to our customers. We deliver high-quality food at a great value and an increasingly modern atmosphere. This continues to resonate with our consumers, and that's why McDonald's is a destination for more than 64 million customers each and every day. I'm confident that we will continue to grow our market share while generating sustained profitable growth for our system and our shareholders. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Pete."
139488,137170346,144930,"McDonald's Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2011",2011-07-22,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. Through the first 6 months of 2011, the McDonald's system has remained focused on executing the Plan to Win strategy, and it's continuing to produce positive results.

Through the first 6 months of 2011, the McDonald's system has remained focused on executing the Plan to Win strategy, and it's continuing to produce positive results. We are building sales, guest counts and market share in every area of the world despite a global economy facing rising costs and volatile consumer sentiment. Despite this environment, systemwide sales increased 6% in constant currencies for the 6 months ended June 30, and we continue to strengthen our profitability with year-to-date combined operating margin up 30 basis points to 30.8%.
Our franchise business model relies on the entrepreneurial spirit of the local businessmen and women who operate 80% of our restaurants around the world. For the quarter, franchise margins totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of $130 million in constant currencies, with every area of the world contributing. The margin percentage was up 40 basis points to 83.1% driven by positive comparable sales. Franchise margins drive approximately 2/3 of our restaurant profits. 
Global company operating margin dollars grew $27 million in constant currencies to $891 million for the quarter, while the percent declined 90 basis points to 19%. Rising commodity, labor and other costs more than offset strong comparable sales. We are satisfied with these margins in this environment. For a perspective, at 19%, the 2011 second quarter margin is the second-highest of the past 10 years. In the U.S., company operating margins declined 150 basis points to 20.7% for the second quarter due primarily to 6% higher commodity costs and to a lesser extent, higher labor and other costs.
The full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket remains at 4% to 4.5%. The cost increases were partly offset by strong guest count growth and a 1% price increase in March and a 1.4% increase at the end of May. As we move through the year, we will continue to consider future price increases, balancing our desire to maintain growth in guest count and market share amidst rising input costs. 
We remain mindful of food at home inflation, while striving to remain below from the food away from home index to maintain our strong value proposition. Food at home inflation is rising faster than food away from home, providing us some room to take more pricing in the current environment. 
In Europe, second quarter company operated margins decreased 70 basis points to 19.6%, primarily impacted by 5% higher commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, higher labor and other costs. Europe's projected full year commodity cost increase also remains at 4% to 4.5%.
Europe is a collection of 39 different markets, so our price increases vary by market, with Russia at the high end due to it's significant inflation and all other markets averaging about 2% year-over-year. As we move to 2011, we will continue to evaluate pricing being sensitive to austerity measures and shrinking disposable income. 
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins for the quarter decreased 10 basis points to 17%, also reflecting inflationary pressures in commodity, labor and occupancy costs, offset by comparable sales increases.
Similar to last quarter, the acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the segment's margin percent. In terms of pricing, APMEA is averaging about 3% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, we will continue to assess our pricing in an effort to alleviate some of the inflationary pressures while maintaining our guest count momentum.
Looking forward, given our commodity pressures, we expect third quarter consolidated margin comparisons to remain challenging, with comparisons easing into the fourth quarter.
G&A control remains a part of how we operate. Compared to second quarter 2010 which included our biannual worldwide convention, G&A spending declined $5 million or 1% in constant currencies. We remain on track for full year G&A to decrease about 2% in constant currencies.
On the other operating income line, the current quarter benefited from gains on partnership dissolutions in the U.S., as well as comparisons to charges related to voluntary glassware recall last year. 
With half year behind us, we have tightened our full year effective tax rate guidance to 31% to 32%. Through June, the effective tax rate was approximately 30%, implying that both third and fourth quarter rates will likely be above the annual guidance range.
Our strong operating results continue to generate significant amount of cash. Our first priority for this cash remains reinvestment in our business to drive future growth and returns. About half our CapEx is allocated to existing restaurants, with the other half to open new units. 
As Don mentioned, modernizing the customer experience is one of the pillars of our growth strategy and reimaging plays essential role, refreshing our interiors and exteriors so customers easily notice the contemporary look and feel of our restaurants. 
Equally important, we are taking advantage of the opportunity to enhance operational efficiencies such as adding dual lane drive-thrus, optimizing the spacing between the payment and present windows in the drive-thru or expanding the kitchen to increase capacity, to name a few.
Through the first 6 months, we have completed 200 reimages in the U.S., and are confident that we will meet our target of 600 by year end. Our owner/operators are enthusiastic about this initiative and view it as a way to capture a sustainable long-term competitive advantage. 
The other half of our capital expenditures is allocated toward opening new restaurants. Over half of the projected 1,100 openings or about 650 will be in APMEA, a key growth region for us. China has opened 66 restaurants through the first half of the year, and we'll finish the year opening between 175 and 200. Broadening our accessibility remains a key strategy for us in this region, and we see significant opportunity for new units for many years to come.
Lastly, let me discuss foreign currency translation which positively impacted second quarter results by $0.10. At current exchange rates, we expect third quarter EPS to benefit $0.07 to $0.09, with a full year benefit of $0.23 to $0.25. But as usual, take this guidance as directional only because rates will continue to change as we progress through the second half of the year.
McDonald's results for the second quarter underscore the strong foundation from which we are operating: a resilient strategy that operates effectively in any economic climate; a powerful alignment of our system around the key priorities that widen our gap versus the competition; and an paralleled focus on execution that delivers a uniquely McDonald's experience to the 64 million customers served at our restaurants each day. We remain confident that this formula will continue to deliver strong results over the long term. 
Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A."

And now, a renewed focus on value at breakfast, with a RMB 6 muffin and coffee offering, and recently introducing a snacking value menu around RMB 7 and up from there. So all efforts to drive traffic, yet that the same time, realizing that with input costs rising, we do have to do something to maintain our profitability there. So we did, in July, look at adjusting prices.

We picked that up in a benefit in the month of June. So very, very solid performance, very, very solid guest count growth. As I mentioned earlier, continued momentum, and we're looking at July comps in range of 4 to 5 percentile."

And therefore, our appeal as a brand across the lunch program, the breakfast daypart, the initiatives that we've launched, our service initiatives, more drive-thrus in the marketplace, more restaurants in the marketplace, a stronger marketing voice, we made investments there. All of these things are coming to bear, I believe, in China. And we're seeing some really good momentum there and our team is very strong. I was over earlier this year, very, very pleased with the development plan and the process there. Very pleased with our operational execution. We're learning better and better how to start up new restaurants and do it at the rate and pace where we've got going now. So the Chinese team is hitting on all cylinders now."

So the one that we took in the U.S. in March, I would say the flow through from that was probably above average of what we typically get on a price increase.

And generally, that's been the case around the world. So we've been very cautious. We've used our tools, we've looked at all of the other indicators that guide us whether it be grocery store inflation or food away from home and what's going on with competitors and unemployment rates, et cetera. So we've been judicious, and I think as a result of that, we're getting good reaction and good flow through on those price increases. And in terms of is that changing consumer behavior per se, I would say no because we aren't seeing any dramatic spike in the usage of our dollar menus. That would be one indicator.

I think the anomaly of having a large decrease in our basket that we saw in 2010, I'm afraid those days are behind us for a while. And so as we think about price increases for the rest of this year, and we also have to think about what is coming in commodity cost in 2012 and beyond, our suppliers are, as they always do, looking at the markets and putting on positions where it makes appropriate to help lock-in and secure some of that predictability to our pricing in 2012.

Beverages, we're gaining share clearly based upon the McCafé beverages. They've been growing at a really good pace. Also though we're growing beverages on the value platform. So when you look at Dollar Drinks and dollar sweet tea, those areas, we're growing our business there. Breakfast wise, clearly, we're growing business at the breakfast daypart. Oatmeal has been a large incremental for us at breakfast. So we're getting the incrementality of an oatmeal. So where exactly those dollars are coming from, we haven't dissected that or really pinpointed from other competitors, we just know they're coming from the broader marketplace. And clearly, in the area of chicken with the success of nuggets, we grew our chicken business quite a bit. The other thing we're doing in the U.S. though is extending and expanding hours. And so we've gone from about 36% up to about 40% in terms of our 24 and extended hour operations. And so when you look at that, we're becoming more accessible. We are definitely getting in some of the product categories and we're improving our peak-hour service and our ability to satisfy customers during the peak periods where we have a higher flow through of customers. And so all of those things are areas where we're seeing some business gains."

That's where we're really modeling out the benefit of self-order kiosks. It is not for every restaurant. It is one of those things that helps us pull traffic away from the front counter and helps us get basically another initiation point in terms of being able to place orders, which go back into the kitchen. And so that is what self-order kiosk has done. Now, what it helps some of the areas in terms of early read, it's that when you have an opportunity as a customer to be in a position where you're placing your own order, you take your own time. So if you're a person that takes a little longer or if you're a mom or dad with kids, they tend to like the ability to go at their own pace with a self-order kiosk. So those are the things that we're really testing. I think right now we've got about 700, 760, 770 or so in France and we'll probably stay around that number until we've really proven out the business case for this."

And in France, which is probably our -- they were the leader in this area, they are looking at, I call it second-generation of interior remodeling. So when they're essentially done, they're looking at what the next version of the reimaging. And the good news is the way it was done and the materials used and the way it was all put together, that second round of reimaging is much less expensive from a cost perspective. It could be just changing some of the wallcoverings or some of the seating and you're able to get an updated refreshed environment without a significant capital outlay. But we're not really seeing a slowdown in terms of the impact when you do a new reimage relative to the marketplace. So it's still in that, let's say, 6% to 7% sales lift when we do a reimaging. And we aren't seeing that slow down. So we know it's a great investment for today and for the future, and not only does it drive sales, but when you look at all the customer attributes, they tell us those services friendlier, the food is hotter, the restroom is cleaner. They give us a lot of credit in that reimaged surrounding that does help the brand halo and helps their intent to revisit us."

And it's also assuming that 2% to 3% gives us -- half of that growth is coming from pricing and half of that is coming from traffic growth. So when years like now, we've got more of our growth coming from traffic, which means you need a higher comp, and we've got commodity cost above that average. So it's something more than the 2% to 3% comp to maintain margins in this current environment. And so obviously, we're going to -- as we've said before, we're not solely going to monitor the company operating margins and focus solely on growing that. We're going to look at that balance between continuing to drive customers, continuing to take market share with the need to cover some of these input costs.

So if the mix has stayed basically the same, now what's happened is we've got a lot more customers coming into the restaurants. So that part is good. We're still seeing a bunch of same mix there. Clearly, we're selling more beverages and seeing more of those kind of transactions, which is very good for us. But all in all, the mix is not varied that much.

So in terms of 2011, we do have a greater proportion of purchased sites than we had in 2010, primarily in Europe where we focused a little bit more. I still say that our expectation was maybe we'd see a little bit more distressed real estate on the market or opportunity to buy sites that maybe we couldn't in the past. But we really aren't seeing that to a meaningful degree. So nothing dramatically different in that regard. We'll continue to focus.

Keep in mind, Europe has already tested the 1955 very successfully. Big burger, Big Tasty has been out. So we -- I'm really looking forward to us having even more premium burgers. We'll manage it appropriately from a price perspective and be able to deliver that, we think, at an even much more of a value proposition based upon our supply chain and the efficacy of it.

I'm pleased to share our latest business results, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, global comparable sales were up 5.6%.

I'm pleased to share our latest business results, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, global comparable sales were up 5.6%. Operating income increased 11% in constant currencies and EPS reached $1.35, an 11% increase in constant currencies. We also returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Our momentum continues, with July global comparable sales expected to be about 4% to 5%. 
Our performance is broad-based. We continue to grow share in every area of the world despite an informal eating-out market that remains relatively flat overall. 
Now I've had an opportunity to spend time in many of our major markets around the world over the past several months, and I'm pleased to say that we're focused on taking our business to the next level. The system is aligned around 3 global growth priorities that support our Plan to Win. And we're confident that our emphasis on optimizing and evolving our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our brand will continue to move our business forward.
Now when it comes to optimizing and evolving the menu, we are leveraging our iconic products and billion-dollar brands, we're innovating in key menu categories like beverages and chicken, and we're elevating our food image around the world. 
Our second priority, which is modernizing the customer experience, is really all about improving both how our restaurants look and feel and how they operate. We keep looking for ways to create efficiencies and build capacity so that we can accommodate our continued guest count growth. 
In addition to reimaging our restaurants, we're leveraging technology to enhance the customer experience to make the jobs of our managers and crew easier. For example, innovations like our new point-of-sale system and self-order kiosks, enable restaurant employees to focus on what matters most, the customer experience, and what we call the moment of truth.
Our third priority, which is broadening accessibility to our brand, is about driving growth through value and convenience. You see, to us, value means a great customer experience delivered at a great price so that our customers get the biggest bang for their buck, their yen, euro or pound. The second component of accessibility, which is convenience, is about daypart expansion and continuing to open new restaurants when and where appropriate. 
Ensuring our plan's focus on these 3 global priorities enables our teams to be more effective in terms of integrating and aligning their initiatives under the Plan to Win. This is particularly important as we execute against our biggest opportunities by leveraging one of our core competencies, operations excellence. 
Now I'd like to share a few highlights from each of the areas of the world. Let's begin with the U.S., where comparable sales for the quarter increased 4.5% and operating income grew 6%. We continue to take share in the IEO marketplace even as the overall industry traffic has been relatively flat. 
These are strong results, especially in today's environment, where unemployment levels are still high and consumer confidence continues to waver. Our performance has been driven by a combination of everyday value, the introduction of compelling new menu items, a sustained focus on core favorites and an ongoing emphasis on improving restaurant operations. 
We continue to capture an even greater share of the beverage market with the introduction of Frozen Strawberry Lemonade to our McCafé line up. To keep the news coming, we added another great tasting smoothie flavor, Mango Pineapple, at the end of June. 
Total McCafé beverage sales rose 29% over second quarter 2010 on top of the gains realized last year. And we're still featuring dollar soft drinks and sweet tea in a majority of our restaurants. 
The U.S. has also been promoting its flagship products that offer great taste and value. Advertising the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder drove unit sales up double digits. And the promotion of shareable 20 piece McNuggets and a new lineup of dipping sauces also delivered positive results. 
Now at the same time, customers appreciate the choices we provide during the early morning hours, with signature breakfast products like the Egg McMuffin, the Dollar Menu and our Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, breakfast continues to contribute to results. Our oatmeal is just one example of how we keep evolving the nutritionals of our menu. Another great example is the premium chicken sandwiches that have been reinvented with a new marinade and are now served on a roll with 8 grams of whole grain.  We're committed to continuing our focus on this important area and evolving as appropriate. 
Now we also continue to make progress with our modernization efforts on multiple fronts, from reimaging and rebuilding restaurants to exploring new ways to expand capacity. We just begun to tap capacity opportunities with the addition of side-by-side drive-thrus. We now have about 2,200 in the U.S., in addition to a growing number of hand-held order takers that are also helping increase throughput in our drive-thrus.
The U.S. also continues to rollout a new point-of-sale system that simplifies the order taking process. It improves accuracy and it enables our crew to better provide customer service. Today, it's in more than 10,000 restaurants in the U.S. The plan is to have it in virtually all of our restaurants in the U.S. by the end of the year. 
So let's switch over to Europe. Comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.9% and operating income grew 10% in constant currencies. While the overall IEO market was flat, we continue to increase our market share around Europe. The big 4 markets in Europe, France, the U.K., Russia and Germany, continue contributing to results. 
Now while austerity measures are pressuring consumers purchasing power, these markets and many across Europe have continued to grow sales, guest counts and operating income. Results for the segment were driven by a compelling menu of signature offerings, new products across price tiers, a growing breakfast daypart and a continued emphasis on modernizing the restaurant experience. Our strong guest count numbers in the region have reaffirmed the fact that we're pulling the right levers to remain a compelling destination.
For example, premium products like McWrap, a new line of large chicken and beef wraps, are now in 17 countries in Europe. 11 markets are featuring the 1955, which is a burger topped with grilled onions, bacon and smoky barbecue sauce and served on a gourmet roll. This nostalgic taste has become Germany's best-performing premium sandwich. 
Mid-tier offerings like the Little Tasters in the U.K. and Snack Deluxe in Germany continue to elevate our position as the leader in great taste at mid-tier prices. 
Europe also continues to elevate our food image as we increase our emphasis on telling our story. A great example of this is the UK's new A-Z quality campaign. Now this campaign celebrates the sheer quantity of great stories that we have to tell on topics including our farm fresh produce, local sourcing and the nutritional profile of our menu items. It's also a fun way for us to talk about the many other great things that we do as a company. 
And when it comes to restaurant modernization, Europe has led the system in evolving the look of our restaurants. And this effort has clearly benefited our results in Europe and globally. Our reimaging work is complemented by a concerted effort to simplify the customer experience. One example of this is the contactless payment technology that is rolled out in the U.K. and Switzerland, and is currently being deployed in Italy and Poland. 
I'd now like to shift over to Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, or APMEA, which delivered another strong quarter. Comparable sales for the quarter grew 5.2% and operating income increased 19% in constant currencies. The region's growth has been balanced with convenience, value and menu initiatives leading the way. 
A sustained focus on the drive-thru and delivery service strategies is paying dividends as the top sales driver among convenience tactics in markets including Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea. Another convenience is the nearly 1,700 dessert kiosks, many of which are in China, where disposable income becoming more widely spread these days, our kiosks provide a quick, convenient treat for loyal customers while also serving as a great way to introduce new customers to our brand. 
And on the topic of menu, breakfast continues to deliver results. In China, the launch of a 2-item meal combo, featuring the new big crispy chicken muffin and coffee has driven early morning performance and contributed to more than half of China's total comp guest count growth. This daypart is approaching 8% of sales in China.
And in Australia, a new breakfast menu that includes items like bagels has made it the region's strongest growing daypart. Now as all of you know, Australia has begun to feel some of the economic pressures that have been weighing in on much of the world these last few years. GDP contracted 1.2% in the first quarter, its biggest fall in 20 years. The cost of living and the level of savings are both high and also contributing to concerns is the high Australian dollar. 
Recognizing the need to turn up our attention to entry-level value, our Australian team has launched the Value Lunch initiative. And it's similar to the one that we launched in China. Early results are promising. 
On the topic of value, I'm pleased to report China's Value Lunch sales which offer an Extra Value Meal at a discounted price for a set period of time during lunch have grown by 20% versus the same period last year.
Now on to Japan. A branded affordability platform in Japan at breakfast and a new Value Lunch initiative are driving sales and guest counts and growing our market share. I'd also like to provide a brief update on our operations in Japan. Our business there is holding steady. And today, all but 17 out of 3,300 restaurants are open. Our team is doing an outstanding job managing through a very devastating situation. Although Japan is starting its recovery, the road is still unclear as the country begins efforts to address summer energy consumption levels, measures like the rolling closures of manufacturing facilities and work week changes may impact consumer behaviors.
As we move past the midyear point, we remain very confident in our strategies as we continue to work towards becoming our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink. At McDonald's, we deliver a great experience to our customers. We deliver high-quality food at a great value and an increasingly modern atmosphere. This continues to resonate with our consumers, and that's why McDonald's is a destination for more than 64 million customers each and every day. I'm confident that we will continue to grow our market share while generating sustained profitable growth for our system and our shareholders. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Pete."

We are building sales, guest counts and market share i",1127,"Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. Through the first 6 months of 2011, the McDonald's system has remained focused on executing the Plan to Win strategy, and it's continuing to produce positive results. We are building sales, guest counts and market share in every area of the world despite a global economy facing rising costs and volatile consumer sentiment. Despite this environment, system wide sales increased 6% in constant currencies for the 6 months ended June 30, and we continue to strengthen our profitability with year-to-date combined operating margin up 30 basis points to 30.8%.
Our franchise business model relies on the entrepreneurial spirit of the local businessmen and women who operate 80% of our restaurants around the world. For the quarter, franchise margins totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of $130 million in constant currencies, with every area of the world contributing. The margin percentage was up 40 basis points to 83.1% driven by positive comparable sales. Franchise margins drive approximately 2/3 of our restaurant profits. 
Global company operating margin dollars grew $27 million in constant currencies to $891 million for the quarter, while the percent declined 90 basis points to 19%. Rising commodity, labor and other costs more than offset strong comparable sales. We are satisfied with these margins in this environment. For a perspective, at 19%, the 2011 second quarter margin is the second-highest of the past 10 years. In the U.S., company operating margins declined 150 basis points to 20.7% for the second quarter due primarily to 6% higher commodity costs and to a lesser extent, higher labor and other costs.
The full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket remains at 4% to 4.5%. The cost increases were partly offset by strong guest count growth and a 1% price increase in March and a 1.4% increase at the end of May. As we move through the year, we will continue to consider future price increases, balancing our desire to maintain growth in guest count and market share amidst rising input costs. 
We remain mindful of food at home inflation, while striving to remain below from the food away from home index to maintain our strong value proposition. Food at home inflation is rising faster than food away from home, providing us some room to take more pricing in the current environment. 
In Europe, second quarter company operated margins decreased 70 basis points to 19.6%, primarily impacted by 5% higher commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, higher labor and other costs. Europe's projected full year commodity cost increase also remains at 4% to 4.5%.
Europe is a collection of 39 different markets, so our price increases vary by market, with Russia at the high end due to its significant inflation and all other markets averaging about 2% year-over-year. As we move to 2011, we will continue to evaluate pricing being sensitive to austerity measures and shrinking disposable income. 
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins for the quarter decreased 10 basis points to 17%, also reflecting inflationary pressures in commodity, labor and occupancy costs, offset by comparable sales increases.
Similar to last quarter, the acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the segment's margin percent. In terms of pricing, APMEA is averaging about 3% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, we will continue to assess our pricing in an effort to alleviate some of the inflationary pressures while maintaining our guest count momentum.
Looking forward, given our commodity pressures, we expect third quarter consolidated margin comparisons to remain challenging, with comparisons easing into the fourth quarter.
G&A control remains a part of how we operate. Compared to second quarter 2010 which included our biannual worldwide convention, G&A spending declined $5 million or 1% in constant currencies. We remain on track for full year G&A to decrease about 2% in constant currencies.
On the other operating income line, the current quarter benefited from gains on partnership dissolutions in the U.S., as well as comparisons to charges related to voluntary glassware recall last year. 
With half the year behind us, we have tightened our full year effective tax rate guidance to 31% to 32%. Through June, the effective tax rate was approximately 30%, implying that both third and fourth quarter rates will likely be above the annual guidance range.
Our strong operating results continue to generate significant amount of cash. Our first priority for this cash remains reinvestment in our business to drive future growth and returns. About half our CapEx is allocated to existing restaurants, with the other half to open new units. 
As Don mentioned, modernizing the customer experience is one of the pillars of our growth strategy and reimaging plays essential role, refreshing our interiors and exteriors so customers easily notice the contemporary look and feel of our restaurants. 
Equally important, we are taking advantage of the opportunity to enhance operational efficiencies such as adding dual lane drive-thrus, optimizing the spacing between the payment and present windows in the drive-thru or expanding the kitchen to increase capacity, to name a few.
Through the first 6 months, we have completed 200 reimages in the U.S., and are confident that we will meet our target of 600 by year end. Our owner/operators are enthusiastic about this initiative and view it as a way to capture a sustainable long-term competitive advantage. 
The other half of our capital expenditures is allocated toward opening new restaurants. Over half of the projected 1,100 openings or about 650 will be in APMEA, a key growth region for us. China has opened 66 restaurants through the first half of the year, and we'll finish the year opening between 175 and 200. Broadening our accessibility remains a key strategy for us in this region, and we see significant opportunity for new units for many years to come.
Lastly, let me discuss foreign currency translation which positively impacted second quarter results by $0.10. At current exchange rates, we expect third quarter EPS to benefit $0.07 to $0.09, with a full year benefit of $0.23 to $0.25. But as usual, take this guidance as directional only because rates will continue to change as we progress through the second half of the year.
McDonald's results for the second quarter underscore the strong foundation from which we are operating: a resilient strategy that operates effectively in any economic climate; a powerful alignment of our system around the key priorities that widen our gap versus the competition; and an paralleled focus on execution that delivers a uniquely McDonald's experience to the 64 million customers served at our restaurants each day. We remain confident that this formula will continue to deliver strong results over the long term. 
Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A."

I know you made peak lunch hour staffing a priority at your conventions again about a year or so ago. And earlier in this call, you reminded us of new point-of-sale systems and I hear your reimaging has a sneaky positive benefit to throughput. So could you perhaps let us know, have you been able to restart same-store sales growth at the peak hours and perhaps give us a sense of how this might play out in the coming years?"

As you all know, National Hiring Day in the U.S., we targeted hiring 50,000 people. Actual results are coming in at 93,000 people that were hired. And that's increasing our staffing opportunities also for, of course, dayparts but also for the peak hours. So we staffed up better. The new POS system, which is in 10,000 plus restaurants in the U.S., is also helping us from an ease of ordering perspective. And so we have been growing across all dayparts, but we definitely are growing at the lunch daypart as well."

That was on top of a mid-single digit comp last year in the quarter. So traffic and guest count movement, obviously, is very strong there. And key to that in the environment you mentioned, the high inflationary environment, is our everyday value. So our focus, as Don mentioned, I think it was late 2009 we introduced the Value Lunch in China. And now, a renewed focus on value at breakfast, with a RMB 6 muffin and coffee offering, and recently introducing a snacking value menu around RMB 7 and up from there. So, all efforts to drive traffic, yet that the same time, realizing that with input costs rising, we do have to do something to maintain our profitability there. So we did, in July, look at adjusting prices. And when you take some of the products that move to the value menu which effectively were price reductions with some of the other actions, it did net out into a net price increase. But early days, we're seeing no negative impact from that."

We do have to be cognizant of our supply chain and be able to make sure that we have ample fruit supply before we move into those, and our supply chain team is doing a great job of readying us for that. So we're looking at the smoothies and some of the other products for their applicability. But at the same token, some of the premium sandwiches that we've seen in other areas of the world. The U.S. team is looking at some of those, whether they be sandwiches like the McWraps or 1955, to basically augment the existing menu pipeline that's in the U.S. right now.

So we've got quite a few things that are taking place that really supported us. The other benefit that we had was there was a holiday shift in Germany, particularly it was across Europe, but in Germany particularly where in the month of May, we saw some negative impact from some of the shifts of holidays.

And generally, that's been the case around the world. So we've been very cautious. We've used our tools, we've looked at all of the other indicators that guide us whether it be grocery store inflation or food away from home and what's going on with competitors and unemployment rates, et cetera. So we've been judicious, and I think as a result of that, we're getting good reaction and good flow through on those price increases. And in terms of is that changing consumer behavior per se, I would say no because we aren't seeing any dramatic spike in the usage of our dollar menus. That would be one indicator.

The new stores -- and this is not unique to China, but a new store tends to open at a lower margin than the market average. And then over a couple of years, as the comps build, then it gets to the market average. And that's what we're seeing in China. So we are actually, this quarter, the new store mix was less of a drag on the margin than it was in the first quarter. So it's a combination.

You see that Russia is growing but still not at some of the historic rates, and that's due to austerity measures. So what you see -- what we see across Europe -- and it's also a mix in consumer confidence. So you look in the U.K., consumer confidence is eroding a bit, Germany is going up a little bit, France is fairly flat. So it's an interesting set of markets relative to all the economic indicators. For our business, as we move forward, we just continue to focus on being able to have, first of all, value at each tier, bring forward some new innovative news in terms of our menu, at the same time, make sure that from a convenience factor, we're there, and from a base value factor, we're right there for the consumers across Europe. And so right now, still a mixed bag, second half of the year. It depends upon to what happens with some of the additional austerity measures. Some of the markets like Portugal are looking at increased VAT. So it's -- we do have to continue to watch what takes place with some of the austerity measures, and make sure we're prepared from a value perspective and from an operating perspective."

The 2012, it's still too early for me to give you a number, but directionally, my guess is we would see the basket up again in 2012. I think the anomaly of having a large decrease in our basket that we saw in 2010, I'm afraid those days are behind us for a while. And so as we think about price increases for the rest of this year, and we also have to think about what is coming in commodity cost in 2012 and beyond, our suppliers are, as they always do, looking at the markets and putting on positions where it makes appropriate to help lock-in and secure some of that predictability to our pricing in 2012.

So if the mix has stayed basically the same, now what's happened is we've got a lot more customers coming into the restaurants. So that part is good. We're still seeing a bunch of same mix there. Clearly, we're selling more beverages and seeing more of those kind of transactions, which is very good for us. But all in all, the mix is not varied that much. And I think the balance of being able to talk about core products and premium products like Angus, along with beverages, along with value has helped us to manage that mix."

Securing that tenure forever and that occupancy costs forever is our goal. So in terms of 2011, we do have a greater proportion of purchased sites than we had in 2010, primarily in Europe where we focused a little bit more. I still say that our expectation was maybe we'd see a little bit more distressed real estate on the market or opportunity to buy sites that maybe we couldn't in the past. But we really aren't seeing that to a meaningful degree, so nothing dramatically different in that regard. We'll continue to focus.

I'm pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald's which highlight our continued strength. For the third quarter, global comparable sales were up 5% in constant currency operating income increased 8% and EPS increased 6% to $1.45.
Our global success continues with every area in the world contributing. In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter were up 4.4% and operating income grew 6%. 
In Europe, comparable sales for the quarter increased 4.9% and operating income grew 6% in constant currencies. And it Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, comp sales for the quarter increased 3.4% and operating income grew 15% constant currencies.
And our momentum, I'm happy to say, it's continuing into October with global comparable sales expected to be up 4% to 5%.
McDonald's continues to drive results around the world by offering what customers are looking for today, more than ever. Great value, outstanding convenience, a modern restaurant experience and relevant, great tasting menu offerings. 
Our entire system of franchisees, suppliers and employers are aligned around our Plan to Win. And we continue to focus on executing at the highest level against our 3 global priorities. Optimizing the menu with the right food and Beverage offerings. Modernizing the customer and employee experience by upgrading every aspect of our restaurants from service to designs. And broadening accessibility through continued convenience and value initiatives.
Now as I've said before, it's not just 1 initiative but a combination of all of them that continue to drive our growth. In the area menu, we're staying focused on the right balance of core products and new offerings are helping us stay relevant with consumers. We've continue to build on our equity in chicken. In the United States, this quarter, McNugget units were up nearly 10% over last year as we featured for new dipping sauces. In addition, our premium chicken sandwich line with the new flavor profile, and bakery style whole grain bun continued to perform strongly.
In Australia, we launched 2 new chicken offerings a chicken and cheese snack and one with a bone-in McWings. In both have been strong sellers. And in Japan, a renewed chicken tatsuta, a chicken sandwich helped grow sales. 
Beverages also remain on opportunity around the world. In the United States, we energized our McCafe line with 2 additions; frozen Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple Real Fruit Smoothie. These new offerings added to our specialty Beverage lineup, helped to increase total McCafe Beverage sales by 16% over last summer's strong numbers.
McCafe is expanding globally as well. We're building the business across Europe where we have more than 1,400 McCafes with Germany, leading the way over 750. In APNEA, Australia has 650 McCafe's and we're are planning to had approximately 250 China by years end. And while international McCafe's are focused on hot beverages right now, we have a number of markets planning to test our ad real smoothies and freppes over the next few years starting with Australia next month period your
Our practice continues to be an important daypart for McDonald's as well as an opportunity for the future. In China, breakfast is achieving double-digit comparable sales increases, and today has reached over 8% of sales. Europe has only begun to scratch the surface with the U.K. continuing to experience strong sales results of 13% of sales. And in the U.S., where breakfast represtents about 25% of sales, we've focused consumers in our lineup of offerings from oatmeal to Egg McMuffin to our yogurt parfait and fruit and walnut salad. 
Total units on all of these parks combined to increase more than 20% over last year and helped us to continue making gains during this very important part of the day. 
In addition, premium products have continued to deliver results with France being the most recent market to launch McWraps. These are large wraps with chicken or beef that performed well across Europe. 
Rounding out our menu news, Europe drove results with the use of customer focus food events often featuring premium products. The U.K. built sales with a successful summer food event highlighted by the return to the bacon chicken onion sandwich.
Leveraging the the success experienced in Europe, the U.S. is planning a number promotional food events in 2012 that will feature new food news. 
Around the world, our markets are also making gains through strong experience in accessibility initiatives. Europe is furthest along in modernizing the restaurants with new and relevant designs to provide customers with a great experience. Each area of the world has benefited from Europe's experience and are making steady progress. 
Meanwhile, all of our top markets continued their trend of improving customer satisfaction scores. Through a stronger focus on operations and service and technology such as our new POS ordering system which elevates speed and accuracy and is now in nearly all restaurants here in the United States.
On the accessibility front, we're staying focused on serving more customers more often in a variety of ways. Across all geographies, we continue to expand our extended hours in order to be able to be open and available when and where our customers want us to be. We're also growing capacity, especially at the drive-thru. Drive-thru optimization help drive results across APMEA, with countries such as Australia, Japan registering Lipton sales with a focus on their service excellence at the drive-thru.
In the U.S., we are also elevating their commitment to drive-thru by side-by-side drive-thru where real estate will allow handheld order takers where space is limited. We're also running our accessibility but continue to offer the most relevant value. Our value programs in breakfast and lunch continue to be important to growth across APMEA including astrologist made gains from its new value campaign.
In all of our major markets in Europe continue to focus on the value provided by their popular mid-tier offerings from little tasters in the U.K. to Snack Deluxe in Germany, to in France. With new flavors and promotions we're keeping these lines fresh and engaging for customers and elevating our position as a leader in great taste and quality at a great value.
We recognize today that the environment out there is still fragile. The economists say we're officially out of the recession. But it hardly feels that way. Unemployment is back up over 9% here in the U.S. and in similar rates around the world. 
The stock market just ended its worst quarter in two years in many major economies are barely growing, if at all. Consumers everywhere continue to be cautious and hesistant to spend and the informal meeting out industry is growing in a very slow pace. So we remain in a market share something with every something continuing to be hard-won. But we plan to keep winning pick apart the examples I highlighted from across our system demonstrated how we strategically have strengthened our business in a comprehensive way. We remain committed to listening to our customers and eating their needs at every turn whether it's in today's environment or down the road as the economy improves. 
Now moving forward, we're equally committed to maintaining a strong financial foundation and maximizing value for our shareholders. Our intent remains to return all of our free cash flow after reinvestment to investors through a combination it combination of dividends and share repurchases. We recently announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.70 per share or the equivalent of $2.80 annually.
And combined with share repurchases, we expect returned total cash to shareholders 2011 to reach approximately $6 billion.
I'd like to say overall I'm very pleased with our latest quarterly performance while the economic recovery continues to be fragile around the world, we stay focused on what we can control, staying committed to our winning plans and delivering an exceptional experience  for our more than 64 million customers around the world every day.
I'm confident that by continuing to innovate, invest and execute, we will help to continue delighting our customers in growing our business around the world. Thank you and now I'll turn it over to Pete Benson, our CFO."

McDonald's continued to deliver solid results despite another quarter marked by rising cost and macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. We're successfully navigating through this environment because of our alignment and focus around the Plan to Win. This continues to yield significant increases in comparable sales, market share and operating income. Through the first nine months, revenues increased 8% in constant currency, and over that same period, our combined operating margin increased 40 basis points to 31.8%.
This 80% of our 33,000 restaurants are franchised our profitability is primarily driven by franchise margins. In third quarter, franchise margins reached $1.9 billion, an increase of $133 million in constant currency with each area of the world contributing to this growth. The franchise margin percentage for the quarter rose 40 basis points to 83.7%, driven by positive comparable sales.
Global company operating margin dollars increased $26 million in constant currencies for the quarter to $972 million. The margin percentage decreased 100 basis points to 20% as strong comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs, primary commodities. 
On compco margin percentage remains an impressive level considering the current operating environment. 
In the U.S., company operating margins declined 19 basis points to 21.1% for the third quarter due to an 8% rise in commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, higher occupancy and other costs partly offset by positive comparable sales.
The third quarter margin percentage benefited by about 40 basis points due to the recognition of a special payroll tax credit created by the Higher Act. 
These prices, which typically moderate after the summer, have remained high. As a result, we now expect commodity costs in the U.S. to be up a little more than previously expected. 4.5% to 5% for the full-year with fourth quarter increases easing compared to second and third quarter.
Partially offsetting the rising cost are the 2 price increases taken thus far in 2011, the 1% increase in March and the 1.4% increase at the end of May. We're are seeing good flow through to the bottom line for these increases. 
In addition, food at home inflation is rising faster than food away from home, which might allow for additional pricing actions in the near-term. We will continue to evaluate additional price increases in light of this inflationary environment, always balancing our goal of driving balancing traffic and market share gains with effectively managing the impact of rising costs. 
As we we look at the 2012, we expect commodity cost increases in the U.S. to be similar to this years..
In Europe, third quarter company operating margins declined 110 basis points to 20.9%, primarily due to a higher commodity and labor costs, also partly offset by positive comparable sales. In addition to prudently managing cost across the continent, our European management team has developed effective marketing plans that feature value throughout the menu to drive sales.
In third quarter, several premium products offered in our predominantly reimaged interiors were showcased within promotional food events. This included the Big Tasty in France, the Stars of America in Germany, and the launch of the premium 1955 hamburger in the U.K.
Our price increases vary across the 40 European markets. Russia, which is experiencing higher inflation is an outlier. Most other [Audio Gap] 
cash back into our business to drive future growth and returns. Our restaurant development teams are making excellent progress against their plans for re-imaging and building new restaurants, taking advantage of improved tools and capabilities. As a result, we are slightly increasing our 2011 capital expenditure guidance to $2.6 billion. Reimaging remains an immense opportunity for us because the majority far exteriors and interiors do not reflect our current contemporary look. 
We continue to make progress across the globe with our reimaging efforts. As of last week, we have completed over 363 reimages in the U.S. and given what we have under construction, we are on track to complete and likely exceed 600 by the end of the year. On average, it is taking about eight weeks to complete the exterior and interior reimaging. And as we head into the winter months, construction times will likely increase.
During construction, the front counter is often closed for a period, but in nearly all cases, the drive-thru remains open to midnight minimize any filled
Most of the other owner operators who have committed to reimaging their restaurants this year sought to avoid construction during the busy summer months. That explains why over 270 projects have broken ground since Labor Day. 
Our owner operators remain committed to reimaging. Our pipeline of projects is growing because they also view this as an important evolution of our brand. I think it also speaks for their long-term commitment to making the necessary investments to keep McDonald's increasingly relevant to our customers. 
In Europe, we have reimaged over 600 restaurants through September. Brands plan to have all of its interiors and half of its exteriors reimaged by the end of this year. In the U.K. expects nearly all of its restaurants will be reimaged by the end of 2012, having just recently completed its 1000th project.
In APMEA, we're also making significant reimaging part progress having completed approximately 100 images in both Japan and China. Currently, about 20% of China's store base reflects the updated image, but with new restaurant openings and planned reimages, that number should approach what he percent by the end of next year.
We expect to open between 1,100 and 1,200 new restaurants this year on our base of 33,000, an increase over for 3%. New openings in new areas of the world include over 150 in the U.S., more than 225 in Europe and about 650 in APMEA. China is on track to finish near the upper end of the 175 to to 200 new opening range.
Lastly, let's turn to foreign currency translation, which positively impacted third quarter results by $0.08. At current exchange rates, we expect full-year EPS to benefit by about $0.20 which implies a minimal fourth-quarter EPS benefit. But as I always say, this is directional guidance only, given the volatility we are experiencing.
Our third quarter and nine-month results are a testament to the strength of the Plan to Win and its effectiveness in a persistently challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment. Our business model is resilient. The alignment within our system is strong and we are seizing opportunities now to secure an even brighter future for McDonald's. I remain confident that we will continue to drive value for our shareholders over the long-term. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy  to begin our Q&A period."

Because of our business model and the way we're are structured, the everyday affordability, as we like to say, our customers getting pinched everywhere. They shouldn't get that at McDonald's.

Yes, we take a look at what competitors are doing but not because we will necessarily make a decision based on that, but we take all things into consideration as we look across the marketplace. But mostly, it's about this index of food at home and away from home, and we are very judicious about price increases because retaining everyday affordability, particularly in the environment that we're are in today is paramount. And we have a pricing model that we use very, very effectively. And yet it takes intuition and gut feeling about what would pull the trigger on these kind of things. And we take all of those factors into consideration because our pricing model around our commodity cost and our supply chain and our ability to sort of manage the impact of those costs at the restaurant level is very open to us.

But it's definitely at the same time you got more stores then are maturing to help offset that. So again, it's not dramatic, but it is something we keep an eye on. But it is performing consistent with how other markets performed during their kind of their development ramp-up phase. And in terms of the reimaging across Europe, similar to the U.S. those first-year comps are up 6% to 7% ahead of the marketplace. And if you've seen the results in Europe over the last couple of years, sales continue to grow in that regard. We're comfortable we're still seeing sales increases above the market in those restaurants. And yet, there's more than that just that sales increased to drive improvement in the customers attitude about McDonald's and the surroundings they're in, their perception of the cleanliness of the restaurant, the quality of service and food.

But the 1 thing you have to consider is certainly in the U.S. when we flip the calendar to January of 2011, we had 0 pricing increases rolling over from the previous year whereas when we flip the calendar to 2012, those first two months will have the benefit of the previous 12 months of price increases that we've taken in the U.S. So that's certainly a factor and something we consider as we think about price increases, frankly, the rest of this year. And I think something similar in Europe, why we don't have the preliminary estimate nailed down quite yet in Europe with the volatility and some of the currency markets over there in the commodities, they're going to have a year probably that's similar or little bit better than the U.S., from a cost side.

And so while we knew the third quarter was going to be the highest cost increase quarter in the year, heading into that quarter, and that's what we had messaged in July, it actually primarily because the beef costs, which as you know has historically is our least-protected and hedged item, that drove the increases. So you're not seeing a 200 basis point deviation from our expectations in the fourth quarter on cost increases. It's actually much closer than that. And you know we're not going to get into item by item, how much of this is protected. But we've consistently said that beef is the wildcard for us in terms of it has the least amount of locked-in in pricing. And so we didn't see the traditional falloff in prices after the summer season that we've historically seen. And that falloff frankly was built in in our last forecast. But it's manageable for us.

Relative to overall menu development and new product news, the U.S. is probably going to continue to talk about breakfast, they'll talk about big sandwiches and other mid-tier. The problem we have with a company like McDonald's is that the expectation around communication around all those things is expected by our consumers. And providing them that choice on the menu has to continue to get better, not get stale or go soft. And so I expect that we will continue to communicate strongly around all of those dayparts and all of those menu platforms."

And we have not changed our philosophy around that in 55 years. And so the headline is, that it continues to be very, very good. It is has bobbed very slightly this year but its offer record high last year. And the franchisees I think are very, very pleased. And particularly when you look at the alignment of the organization around our initiatives which we colaborate on very closely first of all we don't make decisions here in the center and then bark out orders up to our franchisees, they're part of the process and the Plan to Win. And to profitability, regarding those initiatives, it is always a factor as we move forward with progress sustainable growth of the organization which revolves around the cash flow for the franchisees. So it's a very good place right now and continues to be in a good place. And much of this because of the system support for the franchisee profitability, as we talked earlier about supply chain and locking in food costs that are going to be appropriate for them to be able to maintain some level of cash flow that's important to them.

And so that's continued to grow and be very, very effective for us. But that's been the case really forever around here. Relative to daypart growth, we've had daypart growth really across the board. And I talked in my comments about the growth around the breakfast and some of the items, the Egg McMuffin and the value items in the nutritional items, oatmeal and the rest. And so -- and we're very balanced in our communication with our consumers around these things without -- because we don't have the luxury of pushing 1 side of the business versus another side of the business because we've got such high hurdles to really get over regarding the overall experience throughout the entire business day.

Secondly, on the McCafe, we've served beverages around the world differently forever, really. So if you take McCafe, McCafe is really started in Australia. McCafe has expanded in Europe. Europe really had what they would call their McCafe program before that United States. And so the United States version of course in line with the front counter so we can facilitate drive-thru, these are all really different concepts. And yet with the expansion of the blended iced drinks and smoothies and the other kinds of things into the markets around the world, I would say that as we review our plans coming up in the next month or so for 2012 from the area of the worlds, I would doubt whether they really have that quantified to the extent where I would be able to tell you that expectation is on a store by store basis. The reason why we quantified it the way we did for the United States is because you asked us to, 1. And 2, because at a wholesale basis, we were rolling out something that was going to impact nearly 14,000 stores. And so we were capable of doing it that way because it was a unified program that was consistent throughout every store. We don't have that same experience in every store other than the fact that if you're selling fruit smoothies, that might be consistent, but the footprint platform, and the ability for us to be able to expand McCafe is somewhat different in every market."

I'm pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald's, which highlight our continued strength. For the third quarter, global comparable sales were up 5%, and constant currency's operating income increased 8%, and EPS increased 6% to $1.45.  
Our global success continues with every area in the world contributing. In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter were up 4.4%, and operating income grew 6%. In Europe, comparable sales for the quarter increased 4.9%, and operating income grew 6% in constant currencies. And in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, comp sales for the quarter increased 3.4%, and operating income grew 15% in constant currencies. And our momentum, I'm happy to say, is continuing into October with global comparable sales expected to be up 4% to 5%.
McDonald's continues to drive results around the world by offering what customers are looking for today more than ever: great value, outstanding convenience, a modern restaurant experience and relevant, great-tasting menu offerings. 
Our entire system of franchisees, suppliers and employers are aligned around our Plan to Win. And we continue to focus on executing at the highest level against our 3 global priorities: optimizing the menu with the right food and beverage offerings; modernizing the customer and employee experience by upgrading every aspect of our restaurants from service to designs; and broadening accessibility through continued convenience and value initiatives. Now as I've said before, it's not just one initiative but a combination of all of them that continue to drive our growth. 
In the area of menu, we're seeing focused on the right balance of core products and new offerings are helping us stay relevant with consumers. We've continue to build on our equity in chicken. In the United States, this quarter, McNugget units were up nearly 10% over last year as we featured 4 new dipping sauces. In addition, our premium chicken sandwich line with the new flavor profile and bakery-style whole grain bun continued to perform strongly.
In Australia, we launched 2 new chicken offerings, a chicken and cheese snack and one with the bone-in McWings. And both have been strong sellers. And in Japan, a renewed focus on Chicken Tatsuta, a chicken sandwich helped grow sales. 
Beverages also remain on opportunity around the world. In the United States, we energized our McCafé line with 2 additions: Frozen Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple Real Fruit Smoothies. These new offerings added to our specialty Beverage lineup, helped to increase total McCafé beverage sales by 16% over last summer's strong numbers.
McCafé is expanding globally as well. We're building the business across Europe, where we have more than 1,400 McCafés with Germany, leading the way at over 750. In APMEA, Australia has 650 McCafés, and we're planning to have approximately 250 in China by year's end. And while international McCafés are focused on hot beverages right now, we have a number of markets planning to test or add real fruit smoothies and frappes over the next few years, starting with Australia next month. 
Our practice continues to be an important day part for McDonald's as well as an opportunity for the future. In China, breakfast is achieving double-digit comparable sales increases, and today has reached over 80% of sales. Europe has only begun to scratch the surface, with the U.K. continuing to experience strong sales results of 13% of sales. And in the U.S., where breakfast represents about 25% of sales, we've focused consumers in our lineup of wholesome offerings, from oatmeal and Egg McMuffin to our Yogurt Parfait and Fruit and Walnut salad.  Total units on all of these products combined to increase more than 20% over last year and helped us to continue making gains during this very important part of the day. 
In addition, premium products have continued to deliver results, with France being the most recent market-to-launch McWraps. These are large wraps with chicken or beef that have performed well across Europe. 
Rounding out our menu news, Europe drove results with the use of customer-focused food events often featuring premium products. The U.K. built sales with a successful summer food event, highlighted by the return of the bacon chicken onion sandwich leveraging the success experienced in Europe, the U.S. is planning a number promotional food events in 2012 that will feature new food news. 
Around the world, our markets are also making gains through strong experience in accessibility initiatives. Europe is furthest along in modernizing their restaurants with new and relevant designs to provide customers with a great experience. Each area of the world has benefited from Europe's experience and are making steady progress. 
Meanwhile, all of our top markets continued their trend of improving customer satisfaction scores through a stronger focus on operations and service and technology, such as our new POS ordering system, which elevates speed and accuracy and is now in nearly all restaurants here in the United States.
On the accessibility front, we're staying focused on serving more customers more often in a variety of ways. Across all geographies, we continue to expand our extended hours in order to be able to be open and available when and where our customers want us to be. We're also growing capacity, especially at the drive-thru. Drive-thru optimizations help drive results across APMEA, with countries such as Australia, and Japan registering the Lipton sales with a focus on their service excellence at the drive-thru.  In the U.S., we're also elevating their commitment to drive-thru by side-by-side drive-thrus, where real estate will allow on handheld order takers where space is limited. 
We're also broadening our accessibility by continuing to offer the most relevant value. Our value programs in breakfast and lunch continue to be important to growth across APMEA, including Australia which has made gains from its new value campaign.
And all of our major markets in Europe continue to focus on the value provided by their popular mid-tier offerings, from Little Tasters in the U.K. to Snack Deluxe in Germany to P’tits Plaisirs in France. With new flavors and promotions, we're keeping these lines fresh and engaging for customers and elevating our position as a leader in great taste and quality at a great value.
We recognize today that the environment out there is still fragile. The economists say we're officially out of the recession. But it hardly feels that way. Unemployment is back up over 9% here in the U.S. and in similar rates around the world. 
The stock market just ended its worst quarter in 2 years, and many major economies are barely growing, if at all. Consumers everywhere continue to be cautious and hesitant to spend, and the informal eating-out industry is growing at a very slow pace. So we remain in a market share bell with every victory continuing to be hard won. 
But we plan to keep winning. The examples I highlighted from across our system demonstrate how we strategically have strengthened our business in a comprehensive way. We remain committed to listening to our customers in meeting their needs at every turn, whether it's in today's environment or down the road as the economy improves. 
Now moving forward, we're equally committed to maintaining a strong financial foundation and maximizing value for our shareholders. Our intent remains to return all of our free cash flow after reinvestment to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We recently announced a 15% increase on our quarterly cash dividend to $0.70 per share or the equivalent of $2.80 annually. And combined with share repurchases, we expect to total -- returned total cash to shareholders to 2011 to reach approximately $6 billion.
I'd like to say, overall, I'm very pleased with our latest quarterly performance. While the economic recovery continues to be fragile around the world, we stay focused on what we can control, staying committed to our winning plans and delivering an exceptional experience for our more than 64 million customers around the world every day.
I'm confident that by continuing to innovate, invest and execute, we will help to continue delighting our customers in growing our business around the world. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Pete Bensen, our CFO."

McDonald's continued to deliver solid results despite another quarter marked by rising cost and macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. We're successfully navigating through this environment because of our alignment and focus around the Plan to Win. This continues to yield significant increases in comparable sales, market share and operating income. Through the first nine months, revenues increased 8% in constant currency. And over that same period, our combined operating margin increased 40 basis points to 31.8%.
This 80% of our 33,000 restaurants are franchised. Our profitability is primarily driven by franchise margins. In the third quarter, franchise margins reached $1.9 billion, an increase of $133 million in constant currency, with each area of the world contributing to this growth. The franchise margin percentage for the quarter rose 40 basis points to 83.7%, driven by positive comparable sales.
Global company operating margin dollars increased to $26 million in constant currencies for the quarter to $972 million. The margin percentage decreased 100 basis points to 20% as strong comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs, primarily commodities. 
Our McOpCo margin percentage remains at impressive levels considering the current operating environment. 
In the U.S., the company operating margins declined 90 basis points to 21.1% for the third quarter due to an 8% rise in commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, higher occupancy and other costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. The third quarter margin percentage benefited by about 40 basis points due to the recognition of a special payroll tax credit created by the HIRE Act. 
These prices, which typically moderate after the summer, have remained high. As a result, we now expect commodity cost in the U.S. to be up a little more than previously expected, 4.5% to 5% for the full year, with fourth quarter increases easing compared to second and third quarter.
Partially offsetting the rising cost are the 2 price increases taken thus far in 2011, the 1% increase in March and the 1.4% increase at the end of May. We're seeing good flow-through to the bottom line from these increases.  In addition, food-at-home inflation is rising faster than food away from home, which might allow for additional pricing actions in the near term. We will continue to evaluate additional price increases in light of this inflationary environment, always balancing our goal of driving traffic and market share gains with effectively managing the impact of rising costs. As we look into 2012, we expect commodity cost increases in the U.S. to be similar to this year's.
In Europe, third quarter company operating margins declined 110 basis points to 20.9%, primarily due to higher commodity and labor costs, also partly offset by positive comparable sales. In addition to prudently managing cost across the continent, our European management team has developed effective marketing plans that feature value throughout the menu to drive sales.
In third quarter, several premium products, offered in our predominantly reimaged interiors, were showcased within promotional food events. This included the Big Tasty in France, the Stars of America in Germany and the launch of the premium 1955 hamburger in the U.K. 
Our price increases vary across the 40 European markets. Russia, which is experiencing higher inflation, is an outlier. Most other European markets are averaging year-over-year price increases around 2%. As we consider future price increases, we remain mindful of the extreme economic uncertainty, cautious consumer sentiment amidst the austerity measures and shrinking disposable income. we will continue to monitor this closely, aware of the ongoing inflationary pressures, while doing what is right to the long-term health of our business. Similar to the U.S., Europe slightly increases estimate for the full year commodity cost increase to 4.5% to 5% primarily due to higher beef costs. this implies the fourth quarter increase slightly above the annual guidance. 
Turning to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, the company operating margins for the quarter decreased 50 basis points to 18.4%, also reflecting inflationary cost pressures partially offset by comparable sales increases. similar to the first half of the year, the acceleration of new restaurants, openings in China, negatively impacted this segment's margin percentage. 
Menu continues to be a significant driver of comparable sales growth in APMEA. Innovative locally relevant product offerings of chicken, the dominant protein in this region, as well as breakfast, compelling value offerings and a sustained core menu focus are building loyalty among our customer base. Strong consistent financial performance from our unique business model generates meaningful amounts of cash flow. We reinvest the significant amount of this cash back into our business to drive future growth and returns. 
Our restaurant development teams are making excellent progress against their plans for reimaging and building new restaurants, taking advantage of improved tools and capabilities. As a result, we are slightly increasing our 2011 capital expenditure guidance to $2.6 billion. Reimaging remains an immense opportunity for us because the majority of our exteriors and interiors do not reflect our current contemporary look. 
We continue to make progress across the globe on our reimaging efforts. As of last week, we have completed over 360 reimages in the U.S., and given what we have under construction, we are on track to complete and likely exceed 600 by the end of the year. On average, it is taking about 8 weeks to complete the exterior and interior reimaging. And as we head into the winter months, construction times will likely increase.
During construction, the front counter is often closed for a period. But in nearly all cases, the drive-thru remains open to minimize any sales declines. Most of the other owner operators who have committed to reimaging their restaurants this year sought to avoid construction during the busy summer months. That explains why over 270 projects have broken ground since Labor Day. 
Our owner operators remain committed to reimaging. Our pipeline of projects is growing because they also view this as an important evolution of our brand. I think it also speaks to their long-term commitment to making the necessary investments to keep McDonald's increasingly relevant to our customers. 
In Europe, we have reimaged over 600 restaurants through September. Brands plan to have all of this interiors and half of its exteriors reimaged by the end of this year. And the U.K. expects nearly all of its restaurants will be reimaged by the end of 2012, having just recently completed its 1000th project.
In the APMEA, we're also making significant reimaging progress, having completed approximately 100 reimages in both Japan and China. Currently, about 20% of China's store base reflects the updated image. But with new restaurant openings and planned reimages, that number should approach what 40% by the end of next year.
We expect to open between 1,100 and 1,200 new restaurants this year on our base of 33,000, an increase of over 3%. New openings by areas of the world include over 150 in the U.S., more than 225 in Europe and about 650 in APMEA. China is on track to finish near the upper end of the 175 to 200 new opening range.
Lastly, let's turn to foreign currency translation, which positively impacted third quarter results by $0.08. At current exchange rates, we expect full year EPS to benefit by about $0.20, which implies a minimal fourth quarter EPS benefit. But as I always say, this is directional guidance only, given the volatility we are experiencing.
Our third quarter and nine-month results are a testament to the strength of the Plan to Win and its effectiveness in a persistently challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment. Our business model is resilient. The alignment within our system is strong, and we are seizing opportunities now to secure an even brighter future for McDonald's. I remain confident that we will continue to drive value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A."

And so, we continue to be confident in our initiatives there. And we're not seeing a big impact, really, to our guest counts and the growth in the marketplaces with some of the austerity measures and some of the economic issues that are there, that are impacting certainly discretionary income. And so, it's been actually a good example of how well our business model adapts in these various marketplaces around the world and in different kinds of economic environments we find ourselves in, which is been our history. As you know, it's not the first time we've had to deal with these kinds of things around the world. We've had our presence in Europe for a long time and have gone through various ups and downs in the economies and yet, have been able to deliver steady performance on behalf of brand McDonald's. Because of our business model and the way we're structured, the everyday affordability, as we like to say, our customer's getting pinched everywhere. They shouldn't get that at McDonald's. And even these austerity measures and the lifestyles in Europe, although they can be more harsh in some environments than others, I think the standard of living and the discretionary income has to be impacted very, very severely for us to start to feel that impact at the McDonald's front counter and drive-thru."

First of all, the way we've developed in China in the major cities, where we're mainly focused, is through developments, if you will. So the Chinese are very disciplined around developing new retail outlets and a whole combination of things. They do these like cities, if you will. And so, we go into those because we know we need to be there, but in fact, we go in there early as compared to the overall developments. So you're going to see a benefit, I think, in year 2 or 3 on some of those new stores, which should start to have an impact on that overall margin relative to the new store growth. And it's the best way for us to develop the market because we need to be in those environments. But it takes a little time for them to come on, as the other population retail engagement in those properties begin to come online in a meaningful way."

It maybe 10 basis points higher in China because of some of the specifics Jim mentioned. But generally, they start out a little bit lower, and then by the third year, they've pretty much caught up to the market average. So if you think about what we're doing in China from a development standpoint, we opened 166 last year. We're going to open close to 200 or 200 this year. That kind of incremental ramp up in new stores is really what's kind of causing that impact as we continue to increase the number of openings next year, while slightly have more impact. But it's definitely, at the same time, you've got more stores that are maturing to help offset that. So again, it's not dramatic, but it is something we keep an eye on but is performing consistent with how other markets performed during their kind of their development ramp-up phase. And in terms of the reimaging across Europe, similar to the U.S., those first year comps are up 6% to 7% ahead of the marketplace. And if you've seen the results in Europe over the last couple of years, sales continue to grow in that regard. So we're comfortable that we're still seeing sales increases above the market in those restaurants. And yet, there's more than that just that sales increase that drives improvement in the customer's attitude about McDonald's and the surroundings they're in, their perception of the cleanliness of the restaurant, the quality of service and the food. So it helps build that customer loyalty and drive more repeat business. So it's performing the way we had hoped and expected it to."

They were up 6% in the second quarter and about 1% in the first. So it's by far was the worst quarter. Europe was up about 5% for the quarter, which was kind of similar to the second quarter for them. But the one thing you have to consider is, certainly, in the U.S., when we flip the calendar to January of 2011, we had 0 pricing increases rolling over from the previous year. Whereas, when we flip the calendar to 2012, those first 2 months will have the benefit of the previous 12 months of price increases that we've taken in the U.S. So that's certainly a factor and something we consider as we think about price increases, frankly, the rest of this year. And I think something similar in Europe, why we don't have the a preliminary estimate nailed down quite yet in Europe with the volatility and some of the currency markets over there and the commodities, they're going to have a year probably that's similar or maybe a little bit better than the U.S. from a cost side. But we'll have an opportunity to refine that and maybe share it at the analyst meeting. But it's going to continue to be, as we look at what is going on in the marketplace, is the consumer in a place that we're comfortable, we can continue to add price increases or continue to monitor the impact on them. If you look, as Jim made some comments about Europe, with everything going on there daily around the sovereign debt crisis and what's going on, especially in the 2 big markets we do business in that are, the ones that are supposed to bail out the continent, hearing that all the time in the press does play on the consumer psyche. So we'll continue to be mindful of that, and we'll do what's going to be best for the long-term business from a price side and managed the incurred [ph] cost as best as we can."

The one issue with the commodities is, we only give you guidance updates once a quarter. And so, you can't necessarily assume that all of the increase in our guidance is going to be felt in the fourth quarter, because we actually started experiencing that in August and September. And so, while we knew the third quarter was going to be probably the highest cost-increase quarter of the year, heading into that quarter, and that's what we had messaged in July. It actually, primarily, because of the beef costs, which as you know, historically, is our least protected and hedged item. That drove the increases. So you're not seeing a 200 basis point deviation from our expectations in the fourth quarter on cost increases. It's actually much closer than that. And we're not going to get into item by item, how much of this is protected. But we've consistently said that beef is the wildcard for us in terms of it has the least amount of locked-in pricing. And so, while we didn't see the traditional falloff in prices after the summer of grilling season that we've historically seen, and that falloff frankly was built into our last forecast. But it's manageable for us. And the good news is, in the fourth quarter in the U.S., those cost increases are going to be well below what they were in the second and third quarters. So that's good. And probably at the analyst meeting is when we'll start to give a first look at currency. To be honest with you, I haven't even formulated a view on that yet."

It's a very good place right now and continues to be in a good place.

And yet, with the expansion of the blended iced drinks and the smoothies and the other kinds of things into the markets around the world, I would say that, okay, as we review our plans coming up in the next month or so for 2012 from the area of the worlds, I would doubt whether they really have that quantified to the extent where I would be able to tell you what expectation is on a store-by-store basis. The reason why we quantified it the way we did for United States is because you asked us to, one. And two, because at a wholesale basis, we were rolling out something that was going to impact nearly 14,000 stores. And so, we were capable of doing it that way because it was a unified program that was consistent throughout every store. We don't have that same experience in every store other than the fact that if you're selling fruit smoothies, that might be consistent. But the footprint platform and the ability for us to be able to expand McCafé is somewhat different in every market."

I'm pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald's, which highlight our continued strength. For the third quarter, global comparable sales were up 5%, and constant currency's operating income increased 8%, and EPS increased 6% to $1.45.  
Our global success continues with every area in the world contributing. In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter were up 4.4%, and operating income grew 6%. In Europe, comparable sales for the quarter increased 4.9%, and operating income grew 6% in constant currencies. And in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, comp sales for the quarter increased 3.4%, and operating income grew 15% in constant currencies. And our momentum, I'm happy to say, is continuing into October with global comparable sales expected to be up 4% to 5%.
McDonald's continues to drive results around the world by offering what customers are looking for today more than ever: great value, outstanding convenience, a modern restaurant experience and relevant, great-tasting menu offerings. 
Our entire system of franchisees, suppliers and employers are aligned around our Plan to Win. And we continue to focus on executing at the highest level against our 3 global priorities: optimizing the menu with the right food and beverage offerings; modernizing the customer and employee experience by upgrading every aspect of our restaurants from service to designs; and broadening accessibility through continued convenience and value initiatives. Now as I've said before, it's not just one initiative but a combination of all of them that continue to drive our growth. 
In the area of menu, we're seeing focused on the right balance of core products and new offerings are helping us stay relevant with consumers. We've continue to build on our equity in chicken. In the United States, this quarter, McNugget units were up nearly 10% over last year as we featured 4 new dipping sauces. In addition, our premium chicken sandwich line with the new flavor profile and bakery-style whole grain bun continued to perform strongly.
In Australia, we launched 2 new chicken offerings, a chicken and cheese snack and one with the bone-in McWings. And both have been strong sellers. And in Japan, a renewed focus on Chicken Tatsuta, a chicken sandwich helped grow sales. 
Beverages also remain on opportunity around the world. In the United States, we energized our McCafé line with 2 additions: Frozen Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple Real Fruit Smoothies. These new offerings added to our specialty Beverage lineup, helped to increase total McCafé beverage sales by 16% over last summer's strong numbers.
McCafé is expanding globally as well. We're building the business across Europe, where we have more than 1,400 McCafés with Germany, leading the way at over 750. In APMEA, Australia has 650 McCafés, and we're planning to have approximately 250 in China by year's end. And while international McCafés are focused on hot beverages right now, we have a number of markets planning to test or add real fruit smoothies and frappes over the next few years, starting with Australia next month. 
Our practice continues to be an important day part for McDonald's as well as an opportunity for the future. In China, breakfast is achieving double-digit comparable sales increases, and today has reached over 8% of sales. Europe has only begun to scratch the surface, with the U.K. continuing to experience strong sales results of 13% of sales. And in the U.S., where breakfast represents about 25% of sales, we've focused consumers in our lineup of wholesome offerings, from oatmeal and Egg McMuffin to our Yogurt Parfait and Fruit and Walnut salad.  Total units on all of these products combined to increase more than 20% over last year and helped us to continue making gains during this very important part of the day. 
In addition, premium products have continued to deliver results, with France being the most recent market-to-launch McWraps. These are large wraps with chicken or beef that have performed well across Europe. 
Rounding out our menu news, Europe drove results with the use of customer-focused food events often featuring premium products. The U.K. built sales with a successful summer food event, highlighted by the return of the bacon chicken onion sandwich leveraging the success experienced in Europe, the U.S. is planning a number promotional food events in 2012 that will feature new food news. 
Around the world, our markets are also making gains through strong experience in accessibility initiatives. Europe is furthest along in modernizing their restaurants with new and relevant designs to provide customers with a great experience. Each area of the world has benefited from Europe's experience and are making steady progress. 
Meanwhile, all of our top markets continued their trend of improving customer satisfaction scores through a stronger focus on operations and service and technology, such as our new POS ordering system, which elevates speed and accuracy and is now in nearly all restaurants here in the United States.
On the accessibility front, we're staying focused on serving more customers more often in a variety of ways. Across all geographies, we continue to expand our extended hours in order to be able to be open and available when and where our customers want us to be. We're also growing capacity, especially at the drive-thru. Drive-thru optimizations help drive results across APMEA, with countries such as Australia, and Japan registering the Lipton sales with a focus on their service excellence at the drive-thru.  In the U.S., we're also elevating their commitment to drive-thru by side-by-side drive-thrus, where real estate will allow on handheld order takers where space is limited. 
We're also broadening our accessibility by continuing to offer the most relevant value. Our value programs in breakfast and lunch continue to be important to growth across APMEA, including Australia which has made gains from its new value campaign.
And all of our major markets in Europe continue to focus on the value provided by their popular mid-tier offerings, from Little Tasters in the U.K. to Snack Deluxe in Germany to P’tits Plaisirs in France. With new flavors and promotions, we're keeping these lines fresh and engaging for customers and elevating our position as a leader in great taste and quality at a great value.
We recognize today that the environment out there is still fragile. The economists say we're officially out of the recession. But it hardly feels that way. Unemployment is back up over 9% here in the U.S. and in similar rates around the world. 
The stock market just ended its worst quarter in 2 years, and many major economies are barely growing, if at all. Consumers everywhere continue to be cautious and hesitant to spend, and the informal eating-out industry is growing at a very slow pace. So we remain in a market share battle, with every victory continuing to be hard won. 
But we plan to keep winning. The examples I highlighted from across our system demonstrate how we strategically have strengthened our business in a comprehensive way. We remain committed to listening to our customers in meeting their needs at every turn, whether it's in today's environment or down the road as the economy improves. 
Now moving forward, we're equally committed to maintaining a strong financial foundation and maximizing value for our shareholders. Our intent remains to return all of our free cash flow after reinvestment to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We recently announced a 15% increase on our quarterly cash dividend to $0.70 per share or the equivalent of $2.80 annually. And combined with share repurchases, we expect to total -- returned total cash to shareholders to 2011 to reach approximately $6 billion.
I'd like to say, overall, I'm very pleased with our latest quarterly performance. While the economic recovery continues to be fragile around the world, we stay focused on what we can control, staying committed to our winning plans and delivering an exceptional experience for our more than 64 million customers around the world every day.
I'm confident that by continuing to innovate, invest and execute, we will help to continue delighting our customers in growing our business around the world. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Pete Bensen, our CFO."

McDonald's continued to deliver solid results despite another quarter marked by rising cost and macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. We're successfully navigating through this environment because of our alignment and focus around the Plan to Win. This continues to yield significant increases in comparable sales, market share and operating income. Through the first nine months, revenues increased 8% in constant currency. And over that same period, our combined operating margin increased 40 basis points to 31.8%.
This 80% of our 33,000 restaurants are franchised. Our profitability is primarily driven by franchise margins. In the third quarter, franchise margins reached $1.9 billion, an increase of $133 million in constant currency, with each area of the world contributing to this growth. The franchise margin percentage for the quarter rose 40 basis points to 83.7%, driven by positive comparable sales.
Global company operating margin dollars increased to $26 million in constant currencies for the quarter to $972 million. The margin percentage decreased 100 basis points to 20% as strong comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs, primarily commodities. 
Our McOpCo margin percentage remains at impressive levels considering the current operating environment. 
In the U.S., the company operating margins declined 90 basis points to 21.1% for the third quarter due to an 8% rise in commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, higher occupancy and other costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. The third quarter margin percentage benefited by about 40 basis points due to the recognition of a special payroll tax credit created by the HIRE Act. 
These prices, which typically moderate after the summer, have remained high. As a result, we now expect commodity cost in the U.S. to be up a little more than previously expected, 4.5% to 5% for the full year, with fourth quarter increases easing compared to second and third quarter.
Partially offsetting the rising cost are the 2 price increases taken thus far in 2011, the 1% increase in March and the 1.4% increase at the end of May. We're seeing good flow-through to the bottom line from these increases.  In addition, food-at-home inflation is rising faster than food away from home, which might allow for additional pricing actions in the near term. We will continue to evaluate additional price increases in light of this inflationary environment, always balancing our goal of driving traffic and market share gains with effectively managing the impact of rising costs. As we look into 2012, we expect commodity cost increases in the U.S. to be similar to this year's.
In Europe, third quarter company operating margins declined 110 basis points to 20.9%, primarily due to higher commodity and labor costs, also partly offset by positive comparable sales. In addition to prudently managing cost across the continent, our European management team has developed effective marketing plans that feature value throughout the menu to drive sales.
In third quarter, several premium products, offered in our predominantly reimaged interiors, were showcased within promotional food events. This included the Big Tasty in France, the Stars of America in Germany and the launch of the premium 1955 hamburger in the U.K. 
Our price increases vary across the 40 European markets. Russia, which is experiencing higher inflation, is an outlier. Most other European markets are averaging year-over-year price increases around 2%. As we consider future price increases, we remain mindful of the extreme economic uncertainty, cautious consumer sentiment amidst the austerity measures and shrinking disposable income. we will continue to monitor this closely, aware of the ongoing inflationary pressures, while doing what is right to the long-term health of our business. Similar to the U.S., Europe slightly increases estimate for the full year commodity cost increase to 4.5% to 5% primarily due to higher beef costs. this implies the fourth quarter increase slightly above the annual guidance. 
Turning to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, the company operating margins for the quarter decreased 50 basis points to 18.4%, also reflecting inflationary cost pressures partially offset by comparable sales increases. similar to the first half of the year, the acceleration of new restaurants, openings in China, negatively impacted this segment's margin percentage. 
Menu continues to be a significant driver of comparable sales growth in APMEA. Innovative locally relevant product offerings of chicken, the dominant protein in this region, as well as breakfast, compelling value offerings and a sustained core menu focus are building loyalty among our customer base. Strong consistent financial performance from our unique business model generates meaningful amounts of cash flow. We reinvest the significant amount of this cash back into our business to drive future growth and returns. 
Our restaurant development teams are making excellent progress against their plans for reimaging and building new restaurants, taking advantage of improved tools and capabilities. As a result, we are slightly increasing our 2011 capital expenditure guidance to $2.6 billion. Reimaging remains an immense opportunity for us because the majority of our exteriors and interiors do not reflect our current contemporary look. 
We continue to make progress across the globe on our reimaging efforts. As of last week, we have completed over 360 reimages in the U.S., and given what we have under construction, we are on track to complete and likely exceed 600 by the end of the year. On average, it is taking about 8 weeks to complete the exterior and interior reimaging. And as we head into the winter months, construction times will likely increase.
During construction, the front counter is often closed for a period. But in nearly all cases, the drive-thru remains open to minimize any sales declines. Most of the other owner operators who have committed to reimaging their restaurants this year sought to avoid construction during the busy summer months. That explains why over 270 projects have broken ground since Labor Day. 
Our owner operators remain committed to reimaging. Our pipeline of projects is growing because they also view this as an important evolution of our brand. I think it also speaks to their long-term commitment to making the necessary investments to keep McDonald's increasingly relevant to our customers. 
In Europe, we have reimaged over 600 restaurants through September. France plan to have all of this interiors and half of its exteriors reimaged by the end of this year. And the U.K. expects nearly all of its restaurants will be reimaged by the end of 2012, having just recently completed its 1000th project.
In the APMEA, we're also making significant reimaging progress, having completed approximately 100 reimages in both Japan and China. Currently, about 20% of China's store base reflects the updated image. But with new restaurant openings and planned reimages, that number should approach what 40% by the end of next year.
We expect to open between 1,100 and 1,200 new restaurants this year on our base of 33,000, an increase of over 3%. New openings by areas of the world include over 150 in the U.S., more than 225 in Europe and about 650 in APMEA. China is on track to finish near the upper end of the 175 to 200 new opening range.
Lastly, let's turn to foreign currency translation, which positively impacted third quarter results by $0.08. At current exchange rates, we expect full year EPS to benefit by about $0.20, which implies a minimal fourth quarter EPS benefit. But as I always say, this is directional guidance only, given the volatility we are experiencing.
Our third quarter and nine-month results are a testament to the strength of the Plan to Win and its effectiveness in a persistently challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment. Our business model is resilient. The alignment within our system is strong, and we are seizing opportunities now to secure an even brighter future for McDonald's. I remain confident that we will continue to drive value for our shareholders over the long term. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A."

And we're not seeing a big impact, really, to our guest counts and the growth in the marketplaces with some of the austerity measures and some of the economic issues that are there, that are impacting certainly discretionary income. And so, it's been actually a good example of how well our business model adapts in these various marketplaces around the world and in different kinds of economic environments we find ourselves in, which is been our history. As you know, it's not the first time we've had to deal with these kinds of things around the world. We've had our presence in Europe for a long time and have gone through various ups and downs in the economies and yet, have been able to deliver steady performance on behalf of brand McDonald's. Because of our business model and the way we're structured, the everyday affordability, as we like to say, our customer's getting pinched everywhere. They shouldn't get that at McDonald's. And even these austerity measures and the lifestyles in Europe, although they can be more harsh in some environments than others, I think the standard of living and the discretionary income has to be impacted very, very severely for us to start to feel that impact at the McDonald's front counter and drive-thru."

I don't know that we've said we don't feel like we have the elasticity there. I just think we're just very, very cautious in the face of the economic environment we find ourselves in over there.

And with the commodity outlook, at least at the last update was impressively below the trends in both the commodity markets and what we're seeing from basically almost everyone else in that market. I'm just wondering, is the current -- what is the current commodity outlook for China for this year? And to achieve such a dramatically low inflation relative to others, was this effective contracting? Was there something else? I only ask because if 2011 was a result of really wise contracting, could 2012 turn out to be a much more inflationary a year there? And then, how do you think about pricing in China as a result?"

And so, we go into those because we know we need to be there, but in fact, we go in there early as compared to the overall developments. So you're going to see a benefit, I think, in year 2 or 3 on some of those new stores, which should start to have an impact on that overall margin relative to the new store growth. And it's the best way for us to develop the market because we need to be in those environments.

But generally, they start out a little bit lower, and then by the third year, they've pretty much caught up to the market average. So if you think about what we're doing in China from a development standpoint, we opened 166 last year. We're going to open close to 200 or 200 this year. That kind of incremental ramp up in new stores is really what's kind of causing that impact as we continue to increase the number of openings every year, while slightly have more impact. But it's definitely, at the same time, you've got more stores that are maturing to help offset that. So again, it's not dramatic, but it is something we keep an eye on but is performing consistent with how other markets performed during their kind of their development ramp-up phase. And in terms of the reimaging across Europe, similar to the U.S., those first year comps are up 6% to 7% ahead of the marketplace. And if you've seen the results in Europe over the last couple of years, sales continue to grow in that regard. So we're comfortable that we're still seeing sales increases above the market in those restaurants. And yet, there's more than that just that sales increase that drives improvement in the customer's attitude about McDonald's and the surroundings they're in, their perception of the cleanliness of the restaurant, the quality of service and the food. So it helps build that customer loyalty and drive more repeat business. So it's performing the way we had hoped and expected it to."

Europe was up about 5% for the quarter, which was kind of similar to the second quarter for them. But the one thing you have to consider is, certainly, in the U.S., when we flip the calendar to January of 2011, we had 0 pricing increases rolling over from the previous year. Whereas, when we flip the calendar to 2012, those first 2 months will have the benefit of the previous 12 months of price increases that we've taken in the U.S. So that's certainly a factor and something we consider as we think about price increases, frankly, the rest of this year. And I think something similar in Europe, why we don't have the a preliminary estimate nailed down quite yet in Europe with the volatility and some of the currency markets over there and the commodities, they're going to have a year probably that's similar or maybe a little bit better than the U.S. from a cost side.

The one issue with the commodities is, we only give you guidance updates once a quarter. And so, you can't necessarily assume that all of the increase in our guidance is going to be felt in the fourth quarter, because we actually started experiencing that in August and September. And so, while we knew the third quarter was going to be probably the highest cost-increase quarter of the year, heading into that quarter, and that's what we had messaged in July. It actually, primarily, because of the beef costs, which as you know, historically, is our least protected and hedged item. That drove the increases. So you're not seeing a 200 basis point deviation from our expectations in the fourth quarter on cost increases. It's actually much closer than that. And we're not going to get into item by item, how much of this is protected. But we've consistently said that beef is the wildcard for us in terms of it has the least amount of locked-in pricing. And so, while we didn't see the traditional falloff in prices after the summer of grilling season that we've historically seen, and that falloff frankly was built into our last forecast. But it's manageable for us. And the good news is, in the fourth quarter in the U.S., those cost increases are going to be well below what they were in the second and third quarters. So that's good.

And it's going to continue to be important, and we will continue to communicate that to our consumers. And so, I don't see a lot of change there. Relative to overall menu development and new product news, the U.S. is going to probably continue to talk about breakfast. They'll talk about big sandwiches and other mid-tier. The problem we have with a company like McDonald's is that the expectation around communication around all those of things is expected by our consumers. And of providing them that choice on the menu has to continue to get better, not get stale or go soft. And so, I expect that we will continue to communicate strongly around all of those day parts and all of those menu platforms."

Although, I think you asked Pete the question, I was just with franchisees last week and the week before that here in the United States. And of course, we pay very close attention to franchisee cash flow and profitability going all the way back to Ray Kroc, who said, ""First, the franchisees make money, and then everything else follows."" And we've not changed our philosophy around that in 55 years. And so, the headline is, that it continues to be very, very good. It is off slightly this year, but it's off a record high last year. And the franchisees I think are very, very pleased, particularly, when you look at the alignment of the organization around our initiatives, which we collaborate on very closely. First of all, we don't make decisions here at the center and then bark our orders to our franchisees. They're part of the process in the Plan to Win. And to profitability, regarding those initiatives, it's always a factor as we move forward with the progress and the sustainable growth of the organization, which revolves around the cash flow for the franchisees. It's a very good place right now and continues to be in a good place. And much of this because of the system support for the franchisee profitability, as we talked earlier about supply chain and locking and food costs that are going to be appropriate for them to be able to maintain some level of cash flow that's important to them. In spite of the fact that we have these enormous commodity-cross increases that we've operated with, we work together. We do a very good job on this, and I think you would find that they're very happy and supportive of the initiatives and because we decide together."

First of all, on the communication in the share voice, on advertising with our consumers. It's remained as a percentage of historical expense, about the same and about the same nationally, except to say that we will continue to maintain those levels during the recession and the downturn. And so, our shared voice continues to be very, very strong, and we've always had the attitude of McDonald's that we need to be communicating at the same or greater levels during difficult times as compared to healthier times. And so, that's continued to grow and be very, very effective for us. But that's been the case really forever around here. Relative to the day part growth, we've had day part growth really across the board. And I talked in my comments this morning about the growth around the breakfast and some of the items, the Egg McMuffin and the value items and the nutritional items, oatmeal and the rest. And so -- and we're very balanced in our communication with our consumers around these things without -- because we don't have the luxury of pushing one side of the business versus another side of the business, because we've got such high hurdles to really get over regarding the overall experience throughout the entire business day. And so we're very pleased with the results. But I think you would see a very sort of deliberate, focus around all of day parts and communication and continuing to maintain our share of voice, which by the way is very supported nationally by our franchisees and they're somewhere in the 1% to 2% range and overall store contribution, with local contribution is somewhere in the 3% to 6% range.

And anything we can do to increase that capacity is going to just kind of exponentially improve the sales that you get from just doing the reimaging interior and exterior.

And yet, with the expansion of the blended iced drinks and the smoothies and the other kinds of things into the markets around the world, I would say that, okay, as we review our plans coming up in the next month or so for 2012 from the area of the worlds, I would doubt whether they really have that quantified to the extent where I would be able to tell you what expectation is on a store-by-store basis. The reason why we quantified it the way we did for United States is because you asked us to, one. And two, because at a wholesale basis, we were rolling out something that was going to impact nearly 14,000 stores. And so, we were capable of doing it that way because it was a unified program that was consistent throughout every store. We don't have that same experience in every store other than the fact that if you're selling fruit smoothies, that might be consistent.
