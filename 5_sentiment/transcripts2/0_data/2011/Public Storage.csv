As  outlined in our press release, our fourth quarter core FFO per share is $1.45, compared to $1.33 last year, a 9% increase. Three items drove this growth. First, the per same-store in net operating income increased by 4.2%, or approximately $11 million, representing $0.06 per share. Second, we regained fixed-rate securities in 2010, with available cash that added $0.03 per share. Third, properties acquired in 2010 added another $0.02 per share. Our same-store net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 2.4%, along with lower operating expenses at to 2.1%. Operating expenses were lower due to a decrease in property taxes and amortizing expenses., partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance expenses. Property taxes were lower due to refunds and lower assessments. These adjustments resulted in a decline of $5 million. We expect property taxes will be 3% higher in 2011 than last year.
Advertising expenses were lower due to a decrease in yellow pages and television, offset in part by higher Internet cost. Repairs and maintenance costs were higher, primarily due to high your snow removal costs. FFO from our investment in Shurgard Europe declined approximately $1 million, principally caused by the conversion ratios of euros to dollars which was 8% lower. We retained approximately $100 million of operating cash flow during the quarter. At year-end, our cash and marketable securities were over $500 million.
During February of 2011, we paid off a $103 million, 7.75% unsecured notes having and it affected interstate 5.7% for accounting purposes. This repayment will reduce our annual interest expense by approximately $6 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Ron."

We rented nearly 13,000 more units in Q4 more than last year, or 7% increase business. This is offset by a higher move-outs of 15,000 customers. For all of 2010, we rented about 22,000 more units, offset by 2,000 more move-outs resulting in 20,000 more net customers. Our spread in Europe occupancy in December 31, remains healthy at 1.5% compared to 1.7% in September 30, and 1.1% in June 30.
Same-store revenues per available foot grew b y 2% in Q4, compared to 1% in Q3. At the end of January, both occupancy and in-place rents were higher than the prior year. Asking or street rents were also above last year during January.
Going into the prime rental season, we are in solid position with higher occupancy and rental rates. 19 of our 20 largest U.S. markets achieved positive year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, compared to 16 in Q3, and only six in Q2. The Washington, D.C.  Baltimore market lead the country at 5.1%, followed by New York at 4.6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by .1% in Q4, compared to a decline of 0.7% in Q3. The Florida and Georgia markets were also our most improved, sequentially growing by 2.6%, up from 9.01% in Q3. Our net customer acquisition costs were lower primarily due to higher move-in volume, lower marketing costs, and higher rental rates.
Going to the first quarter, we expect our immediate spend will be comparable with last year. In Europe, same-store top line growth continues to improve. Higher asking rates were offset in part by lower occupancy, rating to 2% revenue growth in Q4. Net operating income was equal to last year despite higher advertising property taxes. Property acquisition activity in the U.S. accelerated nicely in 2010, and we expect this trend to continue into 2011. For all of 2010, we've closed out 42 properties, totaling $2.7 million square feet or approximately $240 million. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

But the acquisition opportunities in Europe, I touched on, I think last quarter. There is 1,200 to 1,500 self-storage properties in Europe by industry data. A lot of those properties are not purpose-built and so are not of interest to us, so the acquisition market, it is much more limited in Europe than it is here in the U.S. Last year, I believe, they acquired two properties, both out of bankruptcy.

As outlined in our press release, our fourth quarter core FFO per share is $1.45, compared to $1.33 last year, a 9% increase. Three items drove this growth. First, for Same Stores, net operating income increased by 4.2%, or approximately $11 million, representing $0.06 per share. Second, we redeemed fixed-rate securities in 2010, with available cash that added $0.03 per share. Third, properties acquired in 2010 added another $0.02 per share. Our Same Stores' net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 2.4%, along with lower operating expenses at 2.1%. Operating expenses were lower due to a decrease in property taxes and amortizing expenses, partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance expenses. Property taxes were lower due to refunds and lower assessments. These adjustments resulted in a decline of $5 million. We expect property taxes will be 3% higher in 2011 than last year.
Advertising expenses were lower due to a decrease in yellow pages and television, offset in part by higher Internet cost. Repairs and maintenance costs were higher, primarily due to higher snow removal costs. FFO from our investment in Shurgard Europe declined approximately $1 million, principally caused by the conversion ratio of euros to dollars, which was 8% lower. We retained approximately $100 million of our operating cash flow during the quarter. At year end, our cash and marketable securities were over $500 million.
During February of 2011, we paid off a $103 million, 7.75% unsecured notes, having an effective interest rate of 5.7% for accounting purposes. This repayment will reduce our annual interest expense by approximately $6 million. With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

We rented nearly 13,000 more units in Q4 compared to last year, or a 7% increase. This is offset by higher move-outs of 15,000 customers. For all of 2010, we rented about 22,000 more units, offset by 2,000 more move-outs resulting in 20,000 more net customers. Our spread in year-over-year occupancy at December 31 remains healthy at 1.5% compared to 1.7% at September 30 and 1.1% at June 30.
Same Store revenues per available foot grew by 2% in Q4, compared to 1% in Q3. At the end of January, both occupancy and in-place rents were higher than the prior year. Asking or street rents were also above last year during January.
Going into the prime rental season, we are in solid position with higher occupancy and rental rates. 19 of our 20 largest U.S. markets achieved positive year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, compared to 16 in Q3 and only six in Q2. The Washington, D.C., Baltimore market lead the country at 5.1%, followed by New York at 4.6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by 0.1% in Q4, compared to a decline of 0.7% in Q3. The Florida and Georgia markets were also our most improved, sequentially growing by 2.6%, up from 0.1% in Q3. Our net customer acquisition costs were lower, primarily due to higher move-in volumes, lower marketing costs and higher rental rates.
Going into the first quarter, we expect our immediate spend will be comparable with last year. In Europe, Same Store top line growth continue to improve. Higher asking rates were offset in part by lower occupancy, leading to 2% revenue growth in Q4. Net operating income was equal to last year despite higher advertising and property taxes. Property acquisition activity in the U.S. accelerated nicely in 2010, and we expect this trend to continue into 2011. For all of 2010, we've closed out 42 properties totaling 2.7 million square feet for approximately $240 million. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

But I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts on that business today, given some of the success that others in the sector have had acquiring assets that they've previously managed?
We manage, I think, the third parties' 30 or 40 properties, so we've done third-party management for 25 to 30 years. One of the issues that we face in doing third-party management is cannibalization of our own customer base because if you manage -- for us anyway, if we're managing a property that we don't own near a property that we do own, our system is blind to who owns the property. But you can figure it out, I mean, there's going to be some cannibalization in terms of customer flows going to the third-party property versus our property. So that's one of the principal reasons we've kind of stayed away from it. The other thing is managing properties to fill them up so that you can buy them at a higher price, we just had a little trouble with that kind of intellectually how that makes sense in terms of beneficial to our organization."

In our better-performing markets, which is the Northeast, street rates are much higher in this year than they were last year. And obviously, in our tougher markets there, we may even be backwards compared to last year. But overall, as a portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, rates during the fourth quarter were up about 4.5% versus last year. They continue to be up as of yesterday compared to last year. But we're going to be conservative on the street rates, and we're really going to focus in a little bit more on the existing tenant increases that we sent out. And as we've mentioned, a little over half of our portfolio, we expect to be sending increases over the next few months. And those increases that we are sending out are higher than the percentage increases that we were sending out last year. If you recall, in past conferences conference calls, I mentioned that I thought we were too conservative last year in our increases. Well, we are rectifying that this year."

So to kind of benchmark 20 years ago to today is a little apples and oranges. So I really can't make that comparison of 20 years ago. What I can tell you is over the last 20 years, there's been, unfortunately, for us a lot of supply come into the market, so it's made the market place more competitive certainly than it was 20 years ago. That's the negative. And we've seen that in kind of the severity of the downturn, although our product type performed far better than most other food groups and real estate. We saw that in the downturn and now you're seeing the recovery. The big picture positive is there's virtually no new supply coming into the markets, there hasn't been for a year or two. And the outlook is pretty weak going forward, at least at this juncture. So as I think about that, absence of new supply coming through the downturn, where we are positioned in various markets, I'm feeling relatively optimistic for our growth for the next couple of years in terms of an organic growth. And as I touched on earlier, in terms of acquisition opportunities, there's still a lot of properties that have to get worked through with the lenders that were overleveraged.

We don't know that, it's going to depend on the reaction our tenant base reacts -- I guess, their reaction to these increases, as well as to holding our occupancy. Remember, we still want to maintain a certain level of occupancy. So we've indicated that we'll be conservative on pricing to new incoming tenants, and we would be more aggressive on increases to the existing tenant base, which is kind of the strategy we've outlined over the past couple quarters when we had conference calls. So we're continuing that strategy. The increases that we have been sending out are in the eight-ish range, 8% to 9% range, and that compares to all of last year, where we were around the 5.5% to 6% range increase."

As outlined in our press release, our fourth quarter core FFO per share is $1.45, compared to $1.33 last year, a 9% increase. Three items drove this growth. First, our Same Stores' net operating income increased by 4.2%, or approximately $11 million, representing $0.06 per share. Second, we redeemed fixed-rate securities in 2010, with available cash that added $0.03 per share. Third, properties acquired in 2010 added another $0.02 per share. Our Same Stores' net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 2.4%, along with lower operating expenses of 2.1%. Operating expenses were lower due to a decrease in property taxes and amortizing expenses, partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance expenses. Property taxes were lower due to refunds and lower assessments. These adjustments resulted in a decline of $5 million. We expect property taxes will be 3% higher in 2011 than last year.
Advertising expenses were lower due to a decrease in yellow pages and television, offset in part by higher Internet costs. Repairs and maintenance costs were higher, primarily due to higher snow removal costs. FFO from our investment in Shurgard Europe declined approximately $1 million, principally caused by the conversion ratio of euros to dollars, which was 8% lower. We retained approximately $100 million of our operating cash flow during the quarter. At year end, our cash and marketable securities were over $500 million.
During February of 2011, we paid off a $103 million, 7.75% unsecured note, having an effective interest rate of 5.7% for accounting purposes. This repayment will reduce our annual interest expense by approximately $6 million.
With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

We rented nearly 13,000 more units in Q4 compared to last year, or a 7% increase. This is offset by higher move-outs of 15,000 customers. For all of 2010, we rented about 22,000 more units, offset by 2,000 more move-outs resulting in 20,000 more net customers. Our spread in year-over-year occupancy at December 31 remains healthy at 1.5% compared to 1.7% at September 30 and 1.1% at June 30.
Same Store revenues per available foot grew by 2% in Q4, compared to 1% in Q3. At the end of January, both occupancy and in-place rents were higher than the prior year. Asking or street rents were also above last year during January.
Going into the prime rental season, we are in solid position with higher occupancy and rental rates. 19 of our 20 largest U.S. markets achieved positive year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, compared to 16 in Q3 and only six in Q2. The Washington, D.C., Baltimore market lead the country at 5.1%, followed by New York at 4.6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by 0.1% in Q4, compared to a decline of 0.7% in Q3. The Florida and Georgia markets were also our most improved, sequentially growing by 2.6%, up from 0.1% in Q3. Our net customer acquisition costs were lower, primarily due to higher move-in volumes, lower marketing costs and higher rental rates.
Going into the first quarter, we expect our immediate spend will be comparable with last year. In Europe, Same Store top line growth continues to improve. Higher asking rates were offset in part by lower occupancy, leading to 2% revenue growth in Q4. Net operating income was equal to last year despite higher advertising and property taxes. Property acquisition activity in the U.S. accelerated nicely in 2010, and we expect this trend to continue into 2011. For all of 2010, we've closed out 42 properties totaling 2.7 million square feet for approximately $240 million.

But I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts on that business today, given some of the success that others in the sector have had acquiring assets that they've previously managed?
We manage, I think, the third parties' 30 or 40 properties, so we've done third-party management for 25 to 30 years. One of the issues that we face in doing third-party management is cannibalization of our own customer base because if you manage -- for us anyway, if we're managing a property that we don't own near a property that we do own, our system is blind to who owns the property. But you can figure it out, I mean, there's going to be some cannibalization in terms of customer flows going to the third-party property versus our property. So that's one of the principal reasons we've kind of stayed away from it. The other thing is managing properties to fill them up so that you can buy them at a higher price, we just had a little trouble with that kind of intellectually how that makes sense in terms of beneficial to our organization."

But I think in terms of the capital markets activities, if I understand correctly, the ones that you're referring to that we did last year, I think you've got two or three more quarters of year-over-year benefit of that for the balance of 2011. So you'll see some of that in the first quarter. For example, we did not redeem the equity stock, the Series equity A stock until April of last year. So when you look at first quarter this year, you won't have the equity A dividends, whereas you had them in the first quarter of last year.

There isn't another equity stock Series A that we can call.

As you sit here and look back over, say, the last 20 years or so, how do you feel about the health of your customers, the health of your business, the ability to continue to push through price increases here than, say, relative to other periods of time in the last two decades where you've also had pricing power? Are you sort of cautiously optimistic? Are you really confident? How does it stack up?"

So to kind of benchmark 20 years ago to today is a little apples and oranges. So I really can't make that comparison of 20 years ago. What I can tell you is over the last 20 years, there's been, unfortunately, for us a lot of supply come into the market, so it's made the market place more competitive certainly than it was 20 years ago. That's the negative. And we've seen that in kind of the severity of the downturn, although our product type performed far better than most other food groups and real estate. We saw that in the downturn and now you're seeing the recovery. The big picture positive is there's virtually no new supply coming into the markets, there hasn't been for a year or two. And the outlook is pretty weak going forward, at least at this juncture. So as I think about that absence of new supply coming through the downturn, where we are positioned in various markets, I'm feeling relatively optimistic for our growth for the next couple of years in terms of an organic growth. And as I touched on earlier, in terms of acquisition opportunities, there's still a lot of properties that have to get worked through with the lenders that were overleveraged. And so there's a kind of a forced acquisition pipeline that's going to be coming our way over the next three to five years. So acquisitions, as well as pretty solid, organic growth, I'm feeling pretty good about our business."

In Q1, we reviewed our same-store pool and adjusted the composition to include properties we have operated for the last 3 years at a stabilized occupancy level. For U.S. operations, we added a net 6 properties to the same-store pool, adjusting the comparable total to 1,931 properties. For Shurgard Europe, with the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest, we added 60 properties to the same-store pool, adjusting the comparable total to 151 properties. This leaves a total of 158 properties or 10.5 million square feet that have been recently acquired, redeveloped or developed and are not stabilized. Now, I'll turn the call over to John Reyes."

As outlined in our press release, our first quarter core FFO per share was $1.28 compared to $1.15 last year, an 11% increase. Four items primarily drove this growth. First, our same-store net operating income increased by 5.4% or approximately $12 million, representing $0.07 per share. Second, we added $0.04 per share from redeeming preferred and fixed-rate securities last year. Third, properties acquired in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 added another $0.03 per share. Fourth, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.01 per share. 
These 4 items were partially offset by higher G&A costs of $0.02 per share. Our same-store net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 3.4%, along with flat operating expenses. Higher property taxes and payroll expenses were offset by lower advertising and R&M expenses, primarily due to lower media and snow removal costs. Operating expenses include indirect costs, such as our information technology platform, web-based marketing, revenue management, HR and training and also provides resellers. Our G&A expense was $14 million or $4 million higher than last year due to higher share-based compensation. We expect G&A expense for the remainder of 2011 will be $30 million to $36 million. We have recently completed 3 capital transactions. First, we paid off the $103 million, 7 3/4% unsecured note, having an effective interest rate of 5.7% for accounting purposes. Second, we issued a total of 375 million of Series Q preferred shares, with an annual rate of 6.5%. And third, we will redeem $350 million of our 7 1/4% preferred shares. There will be in EITF D-42 charge associated with the redemption of approximately $11 million or $0.06 per share during the second quarter. 
As previously announced, Shurgard Europe acquired the remaining 80% interest in 2 joint ventures on 72 properties for $238 million. The JVs have $280 million of debt, with an average interest rate of 4%. The transaction was funded as a dollar-denominated loan by Public Storage. Our partner in Shurgard Europe is expected to fund its proportional interest during the second quarter. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share, a 19% increase. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders has increased primarily due to lower tax depreciation and improved property operations. With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

We ended the quarter with occupancy of 90.6%, increasing the year-over-year spread to 1.7%, up from 1.5% in December. Asking or street rates were also higher. Same-store revenue per available foot grew by 3% compared to 2% in Q4. At the end of April, occupancy, in place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. We are well positioned going into Q2. 
All of our top 20 U.S. markets achieved positive year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. The northeastern markets once again led the country and grew by about 6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by 0.6% compared to 0.2% in Q4. The southeastern markets, led by Florida and Georgia, grew by 3.4%, up from 2.6% in Q4. Our net customer acquisition costs were lower, primarily due to higher move in volume and lower marketing costs, partially offset by higher promotional discounts. We expect our second quarter media spend to be about $2 million lower than last year. 
Moving to our European operations, our same stores had top line growth of 1.8%, resulting from higher realized rents of 1.9%, offset by lower occupancy. We expect modest revenue growth for the balance of the year. Operating expenses were slightly higher by 1.3%, resulting in NOI growth of 2.1%. Five of the 7 markets had positive NOI growth for the quarter. With respect to acquisitions, we closed on 5 properties for approximately $20 million, as well as the leasehold interest for $7 million. We are under contract to acquire 2 additional properties for $28 million. In summary, occupancies are higher, asking rates are higher, in place rates are higher, share-based compensation and expenses are higher due to higher revenue. We deployed nearly $400 million of capital during the quarter, primarily in Europe. We refinanced $350 million of preferred at lower rates and we increased our common dividend by 19%.

And the reality is that your payout ratio and you had this pretty disciplined policy of just paying out the minimum but because the minimum is growing, the payout ratio has also risen from 40 something to the 70 in terms of free cash flow.

The 2 big changes over the last 3 or 4 years are the tax benefits associated with the Shurgard merger, which was a taxable merger, have started to burn off. So that's -- we do see tax depreciation combined with, as you pointed out, redemption of a lot of preferreds -- repurchase actually of a lot of preferreds at big discounts in '08, '09 and the redemption of the equity stock in Q1 of last year.

So this year, we did start in February and we've continued to send them out, although the bulk of the letters didn't really go out until the May and June timeframe. So far, as a result of the increase is that we're spending somewhere in the range of about 8.5% on average and we are seeing just a slight uptick in move out volumes from those folks. But we're not alarmed by the increase as we were expecting some sort of increase. So so far, we're pretty comfortable with what we're seeing.

If you recall, last year, I believe it was in the second quarter, it was on this call but in the second quarter that we announced the acquisition of 35, 40 properties here in Los Angeles, which was really the beginning of acquisition activity really starting in the business. This quarter, there was I think the other public companies announced over $300 million of deals, and there's a number of private investors that have also taken down some portfolio. So what we're seeing is a definite uptick in pricing on several of those transactions, we were simply outbid. People were more aggressive in terms of how they were bidding for the product. If you look across the country, and I can't go through by market, but I'll tell you this, a little bit of a tale of two cities in the acquisitions. On the primary markets, where there's Los Angeles and New York or Florida, Miami or San Francisco, you have people being very aggressive on pricing and going after product. And I would say probably going down the quality spectrum in terms of what they're buying and then in secondary markets, maybe like Birmingham, Alabama, where you can get product at 50% replacement cost and double-digit yields.

Most of that is incentives at the property level due to the higher occupancies and better sales at the property level. That was also up a couple of percent last year. Advertising and promotion's down in Q1 and as I mentioned, we'll be down a couple of million dollars. Why is that trending down? Well, if you recall, when we went into the downturn in '09, we really ramped up the media spend. So it's going to get easier as rates improve and we get down on the media spend. R&M is down this quarter, mainly due to lower snow. We don't have any control over that. So that's a benefit we get. My guess is our R&M will be comparable to last year for the balance of the year and other expenses is primarily management is up 3.5% and my guess is that'll be up 2%, 3%. So on a long-term run rate basis, and the 2 wildcards here are advertising and promotion and property taxes but on a long-term run rate basis, I would expect core expenses to go up 2% to 3% a year ."

We will follow the usual format followed by a question-and-answer period. However, to allow for equal participation, we request that you ask only one question when your turn comes up, and then return to the queue for any follow-up questions. 
Before we start, I want to remind you that all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this conference call are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. These risks and other factors that could adversely affect our business and future results are described in today's earnings press release, as well as in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 6, 2011, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we are providing on this call is included in our earnings press release. You could find our press release, SEC reports and audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website at www.publicstorage.com. 
In Q1, we reviewed our Same Store pool and adjusted the composition to include properties we have operated for the last 3 years at a stabilized occupancy level. For U.S. operations, we added a net 6 properties to the Same Store pool, adjusting the comparable total to 1,931 properties. For Shurgard Europe, with the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest, we added 60 properties to the Same Store pool, adjusting the comparable total to 151 properties. This leaves a total of 158 properties or 10.5 million square feet that had been recently acquired, redeveloped or developed and are not stabilized. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to John Reyes."

As outlined in our press release, our first quarter core FFO per share was $1.28 compared to $1.15 last year, an 11% increase. Four items primarily drove this growth. First, our Same Store net operating income increased by 5.4% or approximately $12 million, representing $0.07 per share. Second, we added $0.04 per share from redeeming preferred and fixed-rate securities last year. Third, properties acquired in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 added another $0.03 per share. Fourth, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.01 per share. 
These 4 items were partially offset by higher G&A costs of $0.02 per share. Our Same Store net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 3.4%, along with flat operating expenses. Higher property taxes and payroll expenses were offset by lower advertising and R&M expenses, primarily due to lower media and snow removal costs. Operating expenses include indirect costs, such as our information technology platform, Web-based marketing, revenue management, HR and training and all supervised resellers. Our G&A expense was $14 million or $4 million higher than last year due to higher share-based compensation. We expect G&A expense for the remainder of 2011 will be $30 million to $36 million. We have recently completed 3 capital transactions. First, we paid off a $103 million, 7 3/4% unsecured note, having an effective interest rate of 5.7% for accounting purposes. Second, we issued a total of 375 million of Series Q preferred shares, with an annual rate of 6.5%. And third, we will redeem $350 million of our 7 1/4% preferred shares. There will be in EITF D-42 charge associated with the redemption of approximately $11 million or $0.06 per share during the second quarter. 
As previously announced, Shurgard Europe acquired the remaining 80% interest in 2 joint ventures that are on 72 properties for $238 million. The JVs have $280 million of debt, with an average interest rate of 4%. The transaction was funded as a dollar-denominated loan by Public Storage. Our partner in Shurgard Europe is expected to fund its proportional interest during the second quarter. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share, a 19% increase. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders has increased primarily due to lower tax depreciation and improved property operations. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

During the quarter, we benefited from higher occupancy and better pricing. We added about 20,000 net customers. We ended the quarter with occupancy of 90.6%, increasing the year-over-year spread to 1.7%, up from 1.5% in December. Asking or street rates were also higher. Same Store revenue per available foot grew by 3% compared to 2% in Q4. At the end of April, occupancy, in place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. We are well positioned going into Q2.
All of our top 20 U.S. markets achieved positive year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. The northeastern markets once again led the country and grew by about 6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by 0.6% compared to 0.2% in Q4. The southeastern markets, led by Florida and Georgia, grew by 3.4%, up from 2.6% in Q4. Our net customer acquisition costs were lower primarily due to higher move-in volume and lower marketing costs, partially offset by higher promotional discounts. We expect our second quarter media spend to be about $2 million lower than last year. 
Moving to our European operations, our Same Stores had top line growth of 1.8%, resulting from higher realized rents of 1.9%, offset by lower occupancy. We expect modest revenue growth for the balance of the year. Operating expenses were slightly higher by 1.3%, resulting in NOI growth of 2.1%. Five of the 7 markets have positive NOI growth for the quarter. With respect to acquisitions, we closed on 5 properties for approximately $20 million, as well as the leasehold interest for $7 million. We are under contract to acquire 2 additional properties for $28 million. 
In summary, occupancies are higher, asking rents are higher, in place rents are higher, share-based compensation expense is higher due to higher revenue. We deployed nearly $400 million of capital during the quarter, primarily in Europe. We refinanced $350 million of preferred at lower rates and we increased our common dividend by 19%. 
With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

And the reality is your payout ratio, and you had this pretty disciplined policy of just paying out the minimum but because the minimum is growing, the payout ratio has also risen from the 40s up to the 70s in terms of free cash flow.

And as you kind of articulated in your question, the taxable income rises, we have to increase the dividend. It's been our policy for 20-plus years to the extent that we find creative ways to shelter the income, we do that. The 2 big changes over the last 3 or 4 years are the tax benefits associated with the Shurgard merger, which was a taxable merger, have started to burn it off. So that's -- we do see tax depreciation combined with, as you pointed out, redemption of a lot of preferreds -- and repurchase actually of a lot of preferreds at big discounts in '08, '09 and the redemption of the equity stock in Q1 of last year. So you put all those things together and the dividend has to rise. It's not -- we don't have a targeted payout ratio. it's simply a function of taxable income."

I'm a little embarrassed that it took this long to get it done, but we're happy with the transaction. In terms of yield, if you look at the trailing numbers, I think on an unleveraged basis, it's somewhere between 7.5% and 8%.

If you recall, last year, I believe it was in the second quarter, it was on this call but in the second quarter that we announced the acquisition of 35, 40 properties here in Los Angeles, which was really the beginning of acquisition activity really starting in the business. This quarter, there was I think the other public companies announced over $300 million of deals, and there's a number of private investors that have also taken down some portfolio. So what we're seeing is a definite uptick in pricing on several of those transactions, we were simply outbid. People were more aggressive in terms of how they were bidding for the product. If you look across the country, and I can't go through by market, but I'll tell you this, a little bit of a tale of 2 cities in the acquisitions. On the primary markets, where there's Los Angeles and New York or Florida, Miami or San Francisco, you have people being very aggressive on pricing and going after product and I would say probably going down the quality spectrum in terms of what they're buying. And then in the secondary markets, maybe like Birmingham, Alabama, where you can get product at 50% replacement cost and double-digit yields. So there's a big gap between the primary markets and the secondary markets. Did that answer your question?"

Well, if you recall, when we went into the downturn in '09, we really ramped up the media spend. So it's going to get easier as rates improve and we can bow down the media spend. R&M is down this quarter, mainly due to lower snow. We don't have any control over that. So that's a benefit we get. My guess is our R&M will be comparable to last year for the balance of the year.

But to give you some more clarity on the expense, the expense is front-end loaded over -- they've used their options or restricted stock, excuse me, vest over a 5-year period, and the expense is front end loaded. So the expense in the first year, which is 2011, will be $9 million. In 2012, we're estimating that expense to go down to $4.9 million. 2013 will be $2.9 million. 2014 will be $1.6 million, and then 2015 will be $700,000.

You could find our press release, SEC reports and audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website at www.publicstorage.com. 
In Q1, we reviewed our Same Store pool and adjusted the composition to include properties we have operated for the last 3 years at a stabilized occupancy level. For U.S. operations, we added a net 6 properties to the Same Store pool, adjusting the comparable total to 1,931 properties. For Shurgard Europe, with the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest, we added 60 properties to the Same Store pool, adjusting the comparable total to 151 properties.

As outlined in our press release, our first quarter core FFO per share was $1.28 compared to $1.15 last year, an 11% increase. Four items primarily drove this growth.

As outlined in our press release, our first quarter core FFO per share was $1.28 compared to $1.15 last year, an 11% increase. Four items primarily drove this growth. First, our Same Store net operating income increased by 5.4% or approximately $12 million, representing $0.07 per share. Second, we added $0.04 per share from redeeming preferred and fixed-rate securities last year. Third, properties acquired in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 added another $0.03 per share. Fourth, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.01 per share. 
These 4 items were partially offset by higher G&A costs of $0.02 per share. Our Same Store net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 3.4%, along with flat operating expenses. Higher property taxes and payroll expenses were offset by lower advertising and R&M expenses, primarily due to lower media and snow removal costs. Operating expenses include indirect costs, such as our information technology platform, Web-based marketing, revenue management, HR and training and all supervisory salaries. Our G&A expense was $14 million or $4 million higher than last year due to higher share-based compensation. We expect G&A expense for the remainder of 2011 will be $30 million to $36 million. We have recently completed 3 capital transactions. First, we paid off a $103 million, 7 3/4% unsecured note, having an effective interest rate of 5.7% for accounting purposes. Second, we issued a total of 375 million of Series Q preferred shares, with an annual rate of 6.5%. And third, we will redeem $350 million of our 7 1/4% preferred shares. There will be in EITF D-42 charge associated with the redemption of approximately $11 million or $0.06 per share during the second quarter. 
As previously announced, Shurgard Europe acquired the remaining 80% interest in 2 joint ventures that own 72 properties for $238 million. The JVs have $280 million of debt, with an average interest rate of 4%. The transaction was funded as a dollar-denominated loan by Public Storage. Our partner in Shurgard Europe is expected to fund its proportional interest during the second quarter. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share, a 19% increase. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders has increased primarily due to lower tax depreciation and improved property operations. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

We ended the quarter with occupancy of 90.6%, increasing the year-over-year spread to 1.7%, up from 1.5% in December. Asking or street rates were also higher. Same Store revenue per available foot grew by 3% compared to 2% in Q4. At the end of April, occupancy, in place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. We are well positioned going into Q2. 
All of our top 20 U.S. markets achieved positive year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. The northeastern markets once again led the country and grew by about 6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by 0.6% compared to 0.2% in Q4. The southeastern markets, led by Florida and Georgia, grew by 3.4%, up from 2.6% in Q4. Our net customer acquisition costs were lower primarily due to higher move-in volume and lower marketing costs, partially offset by higher promotional discounts. We expect our second quarter media spend to be about $2 million lower than last year. 
Moving to our European operations, our Same Stores had top line growth of 1.8%, resulting from higher realized rents of 1.9%, offset by lower occupancy. We expect modest revenue growth for the balance of the year. Operating expenses were slightly higher by 1.3%, resulting in NOI growth of 2.1%. Five of the 7 markets had positive NOI growth for the quarter. With respect to acquisitions, we closed on 5 properties for approximately $20 million, as well as the leasehold interest for $7 million. We are under contract to acquire 2 additional properties for $28 million. 
In summary, occupancies are higher, asking rents are higher, in place rents are higher, share-based compensation expense is higher due to higher revenue. We deployed nearly $400 million of capital during the quarter, primarily in Europe. We refinanced $350 million of preferred at lower rates and we increased our common dividend by 19%.

So that's reducing tax depreciation combined with, as you pointed out, redemption of a lot of preferreds -- repurchase actually of a lot of preferreds at big discounts in '08, '09 and the redemption of the equity stock in Q1 of last year.

On the primary markets, whether it's Los Angeles and New York or Florida, Miami or San Francisco, you have people being very aggressive on pricing and going after product and I would say probably going down the quality spectrum in terms of what they're buying.

Florida has been in a roll-down period for about 2 years, so the comps are getting a little easier. But they've done a great job. The portfolio's pretty full down there. We're regaining some pricing power. So we've got a good team on the ground, and they're executing and positive outlook for the balance of the year in the Southeast.

Most of that is incentives at the property level due to the higher occupancies and better sales at the property level. That was also up a couple of percent last year. Advertising and promotion's down in Q1, and as I mentioned, will be down a couple of million dollars. Why is that trending down? Well, if you recall, when we went into the downturn in '09, we really ramped up the media spend. So it's going to get easier as rates improve and we can dial down the media spend. R&M is down this quarter, mainly due to lower snow. We don't have any control over that. So that's a benefit we'll get. My guess is our R&M will be comparable to last year for the balance of the year. And then other expenses is primarily management is up 3.5%, and my guess is that'll be up 2%, 3%. So on a long-term run rate basis, and the 2 wildcards here are advertising and promotion and property taxes, but on a long-term run rate basis, I would expect core expenses to go up 2% to 3% a year."

It breaks down the plan in terms of the revenue targets and which of the senior execs here got the RSUs, how much they got for this year. This plan has actually been in place. This is the third year of the plan. And for the last 2 years, we've not hit the revenue targets, and so there's been no RSU grants for the previous 2 years. So this is the third year. We're hoping to hit the targets. I can tell you all the people participating in the plan are highly focused on hitting the targets because, as John mentioned, there's $20 million of RSU grants on the line."

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.

You could find our press release, SEC reports and audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website at www.publicstorage.com. 
In Q1, we reviewed our Same Store pool and adjusted the composition to include properties we have operated for the last 3 years at a stabilized occupancy level. For U.S. operations, we added a net 6 properties to the Same Store pool, adjusting the comparable total to 1,931 properties. For Shurgard Europe, with the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest, we added 60 properties to the Same Store pool, adjusting the comparable total to 151 properties. This leaves a total of 158 properties or 10.5 million square feet that have been recently acquired, redeveloped or developed that are not stabilized.

As outlined in our press release, our first quarter core FFO per share was $1.28 compared to $1.15 last year, an 11% increase. Four items primarily drove this growth.

As outlined in our press release, our first quarter core FFO per share was $1.28 compared to $1.15 last year, an 11% increase. Four items primarily drove this growth. First, our Same Store net operating income increased by 5.4% or approximately $12 million, representing $0.07 per share. Second, we added $0.04 per share from redeeming preferred and fixed-rate securities last year. Third, properties acquired in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 added another $0.03 per share. Fourth, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.01 per share. 
These 4 items were partially offset by higher G&A costs of $0.02 per share. Our Same Store net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 3.4%, along with flat operating expenses. Higher property taxes and payroll expenses were offset by lower advertising and R&M expenses, primarily due to lower media and snow removal costs. Operating expenses include indirect costs, such as our information technology platform, Web-based marketing, revenue management, HR and training and all supervisory salaries. Our G&A expense was $14 million or $4 million higher than last year due to higher share-based compensation. We expect G&A expense for the remainder of 2011 will be $30 million to $36 million. We have recently completed 3 capital transactions. First, we paid off a $103 million, 7 3/4% unsecured note, having an effective interest rate of 5.7% for accounting purposes. Second, we issued a total of 375 million of Series Q preferred shares, with an annual rate of 6.5%. And third, we will redeem $350 million of our 7 1/4% preferred shares. There will be in EITF D-42 charge associated with the redemption of approximately $11 million or $0.06 per share during the second quarter. 
As previously announced, Shurgard Europe acquired the remaining 80% interest in 2 joint ventures that own 72 properties for $238 million. The JVs have $280 million of debt, with an average interest rate of 4%. The transaction was funded as a dollar-denominated loan by Public Storage. Our partner in Shurgard Europe is expected to fund its proportional interest during the second quarter. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share, a 19% increase. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders has increased primarily due to lower tax depreciation and improved property operations. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

During the quarter, we benefited from higher occupancy and better pricing. We added about 20,000 net customers. We ended the quarter with occupancy of 90.6%, increasing the year-over-year spread to 1.7%, up from 1.5% in December. Asking or street rates were also higher. Same Store revenue per available foot grew by 3% compared to 2% in Q4. At the end of April, occupancy, in place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. We are well positioned going into Q2. 
All of our top 20 U.S. markets achieved positive year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. The northeastern markets once again led the country and grew by about 6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by 0.6% compared to 0.2% in Q4. The southeastern markets, led by Florida and Georgia, grew by 3.4%, up from 2.6% in Q4. Our net customer acquisition costs were lower primarily due to higher move-in volume and lower marketing costs, partially offset by higher promotional discounts. We expect our second quarter media spend to be about $2 million lower than last year. 
Moving to our European operations, our Same Stores had top line growth of 1.8%, resulting from higher realized rents of 1.9%, offset by lower occupancy. We expect modest revenue growth for the balance of the year. Operating expenses were slightly higher by 1.3%, resulting in NOI growth of 2.1%. Five of the 7 markets had positive NOI growth for the quarter. With respect to acquisitions, we closed on 5 properties for approximately $20 million, as well as the leasehold interest for $7 million. We are under contract to acquire 2 additional properties for $28 million. 
In summary, occupancies are higher, asking rents are higher, in place rents are higher, share-based compensation expense is higher due to higher revenue. We deployed nearly $400 million of capital during the quarter, primarily in Europe. We refinanced $350 million of preferred at lower rates and we increased our common dividend by 19%.

That's been our policy for 20-plus years to the extent that we find creative ways to shelter the income, we do that. The 2 big changes over the last 3 or 4 years are the tax benefits associated with the Shurgard Merger, which was a taxable merger, have started to burn off. So that's reducing tax depreciation combined with, as you pointed out, redemption of a lot of preferreds -- repurchase actually of a lot of preferreds at big discounts in '08, '09 and the redemption of the equity stock in Q1 of last year.

If you recall, last year, I believe it was in the second quarter, it was on this call but in the second quarter that we announced the acquisition of 35, 40 properties here in Los Angeles, which was really the beginning of acquisition activity really starting in the business. This quarter, there was I think the other public companies announced over $300 million of deals, and there's a number of private investors that have also taken down some portfolio. So what we're seeing is a definite uptick in pricing on several of those transactions, we were simply outbid. People were more aggressive in terms of how they were bidding for the product. If you look across the country, and I can't go through by market, but I'll tell you, there's a little bit of a tale of 2 cities in the acquisitions. On the primary markets, whether it's Los Angeles and New York or Florida, Miami or San Francisco, you have people being very aggressive on pricing and going after product and I would say probably going down the quality spectrum in terms of what they're buying. And then in the secondary markets, maybe like Birmingham, Alabama, where you can get product at 50% replacement cost and double-digit yields. So there's a big gap between the primary markets and the secondary markets. Did that answer your question?"

But that would take some time for Shurgard Europe because Shurgard Europe would need to get rated and obviously, get probably an investment grade rating.

R&M is down this quarter, mainly due to lower snow. We don't have any control over that. So that's a benefit we'll get.

As outlined in our press release, our second quarter core FFO per share was $1.43 compared to $1.27 last year, a 13% increase. Three items primarily drove this growth: first, our same-store net operating income increased by 6.2% or approximately $15 million, representing $0.09 per share. Second, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.05 per share, primarily from the acquisition of an 80% interest in 2 joint ventures, along with the 13% higher euro-to-dollar currency exchange rate. Third, our nonsame-store properties added another $0.03 per share. These items were partially offset by higher G&A costs of about $0.02 per share. Our same-store net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 4%, along with flat operating expenses. Higher property taxes and property payroll expenses were offset by lower advertising, primarily due to lower television cost. 
Our G&A expense for the quarter was $2.5 million higher than last year. This is primarily due to an additional $3 million for an intensive plan that is based upon 2011 same-store revenue growth. We expect this plan will add $13 million to our 2011 G&A expense compared to 2010. We recently completed several capital transactions. During the second quarter, we issued $375 million of 6 1/2% preferred stock and we redeemed $518 million of 7 1/4% preferred stock. After the quarter, we issued $488 million of 6.35% preferred stock and called for redemption $425 million of 7 1/4% preferred stock. In the third quarter, there will be an associated EITF D-42 charge of approximately $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
As a result of these transactions, our quarterly preferred dividend will be about $1 million lower in the third quarter and $3 million lower in the fourth quarter as compared to the same periods last year. As previously announced, Shurgard Europe acquired in early March the remaining 8% interest in 2 joint ventures that owned 72 properties for $238 million. The transaction was initially funded as a dollar-denominated loan by Public Storage. In mid-June, our partner in Shurgard Europe funded its proportionate share of the investment. Although the loan bore interest at 7%, it effectively was a participating loan. Accordingly, from early March until mid-June, we received 100% of the income from the 80% interest in the 2 joint ventures. After mid-June, we began receiving our 49% share from the joint ventures. Our second quarter earnings were about $3 million higher than they otherwise would've been due to this brief period where we received 100% of the income. Also in the quarter, we agreed to purchase through mergers, the remaining partnership interest in 5 Public Storage-sponsored public partnership for $154 million. These partnerships owned 47 properties with 2.7 million square feet. The transaction, which is subject to conditions, is expected to close in the third quarter. With that, I will now turn you over to Ron."

We added 31,000 net customers due to higher move-ins, offset in part by higher move-outs. We ended Q2 with record same-store occupancy of 93.1% and maintained a healthy year-over-year spread of 1.5% despite a 50% reduction in media spend. Street rates were also higher, same-store revenue per available foot grew by 4% compared to 3% in Q1. At the end of July, occupancy and asking rents were also higher than the same period last year. All of our top U.S. markets achieved positive revenue growth in Q2. In addition, despite lower media spend, all but one had greater move-ins. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew revenues by 1.5% compared to 0.6% in Q1. Move-ins grew by 1.2% despite a 58% reduction in media spend. San Francisco, our second-largest market, increased revenues by 3.6%, up from 3% in Q1. Move-ins were up 2.1% despite a 56% decline in media spend. The Southeast markets, Florida and Georgia, grew by 4%, up from 3.4% in Q1. Move-ins were flat to last year while our media spend was down 42%. The Pacific Northwest markets, primarily Seattle and Portland, grew by 3.5% revenue, up from 2.4% in Q1. Move-ins were up by 3.8% while our media spend was flat. The Northeast market, Boston, New York, D.C. and Philadelphia, grew revenues by 5.9%, down from 6% in Q1. Move-ins also declined to 3.2%. Media spend was declined by 23%. Our top-performing market was Detroit at 6.3% revenue growth. 
Our third quarter media spend is expected to be about the same as last year. Moving to our European operations, our same stores had top line growth of 1%, resulting from higher realized rents and higher occupancy. We ended Q2 with positive occupancy spread of 0.4%, up from a negative 0.2% at the end of Q1. We expect modest revenue growth for the balance of the year. Operating expenses were 4% higher, primarily from higher advertising and property taxes, resulting in negative NOI growth of 1.5%. With respect to acquisitions, we acquired another 3 properties for $40 million with about 300,000 net rentable square feet. 
In summary, our trends remain solid. Occupancies are higher, asking rents are higher, our cost of preferred securities are lower, our leverage is lower. We feel pretty good about delivering double-digit growth, with debt and preferred at 16% capitalization and in excess of 4.5x fixed charge coverage.

Two, in terms of buying stuff, I'd said this often. It's easy to buy stuff, you just show up with the biggest check. So we could buy as much real estate as we want and we just show up with the biggest check. And over time, I think our premium to NAV would dissipate. Given the market, given the deterioration of the CMBS market, given where the banks are moving with respect to asset disposition and the upcoming debt maturities, I am quite confident we will have plenty of opportunities to deploy capital here in the next year or 2. So from my perspective, I'm not worried about that will. We will remain disciplined and I think that is, in part, why our stock, is what you said, 50% NAV premium."

As outlined in our press release, our second quarter core FFO per share was $1.43 compared to $1.27 last year, a 13% increase. Three items primarily drove this growth. First, our same-store net operating income increased by 6.2% or approximately $15 million, representing $0.09 per share. Second, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.05 per share, primarily from the acquisition of an 80% interest in 2 joint ventures, along with the 13% higher euro-to-dollar currency exchange rate. Third, our nonsame-store properties added another $0.03 per share. These items were partially offset by higher G&A costs of about $0.02 per share. Our same-store net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 4%, along with flat operating expenses. Higher property taxes and property payroll expenses were offset by lower advertising, primarily due to lower television cost.
Our G&A expense for the quarter was $2.5 million higher than last year. This is primarily due to an additional $3 million for an intensive plan that is based upon 2011 same-store revenue growth. We expect this plan will add $13 million to our 2011 G&A expense compared to 2010. We recently completed several capital transactions. During the second quarter, we issued $375 million of 6.5% preferred stock, and we redeemed $518 million of 7.25% preferred stock. After the quarter, we issued $488 million of 6.35% preferred stock and called for redemption $425 million of 7.25% preferred stock. In the third quarter, there will be an associated EITF D-42 charge of approximately $13 million or $0.08 per share.
As a result of these transactions, our quarterly preferred dividend will be about $1 million lower in the third quarter and $3 million lower in the fourth quarter as compared to the same periods last year. As previously announced, Shurgard Europe acquired in early March the remaining 8% interest in 2 joint ventures that owned 72 properties for $238 million. The transaction was initially funded as a dollar-denominated loan by Public Storage. In mid-June, our partner in Shurgard Europe funded its proportionate share of the investment. Although the loan bore interest at 7%, it effectively was a participating loan. Accordingly, from early March until mid-June, we received 100% of the income from the 80% interest in the 2 joint ventures. After mid-June, we began receiving our 49% share from the joint ventures. Our second quarter earnings were about $3 million higher than they otherwise would have been due to this brief period where we received 100% of the income. Also in the quarter, we agreed to purchase through mergers, the remaining partnership interest in 5 Public Storage-sponsored partnerships for $154 million. These partnerships owned 47 properties with 2.7 million square feet. The transaction, which is subject to conditions, is expected to close in the third quarter. With that, I will now turn you over to Ron."

We ended Q2 with record same-store occupancy of 93.1% and maintained a healthy year-over-year spread of 1.5% despite a 50% reduction in media spend. Street rates were also higher. Same-store revenue per available foot grew by 4% compared to 3% in Q1. At the end of July, occupancy and asking rents were also higher than the same period last year. All of our top U.S. markets achieved positive revenue growth in Q2. In addition, despite lower media spend, all but one had greater move-ins. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew revenues by 1.5% compared to 0.6% in Q1. Move-ins grew by 1.2% despite a 58% reduction in media spend. San Francisco, our second-largest market, increased revenues by 3.6%, up from 3% in Q1. Move-ins were up 2.1% despite a 56% decline in media spend. The Southeast markets, Florida and Georgia, grew by 4%, up from 3.4% in Q1. Move-ins were flat to last year while our media spend was down 42%. The Pacific Northwest markets, primarily Seattle and Portland, grew by 3.5% revenue, up from 2.4% in Q1. Move-ins were up by 3.8% while our media spend was flat. The Northeast market, Boston, New York, D.C. and Philadelphia, grew revenues by 5.9%, down from 6% in Q1. Move-ins also declined by 3.2%. Media spend was declined by 23%. Our top-performing market was Detroit at 6.3% revenue growth.
Our third quarter media spend is expected to be about the same as last year. Moving to our European operations, our same stores had top line growth of 1%, resulting from higher realized rents and higher occupancy. We ended Q2 with positive occupancy spread of 0.4%, up from a negative 0.2% at the end of Q1. We expect modest revenue growth for the balance of the year. Operating expenses were 4% higher, primarily from higher advertising and property taxes, resulting in negative NOI growth of 1.5%. With respect to acquisitions, we acquired another 3 properties for $40 million with about 300,000 net rentable square feet.
In summary, our trends remain solid. Occupancies are higher. Asking rents are higher. Our cost of preferred securities are lower. Our leverage is lower. We feel pretty good about delivering double-digit growth with debt and preferred at 16% of capitalization and in excess of 4.5x fixed charge coverage. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

We just show up with the biggest check. And over time, I think our premium to NAV would dissipate. Given the market, given the deterioration of CMBS market, given where the banks are moving with respect to asset disposition and the upcoming debt maturities, I'm quite confident we will have plenty of opportunities to deploy capital here in the next year or 2.

As outlined in our press release, our second quarter core FFO per share was $1.43 compared to $1.27 last year, a 13% increase. Three items primarily drove this growth. First, our same-store net operating income increased by 6.2% or approximately $15 million, representing $0.09 per share. Second, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.05 per share, primarily from the acquisition of an 80% interest in 2 joint ventures, along with the 13% higher euro-to-dollar currency exchange rate. Third, our nonsame-store properties added another $0.03 per share. These items were partially offset by higher G&A costs of about $0.02 per share. Our same-store net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 4%, along with flat operating expenses. Higher property taxes and property payroll expenses were offset by lower advertising, primarily due to lower television cost.
Our G&A expense for the quarter was $2.5 million higher than last year. This is primarily due to an additional $3 million for an intensive plan that is based upon 2011 same-store revenue growth. We expect this plan will add $13 million to our 2011 G&A expense compared to 2010. We recently completed several capital transactions. During the second quarter, we issued $375 million of 6.5% preferred stock, and we redeemed $518 million of 7.25% preferred stock. After the quarter, we issued $488 million of 6.35% preferred stock and called for redemption $425 million of 7.25% preferred stock. In the third quarter, there will be an associated EITF D-42 charge of approximately $13 million or $0.08 per share.
As a result of these transactions, our quarterly preferred dividend will be about $1 million lower in the third quarter and $3 million lower in the fourth quarter as compared to the same periods last year. As previously announced, Shurgard Europe acquired in early March the remaining 8% interest in 2 joint ventures that own 72 properties for $238 million. The transaction was initially funded as a dollar-denominated loan by Public Storage. In mid-June, our partner in Shurgard Europe funded its proportionate share of the investment. Although the loan bore interest at 7%, it effectively was a participating loan. Accordingly, from early March until mid-June, we received 100% of the income from the 80% interest in the 2 joint ventures. After mid-June, we began receiving our 49% share from the joint ventures. Our second quarter earnings were about $3 million higher than they otherwise would have been due to this brief period where we received 100% of the income. Also in the quarter, we agreed to purchase through mergers, the remaining partnership interest in 5 Public Storage-sponsored partnerships for $154 million. These partnerships own 47 properties with 2.7 million square feet. The transaction, which is subject to conditions, is expected to close in the third quarter. With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

We added 31,000 net customers due to higher move-ins, offset in part by higher move-outs. We ended Q2 with record same-store occupancy of 93.1% and maintained a healthy year-over-year spread of 1.5% despite a 50% reduction in media spend. Street rates were also higher. Same-store revenue per available foot grew by 4% compared to 3% in Q1. At the end of July, occupancy and asking rents were also higher than the same period last year. All of our top U.S. markets achieved positive revenue growth in Q2. In addition, despite lower media spend, all but one had greater move-ins. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew revenues by 1.5% compared to 0.6% in Q1. Move-ins grew by 1.2% despite a 58% reduction in media spend. San Francisco, our second-largest market, increased revenues by 3.6%, up from 3% in Q1. Move-ins were up 2.1% despite a 56% decline in media spend. The Southeast markets, Florida and Georgia, grew by 4%, up from 3.4% in Q1. Move-ins were flat to last year while our media spend was down 42%. The Pacific Northwest markets, primarily Seattle and Portland, grew by 3.5% revenue, up from 2.4% in Q1. Move-ins were up by 3.8% while our media spend was flat. The Northeast markets, Boston, New York, D.C. and Philadelphia, grew revenues by 5.9%, down from 6% in Q1. Move-ins also declined by 3.2%. Media spend was declined by 23%. Our top-performing market was Detroit at 6.3% revenue growth.
Our third quarter media spend is expected to be about the same as last year. Moving to our European operations, our same stores had top line growth of 1%, resulting from higher realized rents and higher occupancy. We ended Q2 with positive occupancy spread of 0.4%, up from a negative 0.2% at the end of Q1. We expect modest revenue growth for the balance of the year. Operating expenses were 4% higher, primarily from higher advertising and property taxes, resulting in negative NOI growth of 1.5%. With respect to acquisitions, we acquired another 3 properties for $40 million with about 300,000 net rentable square feet.
In summary, our trends remain solid. Occupancies are higher. Asking rents are higher. Our cost of preferred securities are lower. Our leverage is lower. We feel pretty good about delivering double-digit growth with debt and preferred at 16% of capitalization and in excess of 4.5x fixed charge coverage. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

As outlined in our press release, our second quarter core FFO per share was $1.43 compared to $1.27 last year, a 13% increase. Three items primarily drove this growth. First, our same-store net operating income increased by 6.2% or approximately $15 million, representing $0.09 per share. Second, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.05 per share, primarily from the acquisition of an 80% interest in 2 joint ventures, along with the 13% higher euro-to-dollar currency exchange rate. Third, our nonsame-store properties added another $0.03 per share. These items were partially offset by higher G&A costs of about $0.02 per share. Our same-store net operating income benefited from higher revenues of 4%, along with flat operating expenses. Higher property taxes and property payroll expenses were offset by lower advertising, primarily due to lower television cost.
Our G&A expense for the quarter was $2.5 million higher than last year. This is primarily due to an additional $3 million for an intensive plan that is based upon 2011 same-store revenue growth. We expect this plan will add $13 million to our 2011 G&A expense compared to 2010. We recently completed several capital transactions. During the second quarter, we issued $375 million of 6.5% preferred stock, and we redeemed $518 million of 7.25% preferred stock. After the quarter, we issued $488 million of 6.35% preferred stock and called for redemption $425 million of 7.25% preferred stock. In the third quarter, there will be an associated EITF D-42 charge of approximately $13 million or $0.08 per share.
As a result of these transactions, our quarterly preferred dividend will be about $1 million lower in the third quarter and $3 million lower in the fourth quarter as compared to the same periods last year. As previously announced, Shurgard Europe acquired in early March the remaining 8% interest in 2 joint ventures that own 72 properties for $238 million. The transaction was initially funded as a dollar-denominated loan by Public Storage. In mid-June, our partner in Shurgard Europe funded its proportionate share of the investment. Although the loan bore interest at 7%, it effectively was a participating loan. Accordingly, from early March until mid-June, we received 100% of the income from the 80% interest in the 2 joint ventures. After mid-June, we began receiving our 49% share from the joint ventures. Our second quarter earnings were about $3 million higher than they otherwise would have been due to this brief period where we received 100% of the income. Also in the quarter, we agreed to purchase through mergers, the remaining partnership interest in 5 Public Storage-sponsored partnerships for $154 million. These partnerships own 47 properties with 2.7 million square feet. The transaction, which is subject to conditions, is expected to close in the third quarter. With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

We added 31,000 net customers due to higher move-ins, offset in part by higher move-outs. We ended Q2 with record same-store occupancy of 93.1% and maintained a healthy year-over-year spread of 1.5% despite a 50% reduction in media spend. Street rates were also higher. Same-store revenue per available foot grew by 4% compared to 3% in Q1. At the end of July, occupancy and asking rents were also higher than the same period last year. All of our top U.S. markets achieved positive revenue growth in Q2. In addition, despite lower media spend, all but one had greater move-ins. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew revenues by 1.5% compared to 0.6% in Q1. Move-ins grew by 1.2% despite a 58% reduction in media spend. San Francisco, our second-largest market, increased revenues by 3.6%, up from 3% in Q1. Move-ins were up 2.1% despite a 56% decline in media spend. The Southeast markets, Florida and Georgia, grew by 4%, up from 3.4% in Q1. Move-ins were flat to last year while our media spend was down 42%. The Pacific Northwest markets, primarily Seattle and Portland, grew by 3.5% revenue, up from 2.4% in Q1. Move-ins were up by 3.8% while our media spend was flat. The Northeast markets, Boston, New York, D.C. and Philadelphia, grew revenues by 5.9%, down from 6% in Q1. Move-ins also declined by 3.2%. Media spend was declined by 23%. Our top-performing market was Detroit at 6.3% revenue growth.
Our third quarter media spend is expected to be about the same as last year. Moving to our European operations, our same stores had top line growth of 1%, resulting from higher realized rents and higher occupancy. We ended Q2 with positive occupancy spread of 0.4%, up from a negative 0.2% at the end of Q1. We expect modest revenue growth for the balance of the year. Operating expenses were 4% higher, primarily from higher advertising and property taxes, resulting in negative NOI growth of 1.5%. With respect to acquisitions, we acquired another 3 properties for $40 million with about 300,000 net rentable square feet.
In summary, our trends remain solid. Occupancies are higher. Asking rents are higher. Our cost of preferred securities are lower. Our leverage is lower. We feel pretty good about delivering double-digit growth with debt and preferred at 16% of capitalization and in excess of 4.5x fixed charge coverage. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

We have, in some sense, had a meaningful expansion there by taking out our joint venture partner, which was about $240 million earlier in the year. So you can look at that in one sense as expansion in Europe and both Public Storage and New York Common contributed to the funding of that acquisition. With respect to Canada, that's really -- the Hughs family owns that, and that's really their decision in terms of what they want to do with it."

Two, in terms of buying stuff, I've said this often. It's easy to buy stuff. You just show up with the biggest check. So it's not -- I mean we could buy as much real estate as we wanted. We just show up with the biggest check. And over time, I think our premium to NAV would dissipate. Given the market, given the deterioration of CMBS market, given where the banks are moving with respect to asset disposition and the upcoming debt maturities, I'm quite confident we will have plenty of opportunities to deploy capital here in the next year or 2. So from my perspective, I'm not worried about that at all. But we will remain disciplined, and I think that is, in part, why our stock, is at what you said, that 50% NAV premium."

As outlined in our press release our third quarter core FFO per share was $1.56 compared to $1.35 last year, a 16% increase. Five items contributed to this growth. First, our same-store net operating income increased by 8.6%, adding $0.13 per share due to higher revenues of 5.8% and flat operating expenses. Second, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.03 per share, driven primarily by Shurgard's first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in 2 joint ventures. Non-same store properties added $0.03 per share, lower preferred dividends added $0.02 and higher ancillary income $0.01 per share. These items were partially offset by higher G&A cost of $0.02 per share due to increased incentive compensation. During the third quarter, we issued $488 million of 6.53% preferred stock and redeemed $525 million with a blended rate of 7.2%. In the fourth quarter, we will redeem an additional $105 million of preferred with a rate of 6.95%. It will be a charge associated with the redemption of about $3 million or $0.02 per share. As a result of these capital transactions completed in 2011, our quarterly preferred dividend is expected to be about $7 million lower in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year. With respect to Shurgard Europe, we expect to refinance the 2 joint venture loans into a single term loan of EUR 215 million, and eliminate the underlying joint venture structures. The new loan will mature in November 2014 and will have a lower interest rate. We expect to extend the maturity of our loan to Shurgard Europe to the first quarter of 2015. Since June 30, we've acquired about $176 million of affiliated partnership interest, using $120 million in cash and issuing 478,000 shares of common stock. We incurred transaction costs of approximately $2 million, which were included in our G&A expenses. With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

Same-store revenue per available foot grew by 5.4%, up from 3.7% in Q2. At the end of October, occupancy, in-place rent and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. In Q3, all of our top 20 markets achieved positive revenue growth. The Dallas and Minneapolis markets led the country, with revenue growth of 8.5%. Our largest market grew revenues by 3.1% compared to 1.5% in Q2. San Francisco, our second largest market, increased revenues by 5.8%, up from 3.6% in Q2. The Northeast markets had revenue growth of 7.1%, up from 5.9% in Q2. This growth was achieved despite a reduction in media expense. In Q4, our media expense is expected to increase by about $1 million. 
Moving to our European operations, rental revenues improved by 2.4% due to higher realized rents and higher occupancy. We ended Q3 occupancy at 86.3%, up 0.3% from last year. Operating expenses were higher by 2.3%, primarily from higher R&M, resulting in NOI growth of 2.5%. With respect to acquisitions, we've acquired 4 properties, 2 in California, one each in Florida and Maryland for about $38 million, with about $300,000 net rental per square feet. In summary, operating trends were positive across all our businesses and we are well positioned going into 2012. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

As outlined in our press release our third quarter core FFO per share was $1.56 compared to $1.35 last year, a 16% increase. Five items contributed to this growth: First, our same-store net operating income increased by 8.6%, adding $0.13 per share due to higher revenues of 5.8% and flat operating expenses; second, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.03 per share, driven primarily by Shurgard's first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in 2 joint ventures. Non-same store properties added $0.03 per share, lower preferred dividends added $0.02 and higher ancillary income $0.01 per share. These items were partially offset by higher G&A cost of $0.02 per share, due to increased incentive compensation. During the third quarter, we issued $488 million of 6.35% preferred stock and redeemed $525 million with a blended rate of 7.2%. In the fourth quarter, we will redeem an additional $105 million of preferred with a rate of 6.95%. It will be a charge associated with the redemption of about $3 million or $0.02 per share. As a result of these capital transactions completed in 2011, our quarterly preferred dividend is expected to be about $7 million lower in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year. With respect to Shurgard Europe, we expect to refinance the 2 joint venture loans into a single term loan of EUR 215 million, and eliminate the underlying joint venture structures. The new loan will mature in November 2014, and will have a lower interest rate. We expect to extend the maturity of our loan to Shurgard Europe to the first quarter of 2015. Since June 30, we've acquired about $176 million of affiliated partnership interest, using $120 million in cash and issuing 478,000 shares of common stock. We incurred transaction costs of approximately $2 million, which were included in our G&A expenses. With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

Our same-store movements were up by 2% year-over-year, offset in part by higher moveouts of up 3%. We ended Q3 with same-store occupancy of 91.7%, up 1.3% from last year. Same-store revenue per available foot grew by 5.4%, up from 3.7% in Q2. At the end of October, occupancy, in-place rent and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. In Q3, all of our top 20 markets achieved positive revenue growth. The Dallas and Minneapolis markets led the country, with revenue growth of 8.5%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew revenues by 3.1%, compared to 1.5% in Q2. San Francisco, our second largest market, increased revenues by 5.8%, up from 3.6% in Q2. The Northeast markets had revenue growth of 7.1%, up from 5.9% in Q2. This growth was achieved despite a reduction in media expense. In Q4, our media expense is expected to increase by about $1 million. 
Moving to our European operations, rental revenues improved by 2.4% due to higher realized rents and higher occupancy. We ended Q3 occupancy at 86.3%, up 0.3% from last year. Operating expenses were higher by 2.3%, primarily from higher R&M, resulting in NOI growth of 2.5%. With respect to acquisitions, we've acquired 4 properties, 2 in California, one each in Florida and Maryland for about $38 million, with about $300,000 net rental per square feet. In summary, operating trends were positive across all our businesses and we are well positioned going into 2012. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

As outlined in our press release, our third quarter core FFO per share was $1.56 compared to $1.35 last year, a 16% increase. Five items contributed to this growth: First, our same-store net operating income increased by 8.6%, adding $0.13 per share due to higher revenues of 5.8% and flat operating expenses; second, our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.03 per share, driven primarily by Shurgard's first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in 2 joint ventures. Non-same store properties added $0.03 per share, lower preferred dividends added $0.02 and higher ancillary income, $0.01 per share. These items were partially offset by higher G&A cost of $0.02 per share, due to increased incentive compensation. During the third quarter, we issued $488 million of 6.35% preferred stock and redeemed $525 million with a blended rate of 7.2%. In the fourth quarter, we will redeem an additional $105 million of preferred with a rate of 6.95%. It will be a charge associated with the redemption of about $3 million or $0.02 per share. As a result of these capital transactions completed in 2011, our quarterly preferred dividend is expected to be about $7 million lower in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year. With respect to Shurgard Europe, we expect to refinance the 2 joint venture loans into a single term loan of EUR 215 million and eliminate the underlying joint venture structures. The new loan will mature in November 2014, and will have a lower interest rate. We expect to extend the maturity of our loan to Shurgard Europe to the first quarter of 2015. Since June 30, we've acquired about $176 million of affiliated partnership interest, using $120 million in cash and issuing 478,000 shares of common stock. We incurred transaction costs of approximately $2 million, which were included in our G&A expenses. With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

Same-store revenue per available foot grew by 5.4%, up from 3.7% in Q2. At the end of October, occupancy, in-place rent and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. In Q3, all of our top 20 markets achieved positive revenue growth. The Dallas and Minneapolis markets led the country, with revenue growth of 8.5%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew revenues by 3.1%, compared to 1.5% in Q2. San Francisco, our second largest market, increased revenues by 5.8%, up from 3.6% in Q2. The Northeast markets had revenue growth of 7.1%, up from 5.9% in Q2. This growth was achieved despite a reduction in media expense. In Q4, our media expense is expected to increase by about $1 million. 
Moving to our European operations, rental revenues improved by 2.4% due to higher realized rents and higher occupancy. We ended Q3 occupancy at 86.3%, up 0.3% from last year. Operating expenses were higher by 2.3%, primarily from higher R&M, resulting in NOI growth of 2.5%. With respect to acquisitions, we've acquired 4 properties, 2 in California, one each in Florida and Maryland for about $38 million, with about 300,000 net rentable square feet. In summary, operating trends were positive across all our businesses, and we are well positioned going into 2012. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."
