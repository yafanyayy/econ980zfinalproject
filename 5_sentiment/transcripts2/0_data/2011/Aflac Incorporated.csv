250178,118702167,98058,"AFLAC Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with a review of 2010 with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong results throughout 2010. We were again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributo",2730,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with a review of 2010 with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong results throughout 2010. We were again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. Sales results were especially impressive considering the tough comparisons, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
Total annualized premium sales in yen exceeded our expectations and we're up a solid 6.5% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, sales rose 11%. For the second consecutive year we exceeded our annual sales goal of a zero to 5% increase. Additionally, the persistency improved for our large block of in-force business in Japan, rising from 94 to 94.2. An improvement in Aflac Japan's persistency rate contributes to the continued growth in premium income. Although Aflac Japan's benefit ratio rose in the fourth quarter, it improved for the full year. The fourth quarter benefit ratio reflects reserve adjustments made to a closed block of Dementia Care business that we stopped selling almost 20 years ago. As we look to 2011, we expect further improvement in the benefit ratio resulting in continued expansion of the profit margin.
In the first quarter of 2010, Japan's premium income grew 3.3% and improved to 4.4 for the fourth quarter which contributed to a 3.8% increase for the full year. As expected, our premium pretax profits continues to expand resulting in strong earnings growth for the year. The bank channel had a great year in 2010. Our innovative products aligned well with the product needs of the banks. Bank sales in the fourth quarter posted another record with sales of JPY 7 billion, which represents an increase of 140.4% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Last quarter I mentioned how we believe more banks and megabanks in particular would step up their efforts in selling Aflac's products and that's exactly what happened. At the end of December, Aflac Japan was represented by 364 banks, or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. Of all the banks, we now have been rolling our products, there's still many branches in their system that are not actively selling yet which means there are still enormous sales potential.
In addition to having a great year from a distribution standpoint we saw success on the product side of our business. Aflac Japan has honed its ability to customize our product portfolio to appeal to new market segments by enhancing the benefits of our existing product line. A good example is our expanding suite of medical products that we successfully created over the last decade. In fact, the medical product category was the number one contributor to total sales for both the fourth quarter and full year. You'll recall that in August of 2009, we launched a new EVER an updated version of our popular medical product. Promotion for the new EVER featuring the Maneki Neko or campaign that literally became an overnight sensation in Japan and prompted an incredible surge in the fourth quarter of 2009 medical sales. Although we saw a slight decline in medical sales compared to last year, this category generated a significant amount of new annualized premium.
Importantly, we maintained our position as the number one seller of medical products in Japan which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. Not only was 2010 a year in which we maintained our number one position in medical sales. It also was another year where our cancer product dominated the market. Cancer insurance sales made a solid contribution to total sales, accounted for 22% of the total sales for the year. We're introducing a new cancer policy called DAYS that replaces the base policy, cancer forte. This enhancement is one of our pillar products speak to the changing landscape in cancer treatment as well as our commitment to being the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan. It's important to remember that the foundation of our product portfolio has been and continues to be cancer and medical products. This solid platform allows us to leverage our competitive advantages such as brandying, administrative efficiencies and to grow our product offering and meet the evolving needs of consumers. 
As the bank channel has become a larger contributor to sales, Aflac Japan has also been enhancing its product portfolio to better meet the needs of banks including ways and child endowment products which were key drivers to growth for the fourth quarter and the year. is a unique hybrid whole life product that can be converted to a fixed annuity, a medical coverage or nursing care benefit when the policyholder reaches a predetermined age. WAYS was first introduced in 2006 and was revised to the bank channel in 2009. Sales of ways really took off in the fourth quarter accounting for 13.6% of the total production. But the real story can be seen in the phenomenal growth rates which was 149.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Consumers find this product attractive because it's the first options offer future flexibility. Banks like to sell this product because it has high premiums and Aflac's product margin is significantly enhanced when policyholders elect pay premiums upfront using what we referred to as the discounted advance premium. Importantly, 90% of the customers that the banks choose this payment option.
As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow significantly in 2011. The other strong driver of sales growth was the chile endowment product which was up 67.4% in the quarter and 132% for the year. This product, which was redesigned in 2009, is primarily used to help fund the higher cost associated with a child entering high school and college in Japan. Child endowment policies have been very popular in Japan for many years.
Aflac's strong brand, this product unmatched returns, our expanding presence in banks and the government's child subsidiary payments have started in June have helped make our endowment policy the product of choice. It's important to note that the average annual premium of the child endowment policy is about 3x the size of the health policy, meaning that the premium is a very solid contributor to the top line growth. Child endowment also offers a discounted advance premium and this product profit margin more than doubles when the policy holders elect to pay the premiums upfront using the discounted advance premiums. About half of the consumers who purchased our child endowment policies through banks elect this discounted advance premium method of payment. From top to bottom, Aflac Japan performed extremely well in 2010 despite tough sales comparisons. But before the fourth quarter even began, my mind has already shifted to 2011 and the challenge we would face following two years of strong sales results. Although I believe our sales momentum will continue into the first quarter of 2011, the comparisons get tougher as the year goes on, especially in the fourth quarter.
Taking all of these into account, as we noted in last night's press release, we expect sales to be in the range of down 2% to up 3%. Although I talked in November that sales increase for 2011 would be closer to flat to up 5%. However, after a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter, 2010 sales ended up 11% versus our projection in November which was up 9%. With such exceptional performance, I did not want to penalize Aflac Japan sales department for pushing so hard at the end of 2010. So that's how we came up with the sales expectations for Aflac Japan.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective's, Aflac U.S. continue to perform at expectations. However, ongoing low confidence levels from consumers and small businesses coupled with fewer employees at the work site continue to pose challenges for our U.S. sales growth. As such, we were not surprised these factors reflected in the sales decline of 2.3% for the fourth quarter and 4.9% for the year. You may recall that we acquired CAIC, now rebranded as Aflac Group in October of 2009. New annualized premium sales for Aflac U.S. included sales from Aflac Group of $42 million in the fourth quarter. This result represented a 58.7% increase for the quarter and represented half of Aflac Group Insurance production for the year. I was very excited to see that our traditional sales force rally to sell Group products into our account in addition to individual policies that they already sold.
While I would say our decision to acquire CAIC was a huge success, let me put it in perspective. An $83 million sales contribution from the Aflac Group represents only 6% of the total U.S. production in 2010. About 90% of our businesses continue to revolve around small business owners and accounts with fewer than 100 employees. These accounts don't usually have group insurance and our traditional individual agents continue to be the driving force behind our relationships with them. Our field force continues to be the key to our success and no one else has been able to establish this kind of field force network that we have at Aflac. Unfortunately, both the smaller accounts and our sales agents that sell to them are the slice of America that has been hit the hardest by the economic turmoil over the last two years. As you know, consumer confidence and small business segment continues to hover at low levels. We've also been facing recruiting condition that has not yet returned to business as usual. Although recruitment of sales associates in the fourth quarter was down 8.5%, it's showed significant improvement over the 25.4% decline in recruiting for the first nine months of the year. That means we've averaged 5,500 new recruits per quarter which is still a lot of people. But we can do better. 
Despite a significantly more positive outlook on the job market, some lingering uncertainty still makes it tough to find people with salaried jobs or extended unemployment benefits who are unwilling to take their chances in commission sales. We have adopted a more people-centric recruiting criteria and are continuing national recruiting contest and programs to expand our sales force and we anticipate this will expand the number of new recruits. Beyond expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we remain excited about developing relationships with insurance brokers. Our broker distribution initiative is still in its early stage but our efforts are translating into sales. The group product platform, which is preferred by brokers as an important part of our efforts to broaden our product portfolio. As I mentioned, we saw cross over for Aflac career agents embraced our new group products and frankly we also saw brokers selling individual policies. I tell our entire U.S. distribution system that I don't care whether they sell group or individual products but I do want them to let the existing accounts with more than 100 employees know that Aflac now offers group products in addition to individual policies. That's because if we don't at least that these accounts know that we offer group options you can bet that someone else will. If the accounts won't grow products and they know that Aflac offers them, I believe they'll choose Aflac over the competition.
Although weaker sales have slowed the top line growth somewhat over the last few years, we saw a steady improvement in persistency in 2010 compared to 2009. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing our U.S. operations including budget and people resource. Managing financial components within our control has improved our 2010 expense ratio from 33.7 to 32.5. We're taking measures to better reach potential customers with some innovative product benefits and solutions. We are also continuing to believe that the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products and we are building our business with that potential in mind.
For 2011, we expect Aflac U.S. sales to be flat to be up 5%. Some of you may feel that our 2011 sales expectations is too ambitious considering the environment. To that I would say that I will remain cautious until we see some stability in the economy but we've been adjusting our business to this environment and we still believe strongly in the products that we sell. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Inc. results. Excluding the benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 10.1% for the full year, meaning we achieved our goal of a 9% to 12% increase for 2010. Our balance sheet and capital position remain strong and, we believe that our investment approach of effectively matching assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach to our policyholders and shareholders. Clearly, a lot of attention has shifted recently to the impact of lower interest rates on earnings. As you've heard me say repeatedly since the early 90s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan's low interest rate environment. To address this, we started increasing the amount of Aflac Japan invest in dollar-denominated securities last year. This strategy, we discussed at the Tokyo Analyst Meeting this past September, produces two benefits: first, we're funding incremental dollar purchases with the sale of Japanese government bonds. These JGBs are scheduled to mature before the end of 2011 and this strategy allows us to capture the gains for tax purposes before they mature; second, we're able to invest the proceeds and higher-yielding dollar-denominated corporate bonds at a meaningful spread. The current strength of the yen and the wider spread of the dollar bond helps mitigate the currency risk associated with the strategy. While our preference is investing in yen-denominated securities we believe this is a short-term strategy to help enhance our yield during the low interest rate period.
As we communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong, risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a priority for us and you'll recall that it is also a component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our goal will stand 2010 with a higher RBC than our year end 2009 of 479. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that 2010 RBC ratio exceeded 580%. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategy. Our decision is to whether the increase the dividend or repurchase our shares is a function of our capital position. As you recall, Aflac's Board of Directors approved the 7.1% increase in the quarterly cash dividend effective in the fourth quarter of 2010 payment. That marked the 28th consecutive year of the dividend increase. Additionally, we resumed the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and purchased 2 million shares. We still anticipate repurchasing 6 million to 12 million shares in 2011. At the same time, I remain convinced it makes sense to maintain a healthy degree of conservatism given the economic uncertainties around the globe.
We continue to focus on maintaining strong fundamentals in our core business and building on our record of consistent earnings growth. As I commented in the third quarter release, we will likely be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per share in 2011. Although low interest rates have increased somewhat in the United States recently, they have not increased as much in Japan and the yields remain very low. If we assume 8% earnings per share growth, we would earn $5.97 per diluted share excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 80 to 85 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share.
Looking ahead to 2011 and beyond. We continue to believe that Japan and the United States each have characteristics to make them ideally suited for the insurance products we offer, and no other company is more focused on supplemental insurance products that respond to that need than Aflac. We are focused on providing value to the shareholders and we're fortunate that in the process of doing so, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide. Now I'll turn the program back over to Robin."

Let me go through some numbers for the fourth quarter and year end starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.5% for the quarter. Investment income was flat and excluding the effect of the stronger",923,"Thanks, Dan. Let me go through some numbers for the fourth quarter and year end starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.5% for the quarter. Investment income was flat and excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net investment income rose 2.8% in the quarter. The annualized persistency rate excluding annuities was 94.2%, up from the nine months and up from 94.0% in 2009. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio rose in the fourth quarter to 61.0 due to reserve adjustments made to a close block of Dementia business. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, the benefit ratio improved for the year by 90 basis points. The expense ratio for the quarter was 20.4%, down from 21.6% a year ago. The decrease reflected tight general expense controls and lower advertising expense in the quarter. The pretax margin decreased slightly from 18.7% to 18.6% in the quarter. With the retraction of the margin, pretax earnings increased 2.9% for the quarter in yen terms. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, pretax earnings were up 5.4% in the quarter.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.36%, and including the dollars, the blended rate was 2.61%. As part of our strategy that Dan talked about to address the low interest rate impairment in Japan, we made dollar-denominated purchases totaling $703 million through the end of 2010, and we'll continue these purchases in 2011 until we reach $1 billion. The yield on these securities was 4.19%.
The portfolio yield was 3.56% at the end of December, down eight basis points from the end of September and 21 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 2.5% in the fourth quarter and continue to benefit from the addition of Aflac Group sales. The annualized persistency rate for the year was 73.6% compared with 72.2% a year ago. Persistency showed steady improvement throughout 2010. The benefit ratio for the quarter was 50.1% compared with 53.8% a year ago. The decrease in the benefit ratio was due to adjustments made in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. The operating expense ratio was 32.5% compared with 33.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Reflecting improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the profit margin for the quarter was 17.4% compared with 12.5% a year ago. And pretax operating earnings were up 42.3% for the quarter. 
In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.45% versus 6.25% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of December was 6.92%, down four basis points from the third quarter and 25 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. Excluding FAS 115, the ratio of debt to total capital was 21.7% at the end of the year compared with 22.3% a year ago. Noninsurance interest expense in the fourth quarter was $41 million compared with $25 million a year ago. The higher interest expense reflected debt issue earlier in the year and the impact of a stronger yen on our yen-denominated debt.
Parent company and other expenses were $20 million in the fourth quarter compared with $32 million a year ago. The lower parent company expenses in the quarter primarily were the result of -- in 2009 we did not convert yen repatriation due to pending repayment of debt. In addition we had higher legal and consulting fees in 2009. These operating margins improved for the quarter. Pretax margin rose from 16.1% to 17.2%. The after-tax margin increased slightly from 11.0% to 11.2%. On an operating basis, the tax rate increased from 31.5% to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.92 compared to $0.53 in 2009. The primary difference between net and operating EPS was again realized investment losses which were $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $0.65 per share in 2009. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share for the quarter rose 12.7% to $1.33. The stronger yen increase operating earnings by $0.06 per diluted share for the quarter and $0.19 for the year. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share increased 7.6% for the quarter and 10.1% for the year. Lastly let me comment on the outlook for operating earnings per share for 2011.
As you heard Dan say, we affirmed our for 2011 of an 8% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share excluding the impact of the yen. With yen yields remaining very low, we're assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share growth. We would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. This year, we estimate that a one yen change on the average exchange rate for the year would equal approximately $4.05 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of 8% growth and the yen averages 80 to 85 for the full year, we would expect operating earnings per share to be in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share.
Now we will start taking people's questions. We want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to ask a question. So I'd like to ask you to limit your questions to just one to be fair to everyone else. Now we'll be glad to start taking questions."

Dementia reserve strengthening we had and the divert calls we be wrote off. But what you have to consider is we normally have a couple of different types of adjustments and either third or fourth quarter or any quarter for that matter. And in the fourth quarter this year we had some climb reserves released because we trued up some of the one-off factors and the experience analysis too, and we had some JPY 5.2 billion of claim reserves released compared to what we have posted at the end of the third quarter that offset some of that Dementia increase. Let me just make a couple more comments on that. That's not an unusual thing for us. As a matter of fact, in accordance with our SAC's requirements on internal standards for financial controls, we actually have that recorded that we'll do a review of the adequacy of Dementia reserves with respect to interest rates during the fourth quarter. And we'll do certain other updates on claim runoff factors for claim reserves and the like during the third or the fourth quarter, and we had all that coordinated with the audit work that goes on.  This quarter, we did strengthen the Dementia reserves and let me just tell you why. Last year, we also strengthened Dementia reserves in the fourth quarter but because they pretty much netted against other adjustments, we made the claim reserves and the like. We didn't discuss it because it didn't create any significant difference in the benefit ratio. So last year we strengthened interest rates underlying the reserving of the closed block of Dementia down to a 2.7% ultimate new money interest rate. We actually used 2.5%, upgraded it up to 2.7% because we thought interest rates were very low and likely to increase. This year we decided to eliminate the assumed increase in interest rates so we just kept the new money rate used to reserve that block at a flat 2.5. And that's the only thing that caused the increase in the reserve on that block of business."

And you've got this program where you're investing some Japanese cash flows into dollar-denominated securities that's layering in at least a little bit of additional yield.

One of the things that's creating us being bias toward the low end of the range is that in 2010 we had an extraordinary benefit to earnings of our U.S. operation caused by the termination of the large case and that created a net impact to profitability of roughly $40 million that we've got to find some way to cover in next year's earning comparisons. So that $40 million is a pretty good amount. Other than that, we're concerned about layering in of more low interest rates while we've moderated sales expectations in Japan due to modest or difficult comparisons. Japan sales and Japan profitability probably are going to be in line in terms of growth with 2010. We still need U.S. sales and U.S. revenue growth to recover to give us growth over and above covering this extraordinary benefit we got in 2010. So offsetting that is our ability to resume the share repurchase program and having achieved good capital adequacy positions during 2010 will allow us to deploy some of that accumulated capital during 2011."

Though we haven't finalized our statutory results yet, we're confident that our statutory earnings came in at somewhat over $2 billion after tax. The",665,"Let me start with an answer to that. 2010 as I've said was a year of strong capital accumulation for us. Though we haven't finalized our statutory results yet, we're confident that our statutory earnings came in at somewhat over $2 billion after tax. The realized losses on a statutory basis are pretty much pretax numbers and that's going to come in somewhere around $850 million to $900 million. So overall net earnings on a statutory basis are going to come in and around $1.2 billion. Now, that added to our capital position during 2010. Also, what you make in terms of statutory earnings less your realized losses gives you the amount of money you can dividend out of a light company without special approval. And let's just say that's going to be $1.2 billion; it was $1.4 billion last year. We didn't take out the $1.4 billion but we could take out -- and I'm speaking hypothetically at the moment, because we haven't finalized the numbers, but we could take out $1.2 billion to apply to capital management purposes. And that assumes that we could absorb say another $1 billion of realized losses in 2011 if we continue making statutory earnings in excess of $2 billion and replenish the capital we took out as the dividend. So that still leaves us at a very strong RBC position. So just hypothetically again say we took out $1 billion dividend and I'd go where is as I usually do meeting in terms of sources and uses of capital. But let's say we took out that $1.2 billion dividend we have over $600 million of cash in holding company. Today, let's just say we wanted to maintain $200 million or $300 million of that, that leaves us, say, $1.5 billion we might want to deploy. I'm giving you just a lot of numbers that are in my head. I haven't paired them with everybody that matters around here but this is some stuff I've been playing with. Say we got $1.5 billion available, and we've got a shareholder dividend commitment of around $500 million, a little more, maybe $525 million, say, that leaves us $1 billion to do, share repurchase or other activities what we'd said 6 million to 12 million shares while obviously at the high end of the range at 12 million say buying back shares is 58, 60 $7 a share, we'd spend somewhere between $700 million and $800 million there and maybe that leaves us a little bit more cushion. So I think the fact that we could I think maintain RBC levels that we ended 2010 still absorb some significant realized losses during 2011 which we hope not to do. But I'll let Jerry address that. Still maintain strong fundamental earnings group in statutory earnings which I expect we'll do puts us in a very good position for deploying capital during 2011. And I think that's sort of was on my mind. Some people have asked me in the past that you'll going to be so conservative that you just sit there and grow RBC levels. And I replied that, ""No, we're not going to sit there and create a position where we got significant sterile capital that's not being deployed."" and I just want to reiterate that. That's my conclusion. My only caveat is that I do have to worry a little bit about the impact of further strengthening of the yen on the solvency margin in Japan particularly we increased portion of our Japanese capital that we invested in dollars because we lose solvency margin benefits from doing that. But the yen is already pretty darn strong at JPY 82 to the dollar and Japanese industry is starting to complain about their ability to maintain exports and the like. So not to say that's a controlling factor for currency and we don't really predict currency we just try to manage whatever current environment we're in but that's kind of, John."

Let me just say one thing in the outset. The number one concern that I have and have had is in terms of risks to the portfolio's concentration risks that continues to be our highest priority to look for intelligent ways to reduce our concentration and diversify our risks. And so you've brought up a number of topics that kind of speak to that the first Greek banks. I think that obviously a very fluid situation. Sure there would be liability management exercises among the Greek banks in 2011 or maybe beyond that. And we'll keep an eye on that and if it's advantageous to us we may act on it. But we're constantly evaluating that prospect. I got to turn to Israel Elec first. Israel, as you know, is in effect a government agency if you will. They're not even more than 99% owned by the government. I think given the structure in Israel, it is highly unlikely that they would any other owner in the perceivable future because of the way their rate structure operates. I think nothing has changed materially in their business model. And in fact unlike what you've seen happen in Europe, their ability to raise capital in public markets has been unaffected this past month they in their history. So their liquidity remains pretty secure. But the problem there what their return on capital can be and given their capital expansion needs that's is something of a sore spot for them but their operating model hasn't changed. What has changed is that S&P took a look at what has been the status quo for years and decided to kind of fire a shot across the balance seems to me and downgrade it was a warning shot I guess to Israel they need to ensure Israel Elec achieve greater profitability. So we'll see what goes there but they still monopoly there essential service in Israel. And their profits while low are adequate. So we're not concerned about their ability to service debt.  Turning to Tunisia, what we can say about there is I think it's an interesting situation because one of the key reasons Tunisia was he was not able to demonize the opposition because it was not fundamentalist opposition it was really much more of a secular opposition. And I think -- so therefore I think you have a well educated, very secular population, that I would say that the outcome politically is highly uncertain. But I would also say that the market has not responded with any material devaluation of their bond. If you look back to December valuations on Tunisian public debt and then you look at the valuations today, many of their issues trained well above par, and none of them have been devalued by more than 5% of the marketplace. So I think globally there's not the level of concern about Tunisia that there is in Egypt which is much more, the opposition there is probably a little more troubling. InvestCorp, I think again an interesting situation. I think we remain pretty comfortable with InvestCorp it is a large exposure but they have really shifted much towards a key-based business model as opposed to direct investment and hedge et cetera. So their profitability is much more stable. They were able to raise significant capital over the last 18 months. So I would view that as a fairly stable situation."

As you probably know we had an exposure to talk of. We sold our final exposure in the first quarter of 2010. Eyeful was quite a different situation because -- and is quite a difficult situation, they have a significant amount of liquidity, and they have sources of funding that will last them for at least the next three or four years. But they are operating in an industry where the rules have changed materially in the last couple of years, and it changed negatively for them. But given the support of their banks and given their liquidity, we continue to support them. But when they came out with earnings results and I think that they came out in October, we became somewhat uncomfortable with the disclosures we were receiving. And so that really precipitated the impairment there. We viewed their future as I guess more more opaque than it had been. So that's speak to the actual situation. With the Irish banks, really I guess there were two things there that triggered our decision. So first is they started receiving -- and the two are related, by the way, the first is that they started receiving significant amounts of support from the Irish government, and as a result the politicians have kind of taken over rule of law when it comes to the rights of bondholders. We do subordinated debt which prior to the Irish banking crisis had debt was considered except from law sharing. But in Ireland there are no rules about subordinated debt anymore that we can take comfort in so. And we were concerned that the Irish government was going to exact serious law sharing kind of lease from subordinated debt holders so Irish announced a tender offer we pursued that with them. Irish kind of similar background kind of different situation over. They have not taken on government support. And at this point it's unclear whether or not. But we decided to be proactive in that situation because they too are governed by Irish law. So no clarity as to why it's going to resolve itself."

I know you know that production in the bank channel, particularly of the channel child endowment and WAYS is going to drive overall margin down a little bit. Because those products, those two products produced more investment-spread income than they do property context underwriting income the difference between premiums, benefits and expenses, particularly child endowment that's kind of as close to zero underwriting product we're putting equals benefits and expenses at the assumed pricing interest rate. And then what you do is make a spread on the reserves based on the difference between earned interest rate on investment assets and the required interest rate on reserves. And that's going to emerge more over time, Ed, on that child endowment. And also I've talked about advanced premium deposit funds of being spread-type generator, too. So those spreads don't emerge in proportion to premium. They emerge over time in proportion to invested assets and earned rates versus credited rates. And WAYS is similar though not quite as extreme as child endowment. So I'm telling you that if the margin, the underwriting margin goes down, it's going to be replaced to some extent by increased investment spread that you won't directly see. The way we look at the numbers now. I'm promising you all and we talked about the many September. We didn't talk about it but I don't it to a number of you. I mention it again, I think in the third quarter report and in that meeting I'm going to try to lay out a lot more about the impact of child endowment and WAYS on the margin computations. But I want to assure you that those products are expected to produce profits, not quite at the level of our medical products. And I'm telling you that.

250178,118702167,98226,"AFLAC Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Robin, and good morning. Thank you for joining us. Let me begin a review of 2010 with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong results throughout 2010. We were again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. S",2735,"Thank you, Robin, and good morning. Thank you for joining us. Let me begin a review of 2010 with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong results throughout 2010. We were again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. Sales results were especially impressive considering the tough comparisons, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
Total new annualized premium sales in yen exceeded our expectations, and we're up a solid 6.5% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, sales rose 11%, for the second consecutive year, we exceeded our annual sales goal of a zero to 5% increase. Additionally, the persistency improved for our large block of in-force business in Japan, rising from 94.0% to 94.2%. An improvement in Aflac Japan's persistency rate contributes to the continued growth in premium income. Although Aflac Japan's benefit ratio rose in the fourth quarter, it improved for the full year. The fourth quarter benefit ratio reflects reserve adjustments made to a closed block of Dementia Care business that we stopped selling almost 20 years ago. As we look to 2011, we expect further improvement in the benefit ratio resulting in continued expansion of the profit margin.
In the first quarter of 2010, Japan's premium income grew 3.3% and improved to 4.4% for the fourth quarter, which contributed to a 3.8% increase for the full year. As expected, our premium pretax profits continued to expand, resulting in strong earnings growth for the year. The bank channel had a great year in 2010. Our innovative products aligned well with the product needs of the banks. Bank sales in the fourth quarter posted another record with sales of JPY 7 billion, which represents an increase of 140.4% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Last quarter I mentioned how we believe more banks and mega banks in particular would step up their efforts in selling Aflac's products, and that's exactly what happened. At the end of December, Aflac Japan was represented by 364 banks, or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. Of all the banks, we now have enrolling our products, there's still many branches in their system that are not actively selling yet, which means there's still enormous sales potential.
In addition to having a great year from a distribution standpoint, we saw a success on the product side of our business. Aflac Japan has honed its ability to customize our product portfolio to appeal to new market segments by enhancing the benefits of our existing product line. A good example is our expanding suite of medical products that we've successfully created over the last decade. In fact, the medical product category was the number one contributor to total sales for both the fourth quarter and full year. You'll recall that in August of 2009, we launched new EVER, an updated version of our popular medical product. Promotion for the new EVER featured the Maneki Neko or cat duck advertising campaign that literally became an overnight sensation in Japan, and prompted an incredible surge in the fourth quarter of 2009 medical sales. Although we saw a slight decline in medical sales compared to last year, this category generated a significant amount of new annualized premium.
Importantly, we maintained our position as the number one seller of medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. Not only was 2010 a year in which we maintained our number one position in medical sales, it also was another year where our cancer products dominated the market. Cancer insurance sales made a solid contribution to total the sales, accounting for 22% of the total sales for the year. We're introducing a new cancer policy called DAYS [ph] that replaces the base policy, Cancer Forte. This enhancement of one of our pillar products speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatment, as well as our commitment to being the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan. It's important to remember that the foundation of our product portfolio has been, and continues to be, cancer and medical products. This solid platform allows us to leverage our competitive advantages such as branding, administrative efficiencies and to grow our product offering and meet the evolving needs of consumers. 
As the bank channel has become a larger contributor to sales, Aflac Japan has also been enhancing its product portfolio to better meet the needs of banks including WAYS and child endowment products, which were key drivers to growth for the fourth quarter and the year. WAYS is a unique hybrid whole life product that can be converted to a fixed annuity, a medical coverage or nursing care benefit when the policyholder reaches a predetermined age. WAYS was first introduced in 2006, and was revised to the bank channel in 2009. Sales of WAYS really took off in the fourth quarter, accounting for 13.6% of the total production. But the real story can be seen in the phenomenal growth rate, which was 149.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Consumers find this product attractive because the first options offer future flexibility. Banks like to sell this product because it has high premiums. And Aflac's product margin is significantly enhanced when policyholders elect to pay premiums upfront using what we referred to as the discounted advanced premium. Importantly, 90% of the customers at the banks choose this payment option.
As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow significantly in 2011. The other strong driver of sales growth was the child endowment product, which was up 67.4% for the quarter and 132% for the year. This product, which was redesigned in 2009, is primarily used to help fund the higher cost associated with a child entering high school and college in Japan. Child endowment policies have been very popular in Japan for many years.
Aflac's strong brand, this product's unmatched returns, our expanding presence in banks and the government's child subsidiary payments that started in June have helped make our endowment policy the product of choice. It's important to note that the average annual premium of the child endowment policy is about 3x the size of the health policy, meaning that the premium is very solid contributor to the top line growth. Child endowment also offers a discounted advanced premium, and this product's profit margin more than doubles when the policy holders elect to pay the premiums upfront using the discounted advanced premiums. About half of the consumers who purchased our child endowment policies through banks elect this discounted advanced premium method of payment. From top to bottom, Aflac Japan performed extremely well in 2010 despite tough sales comparisons. But before the fourth quarter even began, my mind had already shifted to 2011, and the challenge we would face following two years of strong sales results. Although I believe our sales momentum will continue into the first quarter of 2011, the comparisons get tougher as the year goes on, especially in the fourth quarter.
Taking all of these into account, as we noted in last night's press release, we expect sales to be in the range of down 2% to up 3%, although I talked in November that sales increase for 2011 would be closer to flat to up 5%. However, after a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter, 2010 sales ended up 11% versus our projection in November which was up 9%. With such exceptional performance, I did not want to penalize Aflac Japan sales department for pushing so hard at the end of 2010. So that's how we came up with the sales expectations for Aflac Japan.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. continued to perform at expectations. However, ongoing low confidence level from consumers and small businesses coupled with fewer employees at the work site continued to pose challenges for our U.S. sales growth. As such, we were not surprised that these factors reflected in the sales decline of 2.3% for the fourth quarter and 4.9% for the year. You may recall that we acquired CAIC, now rebranded as Aflac Group, in October of 2009. New annualized premium sales for Aflac U.S. included sales from Aflac Group of $42 million in the fourth quarter. This result represented a 58.7% increase for the quarter and represented half of Aflac Group Insurance production for the year. I was very excited to see that our traditional sales force rallied to sell group products into our account in addition to individual policies that they already sold.
While I would say our decision to acquire CAIC was a huge success, let me put it in perspective. An $83 million sales contribution from the Aflac Group represents only 6% of the total U.S. production in 2010. About 90% of our businesses continues to revolve around small business owners and accounts with fewer than 100 employees. These accounts don't usually have group insurance, and our traditional individual agents continue to be the driving force behind our relationships with them. Our field force continues to be the key to our success, and no one else has been able to establish this kind of field force network that we have at Aflac. Unfortunately, both the smaller accounts and our sales agents that sell to them are the slice of America that has been hit the hardest by the economic turmoil over the last two years. As you know, consumer confidence and small business segment continues to hover at low levels. We've also been facing recruiting condition that has not yet returned to business as usual. Although recruitment of sales associates in the fourth quarter was down 8.5%, it showed significant improvement over the 25.4% decline in recruiting for the first nine months of the year. That means we've averaged 5,500 new recruits per quarter, which is still a lot of people, but we can do better. 
Despite a significantly more positive outlook on the job market, some lingering uncertainty still makes it tough to find people with salary jobs or extended unemployment benefits who are willing to take their chances in commission sales. We have adopted a more people-centric recruiting criteria and are continuing national recruiting contest and programs to expand our sales force, and we anticipate this will expand the number of new recruits. Beyond expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we remain excited about developing relationships with insurance brokers. Our broker distribution initiative is still in its early stage, but our efforts are translating into sales. 
The group product platform, which is preferred by brokers as an important part of our efforts to broaden our product portfolio. As I mentioned, we saw a cross-over for Aflac career agents embraced our new group products, and frankly, we also saw brokers selling individual policies. I tell our entire U.S. distribution system that I don't care whether they sell group or individual products, but I do want them to let the existing accounts with more than 100 employees know that Aflac now offers group products in addition to individual policies. That's because if we don't at least let these accounts know that we offer group option, you can bet that someone else will. If the accounts want group products, and they know that Aflac offers them, I believe they'll choose Aflac over the competition.
Although weaker sales have slowed the top line growth somewhat over the last few years, we saw a steady improvement in persistency in 2010 compared to 2009. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing our U.S. operations, including budget and people resource. Managing financial components within our control has improved our 2010 expense ratio from 33.7% to 32.5%. We're taking measures to better reach potential customers with some innovative product benefits and solutions. We also continue to believe that the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind.
For 2011, we expect Aflac U.S. sales to be flat to up 5%. Some of you may feel that our 2011 sales expectations is too ambitious considering the environment. To that, I would say that I will remain cautious until we see some stability in the economy. But we've been adjusting our business to this environment, and we still believe strongly in the products that we sell. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Incorporated results. Excluding the benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 10.1% for the full year, meaning we achieved our goal of a 9% to 12% increase for 2010. Our balance sheet and capital position remain strong, and we believe that our investment approach of effectively matching assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach to our policyholders and shareholders. Clearly, a lot of attention has shifted recently to the impact of lower interest rates on earnings. As you've heard me say repeatedly since the early 90s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan's low interest rate environment. To address this, we've started increasing the amount that Aflac Japan invest in dollar-denominated securities last year. This strategy, we discussed at the Tokyo Analyst Meeting this past September, produces two benefits. First, we're funding incremental dollar purchases with the sale of Japanese government bonds. These JGBs are scheduled to mature before the end of 2011, and this strategy allows us to capture the gains for tax purposes before they mature. Second, we're able to invest the proceeds in higher-yielding dollar-denominated corporate bond at a meaningful spread. The current strength of the yen and the wider spread of the dollar bond helps mitigate the currency risk associated with this strategy. While our preference is to invest in yen-denominated securities, we believe this is a short-term strategy to help enhance our yield during the low interest rate periods.
As we communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong, risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a priority for us, and you'll recall that it is also a component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our goal was to end 2010 with a higher RBC than our year-end  2009 of 479%. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that 2010 RBC ratio exceeded 580%. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategy. Our decision as to whether to increase the dividend or repurchase our shares is a function of our capital position. As you'll recall, Aflac's Board of Directors approved the 7.1% increase in the quarterly cash dividend effective in the fourth quarter of 2010 payment, that marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Additionally, we resumed the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and purchased 2 million shares. We still anticipate repurchasing 6 million to 12 million shares in 2011. At the same time, I remain convinced it makes sense to maintain a healthy degree of conservatism given the economic uncertainties around the globe.
We continue to focus on maintaining strong fundamentals in our core business and building on our record of consistent earnings growth. As I commented in the third quarter release, we will likely be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per share in 2011. Although low interest rates have increased somewhat in the United States recently, they have not increased as much in Japan, and the yields remain very low. If we assume 8% earnings per share growth, we would earn $5.97 per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 80 to 85 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share.
Looking ahead to 2011 and beyond. We continue to believe that Japan and the United States each have characteristics to make them ideally suited for the insurance products we offer. And no other company is more focused on supplemental insurance products that respond to that need than Aflac. We are focused on providing value to the shareholders, and we're fortunate that in the process of doing so, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide. Now I'll turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?"

Beginning with the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.5% for the quarter. Investment income was flat, and excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net investment income rose 2.8% in the quarter. The annualized persistency rate, excluding annuities, was 94.2%, up from the nine months, and up from 94.0% in 2009. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio rose in the fourth quarter to 61.0, due to reserve adjustments made to a closed block of Dementia business. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, the benefit ratio improved for the year by 90 basis points. The expense ratio for the quarter was 20.4%, down from 21.6% a year ago. The decrease reflected tight general expense controls and lower advertising expense in the quarter. The pretax margin decreased slightly from 18.7% to 18.6% in the quarter. With the retraction of the margin, pretax earnings increased 2.9% for the quarter in yen terms. Excluding the impact of a stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, pretax earnings were up 5.4% in the quarter.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.36%, and including the dollars, the blended rate was 2.61%. As part of our strategy that Dan talked about to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar-denominated purchases totaling $703 million through the end of 2010. And we'll continue these purchases into 2011 until we reach $1 billion. The yield on these securities was 4.19%.
The portfolio yield was 3.56% at the end of December, down eight basis points from the end of September, and 21 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 2.5% in the fourth quarter and continued to benefit from the addition of Aflac Group sales. The annualized persistency rate for the year was 73.6% compared with 72.2% a year ago. Persistency showed steady improvement throughout 2010. The benefit ratio for the quarter was 50.1% compared with 53.8% a year ago. The decrease in the benefit ratio was due to adjustments made in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. The operating expense ratio was 32.5% compared with 33.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the profit margin for the quarter was 17.4% compared with 12.5% a year ago. And pretax operating earnings were up 42.3% for the quarter. 
In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.45% versus 6.25% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of December was 6.92%, down four basis points from the third quarter and 25 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. Excluding FAS 115, the ratio of debt to total capital was 21.7% at the end of the year compared with 22.3% a year ago. Noninsurance interest expense in the fourth quarter was $41 million compared with $25 million a year ago. The higher interest expense reflected debt issuance earlier in the year and the impact of a stronger yen on our yen-denominated debt.
Parent company and other expenses were $20 million in the fourth quarter compared with $32 million a year ago. The lower parent company expenses in the quarter primarily were the result of -- in 2009 we did not convert yen repatriation due to pending repayment of debt. In addition we had higher legal and consulting fees in 2009. The operating margins improved for the quarter. Pretax margin rose from 16.1% to 17.2%. The after-tax margin increased slightly from 11.0% to 11.2%. On an operating basis, the tax rate increased from 31.5% to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.92 compared to $0.53 in 2009. The primary difference between net and operating EPS was, again, realized investment losses, which were $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $0.65 per share in 2009. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share for the quarter rose 12.7% to $1.33. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.06 per diluted share for the quarter and $0.19 for the year. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share increased 7.6% for the quarter and 10.1% for the year. Lastly, let me comment on the outlook for operating earnings per share for 2011.
As you've heard Dan say, we affirmed our objective  for 2011 of an 8% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. With yen yields remaining very low, we're assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share growth, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. This year, we estimate that a one yen change on the average exchange rate for the year would equal approximately $0.045 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of 8% growth, and the yen averages 80 to 85 for the full year, we would expect operating earnings per share to be in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share.
Now we will start taking people's questions. We want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to ask a question. So I'd like to ask you to limit your questions to just one to be fair to everyone else. Now we'll be glad to start taking questions."

Dementia reserve strengthening we had and the divert calls we wrote off. But what you have to consider is we normally have a couple of different types of adjustments in either third quarter or fourth quarter or any quarter for that matter. And in the fourth quarter this year, we had some claim reserves released because we trued up some of the one-off factors and the experience analysis too, and we had some JPY 5.2 billion of claim reserves released compared to what we had posted at the end of the third quarter that offset some of that Dementia increase. Let me just make a couple more comments on that. That's not an unusual thing for us. As a matter of fact, in accordance with our SACS requirements on internal standards for financial controls, we actually have it recorded that we'll do a review of the adequacy of Dementia reserves with respect to interest rates during the fourth quarter. And we'll do certain other updates on claim runoff factors for claim reserves and the like during either the third or the fourth quarter. And we have all that coordinated with the audit work that goes on. This quarter, we did strengthen the Dementia reserves, and let me just tell you why. Last year, we also strengthened Dementia reserves in the fourth quarter but because they pretty much netted against other adjustments, we made the claim reserves and the like. We didn't discuss it because it didn't create any significant difference in the benefit ratio. So last year, we strengthened interest rates underlying the reserving of the closed block of Dementia down to a 2.7% ultimate new money interest rate. We actually used 2.5%, upgraded it up to 2.7% because we thought interest rates were very low and likely to increase. This year we decided to eliminate the assumed increase in interest rates, so we just kept the new money rate used to reserve that block at a flat 2.5%. And that's the only thing that caused the increase in the reserve on that block of business."

One of the things that's creating us being bias toward the low end of the range is that in 2010, we had an extraordinary benefit to earnings of our U.S. operation caused by the termination of a large case, and that created a net impact to profitability of roughly $40 million that we've got to find some way to cover in next year's earning comparisons. So that $40 million is a pretty good amount. Other than that, we're concerned about layering in of more low interest rates while we've moderated sales expectations in Japan due to modest or difficult comparisons. Japan sales and Japan profitability, probably will be in line in terms of growth with 2010. We still need U.S. sales and U.S. revenue growth to recover to give us growth over and above covering this extraordinary benefit we got in 2010. So offsetting that is our ability to resume the share repurchase program, and having achieved good capital adequacy positions during 2010 will allow us to deploy some of that accumulated capital during 2011."

Though we haven't finalized our statutory results yet, we're confident that our statutory earnings came in at somewhat over $2 billion after tax. Th",674,"Let me start with an answer to that. 2010, as I've said, was a year of strong capital accumulation for us. Though we haven't finalized our statutory results yet, we're confident that our statutory earnings came in at somewhat over $2 billion after tax. The realized losses on a statutory basis are pretty much pretax numbers, and that's going to come in somewhere around $850 million to $900 million. So overall, net earnings on a statutory basis are going to come in and around $1.2 billion. Now, that added to our capital position during 2010. Also, what you make in terms of statutory earnings less your realized losses gives you the amount of money you can dividend out of the like company without special approval. And let's just say that's going to be $1.2 billion, it was $1.4 billion last year, we didn't take out the $1.4 billion, but we could take out -- and I'm speaking hypothetically at the moment, because we haven't finalized the numbers, but we could take out $1.2 billion to apply to capital management purposes. And that assumes that we could absorb say another $1 billion of realized losses in 2011 if we continue making statutory earnings in excess of $2 billion and replenish the capital we took out as the dividend. So that still leaves us in a very strong RBC position. So just hypothetically again, say we took out $1 billion dividend, and I'll go where all else, as I usually do at the cap meeting in terms of sources and uses of capital. But let's say we took out that $1.2 billion dividend, we have over $600 million of cash in holding company, today, let's just say we wanted to maintain $200 million or $300 million of that, that leaves us with, say, $1.5 billion we might want to deploy. I'm giving you just a lot of numbers that are in my head. I haven't prepared them with everybody that matters around here, but this is some stuff I've been playing with. Say we got $1.5 billion available, and we've got a shareholder dividend commitment of around $500 million, a little more, maybe $525 million. Say, that leaves us $1 billion to do, share repurchase or other activities, well we've said 6 million to 12 million shares while obviously at the high end of the range at 12 million say buying back shares of $58, $67 a share, we'd spend somewhere between $700 million and $800 million there, and maybe that leaves us a little bit more cushion. So I think the fact that we could I think maintain RBC levels that we ended 2010 at still absorbs some significant realized losses during 2011, which we hope not to do. But I'll let Jerry address that. Still maintained strong fundamental earnings group in statutory earnings, which I expect we'll do, puts us in a very good position for deploying capital during 2011. And I think that's sort of what's on my mind. Some people have asked me in the past, you're going to be so conservative that you'll just sit there and grow RBC levels. And I replied that, no, we're not going to just sit there and create a position where we got significant sterile capital that's not being deployed, and I just want to reiterate that. That's my conclusion. My only caveat is that I do have to worry a little bit about the impact of further strengthening of the yen on the solvency margin in Japan particularly we increased portion of our Japanese capital that we invested dollars because we lose some solvency margin benefits from doing that. But the yen is already pretty darn strong at JPY 82 to the dollar, and Japanese industry is starting to complain about their ability to maintain exports and the like. So not to say that, that's a controlling factor for currency, and we don't really predict currency, we just try to manage in where currency environment we're in, but that's kind of brain dump, John."

The number one concern that I have and have had is in terms of risks to the portfolio's concentration risks, that continues to be our highest priority to look for intelligent ways to reduce our concentration and diversify our risks. And so you've brought up a number of topics that kind of speak to that the first being the Greek banks. I think that obviously a very fluid situation. Sure there would be liability management exercises among the Greek banks in 2011 or maybe beyond that. And we'll keep an eye on that, and if it's advantageous to us we may act on it. But we're constantly evaluating that prospect. I got to turn to Israel Elec first. Israel Elec, as you know, is in effect a government agency, if you will. They're more than 99% owned by the government. I think given the structure in Israel, it is highly unlikely that they would have any other owner other than the government in the foreseeable future because of the way their rate structure operates. I think nothing has changed materially in their business model. And in fact unlike what you've seen happen in Europe, their ability to raise capital in public markets has been unaffected this past month. They just hit the domestic debt via largest in their history. So their liquidity remains pretty secure. But the problem there has been on what their return on capital can be, and given their capital expansion needs that's is something of a sore spot for them, but their operating model hasn't changed. What has changed is that S&P took a look at what has been the status quo for years and decided to kind of fire a shot across the balance, seems to me, and downgrade it was a warning shot I guess to Israel they need to ensure Israel Elec can achieve greater profitability. So we'll see what goes there, but they still are monopoly there and essential service in Israel. And their profits while low are adequate. So we're not concerned about their ability to service debt.  Turning to Tunisia, what we can say about there is I think it's an interesting situation because one of the key reasons that Ali left Tunisia was he was not able to demonize the opposition because it was not Muslim fundamentalist opposition. It was really much more of a secular opposition. So therefore I think you have a well educated, very secular population, that I would say that the outcome politically is highly uncertain there. But I would also say that the market has not responded with any material devaluation of their bonds. If you look back to December valuations on Tunisian public debt, and then you look at the valuations today, many of their issues trade well above par, and none of them have been devalued by more than 5% in the marketplace. So I think globally there's not the level of concern about Tunisia that there is in Egypt, which is much more, the opposition there is probably a little more troubling. InvestCorp, I think again an interesting situation. I think we remain pretty comfortable with InvestCorp it is a large exposure but they have really shifted much towards a key-based business model as opposed to direct investment and hedge et cetera. So their profitability is much more stable. They were able to raise significant capital over the last 18 months. So I would view that as a fairly stable situation."

The Aiful, as part of the Japanese consumer finance industry, as you probably know, we had an exposure to talk to [indiscernible] . We sold our final exposure in the first quarter of 2010. Aiful was quite a different situation because -- and is quite a different situation, they have a significant amount of liquidity, and they have sources of funding that will last them for at least the next three or four years. But they are operating in an industry where the rules have changed materially in the last couple of years, and it changed negatively for them. But given the support of their banks and given their liquidity, we continue to support them. But when they came out with earnings results, and I think that they came out in October, we became somewhat uncomfortable with the disclosures we were receiving. And so that really precipitated the impairment there. We view their future as, I guess, more opaque than it had been. So that's speak to the Aiful situation. With our Irish banks, really, I guess there were two things there that triggered our decision to sell, impairment sell. First is they started receiving -- and the two are related, the first is that they started receiving significant amounts of support from the Irish government, and as a result the politicians have kind of taken over rule of law when it comes to the rights of the bondholders. We did own a subordinated debt, which prior to the Irish banking crisis, had debt was considered except from law sharing. But in Ireland there are no rules about subordinated debt anymore that we can take comfort in, and we were concerned that the Irish government was going to do exact serious law sharing kind of lease, from subordinated debt holders. So when Irish announced a tender offer, we pursued that with them. Irish like in permament kind of similar background quite a different situation or they have not taken on any government support. And at this point it's unclear whether or not it's bill. But we decided to be proactive in that situation because they too are governed by Irish law that there's no clarity as to why it's going to resolve itself. Did that help?"

And then what you do is make a spread on the reserves based on the difference between earned interest rate on investment assets and the required interest rate on reserves. And that's going to emerge more over time, Ed, on that child endowment. And also I've talked about advanced premium deposit funds of being spread-type generator, too. So those spreads don't emerge in proportion to premium. They emerge over time in proportion to invested assets and earned rates versus credited rates.

250178,118702167,98458,"AFLAC Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Robin, and good morning. Thank you for joining us. Let me begin a review of 2010 with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong results throughout 2010. We were again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. S",2734,"Thank you, Robin, and good morning. Thank you for joining us. Let me begin a review of 2010 with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong results throughout 2010. We were again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. Sales results were especially impressive considering the tough comparisons, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
Total new annualized premium sales in yen exceeded our expectations, and we're up a solid 6.5% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, sales rose 11%, for the second consecutive year, we exceeded our annual sales goal of a zero to 5% increase. Additionally, the persistency improved for our large block of in-force business in Japan, rising from 94.0% to 94.2%. An improvement in Aflac Japan's persistency rate contributes to the continued growth in premium income. Although Aflac Japan's benefit ratio rose in the fourth quarter, it improved for the full year. The fourth quarter benefit ratio reflects reserve adjustments made to a closed block of Dementia Care business that we stopped selling almost 20 years ago. As we look to 2011, we expect further improvement in the benefit ratio resulting in the continued expansion of the profit margin.
In the first quarter of 2010, Japan's premium income grew 3.3% and improved to 4.4% for the fourth quarter, which contributed to a 3.8% increase for the full year. As expected, our premium pretax profits continued to expand, resulting in strong earnings growth for the year. The bank channel had a great year in 2010. Our innovative products aligned well with the product needs of the banks. Bank sales in the fourth quarter posted another record with sales of JPY 7 billion, which represents an increase of 140.4% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Last quarter I mentioned how we believe more banks and mega banks in particular would step up their efforts in selling Aflac's products, and that's exactly what happened. At the end of December, Aflac Japan was represented by 364 banks, or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. Of all the banks, we now have enrolling our products, there's still many branches in their system that are not actively selling yet, which means there's still enormous sales potential.
In addition to having a great year from a distribution standpoint, we saw success on the product side of our business. Aflac Japan has honed its ability to customize our product portfolio to appeal to new market segments by enhancing the benefits of our existing product line. A good example is our expanding suite of medical products that we've successfully created over the last decade. In fact, the medical product category was the number one contributor to total sales for both the fourth quarter and full year. You'll recall that in August of 2009, we launched new EVER, an updated version of our popular medical product. Promotion for the new EVER featured the Maneki Neko or cat duck advertising campaign that literally became an overnight sensation in Japan, and prompted an incredible surge in the fourth quarter of 2009 medical sales. Although we saw a slight decline in medical sales compared to last year, this category generated a significant amount of new annualized premium.
Importantly, we maintained our position as the number one seller of medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. Not only was 2010 a year in which we maintained our number one position in medical sales, it also was another year where our cancer products dominated the market. Cancer insurance sales made a solid contribution to total the sales, accounting for 22% of the total sales for the year. We're introducing a new cancer policy called DAYS that replaces the base policy, Cancer Forte. This enhancement of one of our pillar products speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatment, as well as our commitment to being the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan. It's important to remember that the foundation of our product portfolio has been, and continues to be, cancer and medical products. This solid platform allows us to leverage our competitive advantages such as branding, administrative efficiencies and to grow our product offering and meet the evolving needs of consumers. 
As the bank channel has become a larger contributor to sales, Aflac Japan has also been enhancing its product portfolio to better meet the needs of banks including WAYS and child endowment products, which were key drivers to growth for the fourth quarter and the year. WAYS is a unique hybrid whole life product that can be converted to a fixed annuity, a medical coverage or nursing care benefit when the policyholder reaches a predetermined age. WAYS was first introduced in 2006, and was revised to the bank channel in 2009. Sales of WAYS really took off in the fourth quarter, accounting for 13.6% of the total production. But the real story can be seen in the phenomenal growth rate, which was 149.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
Consumers find this product attractive because the first options offer future flexibility. Banks like to sell this product because it has high premiums. And Aflac's product margin is significantly enhanced when policyholders elect to pay premiums upfront using what we referred to as the discounted advanced premium. Importantly, 90% of the customers at the banks choose this payment option.
As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow significantly in 2011. The other strong driver of sales growth was the child endowment product, which was up 67.4% for the quarter and 132% for the year. This product, which was redesigned in 2009, is primarily used to help fund the higher cost associated with a child entering high school and college in Japan. Child endowment policies have been very popular in Japan for many years.
Aflac's strong brand, this product's unmatched returns, our expanding presence in banks and the government's child subsidiary payments that started in June have helped make our endowment policy the product of choice. It's important to note that the average annual premium of the child endowment policy is about 3x the size of the health policy, meaning that the premium is very solid contributor to the top line growth. Child endowment also offers a discounted advanced premium, and this product's profit margin more than doubles when the policy holders elect to pay the premiums upfront using the discounted advanced premiums. About half of the consumers who purchased our child endowment policies through banks elect this discounted advanced premium method of payment. From top to bottom, Aflac Japan performed extremely well in 2010 despite tough sales comparisons. But before the fourth quarter even began, my mind had already shifted to 2011, and the challenge we would face following two years of strong sales results. Although I believe our sales momentum will continue into the first quarter of 2011, the comparisons get tougher as the year goes on, especially in the fourth quarter.
Taking all of this into account, as we noted in last night's press release, we expect sales to be in the range of down 2% to up 3%, although I thought in November that sales increase for 2011 would be closer to flat to up 5%. However, after a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter, 2010 sales ended up 11% versus our projection in November which was up 9%. With such exceptional performance, I did not want to penalize Aflac Japan sales department for pushing so hard at the end of 2010. So that's how we came up with the sales expectations for Aflac Japan.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. continued to perform at expectations. However, ongoing low confidence level from consumers and small businesses coupled with fewer employees at the work site continued to pose challenges for our U.S. sales growth. As such, we were not surprised that these factors reflected in the sales decline of 2.3% for the fourth quarter and 4.9% for the year. You may recall that we acquired CAIC, now rebranded as Aflac Group, in October of 2009. New annualized premium sales for Aflac U.S. included sales from Aflac Group of $42 million in the fourth quarter. This result represented a 58.7% increase for the quarter and represented half of Aflac Group Insurance production for the year. I was very excited to see that our traditional sales force rallied to sell group products to our account in addition to individual policies that they already sold.
While I would say our decision to acquire CAIC was a huge success, let me put it in perspective. An $83 million sales contribution from the Aflac Group represents only 6% of the total U.S. production in 2010. About 90% of our businesses continues to revolve around small business owners and accounts with fewer than 100 employees. These accounts don't usually have group insurance, and our traditional individual agents continue to be the driving force behind our relationships with them. Our field force continues to be the key to our success, and no one else has been able to establish this kind of field force network that we have at Aflac. Unfortunately, both the smaller accounts and our sales agents that sell to them are the slice of America that has been hit the hardest by the economic turmoil over the last two years. As you know, consumer confidence and small business segment continues to hover at low levels. We've also been facing recruiting conditions that have not yet returned to business as usual. Although recruitment of sales associates in the fourth quarter was down 8.5%, it showed significant improvement over the 25.4% decline in recruiting for the first nine months of the year. That means we've averaged 5,500 new recruits per quarter, which is still a lot of people, but we can do better. 
Despite a significantly more positive outlook on the job market, some lingering uncertainty still makes it tough to find people with salary jobs or extended unemployment benefits who are unwilling to take their chances in commission sales. We have adopted a more people-centric recruiting criteria and are continuing national recruiting contest and programs to expand our sales force, and we anticipate this will expand the number of new recruits. Beyond expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we remain excited about developing relationships with insurance brokers. Our broker distribution initiative is still in its early stage, but our efforts are translating into sales. 
The group product platform, which is preferred by brokers is an important part of our efforts to broaden our product portfolio. As I mentioned, we saw a cross-over for Aflac career agents embraced our new group products, and frankly, we also saw brokers selling individual policies. I tell our entire U.S. distribution system that I don't care whether they sell group or individual products, but I do want them to let the existing accounts with more than 100 employees know that Aflac now offers group products in addition to individual policies. That's because if we don't at least let these accounts know that we offer group option, you can bet that someone else will. If the accounts want group products, and they know that Aflac offers them, I believe they'll choose Aflac over the competition.
Although weaker sales have slowed the top line growth somewhat over the last few years, we saw a steady improvement in persistency in 2010 compared to 2009. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing our U.S. operations, including budget and people resource. Managing financial components within our control has improved our 2010 expense ratio from 33.7% to 32.5%. We're taking measures to better reach potential customers with some innovative product benefits and solutions. We also continue to believe that the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind.
For 2011, we expect Aflac U.S. sales to be flat to up 5%. Some of you may feel that our 2011 sales expectations is too ambitious considering the environment. To that, I would say that I will remain cautious until we see some stability in the economy. But we've been adjusting our business to this environment, and we still believe strongly in the products that we sell. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Incorporated results. Excluding the benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 10.1% for the full year, meaning we achieved our goal of a 9% to 12% increase for 2010. Our balance sheet and capital position remain strong, and we believe that our investment approach of effectively matching assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach to our policyholders and shareholders. Clearly, a lot of attention has shifted recently to the impact of lower interest rates on earnings. As you've heard me say repeatedly since the early 90s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan's low interest rate environment. To address this, we've started increasing the amount that Aflac Japan invest in dollar-denominated securities last year. This strategy, we discussed at the Tokyo Analyst Meeting this past September, produces two benefits. First, we're funding incremental dollar purchases with the sale of Japanese government bonds. These JGBs are scheduled to mature before the end of 2011, and this strategy allows us to capture the gains for tax purposes before they mature. Second, we're able to invest the proceeds in higher-yielding dollar-denominated corporate bond at a meaningful spread. The current strength of the yen and the wider spread of the dollar bond helps mitigate the currency risk associated with this strategy. While our preference is to invest in yen-denominated securities, we believe this is a short-term strategy to help enhance our yield during the low interest rate periods.
As we communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong, risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a priority for us, and you'll recall that it is also a component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our goal was to end 2010 with a higher RBC than our year-end 2009 of 479%. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that 2010 RBC ratio exceeded 580%. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategy. Our decision as to whether to increase the dividend or repurchase our shares is a function of our capital position. As you'll recall, Aflac's Board of Directors approved the 7.1% increase in the quarterly cash dividend effective in the fourth quarter of 2010 payment. That marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Additionally, we resumed the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and purchased 2 million shares. We still anticipate repurchasing 6 million to 12 million shares in 2011. At the same time, I remain convinced it makes sense to maintain a healthy degree of conservatism given the economic uncertainties around the globe.
We continue to focus on maintaining strong fundamentals in our core business and building on our record of consistent earnings growth. As I commented in the third quarter release, we will likely be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per share in 2011. Although low interest rates have increased somewhat in the United States recently, they have not increased as much in Japan, and the yields remain very low. If we assume 8% earnings per share growth, we would earn $5.97 per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 80 to 85 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share.
Looking ahead to 2011 and beyond. We continue to believe that Japan and the United States each have characteristics to make them ideally suited for the insurance products we offer. And no other company is more focused on supplemental insurance products that respond to that need than Aflac. We are focused on providing value to the shareholders, and we're fortunate that in the process of doing so, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide. Now I'll turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?"

Beginning with the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.5% for the quarter. Investment income was flat, and excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net investment income rose 2.8% in the quarter. The annualized persistency rate, excluding annuities, was 94.2%, up from the nine months, and up from 94.0% in 2009. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio rose in the fourth quarter to 61.0, due to reserve adjustments made to a closed block of Dementia business. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, the benefit ratio improved for the year by 90 basis points. The expense ratio for the quarter was 20.4%, down from 21.6% a year ago. The decrease reflected tight general expense controls and lower advertising expense in the quarter. The pretax margin decreased slightly from 18.7% to 18.6% in the quarter. With the retraction of the margin, pretax earnings increased 2.9% for the quarter in yen terms. Excluding the impact of a stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, pretax earnings were up 5.4% in the quarter.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.36%, and including the dollars, the blended rate was 2.61%. As part of our strategy that Dan talked about to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar-denominated purchases totaling $703 million through the end of 2010. And we'll continue these purchases into 2011 until we reach $1 billion. The yield on these securities was 4.19%.
The portfolio yield was 3.56% at the end of December, down eight basis points from the end of September, and 21 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 2.5% in the fourth quarter and continued to benefit from the addition of Aflac Group sales. The annualized persistency rate for the year was 73.6% compared with 72.2% a year ago. Persistency showed steady improvement throughout 2010. The benefit ratio for the quarter was 50.1% compared with 53.8% a year ago. The decrease in the benefit ratio was due to adjustments made in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. The operating expense ratio was 32.5% compared with 33.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the profit margin for the quarter was 17.4% compared with 12.5% a year ago. And pretax operating earnings were up 42.3% for the quarter. 
In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.45% versus 6.25% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of December was 6.92%, down four basis points from the third quarter and 25 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. Excluding FAS 115, the ratio of debt to total capital was 21.7% at the end of the year compared with 22.3% a year ago. Noninsurance interest expense in the fourth quarter was $41 million compared with $25 million a year ago. The higher interest expense reflected debt issuance earlier in the year and the impact of a stronger yen on our yen-denominated debt.
Parent company and other expenses were $20 million in the fourth quarter compared with $32 million a year ago. The lower parent company expenses in the quarter primarily were the result of -- in 2009 we did not convert yen repatriation due to pending repayment of debt. In addition we had higher legal and consulting fees in 2009. The operating margins improved for the quarter. Pretax margin rose from 16.1% to 17.2%. The after-tax margin increased slightly from 11.0% to 11.2%. On an operating basis, the tax rate increased from 31.5% to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.92 compared to $0.53 in 2009. The primary difference between net and operating EPS was, again, realized investment losses, which were $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $0.65 per share in 2009. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share for the quarter rose 12.7% to $1.33. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.06 per diluted share for the quarter and $0.19 for the year. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share increased 7.6% for the quarter and 10.1% for the year. Lastly, let me comment on the outlook for operating earnings per share for 2011.
As you've heard Dan say, we affirmed our objective for 2011 of an 8% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. With yen yields remaining very low, we're assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share growth, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. This year, we estimate that a one yen change on the average exchange rate for the year would equal approximately $0.045 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of 8% growth, and the yen averages 80 to 85 for the full year, we would expect operating earnings per share to be in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share.
Now we will start taking people's questions. We want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to ask a question. So I'd like to ask you to limit your questions to just one to be fair to everyone else. Now we'll be glad to start taking questions."

Dementia reserve strengthening we had and the divert costs we wrote off. But what you have to consider is we normally have a couple of different types of adjustments in either third quarter or fourth quarter or any quarter for that matter. And in the fourth quarter this year, we had some claim reserves released because we trued up some of the runoff factors and the experience analysis too, and we had some JPY 5.2 billion of claim reserves released compared to what we had posted at the end of the third quarter that offset some of that Dementia increase. Let me just make a couple more comments on that. That's not an unusual thing for us. As a matter of fact, in accordance with our SACS requirements on internal standards for financial controls, we actually have it recorded that we'll do a review of the adequacy of Dementia reserves with respect to interest rates during the fourth quarter. And we'll do certain other updates on claim runoff factors for claim reserves and the like during either the third or the fourth quarter. And we have all that coordinated with the audit work that goes on. This quarter, we did strengthen the dementia reserves, and let me just tell you why. Last year, we also strengthened dementia reserves in the fourth quarter but because they pretty much netted against other adjustments, we made the claim reserves and the like. We didn't discuss it because it didn't create any significant difference in the benefit ratio. So last year, we strengthened interest rates underlying the reserving of the closed block of dementia down to a 2.7% ultimate new money interest rate. We actually used 2.5%, upgraded it up to 2.7% because we thought interest rates were very low and likely to increase. This year we decided to eliminate the assumed increase in interest rates, so we just kept the new money rate used to reserve that block at a flat 2.5%. And that's the only thing that caused the increase in the reserve on that block of business."

Other than that, we're concerned about layering in of more low interest rates while we've moderated sales expectations in Japan due to modest or difficult comparisons.

Though we haven't finalized our statutory results yet, we're confident that our statutory earnings came in at somewhat over $2 billion after tax. Th",675,"Let me start with an answer to that. 2010, as I've said, was a year of strong capital accumulation for us. Though we haven't finalized our statutory results yet, we're confident that our statutory earnings came in at somewhat over $2 billion after tax. The realized losses on a statutory basis are pretty much pretax numbers, and that's going to come in somewhere around $850 million to $900 million. So overall, net earnings on a statutory basis are going to come in and around $1.2 billion. Now, that added to our capital position during 2010. Also, what you make in terms of statutory earnings less your realized losses gives you the amount of money you can dividend out of the like company without special approval. And let's just say that's going to be $1.2 billion, it was $1.4 billion last year, we didn't take out the $1.4 billion, but we could take out -- and I'm speaking hypothetically at the moment, because we haven't finalized the numbers, but we could take out $1.2 billion to apply to capital management purposes. And that assumes that we could absorb say another $1 billion of realized losses in 2011 if we continue making statutory earnings in excess of $2 billion and replenish the capital we took out as the dividend. So that still leaves us in a very strong RBC position. So just hypothetically again, say we took out $1 billion dividend, and I'll go over all this, as I usually do at the cap meeting in terms of sources and uses of capital. But let's say we took out that $1.2 billion dividend, we have over $600 million of cash in holding company, today, let's just say we wanted to maintain $200 million or $300 million of that, that leaves us with, say, $1.5 billion we might want to deploy. I'm giving you just a lot of numbers that are in my head. I haven't prepared them with everybody that matters around here, but this is some stuff I've been playing with. Say we got $1.5 billion available, and we've got a shareholder dividend commitment of around $500 million, a little more, maybe $525 million. Say, that leaves us $1 billion to do share repurchase or other activities, well we've said 6 million to 12 million shares while obviously at the high end of the range at 12 million say buying back shares of $58, $67 a share, we'd spend somewhere between $700 million and $800 million there, and maybe that leaves us a little bit more cushion. So I think the fact that we could I think maintain RBC levels that we ended 2010 at still absorbs some significant realized losses during 2011, which we hope not to do. But I'll let Jerry address that. Still maintained strong fundamental earnings group in statutory earnings, which I expect we'll do, puts us in a very good position for deploying capital during 2011. And I think that's sort of what's on my mind. Some people have asked me in the past, you're going to be so conservative that you'll just sit there and grow RBC levels. And I replied that, no, we're not going to just sit there and create a position where we got significant sterile capital that's not being deployed, and I just want to reiterate that. That's my conclusion. My only caveat is that I do have to worry a little bit about the impact of further strengthening of the yen on the solvency margin in Japan particularly if we increased portion of our Japanese capital that we invested dollars because we lose some solvency margin benefits from doing that. But the yen is already pretty darn strong at JPY 82 to the dollar, and Japanese industry is starting to complain about their ability to maintain exports and the like. So not to say that, that's a controlling factor for currency, and we don't really predict currency, we just try to manage in whatever currency environment we're in, but that's kind of brain dump, John."

And that ratio has been growing pretty nicely. At the end of the fourth quarter, that has come to about 50%, a little -- I'm sorry, 27% for all banks and 51% for the mega banks. And that's as of the end of the 2010. And if we look at the fourth quarter, the penetration is even higher, and that has come to 6% for the mega banks. But still, we think we have a lot of potential there. So the number can obviously grow even farther, and even if we reach out the number very close to 100%, that really means that one branch says only 1% for the month. And we have no reason to believe that they can sell two policies per month, or even three policies. So I don't know which inning we are in, but I'm sure that we have a plenty of potentials on that."

The number one concern that I have and have had is in terms of risks to the portfolio's concentration risks, that continues to be our highest priorities, to look for intelligent ways to reduce our concentration and diversify our risks. And so you've brought up a number of topics that kind of speak to that the first being the Greek banks. I think that obviously that’s a very fluid situation. Sure there would be liability management exercises among the Greek banks in 2011 or maybe beyond that. And we'll keep an eye on that, and if it's advantageous to us we may act on it. But we're constantly evaluating that prospect. I got to turn to Israel Elec first. Israel Elec, as you know, is in effect a government agency, if you will. They're more than 99% owned by the government. I think given the structure in Israel, it is highly unlikely that they would have any other owner other than the government in the foreseeable future because of the way their rate structure operates. I think nothing has changed materially in their business model. And in fact, unlike what you've seen happen in Europe, their ability to raise capital in public markets has been unaffected this past month. They just hit the domestic debt, the largest in their history. So their liquidity remains pretty secure. But the problem there has been on what their return on capital can be, and given their capital expansion needs that is something of a sore spot for them, but their operating model hasn't changed. What has changed is that S&P took a look at what has been the status quo for years and decided to kind of fire a shot across the balance, seems to me, and downgrade them and it was a warning shot I guess to Israel they need to ensure Israel Elec can achieve greater profitability. So we'll see what goes there, but they still are monopoly there and essential service in Israel. And their profits while low are adequate. So we're not concerned about their ability to service debt.  Turning to Tunisia, what we can say about there is I think it's an interesting situation because one of the key reasons that Ali left Tunisia was he was not able to demonize the opposition because it was not Muslim fundamentalist opposition. It was really much more of a secular opposition. So therefore, I think you have a well educated, very secular population, that I would say that the outcome politically is highly uncertain there. But I would also say that the market has not responded with any material devaluation of their bonds. If you look back to December valuations on Tunisian public debt, and then you look at the valuations today, many of their issues trade well above par, and none of them have been devalued by more than 5% in the marketplace. So I think globally there's not the level of concern about Tunisia that there is in Egypt, which is much more, the opposition there is probably a little more troubling. InvestCorp, I think is again, an interesting situation. I think we remain pretty comfortable with InvestCorp it is a large exposure but they have really shifted much towards a key-based business model as opposed to direct investment and hedge fund et cetera. So their profitability is much more stable. They were able to raise significant capital over the last 18 months. So I would view that as a fairly stable situation."

The Aiful, as part of the Japanese consumer finance industry, as you probably know, we had an exposure to talk to Fuji and we sold our final exposure in the first quarter of 2010. Aiful was quite a different situation because -- and is quite a different situation, they have a significant amount of liquidity, and they have sources of funding that will last them for at least the next three or four years. But they are operating in an industry where the rules have changed materially in the last couple of years, and it changed negatively for them. But given the support of their banks and given their liquidity, we continue to support them. But when they came out with earnings results, and I think that they came out in October, we became somewhat uncomfortable with the disclosures we were receiving. And so that really precipitated the impairment there. We view their future is, I guess, more opaque than it had been. So that speaks to the Aiful situation. With our Allied Irish banks, really, I guess there were two things there that triggered our decision to sell, impairment sell. First is they started receiving -- and the two are related, the first is that they started receiving significant amounts of support from the Irish government, and as a result the politicians have kind of taken over rule of law when it comes to the rights of the bondholders. We did own a subordinated debt, which prior to the Irish banking crisis, had debt was considered exempt from law sharing. But in Ireland, there are no rules about subordinated debt anymore that we can take comfort in, and we were concerned that the Irish government was going to do exact serious law sharing penalties from subordinated debt holders of Allied Irish. So when Allied Irish announced a tender offer, we pursued that with them. Irish Life & Permanent kind of similar background, quite a different situation or they have not taken on any government support. And at this point it's unclear whether or not it will. But we decided to be proactive in that situation because they too are governed by Irish law that there's no clarity as to why it's going to resolve itself. Did that help?"

I know you know that production in the bank channel, particularly of the child endowment and WAYS, is going to drive the overall margin down a little bit because those two products produce more investment-spread income than they do -- let me use a property and cash context underwriting income, the difference between premiums, benefits and expenses, particularly child endowment, that's kind of as close to zero underwriting product we're putting equals benefits and expenses at the assumed pricing interest rate. And then what you do is make a spread on the reserves based on the difference between earned interest rate on investment assets and the required interest rate on reserves. And that's going to emerge more over time, Ed, on that child endowment. And also I've talked about advanced premium deposit funds of being spread-type generator, too. So those spreads don't emerge in proportion to premium. They emerge over time in proportion to invested assets and earned rates versus credited rates. And WAYS is similar though not quite as extreme as child endowment. So I'm telling you that if the margin, the underwriting margin goes down, it's going to be replaced to some extent by increased investment spreads that you won't directly see. The way we look at the numbers now, I'm promising you all, we talked about this some the many fab in September, we didn't talk about it on the program, but I talked to a number of you. I'll mention it again, I think in the third quarter report and at the fab meeting in May, I'm going to try to lay out a lot more about the impact of child endowment and WAYS on the margin computations. But I want to assure you that those products are expected to produce profits, not quite at the level of our medical products.

Before we start, I'd like to mention the Safe Harbor language to you. Let me point out that some statements in this teleconference are forward looking within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discussed today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly report for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. Now, I'll turn the program over to Dan who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and our operations in Japan and the United States. I'll follow up with a few financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the year, and then we'll take your questions. Dan?"
250178,118702167,98998,"AFLAC Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2011",2011-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Robin, and good morning. Thank you for joining us. Let me begin a review of 2010 with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong results throughout 2010. We were again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. S",2734,"Thank you, Robin, and good morning. Thank you for joining us. Let me begin a review of 2010 with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong results throughout 2010. We were again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. Sales results were especially impressive considering the tough comparisons, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
Total new annualized premium sales in yen exceeded our expectations, and we're up a solid 6.5% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, sales rose 11%, for the second consecutive year, we exceeded our annual sales goal of a zero to 5% increase. Additionally, the persistency improved for our large block of in-force business in Japan, rising from 94.0% to 94.2%. An improvement in Aflac Japan's persistency rate contributes to the continued growth in premium income. Although Aflac Japan's benefit ratio rose in the fourth quarter, it improved for the full year. The fourth quarter benefit ratio reflects reserve adjustments made to a closed block of Dementia Care business that we stopped selling almost 20 years ago. As we look to 2011, we expect further improvement in the benefit ratio resulting in the continued expansion of the profit margin.
In the first quarter of 2010, Japan's premium income grew 3.3% and improved to 4.4% for the fourth quarter, which contributed to a 3.8% increase for the full year. As expected, our premium pretax profits continued to expand, resulting in strong earnings growth for the year. The bank channel had a great year in 2010. Our innovative products aligned well with the product needs of the banks. Bank sales in the fourth quarter posted another record with sales of JPY 7 billion, which represents an increase of 140.4% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Last quarter I mentioned how we believe more banks and mega banks in particular would step up their efforts in selling Aflac's products, and that's exactly what happened. At the end of December, Aflac Japan was represented by 364 banks, or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. Of all the banks, we now have enrolling our products, there's still many branches in their system that are not actively selling yet, which means there's still enormous sales potential.
In addition to having a great year from a distribution standpoint, we saw success on the product side of our business. Aflac Japan has honed its ability to customize our product portfolio to appeal to new market segments by enhancing the benefits of our existing product line. A good example is our expanding suite of medical products that we've successfully created over the last decade. In fact, the medical product category was the number one contributor to total sales for both the fourth quarter and full year. You'll recall that in August of 2009, we launched new EVER, an updated version of our popular medical product. Promotion for the new EVER featured the Maneki Neko or cat duck advertising campaign that literally became an overnight sensation in Japan, and prompted an incredible surge in the fourth quarter of 2009 medical sales. Although we saw a slight decline in medical sales compared to last year, this category generated a significant amount of new annualized premium.
Importantly, we maintained our position as the number one seller of medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. Not only was 2010 a year in which we maintained our number one position in medical sales, it also was another year where our cancer products dominated the market. Cancer insurance sales made a solid contribution to total the sales, accounting for 22% of the total sales for the year. We're introducing a new cancer policy called DAYS that replaces the base policy, Cancer Forte. This enhancement of one of our pillar products speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatment, as well as our commitment to being the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan. It's important to remember that the foundation of our product portfolio has been, and continues to be, cancer and medical products. This solid platform allows us to leverage our competitive advantages such as branding, administrative efficiencies and to grow our product offering and meet the evolving needs of consumers. 
As the bank channel has become a larger contributor to sales, Aflac Japan has also been enhancing its product portfolio to better meet the needs of banks including WAYS and child endowment products, which were key drivers to growth for the fourth quarter and the year. WAYS is a unique hybrid whole life product that can be converted to a fixed annuity, a medical coverage or nursing care benefit when the policyholder reaches a predetermined age. WAYS was first introduced in 2006, and was revised to the bank channel in 2009. Sales of WAYS really took off in the fourth quarter, accounting for 13.6% of the total production. But the real story can be seen in the phenomenal growth rate, which was 149.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
Consumers find this product attractive because the first options offer future flexibility. Banks like to sell this product because it has high premiums. And Aflac's product margin is significantly enhanced when policyholders elect to pay premiums upfront using what we referred to as the discounted advanced premium. Importantly, 90% of the customers at the banks choose this payment option.
As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow significantly in 2011. The other strong driver of sales growth was the child endowment product, which was up 67.4% for the quarter and 132% for the year. This product, which was redesigned in 2009, is primarily used to help fund the higher cost associated with a child entering high school and college in Japan. Child endowment policies have been very popular in Japan for many years.
Aflac's strong brand, this product's unmatched returns, our expanding presence in banks and the government's child subsidiary payments that started in June have helped make our endowment policy the product of choice. It's important to note that the average annual premium of the child endowment policy is about 3x the size of the health policy, meaning that the premium is very solid contributor to the top line growth. Child endowment also offers a discounted advanced premium, and this product's profit margin more than doubles when the policy holders elect to pay the premiums upfront using the discounted advanced premiums. About half of the consumers who purchased our child endowment policies through banks elect this discounted advanced premium method of payment. From top to bottom, Aflac Japan performed extremely well in 2010 despite tough sales comparisons. But before the fourth quarter even began, my mind had already shifted to 2011, and the challenge we would face following two years of strong sales results. Although I believe our sales momentum will continue into the first quarter of 2011, the comparisons get tougher as the year goes on, especially in the fourth quarter.
Taking all of this into account, as we noted in last night's press release, we expect sales to be in the range of down 2% to up 3%, although I thought in November that sales increase for 2011 would be closer to flat to up 5%. However, after a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter, 2010 sales ended up 11% versus our projection in November which was up 9%. With such exceptional performance, I did not want to penalize Aflac Japan sales department for pushing so hard at the end of 2010. So that's how we came up with the sales expectations for Aflac Japan.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. continued to perform at expectations. However, ongoing low confidence level from consumers and small businesses coupled with fewer employees at the work site continued to pose challenges for our U.S. sales growth. As such, we were not surprised that these factors reflected in the sales decline of 2.3% for the fourth quarter and 4.9% for the year. You may recall that we acquired CAIC, now rebranded as Aflac Group, in October of 2009. New annualized premium sales for Aflac U.S. included sales from Aflac Group of $42 million in the fourth quarter. This result represented a 58.7% increase for the quarter and represented half of Aflac Group Insurance production for the year. I was very excited to see that our traditional sales force rallied to sell group products to our account in addition to individual policies that they already sold.
While I would say our decision to acquire CAIC was a huge success, let me put it in perspective. An $83 million sales contribution from the Aflac Group represents only 6% of the total U.S. production in 2010. About 90% of our businesses continues to revolve around small business owners and accounts with fewer than 100 employees. These accounts don't usually have group insurance, and our traditional individual agents continue to be the driving force behind our relationships with them. Our field force continues to be the key to our success, and no one else has been able to establish this kind of field force network that we have at Aflac. Unfortunately, both the smaller accounts and our sales agents that sell to them are the slice of America that has been hit the hardest by the economic turmoil over the last two years. As you know, consumer confidence and small business segment continues to hover at low levels. We've also been facing recruiting conditions that have not yet returned to business as usual. Although recruitment of sales associates in the fourth quarter was down 8.5%, it showed significant improvement over the 25.4% decline in recruiting for the first nine months of the year. That means we've averaged 5,500 new recruits per quarter, which is still a lot of people, but we can do better. 
Despite a significantly more positive outlook on the job market, some lingering uncertainty still makes it tough to find people with salary jobs or extended unemployment benefits who are unwilling to take their chances in commission sales. We have adopted a more people-centric recruiting criteria and are continuing national recruiting contest and programs to expand our sales force, and we anticipate this will expand the number of new recruits. Beyond expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we remain excited about developing relationships with insurance brokers. Our broker distribution initiative is still in its early stage, but our efforts are translating into sales. 
The group product platform, which is preferred by brokers is an important part of our efforts to broaden our product portfolio. As I mentioned, we saw a cross-over for Aflac career agents embraced our new group products, and frankly, we also saw brokers selling individual policies. I tell our entire U.S. distribution system that I don't care whether they sell group or individual products, but I do want them to let the existing accounts with more than 100 employees know that Aflac now offers group products in addition to individual policies. That's because if we don't at least let these accounts know that we offer group option, you can bet that someone else will. If the accounts want group products, and they know that Aflac offers them, I believe they'll choose Aflac over the competition.
Although weaker sales have slowed the top line growth somewhat over the last few years, we saw a steady improvement in persistency in 2010 compared to 2009. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing our U.S. operations, including budget and people resource. Managing financial components within our control has improved our 2010 expense ratio from 33.7% to 32.5%. We're taking measures to better reach potential customers with some innovative product benefits and solutions. We also continue to believe that the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind.
For 2011, we expect Aflac U.S. sales to be flat to up 5%. Some of you may feel that our 2011 sales expectations is too ambitious considering the environment. To that, I would say that I will remain cautious until we see some stability in the economy. But we've been adjusting our business to this environment, and we still believe strongly in the products that we sell. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Incorporated results. Excluding the benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 10.1% for the full year, meaning we achieved our goal of a 9% to 12% increase for 2010. Our balance sheet and capital position remain strong, and we believe that our investment approach of effectively matching assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach to our policyholders and shareholders. Clearly, a lot of attention has shifted recently to the impact of lower interest rates on earnings. As you've heard me say repeatedly since the early 90s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan's low interest rate environment. To address this, we've started increasing the amount that Aflac Japan invest in dollar-denominated securities last year. This strategy, we discussed at the Tokyo Analyst Meeting this past September, produces two benefits. First, we're funding incremental dollar purchases with the sale of Japanese government bonds. These JGBs are scheduled to mature before the end of 2011, and this strategy allows us to capture the gains for tax purposes before they mature. Second, we're able to invest the proceeds in higher-yielding dollar-denominated corporate bond at a meaningful spread. The current strength of the yen and the wider spread of the dollar bond helps mitigate the currency risk associated with this strategy. While our preference is to invest in yen-denominated securities, we believe this is a short-term strategy to help enhance our yield during the low interest rate periods.
As we communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong, risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a priority for us, and you'll recall that it is also a component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our goal was to end 2010 with a higher RBC than our year-end 2009 of 479%. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that 2010 RBC ratio exceeded 580%. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategy. Our decision as to whether to increase the dividend or repurchase our shares is a function of our capital position. As you'll recall, Aflac's Board of Directors approved the 7.1% increase in the quarterly cash dividend effective in the fourth quarter of 2010 payment. That marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Additionally, we resumed the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and purchased 2 million shares. We still anticipate repurchasing 6 million to 12 million shares in 2011. At the same time, I remain convinced it makes sense to maintain a healthy degree of conservatism given the economic uncertainties around the globe.
We continue to focus on maintaining strong fundamentals in our core business and building on our record of consistent earnings growth. As I commented in the third quarter release, we will likely be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per share in 2011. Although low interest rates have increased somewhat in the United States recently, they have not increased as much in Japan, and the yields remain very low. If we assume 8% earnings per share growth, we would earn $5.97 per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 80 to 85 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share.
Looking ahead to 2011 and beyond. We continue to believe that Japan and the United States each have characteristics to make them ideally suited for the insurance products we offer. And no other company is more focused on supplemental insurance products that respond to that need than Aflac. We are focused on providing value to the shareholders, and we're fortunate that in the process of doing so, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide. Now I'll turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?"

Beginning with the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.5% for the quarter. Investment income was flat, and excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net investment income rose 2.8% in the quarter. The annualized persistency rate, excluding annuities, was 94.2%, up from the nine months, and up from 94.0% in 2009. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio rose in the fourth quarter to 61.0, due to reserve adjustments made to a closed block of Dementia business. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, the benefit ratio improved for the year by 90 basis points. The expense ratio for the quarter was 20.4%, down from 21.6% a year ago. The decrease reflected tight general expense controls and lower advertising expense in the quarter. The pretax margin decreased slightly from 18.7% to 18.6% in the quarter. With the retraction of the margin, pretax earnings increased 2.9% for the quarter in yen terms. Excluding the impact of a stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, pretax earnings were up 5.4% in the quarter.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.36%, and including the dollars, the blended rate was 2.61%. As part of our strategy that Dan talked about to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar-denominated purchases totaling $703 million through the end of 2010. And we'll continue these purchases into 2011 until we reach $1 billion. The yield on these securities was 4.19%.
The portfolio yield was 3.56% at the end of December, down eight basis points from the end of September, and 21 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 2.5% in the fourth quarter and continued to benefit from the addition of Aflac Group sales. The annualized persistency rate for the year was 73.6% compared with 72.2% a year ago. Persistency showed steady improvement throughout 2010. The benefit ratio for the quarter was 50.1% compared with 53.8% a year ago. The decrease in the benefit ratio was due to adjustments made in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. The operating expense ratio was 32.5% compared with 33.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the profit margin for the quarter was 17.4% compared with 12.5% a year ago. And pretax operating earnings were up 42.3% for the quarter. 
In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.45% versus 6.25% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of December was 6.92%, down four basis points from the third quarter and 25 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. Excluding FAS 115, the ratio of debt to total capital was 21.7% at the end of the year compared with 22.3% a year ago. Noninsurance interest expense in the fourth quarter was $41 million compared with $25 million a year ago. The higher interest expense reflected debt issuance earlier in the year and the impact of a stronger yen on our yen-denominated debt.
Parent company and other expenses were $20 million in the fourth quarter compared with $32 million a year ago. The lower parent company expenses in the quarter primarily were the result of -- in 2009 we did not convert yen repatriation due to pending repayment of debt. In addition we had higher legal and consulting fees in 2009. The operating margins improved for the quarter. Pretax margin rose from 16.1% to 17.2%. The after-tax margin increased slightly from 11.0% to 11.2%. On an operating basis, the tax rate increased from 31.5% to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.92 compared to $0.53 in 2009. The primary difference between net and operating EPS was, again, realized investment losses, which were $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $0.65 per share in 2009. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share for the quarter rose 12.7% to $1.33. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.06 per diluted share for the quarter and $0.19 for the year. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share increased 7.6% for the quarter and 10.1% for the year. Lastly, let me comment on the outlook for operating earnings per share for 2011.
As you've heard Dan say, we affirmed our objective for 2011 of an 8% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. With yen yields remaining very low, we're assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share growth, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. This year, we estimate that a one yen change on the average exchange rate for the year would equal approximately $0.045 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of 8% growth, and the yen averages 80 to 85 for the full year, we would expect operating earnings per share to be in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share.
Now we will start taking people's questions. We want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to ask a question. So I'd like to ask you to limit your questions to just one to be fair to everyone else. Now we'll be glad to start taking questions."

Dementia reserve strengthening we had and the divert costs we wrote off. But what you have to consider is we normally have a couple of different types of adjustments in either third quarter or fourth quarter or any quarter for that matter. And in the fourth quarter this year, we had some claim reserves released because we trued up some of the runoff factors and the experience analysis too, and we had some JPY 5.2 billion of claim reserves released compared to what we had posted at the end of the third quarter that offset some of that Dementia increase. Let me just make a couple more comments on that. That's not an unusual thing for us. As a matter of fact, in accordance with our SACS requirements on internal standards for financial controls, we actually have it recorded that we'll do a review of the adequacy of Dementia reserves with respect to interest rates during the fourth quarter. And we'll do certain other updates on claim runoff factors for claim reserves and the like during either the third or the fourth quarter. And we have all that coordinated with the audit work that goes on. This quarter, we did strengthen the dementia reserves, and let me just tell you why. Last year, we also strengthened dementia reserves in the fourth quarter but because they pretty much netted against other adjustments, we made the claim reserves and the like. We didn't discuss it because it didn't create any significant difference in the benefit ratio. So last year, we strengthened interest rates underlying the reserving of the closed block of dementia down to a 2.7% ultimate new money interest rate. We actually used 2.5%, upgraded it up to 2.7% because we thought interest rates were very low and likely to increase. This year we decided to eliminate the assumed increase in interest rates, so we just kept the new money rate used to reserve that block at a flat 2.5%. And that's the only thing that caused the increase in the reserve on that block of business."

You've obviously told us to focus on the lower end of the 8% to 12% growth, there's nothing new there. But your Japan sales in the fourth quarter were ahead of your expectations by a pretty fair amount. You had a pretty significant one-time reserve item in the fourth quarter notwithstanding -- and I understand Kriss what you just sort of talked about with maybe the offset from some claims reserves. And you've got this program where you're investing some Japanese cash flows into dollar-denominated securities that's layering in at least a little bit of additional yield. So I guess what I'm getting at is your focus on the lower end of the growth range feels more conservative now than maybe it did in the past few quarters. Is there something I'm missing that would be an offset to those positive items at the margin?"

One of the things that's creating us being bias toward the low end of the range is that in 2010, we had an extraordinary benefit to earnings of our U.S. operation caused by the termination of a large case, and that created a net impact to profitability of roughly $40 million that we've got to find some way to cover in next year's earning comparisons. So that $40 million is a pretty good amount. Other than that, we're concerned about layering in of more low interest rates while we've moderated sales expectations in Japan due to modest or difficult comparisons. Japan sales and Japan profitability, probably will be in line in terms of growth with 2010. We still need U.S. sales and U.S. revenue growth to recover to give us growth over and above covering this extraordinary benefit we got in 2010. So offsetting that is our ability to resume the share repurchase program, and having achieved good capital adequacy positions during 2010 will allow us to deploy some of that accumulated capital during 2011."

Though we haven't finalized our statutory results yet, we're confident that our statutory earnings came in at somewhat over $2 billion after tax. Th",675,"Let me start with an answer to that. 2010, as I've said, was a year of strong capital accumulation for us. Though we haven't finalized our statutory results yet, we're confident that our statutory earnings came in at somewhat over $2 billion after tax. The realized losses on a statutory basis are pretty much pretax numbers, and that's going to come in somewhere around $850 million to $900 million. So overall, net earnings on a statutory basis are going to come in and around $1.2 billion. Now, that added to our capital position during 2010. Also, what you make in terms of statutory earnings less your realized losses gives you the amount of money you can dividend out of the like company without special approval. And let's just say that's going to be $1.2 billion, it was $1.4 billion last year, we didn't take out the $1.4 billion, but we could take out -- and I'm speaking hypothetically at the moment, because we haven't finalized the numbers, but we could take out $1.2 billion to apply to capital management purposes. And that assumes that we could absorb say another $1 billion of realized losses in 2011 if we continue making statutory earnings in excess of $2 billion and replenish the capital we took out as the dividend. So that still leaves us in a very strong RBC position. So just hypothetically again, say we took out $1 billion dividend, and I'll go over all this, as I usually do at the cap meeting in terms of sources and uses of capital. But let's say we took out that $1.2 billion dividend, we have over $600 million of cash in holding company, today, let's just say we wanted to maintain $200 million or $300 million of that, that leaves us with, say, $1.5 billion we might want to deploy. I'm giving you just a lot of numbers that are in my head. I haven't prepared them with everybody that matters around here, but this is some stuff I've been playing with. Say we got $1.5 billion available, and we've got a shareholder dividend commitment of around $500 million, a little more, maybe $525 million. Say, that leaves us $1 billion to do share repurchase or other activities, well we've said 6 million to 12 million shares while obviously at the high end of the range at 12 million say buying back shares of $58, $67 a share, we'd spend somewhere between $700 million and $800 million there, and maybe that leaves us a little bit more cushion. So I think the fact that we could I think maintain RBC levels that we ended 2010 at still absorbs some significant realized losses during 2011, which we hope not to do. But I'll let Jerry address that. Still maintained strong fundamental earnings group in statutory earnings, which I expect we'll do, puts us in a very good position for deploying capital during 2011. And I think that's sort of what's on my mind. Some people have asked me in the past, you're going to be so conservative that you'll just sit there and grow RBC levels. And I replied that, no, we're not going to just sit there and create a position where we got significant sterile capital that's not being deployed, and I just want to reiterate that. That's my conclusion. My only caveat is that I do have to worry a little bit about the impact of further strengthening of the yen on the solvency margin in Japan particularly if we increased portion of our Japanese capital that we invested dollars because we lose some solvency margin benefits from doing that. But the yen is already pretty darn strong at JPY 82 to the dollar, and Japanese industry is starting to complain about their ability to maintain exports and the like. So not to say that, that's a controlling factor for currency, and we don't really predict currency, we just try to manage in whatever currency environment we're in, but that's kind of brain dump, John."

The number one concern that I have and have had is in terms of risks to the portfolio's concentration risks, that continues to be our highest priorities, to look for intelligent ways to reduce our concentration and diversify our risks. And so you've brought up a number of topics that kind of speak to that the first being the Greek banks. I think that obviously that’s a very fluid situation. Sure there would be liability management exercises among the Greek banks in 2011 or maybe beyond that. And we'll keep an eye on that, and if it's advantageous to us we may act on it. But we're constantly evaluating that prospect. I got to turn to Israel Elec first. Israel Elec, as you know, is in effect a government agency, if you will. They're more than 99% owned by the government. I think given the structure in Israel, it is highly unlikely that they would have any other owner other than the government in the foreseeable future because of the way their rate structure operates. I think nothing has changed materially in their business model. And in fact, unlike what you've seen happen in Europe, their ability to raise capital in public markets has been unaffected this past month. They just hit the domestic debt, the largest in their history. So their liquidity remains pretty secure. But the problem there has been on what their return on capital can be, and given their capital expansion needs that is something of a sore spot for them, but their operating model hasn't changed. What has changed is that S&P took a look at what has been the status quo for years and decided to kind of fire a shot across the balance, seems to me, and downgrade them and it was a warning shot I guess to Israel they need to ensure Israel Elec can achieve greater profitability. So we'll see what goes there, but they still are monopoly there and essential service in Israel. And their profits while low are adequate. So we're not concerned about their ability to service debt.  Turning to Tunisia, what we can say about there is I think it's an interesting situation because one of the key reasons that Ali left Tunisia was he was not able to demonize the opposition because it was not Muslim fundamentalist opposition. It was really much more of a secular opposition. So therefore, I think you have a well educated, very secular population, that I would say that the outcome politically is highly uncertain there. But I would also say that the market has not responded with any material devaluation of their bonds. If you look back to December valuations on Tunisian public debt, and then you look at the valuations today, many of their issues trade well above par, and none of them have been devalued by more than 5% in the marketplace. So I think globally there's not the level of concern about Tunisia that there is in Egypt, which is much more, the opposition there is probably a little more troubling. InvestCorp, I think is again, an interesting situation. I think we remain pretty comfortable with InvestCorp it is a large exposure but they have really shifted much towards a key-based business model as opposed to direct investment and hedge fund et cetera. So their profitability is much more stable. They were able to raise significant capital over the last 18 months. So I would view that as a fairly stable situation."

But given the support of their banks and given their liquidity, we continue to support them. But when they came out with earnings results, and I think that they came out in October, we became somewhat uncomfortable with the disclosures we were receiving. And so that really precipitated the impairment there. We view their future is, I guess, more opaque than it had been. So that speaks to the Aiful situation. With our Allied Irish banks, really, I guess there were two things there that triggered our decision to sell, impairment sell. First is they started receiving -- and the two are related, the first is that they started receiving significant amounts of support from the Irish government, and as a result the politicians have kind of taken over rule of law when it comes to the rights of the bondholders. We did own a subordinated debt, which prior to the Irish banking crisis, had debt was considered exempt from law sharing. But in Ireland, there are no rules about subordinated debt anymore that we can take comfort in, and we were concerned that the Irish government was going to do exact serious law sharing penalties from subordinated debt holders of Allied Irish. So when Allied Irish announced a tender offer, we pursued that with them. Irish Life & Permanent kind of similar background, quite a different situation or they have not taken on any government support. And at this point it's unclear whether or not it will. But we decided to be proactive in that situation because they too are governed by Irish law that there's no clarity as to why it's going to resolve itself. Did that help?"

So I probably need to get back to you on that some. But I know we don't get the full benefit under stat that we get under GAAP."

I know you know that production in the bank channel, particularly of the child endowment and WAYS, is going to drive the overall margin down a little bit because those two products produce more investment-spread income than they do -- let me use a property and cash context underwriting income, the difference between premiums, benefits and expenses, particularly child endowment, that's kind of as close to zero underwriting product we're putting equals benefits and expenses at the assumed pricing interest rate. And then what you do is make a spread on the reserves based on the difference between earned interest rate on investment assets and the required interest rate on reserves. And that's going to emerge more over time, Ed, on that child endowment. And also I've talked about advanced premium deposit funds of being spread-type generator, too. So those spreads don't emerge in proportion to premium. They emerge over time in proportion to invested assets and earned rates versus credited rates. And WAYS is similar though not quite as extreme as child endowment. So I'm telling you that if the margin, the underwriting margin goes down, it's going to be replaced to some extent by increased investment spreads that you won't directly see. The way we look at the numbers now, I'm promising you all, we talked about this some the many fab in September, we didn't talk about it on the program, but I talked to a number of you. I'll mention it again, I think in the third quarter report and at the fab meeting in May, I'm going to try to lay out a lot more about the impact of child endowment and WAYS on the margin computations. But I want to assure you that those products are expected to produce profits, not quite at the level of our medical products. And I've told you that, that they're going to add to the overall profitability of corporation by growing revenue faster than we otherwise would have grown it, and by producing margins, they're going to add to total profits."

I hope you've had a chance to review our first quarter press release. I'll comment on our operations in Japan and the United States, but first, I'd like to discuss what's been going on in Japan over the last 6 weeks. Clearly, the earthquake and tsunami on March 11 and the subsequent nuclear situation present in Japan is 1 of the biggest crisis it's ever faced. The whole world watched helplessly through televisions and social media as devastating pictures and news coverage of the disastrous situation unfolded. We've been operating in Japan for more than 35 years. If there's 1 thing we've found in developing such close ties with Japan, is that the Japanese people are resilient. And when I visited Japan the week after the earthquake, I saw this resilience. Our employees are safe. Our business operations are running, and we do not expect any material impact on claims or earnings this year. Life is moving forward for most Japanese citizens, and so is our resolve to be there for our policyholders during their time of need by paying claims just as we promised.
Aflac Japan generated strong results in the first quarter, and we're again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. Revenue growth showed continued improvement rising 3.7% for the quarter. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand resulting in solid earnings growth for the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact, Aflac Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36-year history. 
New annualized premium sales exceeded our expectations and rose 12.6% to 34.1 billion. With the expanding bank channel in mind, Aflac Japan has developed innovative products that align well with the product needs of banks. Bank sales in the first quarter posted another record with sales of 7.9 billion, which represents an increase of 12.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 154%% increase over the first quarter of 2010. I mentioned how we believe more banks and mega banks in particular would step up their efforts in selling Aflac's products and that's exactly what we've been seeing. 
At the end of March, Aflac Japan was represented by 354 banks and more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. While many banks have agreed to sell our products, turning that agreement from ink on paper into sales does not happen overnight, especially with more than 20,000 branches representing the 364 banks. It will take some time to facilitate training at all these locations, but we're seeing sales steadily improving at many of these banks, As training takes place and the banks expand their offering of Aflac products. In many of the banks, sales represented selling our products and their confidence levels and their sales ability has grown. WAYS and child endowment products, which are both especially popular with banks, were key drivers to growth again in the first quarter. You'll recall that WAYS is a unique hybrid whole life product that is being converted to fixed annuity medical coverage or nursing care benefit when the policyholder reaches a predetermined age. The real story can be seen in WAYS phenomenal sales growth rate, which was an increase of 221%, compared to the first quarter of 2010. Consumers find WAYS attractive because of the guaranteed principal and the future flexibility of the benefit options. Banks like to sell this product because of its high premium and attractive commission, and Aflac's product margin on WAYS is significantly enhanced when policy holders elect to pay all the premium upfront through the discounted advanced premium. Importantly, 90% of the customers at the banks choose this payment option. As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow significantly in 2011. 
As I mentioned, the other strong driver to sales growth is child endowment product, which was up 58.9% in the first quarter. This product is primarily used to help fund the higher cost associated with child's entering high school or college in Japan. Child endowment policy have been very popular in Japan for many years. Aflac's strong brand, this product's unmatched return and our expanding presence in banks are competitive advantages that have helped make our child endowment policy the product of choice. You'll recall that the average premium for child endowment is much lower profit margin but because it is wanted and needed in the bank channel and is about 3 times the premium of the medical policies, the premium is a very solid contributor to topline growth. It's also helpful in enhancing our policyholder base, allowing us the opportunity to cross sell additional products like WAYS to consumer. Like WAYS, our child endowment offers a discounted advanced premium and the profit margin on the child endowment more than doubles when the policyholders elect to pay premiums upfront using the discounted advanced premiums. About half of the consumers who purchased child endowment through the banks elected the discounted advanced premium method of payment.
As expected, cancer insurance sales were down 10.4% for the quarter as prospective policyholders and sales agents postponed cancer insurance purchases and sales in anticipation of the introduction of the new base cancer policy DAYS, which was introduced at the end of March. The enhancement of these new base policy speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatment as well as our commitment to retaining the number 1 provider of cancer insurance in Japan. Sales of cancer insurance accounted for 17.5% of total sales. Keep in mind that the foundation of our product portfolio has been and continues to be cancer and medical products. Importantly, we maintain our position as the number 1 seller of medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. The solid platform we established with these 2 pillar products has allowed us to leverage our competitive advantages such as branding and administrative efficiencies to grow our product offering and meet the evolving needs of the consumers.
From top to bottom, Aflac Japan performed extremely well in the first quarter, especially in light of a natural disaster and tough sales comparisons to a year ago. But as I told you, following 2 years of sales growth, the sales comparisons only get tougher as the year goes on, especially in the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, we believe the natural disaster has affected our sales, primarily in the affected regions, but I still believe we can achieve our sales target for the year in the range of down 2% to up 3%. 
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. We were very pleased and excited with Aflac's U.S. performance from both the sales and the financial perspective. For the first time in 9 quarters, Aflac U.S. generated positive sales growth and new annualized premium sales were up nicely, generating a 6.3% sales increase. We were especially encouraged to see an increase in production from both new and veteran agents. In fact, we saw cross over, where Aflac career agents embraced group products. To me, it all boils down to giving our customers a choice between group and individual products. As I've said before, I tell our entire U.S. distribution system that I don't care whether they sell group or individual products but I do care that they give the group or the individual platform options to the employers with more than 100 workers. That's because if they don't at least let these accounts know we offer the group options now, you can bet that someone else will. I truly believe that if the employer wants group products, and they know Aflac offers them, they'll choose Aflac over the competition.
For both group and individual products, we are driving sales through specific product bridges called smart launches, which are modeled after Aflac Japan's product launches that effectively focus on the entire sales force on selling 1 specific product during a specific period of time. Our first Smart launch was in the first quarter and it focused on the dental product. The results were phenomenal. Our dental category generated a 37.1% sales increase and contributed 6.9% to the total annualized premium sales. We've also seen success with the critical illness product created for the group platform. While this product was only introduced in mid-2010, it has provided both our traditional sales force and brokers with valuable products to add to accounts that currently have cancer products on an individual basis. This is a good example of a product that helps career agents transition and expand their portfolio to include, not only individual products but also group products.
On the distribution side, our strategy, we've said many times before, that today's recruits are tomorrow's sales. With that in mind, in early January, we launched our first ever recruiting campaign utilizing national television advertising. It featured a commercial with successful agents sharing their story and generating phenomenal leads, which ultimately contributed significantly to our 13.5% increase in recruiting for the first quarter. As you can see, we've taken measures to better reach potential customers with some innovative products, benefit solutions, and we've improved Aflac U.S. sales not only to reflect intense focus on supporting our field force with enhanced products but also reflects better resources and training that helps our sales force better approach selling in the current environment. We will continue to help our entire distribution, new and veteran agents as well as brokers, with ways they can provide and improve their performance because they're essential part of our strategy and our success. All these elements are fundamental to the model that we've been following in the U.S. We call it: Recruit, Train, Motivate and Sell. For those of you who will be coming to the financial analyst briefing in New York on May 17 and 18, we'll be sharing more about this model and the products that we're going to introduce.
We continue to believe the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind. We also believe our expectations that Aflac U.S. sales growth for 2011 will be flat to up 5% is reasonable, and our first quarter sales are a good start toward achieving that objective. Given the state of the economy, we still remain somewhat cautious. In addition, this is a momentum business. Although our 6.3% sales increase is a great start, I would obviously like to see the momentum build for a few quarters. It is clear however, that the addition of group product platforms, and our growing broker initiative only serve to enhance our ability to leverage Aflac's finance and to reach more companies, large and small, across the United States.
Now let me update you on Aflac Inc.'s results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated performance. Operating per share diluted rose 15.6% to $1.63. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen operating per diluted share, it rose 8.5%. We believe that our basic investment approach of effectively managing assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach for our policyholders and shareholders. As you've heard us say repeatedly since early 1990s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan's low interest rate environment. To reiterate what we said in our year-end conference call, 1 of our top focuses in 2011 is concentration risk. While our largest exposures are predominantly legacy issues, we have continued to look at ways to optimistically reduce some larger positions where practical. As I said last week on CNBC, we focused on growing our operating earnings while derisking to further enhance the quality of the portfolio. I don't think many of you fully recognize the extent of our investment portfolio derisking activities that we've been actively engaged in over the last couple of years, so I'm going to cover 4 major derisking actions that we've taken to remind you of what we've accomplished. For instance, as we began 2009, our holding of perpetual subordinated securities was approximately 13% of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, perpetual subordinated debt accounted for less than 9% of the portfolio, a 30% decrease. We also derisked the portfolio by lowering our concentration and financial exposures. At the start of 2009, banks and other financials made up 41% of the total portfolio and at the end of the first quarter of this year the number had dropped to 33%, a 20% decrease. We've accomplished this by both selling assets, as well as reducing the percentage of new investments allocated for the financial sector. We also reduced our exposure to the countries. At the start of 2009, these sovereign and financial exposures made up approximately 6% of the total portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, that number had declined to 4%, a 33% decrease.
As I've already suggested, we are now focused on addressing some of our legacy issues, especially some of those highly concentrated positions. Within the portfolio, we've started with lowering the exposure in 2010. And in the first quarter of 2011, we focused our efforts on reducing our exposure to Greek financial system. Today, our holding of Greek banks has been reduced by 82% from the beginning of 2011. This percentage decline also reflects the sale of 1 of the banks following quarter end. In addition to significantly reducing our exposure to Greek financial systems, we also focused on reducing some of our larger concentrated positions where practical. As such, we sold some of our holdings and available for sale categories that exceeded 10% of tax. We believe these actions to lessen the concentrated risks in our investment portfolio further strengthens our balance sheet. Our business continue to generate significant capital in the first quarter. As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital ratio or RBC remains a top priority for us, and you'll recall that it remains a primary component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our objective for 2011 is to derisk our portfolio while maintaining our RBC ratio in the range of 400% to 500%, with a target of 450%. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the first quarter, we estimate our RBC fell within the range of 500% to 525% at the end of March. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategies.
As you'll recall, 2010 marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Our objective remains to increase cash dividends generally in line with earnings growth before the impact of the yen. We will again evaluate the dividend increase later this year, but I am confident we will extend our consecutive annual dividend increases for 29 years. Additionally, you'll recall that we resumed the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. We purchased 3.1 million shares in the first quarter and anticipate purchasing 6 million to 12 million shares for 2011. However, we will balance our share repurchase activities this year with the derisking opportunities that ultimately enhance our portfolio.
With the first quarter of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well-positioned for another year of solid financial performance. We still believe our goal of increasing operating earnings per diluted share is reasonable and attainable. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing Aflac Japan and U.S. operations, especially the expense control. As the year progresses, we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly in marketing and IT initiatives, and we have said previously, given the continued low interest rate environment, especially in Japan for 2011, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of yen.
As you know, we historically announced our earnings guidance for the following year at our May analyst meeting. Although we have not yet finalized our projections for 2012, I can tell you that our expected rate of earnings growth next year will likely be lower than 2011 due primarily to the portfolio derisking activity and a continued low interest rate environment in Japan. After the effects of the derisking and the low interest rates in Japan and the United States have fully integrated into the financial results, we should expect to see the rate of increase in earnings begin to improve.
With respect to achieving our objectives, you've heard me say many times before that we manage this company for the long term. As such, we believe that derisking our portfolio is more important than the effect of 1 year's earnings and in doing so, will ultimately enhance the shareholder value. Now I'll turn it back over to Robin. Robin?"

And as Dan said and you are all aware, the quakes and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 had a devastating impact on the country and they remain on our thoughts and prayers. But I'd like to go through some of the numbers to date",1172,"Thank you, Dan. And as Dan said and you are all aware, the quakes and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 had a devastating impact on the country and they remain on our thoughts and prayers. But I'd like to go through some of the numbers to date that reflect the magnitude of this event.
According to the official report by Japan's National Police Agency, as of April 28, total lives that were lost is 14,575, and there are still 11,324 who are missing. There are also 5,277, who are reported injured. We estimate that there will be a total impact of 3 billion yen in claims and of this amount, we booked a total of 1 billion claims to incur claims and the remaining, approximately 2 billion, will be handled through reinsurance plans we have and offsetting reserve releases. There was also 0.7 billion yen of operating expenses resulting from the earthquake and tsunami. Now I'd like to go through some first quarter numbers for Japan.
Beginning with the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.7% for the quarter, investment income was down slightly 0.7%. However, excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net income rose 2.7% in the quarter. Annualized premium persistency rate, excluding annuities, was 94.3%, compared to 93.8% in 2010. In terms of quarterly operating ratio, the benefit ratio improved over last year moving from 59.5% a year ago to 59.0% in the first quarter. The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.6%, down from 19.1% a year ago. As a result, the lower benefit and expense ratios to pretax margin rose from 21.4% to 22.4% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 8.5% for the quarter in yen terms.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.36% and including the dollars invested, the blended rate was 3.16%. As we discussed last year, part of our strategy to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar-denominated purchases to extend the 1 billion we discussed in the fourth quarter of the year in the amount 219 million. That amount purchased through the end of Japan for that objective totaled $993 million. The yield on these investments was 4.26%. Our portfolio yield rose 3.56% at the end of March, no change from the end of December and 19 basis points lower than a year ago.
Now turning to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 3.1% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 48.8%, compared with 45.5% a year ago. The rise in the benefit ratio reflected a return to a more normalized number in 2011 following the decline in the benefit ratio in 2010, which resulted from the loss of a large account. The operating expense ratio decreased from 35.4% to 32.0%, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be incurred later in the year. Also driving the operating expense number down to the first quarter was a return in amortization to a more normalized number after the loss of a large account, increased the 2010 debt number. The profit margin for the quarter was 19.2% compared with 19.1% a year ago. In terms of U.S. investment, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.77% versus 5.98% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 6.84, down 8 basis points from the fourth quarter and 22 basis points from a year ago.
Now turning to some other items in the quarter. Noninsurance expense for the first quarter was $41 million compared with $31 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflects our debt issuance in the second half of 2010 of $750 million. Our parent company and other expenses remained flat at $14 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and U.S. Pretax margins rose from 20.0% to 20.7%. The after-tax margin increased from 13.0% to 13.5% and an on operating bases the tax rate remains relatively unchanged at 34.2%. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.84 compared to $1.35 in 2010. Realized investment losses were $0.79 per share for the quarter compared to $0.06 per share in 2010. During the quarter, we realized investment losses of $376 million net of tax or $0.79 per diluted share, primarily as a result of the significant derisking activities in the quarter that Dan outlined. $115 million was attributable to our sale of holdings in the Alpha Bank, $258 million resulted from the impairment of 2 other Greek banks, National Bank of Greece and EFG Euro Bank. We also lowered our holdings of other concentrated positions with smaller transactions and impairments and these transactions altogether resulted in a gain of $16 million. The remaining $19 million losses is associated with derivative and hedging activity.
As reported, our operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.63. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.10 per diluted share. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.5% for the quarter that was in our annual range of the low end of 8% to 12%. Lastly, let me comment on earnings outlook for 2011. As you heard, we have affirmed our objective for 2011 with an 8% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. But as we've previously said, given the low interest rate environment, especially in Japan, we expect to be in the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the yen impact. Assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share growth, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. If the yen averages 80, 85 for the second quarter we would expect operating earnings to be $1.51 to $1.57 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of an 8% growth and the yen averages 80 to 80 for the full year, we would expect EPS to be in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. As we mentioned in our press release last night, although we historically announced earnings guidance for the following year at our May analyst meeting, in our 2012 earnings projection is not finalized, we do anticipate that earnings growth for next year 2012 would likely be lower than 2011.
Let me take this opportunity to remind you that our annual analyst meeting will be held in New York City on May 17 and 18. We'll be there to provide you with further updates on our operations in both the U.S. and Japan along with our outlook for this year and the following year so we invite you to please login and register to attend. I'm now ready, Diane, to start taking questions. To be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to 1 question, and we'd be happy now to start with the questions."

I think this is a plan that's been put in place over the last several quarters. Our sales and marketing teams are working more tightly together than ever. You can see that through that the beginning of the effects with our first ever DRTV, our recruiting campaign, which helped drive up overall recruiting by 13.5% this quarter. At the same time, things like our smart launches, even though we used it on a smaller product line like dental, it was a direct effect of conferences that we put in place between the U.S. and Japan several years ago. We began to learn about the positive affects of what they were doing and marrying up what was happening socially with how to drive product demand. In the U.S. this year, due to the smart product launch, we were able to drive demand for dental by using our duck and leveraging it in our existing accounts to really help push specific product lines. We do hope that that's something that we can continue to expand on in the future that will continue to help drive up our existing accounts sales as well as our veteran agents sales. We coined that term our book of business. We'll be talking more about several of these items at our upcoming meeting. I'm very excited about what we're seeing. I do think this is the beginning of positive. How quickly and how big is that I think it's too early for us to tell. I think at the end of the second quarter I'll be better able to tell you whether the turn is completely in. But I think at this point I'm very proud of our sales team and our marketing team and all the people who have worked very hard to make this happen and I do believe that there's no fluke in the numbers here. This is just a great quarter of sales that has been long in place from a turnaround, good momentum by our sales force and a very strong balance between good broker sales and good career agent sales. But in the end, I do believe probably the overriding factor in all of this is the Aflac Group. The fact is that it is not only been the business sales that happened in the group business but also the momentum that having the Group business brought to our career channel and broker channel. So a lot to say but there's a lot of good factors happening, all of which are coming together for what was our best quarter in a long period of time."

Really, Ed, it takes awhile for the cumulative affect of derisking to work its way through earnings and over the last couple of years, we've had a substantial amount of derisking in addition to what we had in the first quarter. I think we've had about $1.6-or-so-billion in realized losses over the last couple of years. We had another $450 million or so this quarter. We're going to have some more in all likelihood, and the numbers you guys have are not unreasonable there. But it's a cumulative effect of low interest rates and the fact that it takes 12 to 18 months to get the effects all the way through the financial results that lead us to be thoughtful about how we're going to project earnings. In addition, I'll say when we derisk, there are several ways to derisk, some of which affect P&L more than others. Clearly, if you decide to sell a security that you believe you don't want to hold anymore and you take a realized loss, you've got a lower amount of funds to invest and then you've got decisions about whether to invest those funds in dollars or yen and then what categories of yen assets you might be able to acquire. On the other hand, you might take an impairment and derisk adjust by reducing equity and the like, but not sell if you thought the credit characteristics of the security are such that you didn't need to sell it. And then when you deal with concentrations, you're probably going to sell positions and you have to positions in concentration to reduce your concentration and those type securities. So we haven't fully concluded on exactly what steps we're going to take and there's just a level of uncertainty. We think the net result is going to be a modest slowdown in earnings growth for some period to come. Ken, do you want to add further on that?"

They don't use smart act in Japan like we do in the U.S. so there's a time lag so my gut is that and it is a gut because I want to wait and see what April numbers look like and we plan on telling you at the FAD meeting. We normally don't cover what sales numbers are for a month but we're going to give you April numbers, when we've got them. But I don't think March reflects what really happened, maybe the last week did little bit, but it's hard to tell. And so at this point, we don't want to go out and make some statement that all of a sudden the next couple of weeks we see a difference and as Toru talked about, pretty much everything is getting back to normal now. And of course the area that was directly hit, it would be quite a time but that accounted for 5% of our sales. So that will give you an idea of what to look at. So what I tried to kind of analyze in my mind is, in terms of these numbers, if you say that okay, sales in the first quarter were basically where we thought they would be. Because remember, we expected a good first quarter, a little bit better than what we thought, but we expect sales to be flat to down in the fourth quarter because of the tough sales comparisons so if you go back and say the first quarter that area that was affected was 5% of our sales then let's say the second quarter, the number's 0 and the third quarter is 1/5 and the fourth quarter is 1/5 then that means that our overall sales have been hurt by 2.5% over what our original projections are. And then say Tokyo was hurt for a short period but outside Tokyo nothing else was really that affected then we're actually increasing our sales objectives in the 2% to 5% still think we can make yet down to up 3% or 5 swing is actually a higher number because we have to make up the difference of what happened due to the tsunami."

And as I previously discussed with the community, the investment community, starting last September, and continuing on in the fourth quarter discussions. Child endowment and WAYS are going to slow down the improvement and the decline in the benefit ratio. We're still getting the same kind of decline in the cancer product from reduction in the number of days in the hospital, though as I've told you that's moderating some. Once you get the numbers down to days in the hospital of around 20 to 22, you don't have as much room for improvement as when the average was say, 40 days a stay for cancer treatment. So I told you the improvement in the medical or the cancer line is moderating some. The child endowment and WAYS products will have the benefit ratio go up some but they'll have the expense ratio go down some and they're going to drive revenue more than the medical products do. And at the analyst meeting, I'm going to show you an analysis that basically I'll just disclose that early, I guess, but basically it tells you that if we write the same number of policies of medical and child endowment and WAYS, we produce somewhat more profit just modestly more profit by producing the same number of policies with child endowment and WAYS that we do through the medical policies and that's because they've got a higher average premium, they've got a lower average margin but profits per policy, come out somewhat higher so there's a bit of a change in the composition of the way profits are produced. But the net effect is that you get about the same if not slightly more profit about writing a policy of WAYS or child endowment than a policy of medical or cancer."

I'll comment on our operations in Japan and the United States. But first, I'd like to discuss what's been going on in Japan over the last 6 weeks. Clearly, the earthquake and tsunami on March 11 and the subsequent nuclear situation presented Japan with one of the biggest crises it's ever faced. The whole world watched helplessly through television and social media as devastating pictures and news coverage of the disastrous situation unfolded. We've been operating in Japan for more than 35 years. If there's one thing we've found in developing such close ties in Japan, it's that the Japanese people are resilient. And when I visited Japan the week after the earthquake, I saw this resilience. Our employees are safe, our business operations are running, and we do not expect any material impact on claims or earnings this year. Life is moving forward for most Japanese citizens and so is our resolve to be there for our policyholders during their time of need by paying claims just as we promised.
Aflac Japan generated strong results in the first quarter, and we're again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. Revenue growth showed continued improvement rising 3.7% for the quarter. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand, resulting in solid earnings growth for the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact, Aflac Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36-year history. 
New annualized premium sales exceeded our expectations and rose 12.6% to JPY 34.1 billion. With the expanding bank channel in mind, Aflac Japan has developed innovative products that align well with the product needs of banks. Bank sales in the first quarter posted another record with sales of JPY 7.9 billion, which represents an increase of 12.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 154% increase over the first quarter of 2010. I mentioned how we believe more banks, and mega banks in particular, would step up their efforts in selling Aflac's products, and that's exactly what we've been seeing. 
At the end of March, Aflac Japan was represented by 364 banks and more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. While many banks have agreed to sell our products, turning that agreement from ink on paper into sales does not happen overnight, especially with more than 20,000 branches representing the 364 banks. It will take some time to facilitate training at all these locations but we're seeing sales steadily improving at many of these banks as training takes place and the banks expand their offering of Aflac products. In many of the banks, sales representatives had gained experience at selling our products, and their confidence level and their sales ability have grown. WAYS and child endowment products, which are both especially popular with banks, were key drivers to growth again in the first quarter. You'll recall that WAYS is a unique hybrid whole life product that's being converted to fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefit when the policyholder reaches a predetermined age. The real story can be seen in WAYS' phenomenal sales growth rate, which was an increase of 221%, compared to the first quarter of 2010. Consumers find WAYS attractive because of the guaranteed principal and the future flexibility of the benefit options. Banks like to sell this product because of its high premium and attractive commission, and Aflac's product margin on WAYS is significantly enhanced when policy holders elect to pay all the premium upfront through the discounted advanced premium. Importantly, 90% of the customers at the banks choose this payment option. As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow significantly in 2011. 
As I mentioned, the other strong driver to sales growth is child endowment product, which was up 58.9% in the first quarter. This product is primarily used to help fund the higher cost associated with child's entering high school or college in Japan. Child endowment policies have been very popular in Japan for many years. Aflac's strong brand, this product's unmatched return and our expanding presence in banks are competitive advantages that have helped make our child endowment policy the product of choice. You'll recall that the average premium for child endowment is much lower profit margin, but because it is wanted and needed in the bank channel and is about 3x the premium of the medical policies, the premium is a very solid contributor to top line growth. It's also helpful in enhancing our policyholder base, allowing us the opportunity to cross sell additional products like WAYS to consumers. Like WAYS, our child endowment offers a discounted advanced premium, and the profit margin on the child endowment more than doubles when the policyholders elect to pay premiums upfront using the discounted advanced premiums. About half of the consumers who purchase child endowment through the banks elect the discounted advanced premium method of payment.
As expected, cancer insurance sales were down 10.4% for the quarter as prospective policyholders and sales agents postponed cancer insurance purchases and sales in anticipation of the introduction of the new base cancer policy DAYS, which was introduced at the end of March. The enhancement of this new base policy speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatment as well as our commitment to retaining the #1 provider of cancer insurance in Japan. Sales of cancer insurance accounted for 17.5% of total sales. Keep in mind that the foundation of our product portfolio has been and continues to be cancer and medical products. Importantly, we maintain our position as the #1 seller of medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. The solid platform we established with these 2 pillar products has allowed us to leverage our competitive advantages such as branding and administrative efficiencies to grow our product offering and meet the evolving needs of the consumers.
From top to bottom, Aflac Japan performed extremely well in the first quarter, especially in light of a natural disaster and tough sales comparisons to a year ago. But as I've told you, following 2 years of strong sales growth, the sales comparisons only get tougher as the year goes on especially in the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, we believe the natural disaster has affected our sales, primarily in the affected regions, but I still believe we can achieve our sales target for the year in the range of down 2% to up 3%. 
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. We were very pleased and excited with Aflac's U.S. performance from both the sales and the financial perspective. For the first time in 9 quarters, Aflac U.S. generated positive sales growth, and new annualized premium sales were up nicely, generating a 6.3% sales increase. We were especially encouraged to see an increase in production from both new and veteran agents. In fact, we saw a crossover where Aflac career agents embraced group products. To me, it all boils down to giving our customers a choice between group and individual products. As I've said before, I'd tell our entire U.S. distribution system that I don't care whether they sell group or individual products but I do care that they give the group or the individual platform options to the employers with more than 100 workers. That's because if they don't at least let these accounts know we offer the group options now, you can bet that someone else will. I truly believe that if the employer wants group products, and they know Aflac offers them, they'll choose Aflac over the competition.
For both group and individual products, we are driving sales through specific product bridges called smart launches, which are modeled after Aflac Japan's product launches that effectively focus on the entire sales force on selling one specific product during a specific period of time. Our first smart launch was in the first quarter, and it focused on the Dental product. The results were phenomenal. Our dental category generated a 37.1% sales increase and contributed 6.9% to the total annualized premium sales. We've also seen success with the Critical Illness product created for the group platform. While this product was only introduced in mid-2010, it has provided both our traditional sales force and brokers with valuable products to add to accounts that currently have Cancer products on an individual basis. This is a good example of a product that helps career agents transition and expand their portfolio to include not only individual products but also group products.
On the distribution side, our strategy, we've said many times before that today's recruits are tomorrow's sales. With that in mind, in early January, we launched our first ever recruiting campaign utilizing national television advertising. It featured a commercial with successful agents sharing their story and generating phenomenal leads, which ultimately contributed significantly to our 13.5% increase in recruiting for the first quarter. As you can see, we've taken measures to better reach potential customers with some innovative products, benefit solutions -- and we've improved Aflac U.S. sales not only to reflect intense focus on supporting our field force with enhanced products but also reflects the better resources and training that helps our sales force better approach selling in the current environment. We will continue to help our entire distribution, new and veteran agents, as well as brokers, with ways they can provide and improve their performance because they are essential part of our strategy and our success. All these elements are fundamental to the model that we've been following in the U.S. We call it ""recruit, train, motivate and sell."" For those of you who will be coming to the financial analysts briefing in New York on May 17 and 18, we'll be sharing more about this model and the products that we're going to introduce.
We continue to believe the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind. We also believe our expectations that Aflac U.S. sales growth for 2011 will be flat to up 5% is reasonable, and our first quarter sales are a good start toward achieving that objective. Given the state of the economy, we still remain somewhat cautious. In addition, this is a momentum business. Although our 6.3% sales increase is a great start, I would obviously like to see the momentum build for a few quarters. It is clear, however, that the addition of group product platforms and our growing broker initiative only serve to enhance our ability to leverage Aflac's brand and to reach more companies, large and small, across the United States.
Now let me update you on Aflac Inc.'s results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated performance. Operating per share diluted rose 15.6% to $1.63. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen operating earnings per diluted share, it rose 8.5%. We believe that our basic investment approach of effectively managing assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach for our policyholders and shareholders. As you've heard us say repeatedly since early 1990s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan's low interest rate environment. To reiterate what we said in our year-end conference call, one of our top focuses in 2011 is concentration risk. While our largest exposures are predominantly our legacy issues, we have continued to look at ways to optimistically reduce some larger positions where practical. As I said last week on CNBC, we focused on growing our operating earnings while derisking to further enhance the quality of the portfolio. I don't think many of you fully recognize the extent of our investment portfolio derisking activities that we've been actively engaged in over the last couple of years, so I'm going to cover 4 major derisking actions that we've taken to remind you of what we've accomplished. For instance, as we began 2009, our holding of perpetual subordinated securities was approximately 13% of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, perpetual subordinated debt accounted for less than 9% of the portfolio, a 30% decrease. We also de-risked the portfolio by lowering our concentration and financial exposures. At the start of 2009, banks and other financials made up 41% of the total portfolio, and at the end of the first quarter of this year, the number had dropped to 33%, a 20% decrease. We've accomplished this by both selling assets as well as reducing the percentage of new investments allocated for the financial sector. We also reduced our exposure to the PIIGS countries. At the start of 2009, these sovereign and financial exposures made up approximately 6% of the total portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, that number had declined to 4%, a 33% decrease.
As I've already suggested, we are now focused on addressing some of our legacy issues, especially some of those highly concentrated positions. Within the PIIGS portfolio, we've started with lowering the exposure in 2010. And in the first quarter of 2011, we focused our efforts on reducing our exposure to Greek financial system. Today, our holding of Greek banks has been reduced by 82% from the beginning of 2011. This percentage decline also reflects the sale of one of the banks following quarter end. In addition to significantly reducing our exposure to Greek financial system, we also focused on reducing some of our larger concentrated positions where practical. As such, we sold some of our holdings in available-for-sale categories that exceeded 10% of tax. We believe these actions to lessen the concentrated risk in our investment portfolio further strengthens our balance sheet. Our business continues to generate significant capital in the first quarter.
As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital ratio or RBC remains a top priority for us, and you'll recall that it remains a primary component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our objective for 2011 is to derisking-risk our portfolio while maintaining our RBC ratio in the range of 400% to 500%, with a target of 450%. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the first quarter, we estimate our RBC fell within the range of 500% to 525% at the end of March. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategies.
As you'll recall, 2010 marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Our objective remains to increase cash dividends generally in line with earnings growth before the impact of the yen. We will again evaluate a dividend increase later this year, but I am confident we will extend our consecutive annual dividend increases for 29 years. Additionally, you'll recall that we resumed the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. We purchased 3.1 million shares in the first quarter and anticipate purchasing 6 million to 12 million shares for 2011. However, we will balance our share repurchase activities this year with the derisking opportunities that ultimately enhance our portfolio.
With the first quarter of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well positioned for another year of solid financial performance. We still believe our goal of increasing operating earnings per diluted share is reasonable and attainable. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing Aflac Japan and U.S. operations, especially the expense control. As the year progresses, we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly in marketing and IT initiatives. And we have said previously, given the continued low interest rate environment, especially in Japan for 2011, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of yen.
As you know, we historically announced our earnings guidance for the following year at our May analysts meeting. Although we have not yet finalized our projections for 2012, I can tell you that our expected rate of earnings growth next year will likely be lower than 2011 due primarily to the portfolio derisking activity and a continued low interest rate environment in Japan. After the effects of the derisking and the low interest rates in Japan and the United States have fully integrated into the financial results, we should expect to see the rate of increase in earnings begin to improve.
With respect to achieving our objectives, you've heard me say many times before that we manage this company for the long term. As such, we believe that derisking our portfolio is more important than the effect of one year's earnings, and in doing so, we'll ultimately enhance the shareholder value. Now I'll turn it back over to Robin. Robin?"

There are also 5,277 who are reported injured. We estimate that there will be a total impact of JPY 3 billion in claims, and of this amount, we booked a total of JPY 1 billion to incurred claims, and the remaining, approximately JPY 2 billion, will be handled through reinsurance plans we have and offsetting reserve releases. There was also JPY 0.7 billion of operating expenses resulting from the earthquake and tsunami. Now I'd like to go through some first quarter numbers for Japan.
Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 3.7% for the quarter. Investment income was down slightly 0.7%. However, excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net income rose 2.7% in the quarter. Annualized premium persistency rate, excluding annuities, was 94.3% compared to 93.8% in 2010. In terms of quarterly operating ratio, the benefit ratio improved over last year, moving from 59.5% a year ago to 59.0% in the first quarter. The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.6%, down from 19.1% a year ago. As a result, the lower benefit and expense ratios to pretax margin rose from 21.4% to 22.4% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 8.5% for the quarter in yen terms.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.36%, and including the dollars invested, the blended rate was 3.16%. As we discussed last year, part of our strategy to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar-denominated purchases to extend the $1 billion we discussed in the fourth quarter of the year and the amount $290 million. That amount, purchase through the end of Japan for that objective, totaled $993 million. The yield on these investments was 4.26%. Our portfolio yield rose 3.56% at the end of March, no change from the end of December and 19 basis points lower than a year ago.
Now turning to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 3.1% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 48.8% compared with 45.5% a year ago. The rise in the benefit ratio reflected a return to a more normalized number in 2011 following the decline in the benefit ratio in 2010, which resulted from the loss of a large account. The operating expense ratio decreased from 35.4% to 32.0%, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be incurred later in the year. Also driving the operating expense number down to the first quarter was a return in amortization to a more normalized number after the loss of a large account increased the 2010 debt number. The profit margin for the quarter was 19.2% compared with 19.1% a year ago. In terms of U.S. investment, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.77% versus 5.98% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 6.84, down 8 basis points from the fourth quarter and 22 basis points from a year ago.
Now turning to some other items in the quarter. Noninsurance expense for the first quarter was $41 million compared with $31 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflects our debt issuance in the second half of 2010 of $750 million. Our parent company and other expenses remained flat at $14 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and U.S. Pretax margins rose from 20.0% to 20.7%. The after-tax margin increased from 13.0% to 13.5%. And on an operating basis, the tax rate remains relatively unchanged at 34.2%. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.84 compared to $1.35 in 2010. Realized investment losses were $0.79 per share for the quarter compared to $0.06 per share in 2010. During the quarter, we realized investment losses of $376 million net of tax or $0.79 per diluted share, primarily as a result of the significant derisking activities in the quarter that Dan outlined. $115 million was attributable to our sale of holdings in the Alpha Bank, $258 million resulted from the impairment of 2 other Greek banks: National Bank of Greece and EFG Eurobank. We also lowered our holdings of other concentrated positions with smaller transactions and impairments, and these transactions altogether resulted in a gain of $16 million. The remaining $19 million losses is associated with derivative and hedging activity.
As reported, our operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.63. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.10 per diluted share. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.5% for the quarter that was in our annual range of the low end of 8% to 12%. Lastly, let me comment on earnings outlook for 2011. As you heard, we have affirmed our objective for 2011 with an 8% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the Yen. But as we've previously said, given the low interest rate environment, especially in Japan, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the Yen impact. Assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share growth, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. If the Yen averages 80, 85 for the second quarter we would expect operating earnings to be $1.51 to $1.57 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of that 8% growth, and the Yen averages 80 to 80 for the full year, we would expect EPS to be in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. As we mentioned in our press release last night, although we historically announce earnings guidance for the following year at our May analysts meeting, and our 2012 earnings projection is not finalized, we do anticipate that earnings growth of year, 2012, would likely be lower than 2011.  
Let me take this opportunity to remind you that our annual analyst meeting will be held in New York City on May 17 and 18. We'll be there to provide you with further updates on our operations in both the U.S. and Japan along with our outlook for this year and the following year, so we invite you to please log in and register to attend. I'm now ready, Diane, to start taking questions. To be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to 1 question, and we'd be happy now to start with the questions."

I think this is a plan that's been put in place over the last several quarters. Our sales and marketing teams are working more tightly together than ever. You could see that through the beginning of the effects with our first ever DRTV, our recruiting campaign, which helped drive up our overall recruiting by 13.5% this past quarter. At the same time, things like our smart launches, even though we used it on a smaller product line like dental, it was a direct effect of conferences that we put in place between the U.S. and Japan several years ago. We began to learn about the positive affects of what they were doing and marrying up what was happening socially with how to drive product demand. In the U.S. this year, due to smart product launch, we were able to drive demand for dental by using our duck and leveraging it in our existing accounts to really help push specific product lines. We do hope that, that's something that we can continue to expand on in the future that will continue to help drive up our existing accounts sales as well as our veteran agents' sales. We've coined that term, our book of business. We'll be talking more about several of these items at our upcoming FAB meeting. I'm very excited about what we're seeing. I do think that this is the beginning of something positive. How quickly and how big is that, I think it's too early for us to tell. I think at the end of the second quarter I'll be better able to tell you whether the turn is completely in. But I think at this point, I'm very proud of our sales team and Tom Giddens, and our marketing team and Michael Zuna, and all the people who have worked very hard to make this happen. And I do believe that there's no fluke in the numbers here. This is just a great quarter of sales that has been long in place from a turnaround, good momentum by our sales force and a very strong balance between good broker sales and good career agent sales. But in the end, I do believe that probably the overriding factor in all of this is the Aflac Group. The fact is that it is not only been the sales that have happened in the group business but also the momentum that having the group business has brought to our career channel and our broker channel. So that's a lot to say, but I think there are a lot of good factors happening, all of which are coming together for what was our best quarter in a long period of time."

Really, Ed, it takes awhile for the cumulative effect of derisking to work its way through earnings. And over the last couple of years, we've had a substantial amount of derisking in addition to what we had in the first quarter. I think we've had about $1.6-or-so billion in realized losses over the last couple of years. We had another $450 million or so this quarter. We're going to have some more in all likelihood. And the numbers you guys have are not unreasonable there. But it's a cumulative effect of low interest rates and the fact that it takes say, 12 to 18 months to get the effects all the way through the financial results that lead us to be thoughtful about how we're going to project earnings. In addition, I'll say when we derisk -- there are several ways to derisk, some of which affect P&L more than others. Clearly, if you decide to sell a security that you believe you don't want to hold anymore and you take a realized loss, you've got a lower amount of funds to invest and then you've got decisions about whether to invest those funds in dollars or yen, and then what categories of yen assets you might be able to acquire. On the other hand, you might take an impairment and derisk just by reducing equity and the like, but not sell if you thought really the credit characteristics of the security were such that you didn't need to sell it. And then when you deal with concentrations, you're probably going to sell positions and you have to positions in concentration to reduce your concentration and those type securities. So we haven't fully concluded on exactly what steps we're going to take and there's just a level of uncertainty. But we think the net result is going to be a modest slowdown in earnings growth for some period to come. Ken, do you want to comment further on that, or you think that's enough?"

This is Dan. There's a difference between the U.S. and Japan. They don't use SMART Act in Japan like we do in the U.S. So there's a time lag so my gut is that, and it is a gut because I want to wait and see what April numbers look like. And we plan on telling you at the FAB meeting. We normally don't cover what sales numbers are for a month but we're going to give you April numbers when we got them. But I don't think March reflects what really happened, maybe the last week did a little bit, but it's hard to tell. And so at this point, we don't want to go out and make some statement then all of a sudden the next couple of weeks we see a difference. And as Toru talked about, pretty much everything is kind of getting back to normal now. And of course the area that was directly hit, it would be quite a time but that accounted for 5% of our sales. So that will kind of give you an idea of what to look at. So what I've tried to kind of analyze in my mind is in terms of these numbers, if you say that okay, sales in the first quarter were basically where we thought they would be. Because remember, we expected a good first quarter, a little bit better than what we thought, but we expected sales to be flat to down in the fourth quarter because of the tough sales comparison. So if you go back and say okay the first quarter, that area that was affected was 5% of our sales then let's say the second quarter, the number 0 and the third quarter is 1/2 and the fourth quarter is 1/2 then that means that our overall sales have been hurt by 2.5% over what our original projections are. And then say Tokyo was hurt for a short period of time but outside Tokyo nothing else was really that affected then we're actually increasing our sales objective in the 2% to 5% still we think we can make yet down to the up 3% or 5% swing is actually a higher number because we got to make up the difference of what happened due to the tsunami."

And we had said that the 100 to 150 basis points -- quite frankly we were surprised but pleased about the level of production of child endowment and WAYS. I think they were somewhat above expectations. And as I previously discussed with the community, the investment community, starting last September, the meeting in FAB and continuing on in the fourth quarter discussions, child endowment and WAYS are going to slow down the improvement or the decline in the benefit ratio. We're still getting the same kind of decline in the cancer product from reduction in number of days in the hospital, though as I've told you that's moderating some. Once you get the numbers down to days in the hospital of around 20 to 22, you don't have as much room for improvement as when the average was say, 40 days per stay for cancer treatment. So I've told you the improvement in the medical or the cancer line is moderating some. The child endowment and WAYS products will have the benefit ratio go up some but they'll have the expense ratio go down some, and they're going to drive revenue more than the medical products do. And at the analyst meeting, I'm going to show you an analysis that basically I just disclosed that early, I guess, but basically it tells you that if we write the same number of policies of medical with child endowment and WAYS, we've produced somewhat more profit just modestly more profit by producing the same number of policies with child endowment and WAYS than we do through the medical policies. And that's because they've got a higher average premium, they've got a lower average margin but the profits per policy come out somewhat higher. So there's a bit of a change in the composition of the way profits are produced. But the net effect is that you get about the same, if not slightly more profit about writing a policy at WAYS or child endowment than a policy of medical or cancer."

But first, I'd like to discuss what's been going on in",2825,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you've had a chance to review our first quarter press release. I'll comment on our operations in Japan and the United States. But first, I'd like to discuss what's been going on in Japan over the last 6 weeks. Clearly, the earthquake and tsunami on March 11 and the subsequent nuclear situation presented Japan with one of the biggest crises it's ever faced. The whole world watched helplessly through television and social media as devastating pictures and news coverage of the disastrous situation unfolded. We've been operating in Japan for more than 35 years. If there's one thing we've found in developing such close ties in Japan, it's that the Japanese people are resilient. And when I visited Japan the week after the earthquake, I saw this resilience. Our employees are safe, our business operations are running, and we do not expect any material impact on claims or earnings this year. Life is moving forward for most Japanese citizens and so is our resolve to be there for our policyholders during their time of need by paying claims just as we promised.
Aflac Japan generated strong results in the first quarter, and we're again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. Revenue growth showed continued improvement rising 3.7% for the quarter. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand, resulting in solid earnings growth for the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact, Aflac Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36-year history. 
New annualized premium sales exceeded our expectations and rose 12.6% to JPY 34.1 billion. With the expanding bank channel in mind, Aflac Japan has developed innovative products that align well with the product needs of banks. Bank sales in the first quarter posted another record with sales of JPY 7.9 billion, which represents an increase of 12.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 154% increase over the first quarter of 2010. I mentioned how we believe more banks, and mega banks in particular, would step up their efforts in selling Aflac's products, and that's exactly what we've been seeing. 
At the end of March, Aflac Japan was represented by 364 banks and more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. While many banks have agreed to sell our products, turning that agreement from ink on paper into sales does not happen overnight, especially with more than 20,000 branches representing the 364 banks. It will take some time to facilitate training at all these locations but we're seeing sales steadily improving at many of these banks as training takes place and the banks expand their offering of Aflac products. In many of the banks, sales representatives had gained experience at selling our products, and their confidence level and their sales ability haS grown. WAYS and child endowment products, which are both especially popular with banks, were key drivers to growth again in the first quarter. You'll recall that WAYS is a unique hybrid whole life product that's being converted to fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefit when the policyholder reaches a predetermined age. The real story can be seen in WAYS' phenomenal sales growth rate, which was an increase of 221%, compared to the first quarter of 2010. Consumers find WAYS attractive because of the guaranteed principal and the future flexibility of the benefit options. Banks like to sell this product because of its high premium and attractive commission, and Aflac's product margin on WAYS is significantly enhanced when policy holders elect to pay all the premium upfront through the discounted advanced premium. Importantly, 90% of the customers at the banks choose this payment option. As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow significantly in 2011. 
As I mentioned, the other strong driver to sales growth is child endowment product, which was up 58.9% in the first quarter. This product is primarily used to help fund the higher cost associated with child's entering high school or college in Japan. Child endowment policies have been very popular in Japan for many years. Aflac's strong brand, this product's unmatched return and our expanding presence in banks are competitive advantages that have helped make our child endowment policy the product of choice. You'll recall that the average premium for child endowment is much lower profit margin, but because it is wanted and needed in the bank channel and is about 3x the premium of the medical policies, the premium is a very solid contributor to top line growth. It's also helpful in enhancing our policyholder base, allowing us the opportunity to cross sell additional products like WAYS to consumers. Like WAYS, our child endowment offers a discounted advanced premium, and the profit margin on the child endowment more than doubles when the policyholders elect to pay premiums upfront using the discounted advanced premiums. About half of the consumers who purchase child endowment through the banks elect the discounted advanced premium method of payment.
As expected, cancer insurance sales were down 10.4% for the quarter as prospective policyholders and sales agents postponed cancer insurance purchases and sales in anticipation of the introduction of the new base cancer policy DAYS, which was introduced at the end of March. The enhancement of this new base policy speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatment as well as our commitment to retaining the #1 provider of cancer insurance in Japan. Sales of cancer insurance accounted for 17.5% of total sales. Keep in mind that the foundation of our product portfolio has been and continues to be cancer and medical products. Importantly, we maintain our position as the #1 seller of medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. The solid platform we established with these 2 pillar products has allowed us to leverage our competitive advantages such as branding and administrative efficiencies to grow our product offering and meet the evolving needs of the consumers.
From top to bottom, Aflac Japan performed extremely well in the first quarter, especially in light of the natural disaster and tough sales comparisons to a year ago. But as I've told you, following 2 years of strong sales growth, the sales comparisons only get tougher as the year goes on especially in the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, we believe the natural disaster has affected our sales, primarily in the affected regions, but I still believe we can achieve our sales target for the year in the range of down 2% to up 3%. 
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. We were very pleased and excited with Aflac's U.S. performance from both the sales and a financial perspective. For the first time in 9 quarters, Aflac U.S. generated positive sales growth, and new annualized premium sales were up nicely, generating a 6.3% sales increase. We were especially encouraged to see an increase in production from both new and veteran agents. In fact, we saw crossover where Aflac career agents embraced group products. To me, it all boils down to giving our customers a choice between group and individual products. As I've said before, I tell our entire U.S. distribution system that I don't care whether they sell group or individual products but I do care that they give the group or the individual platform options to the employers with more than 100 workers. That's because if they don't at least let these accounts know we offer the group options now, you can bet that someone else will. I truly believe that if the employer wants group products, and they know Aflac offers them, they'll choose Aflac over the competition.
For both group and individual products, we are driving sales through specific product pushes called smart launches, which are modeled after Aflac Japan's product launches that effectively focus on the entire sales force on selling one specific product during a specific period of time. Our first smart launch was in the first quarter, and it focused on the Dental product. The results were phenomenal. Our dental category generated a 37.1% sales increase and contributed 6.9% to the total annualized premium sales. We've also seen success with the Critical Illness product created for the group platform. While this product was only introduced in mid-2010, it has provided both our traditional sales force and brokers with valuable products to add to accounts that currently have cancer products on an individual basis. This is a good example of a product that helps career agents transition and expand their portfolio to include not only individual products but also group products.
On the distribution side, our strategy, we've said many times before that today's recruits are tomorrow's sales. With that in mind, in early January, we launched our first ever recruiting campaign utilizing national television advertising. It featured a commercial with successful agents sharing their story and generating phenomenal leads, which ultimately contributed significantly to our 13.5% increase in recruiting for the first quarter. As you can see, we've taken measures to better reach potential customers with some innovative products, benefit solutions -- and we've improved Aflac U.S. sales not only to reflect intense focus on supporting our field force with enhanced products but also reflects the better resources and training that helps our sales force better approach selling in the current environment. We will continue to help our entire distribution, new and veteran agents, as well as brokers, with ways they can provide and improve their performance because they are essential part of our strategy and our success. All of these elements are fundamental to the model that we've been following in the U.S. We call it ""recruit, train, motivate and sell."" For those of you who will be coming to the financial analysts briefing in New York on the May 17 and 18, we'll be sharing more about this model and the products that we're going to introduce.
We continue to believe the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind. We also believe our expectations that Aflac U.S. sales growth for 2011 will be flat to up 5% is reasonable, and our first quarter sales are a good start toward achieving that objective. Given the state of the economy, we still remain somewhat cautious. In addition, this is a momentum business. Although our 6.3% sales increase is a great start, I would obviously like to see the momentum build for a few quarters. It is clear, however, that the addition of group product platforms and our growing broker initiative only serve to enhance our ability to leverage Aflac's brand and to reach more companies, large and small, across the United States.
Now let me update you on Aflac Inc.'s results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated performance. Operating per share diluted rose 15.6% to $1.63. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen operating earnings per diluted shares rose 8.5%. We believe that our basic investment approach of effectively managing assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach for our policyholders and shareholders. As you've heard us say repeatedly since early 1990s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan's low interest rate environment. To reiterate what we said in our year-end conference call, one of our top focuses in 2011 is concentration risk. While our largest exposures are predominantly a legacy issues, we have continued to look at ways to optimistically reduce some larger positions where practical. As I said last week on CNBC, we focused on growing our operating earnings while derisking to further enhance the quality of the portfolio. I don't think many of you fully recognize the extent of our investment portfolio derisking activities that we've been actively engaged in over the last couple of years, so I'm going to cover 4 major derisking actions that we've taken to remind you of what we've accomplished. For instance, as we began 2009, our holding of perpetual subordinated securities was approximately 13% of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, perpetual subordinated debt accounted for less than 9% of the portfolio, a 30% decrease. We also de-risked the portfolio by lowering our concentration in financial exposures. At the start of 2009, banks and other financials made up 41% of the total portfolio, and at the end of the first quarter of this year, the number had dropped to 33%, a 20% decrease. We've accomplished this by both selling assets as well as reducing the percentage of new investments allocated for the financial sector. We also reduced our exposure to the PIIGS countries. At the start of 2009, these sovereign and financial exposures made up approximately 6% of the total portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, that number has declined to 4%, a 33% decrease.
As I've already suggested, we are now focused on addressing some of our legacy issues, especially some of those highly concentrated positions. Within the PIIGS portfolio, we've started with lowering the exposure in 2010. And in the first quarter of 2011, we focused our efforts on reducing our exposure to Greek financial system. Today, our holding of Greek banks has been reduced by 82% from the beginning of 2011. This percentage decline also reflects the sale of one of the banks following quarter end. In addition to significantly reducing our exposure to Greek financial systems, we also focused on reducing some of our larger concentrated positions where practical. As such, we sold some of our holdings in available-for-sale categories that exceeded 10% of tax. We believe these actions to lessen the concentrated risk in our investment portfolio further strengthens our balance sheet. Our business continues to generate significant capital in the first quarter.
As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital ratio or RBC remains a top priority for us, and you'll recall that it remains a primary component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our objective for 2011 is to derisk our portfolio while maintaining our RBC ratio in the range of 400% to 500%, with a target of 450%. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the first quarter, we estimate our RBC fell within the range of 500% to 525% at the end of March. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategies.
As you'll recall, 2010 marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Our objective remains to increase cash dividends generally in line with earnings growth before the impact of the yen. We will again evaluate a dividend increase later this year, but I am confident we will extend our consecutive annual dividend increases for 29 years. Additionally, you'll recall that we resumed the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. We purchased 3.1 million shares in the first quarter and anticipate purchasing 6 million to 12 million shares for 2011. However, we will balance our share repurchase activities this year with the derisking opportunities that ultimately enhance our portfolio.
With the first quarter of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well positioned for another year of solid financial performance. We still believe our goal of increasing operating earnings per diluted share is reasonable and attainable. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing Aflac Japan and U.S. operations, especially the expense control. As the year progresses, we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly in marketing and IT initiatives. And we have said previously, given the continued low interest rate environment, especially in Japan for 2011, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of yen.
As you know, we historically announced our earnings guidance for the following year at our May analysts meeting. Although we have not yet finalized our projections for 2012, I can tell you that our expected rate of earnings growth next year will likely be lower than 2011 due primarily to the portfolio derisking activity and the continued low interest rate environment in Japan. After the effects of the derisking and the low interest rates in Japan and the United States have fully integrated into the financial results, we should expect to see the rate of increase in earnings begin to improve.
With respect to achieving our objectives, you've heard me say many times before that we manage this company for the long term. As such, we believe that derisking our portfolio is more important than the effect on one year's earnings, and in doing so, we'll ultimately enhance the shareholder value. Now I'll turn it back over to Robin. Robin?"

And as Dan said and you are all aware, the quakes and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 had a devastating impact on the country, and they remain in our thoughts and prayers. But I'd like to go through some of the numbers to-dat",1172,"Thank you, Dan. And as Dan said and you are all aware, the quakes and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 had a devastating impact on the country, and they remain in our thoughts and prayers. But I'd like to go through some of the numbers to-date that reflect the magnitude of this event.
According to the official report by Japan's National Police Agency, as of April 28, total lives that were lost is 14,575, and there are still 11,324 who are missing. There are also 5,277 who are reported injured. We estimate that there will be a total impact of JPY 3 billion in claims, and of this amount, we booked a total of JPY 1 billion to incurred claims, and the remaining, approximately JPY 2 billion, will be handled through reinsurance plans we have and offsetting reserve releases. There was also JPY 0.7 billion of operating expenses resulting from the earthquake and tsunami. Now I'd like to go through some first quarter numbers for Japan.
Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 3.7% for the quarter. Investment income was down slightly 0.7%. However, excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net income rose 2.7% in the quarter. Annualized premium persistency rate, excluding annuities, was 94.3% compared to 93.8% in 2010. In terms of quarterly operating ratio, the benefit ratio improved over last year, moving from 59.5% a year ago to 59.0% in the first quarter. The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.6%, down from 19.1% a year ago. As a result, the lower benefit and expense ratios to pretax margin rose from 21.4% to 22.4% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 8.5% for the quarter in yen terms.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.36%, and including the dollars invested, the blended rate was 3.16%. As we discussed last year, part of our strategy to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar-denominated purchases to extend the $1 billion we discussed in the fourth quarter of the year and the amount $290 million. That amount, purchase through the end of Japan for that objective, totaled $993 million. The yield on these investments was 4.26%. Our portfolio yield rose 3.56% at the end of March, no change from the end of December and 19 basis points lower than a year ago.
Now turning to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 3.1% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 48.8% compared with 45.5% a year ago. The rise in the benefit ratio reflected a return to a more normalized number in 2011 following the decline in the benefit ratio in 2010, which resulted from the loss of a large account. The operating expense ratio decreased from 35.4% to 32.0%, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be incurred later in the year. Also driving the operating expense number down to the first quarter was a return in amortization to a more normalized number after the loss of the large account increased the 2010 debt number. The profit margin for the quarter was 19.2% compared with 19.1% a year ago. In terms of U.S. investment, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.77% versus 5.98% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 6.84%, down 8 basis points from the fourth quarter and 22 basis points from a year ago.
Now turning to some other items in the quarter. Noninsurance expense for the first quarter was $41 million compared with $31 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflects our debt issuance in the second half of 2010 of $750 million. Our parent company and other expenses remained flat at $14 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and U.S. Pretax margins rose from 20.0% to 20.7%. The after-tax margin increased from 13.0% to 13.5%. And on an operating basis, the tax rate remains relatively unchanged at 34.2%. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.84 compared to $1.35 in 2010. Realized investment losses were $0.79 per share for the quarter compared to $0.06 per share in 2010. During the quarter, we realized investment losses of $376 million net of tax or $0.79 per diluted share, primarily as a result of the significant derisking activities in the quarter that Dan outlined. $115 million was attributable to our sale of holdings in the Alpha Bank, $258 million resulted from the impairment of 2 other Greek banks: National Bank of Greece and EFG Eurobank. We also lowered our holdings of other concentrated positions with smaller transactions and impairments, and these transactions altogether resulted in a gain of $16 million. The remaining $19 million loss is associated with derivative and hedging activity.
As reported, our operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.63. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.10 per diluted share. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.5% for the quarter that was in our annual range of the low end of 8% to 12%. Lastly, let me comment on earnings outlook for 2011. As you heard, we have affirmed our objective for 2011 with an 8% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the Yen. But as we've previously said, given the low interest rate environment, especially in Japan, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the Yen impact. Assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share growth, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. If the Yen averages 80, 85 for the second quarter we would expect operating earnings to be $1.51 to $1.57 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of that 8% growth, and the Yen averages 80 to 85 for the full year, we would expect EPS to be in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. As we mentioned in our press release last night, although we historically announce earnings guidance for the following year at our May analysts meeting, and our 2012 earnings projection is not finalized, we do anticipate that earnings for the next year, 2012, would likely be lower than 2011.
Let me take this opportunity to remind you that our annual analyst meeting will be held in New York City on May 17 and 18. We'll be there to provide you with further updates on our operations in both the U.S. and Japan along with our outlook for this year and the following year, so we invite you to please log in and register to attend. I'm now ready, Diane, to start taking questions. To be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to one question, and we'd be happy now to start with the questions."

I think this is a plan that's been put in place over the last several quarters. Our sales and marketing teams are working more tightly together than ever. You could see that through the beginning of the effects with our first ever DRTV, or recruiting campaign, which helped drive up our overall recruiting by 13.5% this past quarter. At the same time, things like our smart launches, even though we used it on a smaller product line like dental, it was a direct effect of conferences that we put in place between the U.S. and Japan several years ago. We began to learn about the positive affects of what they were doing and then marrying up what was happening socially with how to drive product demand. In the U.S. this year, due to smart product launch, we were able to drive demand for dental by using our duck and leveraging it in our existing accounts to really help push specific product lines. We do hope that, that's something that we can continue to expand on in the future that will continue to help drive up our existing accounts sales as well as our veteran agents' sales. We've coined that term, our book of business. We'll be talking more about several of these items at our upcoming FAB meeting. I'm very excited about what we're seeing. I do think that this is the beginning of something positive. How quickly and how big is that, I think it's too early for us to tell. I think at the end of the second quarter I'll be better able to tell you whether the turn is completely in. But I think at this point, I'm very proud of our sales team and Tom Giddens, and our marketing team and Michael Zuna, and all the people who have worked very hard to make this happen. And I do believe that there's no fluke in the numbers here. This is just a great quarter of sales that has been long in place from a turnaround, good momentum by our sales force and a very strong balance between good broker sales and good career agent sales. But in the end, I do believe that probably the overriding factor in all of this has been Aflac Group. The fact is that it is not only been the sales that have happened in the group business but also the momentum that having the group business has brought to both our career channel and our broker channel. So that's a lot to say, but I think there are a lot of good factors happening, all of which are coming together for what was our best quarter in a long period of time."

Really, Ed, it takes awhile for the cumulative effect of derisking to work its way through earnings. And over the last couple of years, we've had a substantial amount of derisking in addition to what we had in the first quarter. I think we've had about $1.6-or-so billion in realized losses over the last couple of years. We had another $450 million or so this quarter. We're going to have some more in all likelihood. And the numbers you guys have are not unreasonable there. But it's a cumulative effect of low interest rates and the fact that it takes say, 12 to 18 months to get the effects all the way through the financial results that lead us to be thoughtful about how we're going to project earnings. In addition, I'll say when we derisk -- there are several ways to derisk, some of which affect P&L more than others. Clearly, if you decide to sell a security that you believe you don't want to hold anymore and you take a realized loss, you've got a lower amount of funds to invest and then you've got decisions about whether to invest those funds in dollars or yen, and then what categories of yen assets you might be able to acquire. On the other hand, you might take an impairment and derisk just by reducing equity and the like, but not sell if you thought really the credit characteristics of the security were such that you didn't need to sell it. And then when you deal with concentrations, you're probably going to sell positions and you have to positions in concentration to reduce your concentration of those type securities.

They don't use SMART Act in Japan like we do in the U.S. So there's a time lag so my gut is that, and it is a gut because I want to wait and see what April numbers look like. And we plan on telling you at the FAB meeting. We normally don't cover what sales numbers are for a month but we're going to give you April numbers when we got them. But I don't think March reflects what really happened, maybe the last week did a little bit, but it's hard to tell. And so at this point, we don't want to go out and make some statement then all of a sudden the next couple of weeks we see a difference. And as Toru talked about, pretty much everything is kind of getting back to normal now. And of course the area that was directly hit, it will be quite a time but that accounted for 5% of our sales. So that will kind of give you an idea of what to look at. So what I've tried to kind of analyze in my mind is in terms of these numbers, if you say that okay, sales in the first quarter were basically where we thought they would be. Because remember, we expected a good first quarter, a little bit better than what we thought, but we expect sales to be flat to down in the fourth quarter because of the tough sales comparison. So if you go back and say okay the first quarter, that area that was affected was 5% of our sales then say the second quarter, the number 0 and the third quarter is 1/2 and the fourth quarter is 1/2 then that means that our overall sales have been hurt by 2.5% over what our original projections are. And then say Tokyo was hurt for a short period of time but outside Tokyo nothing else was really that affected then we're actually increasing our sales objective in that the 2% to 5% still we think we can make yet down 2% to up 3% or 5% swing is actually a higher number because we got to make up the difference of what happened due to the tsunami."

And we had said that the 100 to 150 basis points -- quite frankly we were surprised but pleased about the level of production of child endowment and WAYS. I think they were somewhat above expectations. And as I previously discussed with the community, the investment community, starting last September, the mini FAB and continuing on in the fourth quarter discussions, child endowment and WAYS are going to slow down the improvement or the decline in the benefit ratio. We're still getting the same kind of decline in the cancer product from reduction in number of days in the hospital, though as I've told you that's moderating some. Once you get the numbers down to days in the hospital of around 20 to 22, you don't have as much room for improvement as when the average was say, 40 days per stay for a cancer treatment. So I've told you the improvement in the medical or the cancer line is moderating some. The child endowment and WAYS products will have the benefit ratio go up some but they'll have the expense ratio go down some, and they're going to drive revenue more than the medical products do. And at the analyst meeting, I'm going to show you an analysis that basically I'll just disclosed that early, I guess, but basically it tells you that if we write the same number of policies of medical and child endowment and WAYS, we produce somewhat more profit, just modestly more profit by producing the same number of policies with child endowment and WAYS than we do through the medical policies. And that's because they've got a higher average premium, they've got a lower average margin but the profits per policy come out somewhat higher. So there's a bit of a change in the composition of the way profits are produced. But the net effect is that you get about the same, if not slightly more profit by writing a policy of WAYS or child endowment than a policy of medical or cancer."

I'll comment on our operations in Japan and the United States. But first, I'd like to discuss what's been going on in Japan over the last 6 weeks. Clearly, the earthquake and tsunami on March 11 and the subsequent nuclear situation presented Japan with one of the biggest crises it's ever faced. The whole world watched helplessly through television and social media as devastating pictures and news coverage of the disastrous situation unfolded. We've been operating in Japan for more than 35 years. If there's one thing we've found in developing such close ties in Japan, it's that the Japanese people are resilient. And when I visited Japan the week after the earthquake, I saw this resilience. Our employees are safe, our business operations are running, and we do not expect any material impact on claims or earnings this year. Life is moving forward for most Japanese citizens and so is our resolve to be there for our policyholders during their time of need by paying claims just as we promised.
Aflac Japan generated strong results in the first quarter, and we're again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. Revenue growth showed continued improvement rising 3.7% for the quarter. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand, resulting in solid earnings growth for the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact, Aflac Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36-year history. 
New annualized premium sales exceeded our expectations and rose 12.6% to JPY 34.1 billion. With the expanding bank channel in mind, Aflac Japan has developed innovative products that align well with the product needs of banks. Bank sales in the first quarter posted another record with sales of JPY 7.9 billion, which represents an increase of 12.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 154% increase over the first quarter of 2010. I mentioned how we believe more banks, and mega banks in particular, would step up their efforts in selling Aflac's products, and that's exactly what we've been seeing. 
At the end of March, Aflac Japan was represented by 364 banks and more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. While many banks have agreed to sell our products, turning that agreement from ink on paper into sales does not happen overnight, especially with more than 20,000 branches representing the 364 banks. It will take some time to facilitate training at all these locations but we're seeing sales steadily improving at many of these banks as training takes place and the banks expand their offering of Aflac products. In many of the banks, sales representatives had gained experience at selling our products, and their confidence level and their sales ability has grown. WAYS and child endowment products, which are both especially popular with banks, were key drivers to growth again in the first quarter. You'll recall that WAYS is a unique hybrid whole life product that's being converted to fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefit when the policyholder reaches a predetermined age. The real story can be seen in WAYS' phenomenal sales growth rate, which was an increase of 221%, compared to the first quarter of 2010. Consumers find WAYS attractive because of the guaranteed principal and the future flexibility of the benefit options. Banks like to sell this product because of its high premium and attractive commission, and Aflac's product margin on WAYS is significantly enhanced when policy holders elect to pay all the premium upfront through the discounted advanced premium. Importantly, 90% of the customers at the banks choose this payment option. As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow significantly in 2011. 
As I mentioned, the other strong driver to sales growth is child endowment product, which was up 58.9% in the first quarter. This product is primarily used to help fund the higher cost associated with child's entering high school or college in Japan. Child endowment policies have been very popular in Japan for many years. Aflac's strong brand, this product's unmatched return and our expanding presence in banks are competitive advantages that have helped make our child endowment policy the product of choice. You'll recall that the average premium for child endowment is much lower profit margin, but because it is wanted and needed in the bank channel and is about 3x the premium of the medical policies, the premium is a very solid contributor to top line growth. It's also helpful in enhancing our policyholder base, allowing us the opportunity to cross sell additional products like WAYS to consumers. Like WAYS, our child endowment offers a discounted advanced premium, and the profit margin on the child endowment more than doubles when the policyholders elect to pay premiums upfront using the discounted advanced premiums. About half of the consumers who purchase child endowment through the banks elect the discounted advanced premium method of payment.
As expected, cancer insurance sales were down 10.4% for the quarter as prospective policyholders and sales agents postponed cancer insurance purchases and sales in anticipation of the introduction of the new base cancer policy DAYS, which was introduced at the end of March. The enhancement of this new base policy speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatment as well as our commitment to retaining the #1 provider of cancer insurance in Japan. Sales of cancer insurance accounted for 17.5% of total sales. Keep in mind that the foundation of our product portfolio has been and continues to be cancer and medical products. Importantly, we maintain our position as the #1 seller of medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. The solid platform we established with these 2 pillar products has allowed us to leverage our competitive advantages such as branding and administrative efficiencies to grow our product offering and meet the evolving needs of the consumers.
From top to bottom, Aflac Japan performed extremely well in the first quarter, especially in light of the natural disaster and tough sales comparisons to a year ago. But as I've told you, following 2 years of strong sales growth, the sales comparisons only get tougher as the year goes on especially in the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, we believe the natural disaster has affected our sales, primarily in the affected regions, but I still believe we can achieve our sales target for the year in the range of down 2% to up 3%. 
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. We were very pleased and excited with Aflac's U.S. performance from both the sales and a financial perspective. For the first time in 9 quarters, Aflac U.S. generated positive sales growth, and new annualized premium sales were up nicely, generating a 6.3% sales increase. We were especially encouraged to see an increase in production from both new and veteran agents. In fact, we saw crossover where Aflac career agents embraced group products. To me, it all boils down to giving our customers a choice between group and individual products. As I've said before, I tell our entire U.S. distribution system that I don't care whether they sell group or individual products but I do care that they give the group or the individual platform options to the employers with more than 100 workers. That's because if they don't at least let these accounts know we offer the group options now, you can bet that someone else will. I truly believe that if the employer wants group products, and they know Aflac offers them, they'll choose Aflac over the competition.
For both group and individual products, we are driving sales through specific product pushes called smart launches, which are modeled after Aflac Japan's product launches that effectively focus on the entire sales force on selling one specific product during a specific period of time. Our first smart launch was in the first quarter, and it focused on the Dental product. The results were phenomenal. Our dental category generated a 37.1% sales increase and contributed 6.9% to the total annualized premium sales. We've also seen success with the Critical Illness product created for the group platform. While this product was only introduced in mid-2010, it has provided both our traditional sales force and brokers with valuable products to add to accounts that currently have cancer products on an individual basis. This is a good example of a product that helps career agents transition and expand their portfolio to include not only individual products but also group products.
On the distribution side, our strategy, we've said many times before that today's recruits are tomorrow's sales. With that in mind, in early January, we launched our first ever recruiting campaign utilizing national television advertising. It featured a commercial with successful agents sharing their story and generating phenomenal leads, which ultimately contributed significantly to our 13.5% increase in recruiting for the first quarter. As you can see, we've taken measures to better reach potential customers with some innovative products, benefit solutions -- and we've improved Aflac U.S. sales not only to reflect intense focus on supporting our field force with enhanced products but also reflects the better resources and training that helps our sales force better approach selling in the current environment. We will continue to help our entire distribution, new and veteran agents, as well as brokers, with ways they can provide and improve their performance because they are essential part of our strategy and our success. All of these elements are fundamental to the model that we've been following in the U.S. We call it ""recruit, train, motivate and sell."" For those of you who will be coming to the financial analysts briefing in New York on the May 17 and 18, we'll be sharing more about this model and the products that we're going to introduce.
We continue to believe the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind. We also believe our expectations that Aflac U.S. sales growth for 2011 will be flat to up 5% is reasonable, and our first quarter sales are a good start toward achieving that objective. Given the state of the economy, we still remain somewhat cautious. In addition, this is a momentum business. Although our 6.3% sales increase is a great start, I would obviously like to see the momentum build for a few quarters. It is clear, however, that the addition of group product platforms and our growing broker initiative only serve to enhance our ability to leverage Aflac's brand and to reach more companies, large and small, across the United States.
Now let me update you on Aflac Inc.'s results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated performance. Operating per share diluted rose 15.6% to $1.63. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen operating earnings per diluted shares rose 8.5%. We believe that our basic investment approach of effectively managing assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach for our policyholders and shareholders. As you've heard us say repeatedly since early 1990s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan's low interest rate environment. To reiterate what we said in our year-end conference call, one of our top focuses in 2011 is concentration risk. While our largest exposures are predominantly a legacy issues, we have continued to look at ways to optimistically reduce some larger positions where practical. As I said last week on CNBC, we focused on growing our operating earnings while derisking to further enhance the quality of the portfolio. I don't think many of you fully recognize the extent of our investment portfolio derisking activities that we've been actively engaged in over the last couple of years, so I'm going to cover 4 major derisking actions that we've taken to remind you of what we've accomplished. For instance, as we began 2009, our holding of perpetual subordinated securities was approximately 13% of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, perpetual subordinated debt accounted for less than 9% of the portfolio, a 30% decrease. We also de-risked the portfolio by lowering our concentration in financial exposures. At the start of 2009, banks and other financials made up 41% of the total portfolio, and at the end of the first quarter of this year, the number had dropped to 33%, a 20% decrease. We've accomplished this by both selling assets as well as reducing the percentage of new investments allocated for the financial sector. We also reduced our exposure to the PIIGS countries. At the start of 2009, these sovereign and financial exposures made up approximately 6% of the total portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, that number has declined to 4%, a 33% decrease.
As I've already suggested, we are now focused on addressing some of our legacy issues, especially some of those highly concentrated positions. Within the PIIGS portfolio, we've started with lowering the exposure in 2010. And in the first quarter of 2011, we focused our efforts on reducing our exposure to Greek financial system. Today, our holding of Greek banks has been reduced by 82% from the beginning of 2011. This percentage decline also reflects the sale of one of the banks following quarter end. In addition to significantly reducing our exposure to Greek financial systems, we also focused on reducing some of our larger concentrated positions where practical. As such, we sold some of our holdings in available-for-sale categories that exceeded 10% of tax. We believe these actions to lessen the concentrated risk in our investment portfolio further strengthens our balance sheet. Our business continues to generate significant capital in the first quarter.
As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital ratio or RBC remains a top priority for us, and you'll recall that it remains a primary component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our objective for 2011 is to derisk our portfolio while maintaining our RBC ratio in the range of 400% to 500%, with a target of 450%. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the first quarter, we estimate our RBC fell within the range of 500% to 525% at the end of March. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategies.
As you'll recall, 2010 marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Our objective remains to increase cash dividends generally in line with earnings growth before the impact of the yen. We will again evaluate a dividend increase later this year, but I am confident we will extend our consecutive annual dividend increases for 29 years. Additionally, you'll recall that we resumed the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. We purchased 3.1 million shares in the first quarter and anticipate purchasing 6 million to 12 million shares for 2011. However, we will balance our share repurchase activities this year with the derisking opportunities that ultimately enhance our portfolio.
With the first quarter of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well positioned for another year of solid financial performance. We still believe our goal of increasing operating earnings per diluted share is reasonable and attainable. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing Aflac Japan and U.S. operations, especially the expense control. As the year progresses, we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly in marketing and IT initiatives. And we have said previously, given the continued low interest rate environment, especially in Japan for 2011, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of yen.
As you know, we historically announced our earnings guidance for the following year at our May analysts meeting. Although we have not yet finalized our projections for 2012, I can tell you that our expected rate of earnings growth next year will likely be lower than 2011 due primarily to the portfolio derisking activity and the continued low interest rate environment in Japan. After the effects of the derisking and the low interest rates in Japan and the United States have fully integrated into the financial results, we should expect to see the rate of increase in earnings begin to improve.
With respect to achieving our objectives, you've heard me say many times before that we manage this company for the long term. As such, we believe that derisking our portfolio is more important than the effect on one year's earnings, and in doing so, we'll ultimately enhance the shareholder value. Now I'll turn it back over to Robin. Robin?"

And as Dan said and you are all aware, the quakes and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 had a devastating impact on the country, and they remain in our thoughts and prayers. But I'd like to go through some of the numbers to-dat",1172,"Thank you, Dan. And as Dan said and you are all aware, the quakes and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 had a devastating impact on the country, and they remain in our thoughts and prayers. But I'd like to go through some of the numbers to-date that reflect the magnitude of this event.
According to the official report by Japan's National Police Agency, as of April 28, total lives that were lost is 14,575, and there are still 11,324 who are missing. There are also 5,277 who are reported injured. We estimate that there will be a total impact of JPY 3 billion in claims, and of this amount, we booked a total of JPY 1 billion to incurred claims, and the remaining, approximately JPY 2 billion, will be handled through reinsurance plans we have and offsetting reserve releases. There was also JPY 0.7 billion of operating expenses resulting from the earthquake and tsunami. Now I'd like to go through some first quarter numbers for Japan.
Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 3.7% for the quarter. Investment income was down slightly 0.7%. However, excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net income rose 2.7% in the quarter. Annualized premium persistency rate, excluding annuities, was 94.3% compared to 93.8% in 2010. In terms of quarterly operating ratio, the benefit ratio improved over last year, moving from 59.5% a year ago to 59.0% in the first quarter. The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.6%, down from 19.1% a year ago. As a result, the lower benefit and expense ratios to pretax margin rose from 21.4% to 22.4% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 8.5% for the quarter in yen terms.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.36%, and including the dollars invested, the blended rate was 3.16%. As we discussed last year, part of our strategy to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar-denominated purchases to extend the $1 billion we discussed in the fourth quarter of the year and the amount $290 million. That amount, purchase through the end of Japan for that objective, totaled $993 million. The yield on these investments was 4.26%. Our portfolio yield rose 3.56% at the end of March, no change from the end of December and 19 basis points lower than a year ago.
Now turning to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 3.1% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 48.8% compared with 45.5% a year ago. The rise in the benefit ratio reflected a return to a more normalized number in 2011 following the decline in the benefit ratio in 2010, which resulted from the loss of a large account. The operating expense ratio decreased from 35.4% to 32.0%, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be incurred later in the year. Also driving the operating expense number down to the first quarter was a return in amortization to a more normalized number after the loss of the large account increased the 2010 debt number. The profit margin for the quarter was 19.2% compared with 19.1% a year ago. In terms of U.S. investment, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.77% versus 5.98% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 6.84%, down 8 basis points from the fourth quarter and 22 basis points from a year ago.
Now turning to some other items in the quarter. Noninsurance expense for the first quarter was $41 million compared with $31 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflects our debt issuance in the second half of 2010 of $750 million. Our parent company and other expenses remained flat at $14 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and U.S. Pretax margins rose from 20.0% to 20.7%. The after-tax margin increased from 13.0% to 13.5%. And on an operating basis, the tax rate remains relatively unchanged at 34.2%. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.84 compared to $1.35 in 2010. Realized investment losses were $0.79 per share for the quarter compared to $0.06 per share in 2010. During the quarter, we realized investment losses of $376 million net of tax or $0.79 per diluted share, primarily as a result of the significant derisking activities in the quarter that Dan outlined. $115 million was attributable to our sale of holdings in the Alpha Bank, $258 million resulted from the impairment of 2 other Greek banks: National Bank of Greece and EFG Eurobank. We also lowered our holdings of other concentrated positions with smaller transactions and impairments, and these transactions altogether resulted in a gain of $16 million. The remaining $19 million loss is associated with derivative and hedging activity.
As reported, our operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.63. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.10 per diluted share. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.5% for the quarter that was in our annual range of the low end of 8% to 12%. Lastly, let me comment on earnings outlook for 2011. As you heard, we have affirmed our objective for 2011 with an 8% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the Yen. But as we've previously said, given the low interest rate environment, especially in Japan, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the Yen impact. Assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share growth, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. If the Yen averages 80, 85 for the second quarter we would expect operating earnings to be $1.51 to $1.57 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of that 8% growth, and the Yen averages 80 to 85 for the full year, we would expect EPS to be in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. As we mentioned in our press release last night, although we historically announce earnings guidance for the following year at our May analysts meeting, and our 2012 earnings projection is not finalized, we do anticipate that earnings for the next year, 2012, would likely be lower than 2011.
Let me take this opportunity to remind you that our annual analyst meeting will be held in New York City on May 17 and 18. We'll be there to provide you with further updates on our operations in both the U.S. and Japan along with our outlook for this year and the following year, so we invite you to please log in and register to attend. I'm now ready, Diane, to start taking questions. To be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to 1 question, and we'd be happy now to start with the questions."

I think this is a plan that's been put in place over the last several quarters. Our sales and marketing teams are working more tightly together than ever. You could see that through the beginning of the effects with our first ever DRTV, or recruiting campaign, which helped drive up our overall recruiting by 13.5% this past quarter. At the same time, things like our smart launches, even though we used it on a smaller product line like dental, it was a direct effect of conferences that we put in place between the U.S. and Japan several years ago. We began to learn about the positive effects of what they were doing and then marrying up what was happening socially with how to drive product demand. In the U.S. this year, due to smart product launch, we were able to drive demand for dental by using our duck and leveraging it in our existing accounts to really help push specific product lines. We do hope that, that's something that we can continue to expand on in the future that will continue to help drive up our existing accounts sales as well as our veteran agents' sales. We've coined that term, our book of business. We'll be talking more about several of these items at our upcoming FAB meeting. I'm very excited about what we're seeing. I do think that this is the beginning of something positive. How quickly and how big is that, I think it's too early for us to tell. I think at the end of the second quarter I'll be better able to tell you whether the turn is completely in. But I think at this point, I'm very proud of our sales team and Tom Giddens, and our marketing team and Michael Zuna, and all the people who have worked very hard to make this happen. And I do believe that there's no fluke in the numbers here. This is just a great quarter of sales that has been long in place from a turnaround, good momentum by our sales force and a very strong balance between good broker sales and good career agent sales. But in the end, I do believe that probably the overriding factor in all of this has been Aflac Group. The fact is that it is not only been the sales that have happened in the group business but also the momentum that having the group business has brought to both our career channel and our broker channel. So that's a lot to say, but I think there are a lot of good factors happening, all of which are coming together for what was our best quarter in a long period of time."

I believe that's something that will sustain itself for some period of time, especially as we continue to go out and add suggestions to all of our existing accounts offering our group products. We still have not, we've only begun to see the beginning of that. In terms of what's happening for the company and CAIC, I believe it is now giving us the opportunity to go after the entire market. We were primarily focused on the small end of the market in the past, really employers of 100 and under. This gives us the opportunity to go after the larger employers in America and do so with a set of products that they really want as well as going after the brokerage community with a set of products that they desire. And as a result, we're beginning to see some momentum really build in those areas. It's still early but I am very excited."

I wanted to talk a little bit about the implied derisking that maybe you're sending a message on with initial comments about 2012. I guess if you did some quick math and you just assumed some sales and reinvestment at lower rates and some loss on sales, that it seems like for you to have a 1 point impact on EPS growth, it would require probably portfolio derisking of related to maybe a couple billion dollars of holdings.

Really, Ed, it takes awhile for the cumulative effect of derisking to work its way through earnings. And over the last couple of years, we've had a substantial amount of derisking in addition to what we had in the first quarter. I think we've had about $1.6-or-so billion in realized losses over the last couple of years. We had another $450 million or so this quarter. We're going to have some more in all likelihood. And the numbers you guys have are not unreasonable there. But it's a cumulative effect of low interest rates and the fact that it takes say, 12 to 18 months to get the effects all the way through the financial results that lead us to be thoughtful about how we're going to project earnings. In addition, I'll say when we derisk -- there are several ways to derisk, some of which affect P&L more than others. Clearly, if you decide to sell a security that you believe you don't want to hold anymore and you take a realized loss, you've got a lower amount of funds to invest and then you've got decisions about whether to invest those funds in dollars or yen, and then what categories of yen assets you might be able to acquire. On the other hand, you might take an impairment and derisk just by reducing equity and the like, but not sell if you thought really the credit characteristics of the security were such that you didn't need to sell it. And then when you deal with concentrations, you're probably going to sell positions and you have to positions in concentration to reduce your concentration of those type securities. So we haven't fully concluded on exactly what steps we're going to take and there's just a level of uncertainty. But we think the net result is going to be a modest slowdown in earnings growth for some period to come. Ken, do you want to comment further on that, or you think that's enough?"

And we plan on telling you at the FAB meeting. We normally don't cover what sales numbers are for a month but we're going to give you April numbers when we got them. But I don't think March reflects what really happened, maybe the last week did a little bit, but it's hard to tell. And so at this point, we don't want to go out and make some statement then all of a sudden the next couple of weeks we see a difference. And as Toru talked about, pretty much everything is kind of getting back to normal now. And of course the area that was directly hit, it will be quite a time but that accounted for 5% of our sales. So that will kind of give you an idea of what to look at. So what I've tried to kind of analyze in my mind is in terms of these numbers, if you say that okay, sales in the first quarter were basically where we thought they would be. Because remember, we expected a good first quarter, a little bit better than what we thought, but we expect sales to be flat to down in the fourth quarter because of the tough sales comparison. So if you go back and say okay the first quarter, that area that was affected was 5% of our sales then say the second quarter, the number 0 and the third quarter is 1/2 and the fourth quarter is 1/2 then that means that our overall sales have been hurt by 2.5% over what our original projections are. And then say Tokyo was hurt for a short period of time but outside Tokyo nothing else was really that affected then we're actually increasing our sales objective in that the 2% to 5% still we think we can make yet down 2% to up 3% or 5% swing is actually a higher number because we got to make up the difference of what happened due to the tsunami."

And we had said that the 100 to 150 basis points -- quite frankly we were surprised but pleased about the level of production of child endowment and WAYS. I think they were somewhat above expectations. And as I previously discussed with the community, the investment community, starting last September, the mini FAB and continuing on in the fourth quarter discussions, child endowment and WAYS are going to slow down the improvement or the decline in the benefit ratio. We're still getting the same kind of decline in the cancer product from reduction in number of days in the hospital, though as I've told you that's moderating some. Once you get the numbers down to days in the hospital of around 20 to 22, you don't have as much room for improvement as when the average was say, 40 days per stay for a cancer treatment. So I've told you the improvement in the medical or the cancer line is moderating some. The child endowment and WAYS products will have the benefit ratio go up some but they'll have the expense ratio go down some, and they're going to drive revenue more than the medical products do. And at the analyst meeting, I'm going to show you an analysis that basically I'll just disclosed that early, I guess, but basically it tells you that if we write the same number of policies of medical and child endowment and WAYS, we produce somewhat more profit, just modestly more profit by producing the same number of policies with child endowment and WAYS than we do through the medical policies. And that's because they've got a higher average premium, they've got a lower average margin but the profits per policy come out somewhat higher. So there's a bit of a change in the composition of the way profits are produced. But the net effect is that you get about the same, if not slightly more profit by writing a policy of WAYS or child endowment than a policy of medical or cancer."

I'm pleased with Aflac financial and operational performance in the second quarter. I believe we established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings growth and capital strength objectives. 
With half the year behind us, we believe we have substantially completed our proactive investment derisking program from a realized investment loss perspective. I'll give you more details later, but first, I'll begin with a review of our operations in Japan and the United States. 
Aflac Japan generated strong financial results for both the second quarter and the first 6 months of the year. Revenue growth rose 3.7% for both the quarter and the first 6 months. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand, resulting in solid earnings growth for the quarter and for the 6 months. We are particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. New annualized premium sales in yen exceeded our expectations and rose 6.6% to JPY 36.1 billion for the quarter which was a record for the second quarter production. 
For the first half of the year, total new sales rose 9.4%. These results are even more remarkable when you consider that Aflac Japan overcame challenges resulting for the most destructive and devastating natural disaster in Japan's history. With the expanding bank channel in mind, Aflac Japan has developed innovative products that align well where the product needs of banks. Bank sales continued a strong growth trend with sales of JPY 7.6 billion, which represents an increase of 95.6% over the second quarter of 2010. Sales through banks accounted for more than 21% of the total sales for the second quarter. I'll mention how we believe more banks, mega banks, in particular would step up their efforts in selling Aflac products, and that's exactly what we've been seeing. 
At the end of June, Aflac Japan was represented by 367 banks or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. While many banks have agreed to sell our products, turning that agreement from ink on paper into sales does not happen overnight, especially with more than 20,000 branches representing 367 banks. It will take some time to facilitate trading at all these locations. But we're continuing to see sales steadily improving at many of these bank branches, as training continues and the banks expand their offerings of Aflac's products. In many of these banks, sales representatives have gained experience at selling our products, and their confidence level in sales ability has also grown. 
WAYS, which is especially popular with banks, was again a key driver to growth in the second quarter. You will recall that WAYS is a unique hybrid whole life product that can be converted to a fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefits when the policy holder reaches a predetermined date. WAYS has been a phenomenal sales growth story, and in the second quarter generated an increase of 190.7% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Consumers find WAYS attractive because of its guaranteed principle and future flexibility of its benefit options. Banks like to sell this product because of the high premium and attractive commissions. And Aflac's profit margin on WAYS is more than double the profit margin for child endowment. On top of that, the profit margin is significantly enhanced even further when the policy holders take all their premiums upfront through the discounted advanced premium option.  Importantly, 90% of the companies customers at the banks choose this type of payment.  As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales at the innovative and flexible products to grow significantly in 2011. 
With respect to child endowment product, as we expected, sales declined posting a decrease of 1.4% for the quarter. Furthermore, we have already seen sales of child endowment decline so far in July, and we expect sales of child endowment to continue to decline significantly for the remainder of the year. First and foremost, as we told you, we are shifting our focus from selling child endowment towards selling WAYS and our new cancer product, DAYS. 
Second, adding sole to child endowment product for 2 years now, we already cycle through major first pass at selling our child endowment product to the eligible target of families in young people. This range's remaining growth will primarily come from newborns, bearing in mind that Japan's birthrate is low.  And finally, the government's that initially helped fuel demand for this product is being reevaluated for possible reduction or elimination. As such, we expect child endowment sales to diminish.
The foundation of the product portfolio has been and continues to be our cancer and medical products. Importantly, we maintained our position as the number 1 seller of cancer and medical products in Japan which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. 
Following the March 2011 introduction of DAYS, cancer insurance sales increased 12.4% in the quarter. The enhancements to these new base policy speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatment, as well as our commitment to remaining the number 1 provider of cancer insurance in Japan. Sales of cancer insurance accounted for 24.4% of the total sales.
I don't think when the earthquake and the tsunami struck, followed by the nuclear issue, that anyone would have believed that Aflac Japan sales would be up 6.6% for the second quarter and 9.4% for the first 6 months. This is a remarkable achievement and I'm extremely proud of Aflac Japan. 
As I've told you, following 2 years of strong sales results, the same comparisons get tougher as the year goes on, especially in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, with better-than-expected sales results in the first and second quarter, we are upwardly reviving Aflac sales target to achieve flat to up 5% sales increase. 
Now, let me turn to our U.S. Operations. We are very pleased with Aflac U.S. performance from both a sales and financial perspective. Aflac U.S. generated a 5.9% generated in new annualized premium for the second quarter and a 6.1% sales increase for the first 6 months. These results have benefited greatly from the addition of group products to the Aflac U.S. product portfolio. We are specially encouraged to see that the production from better agents continued to increase. Additionally, we continue to see crossover where Aflac career agents embraced group products. To me, it boils down to giving our customers the choice between group and individual products. When it comes to selling group versus individual products, I told our entire U.S. sales force many times that I'm product neutral. I don't care whether they sell group or individual products. But I do want both products to be offered at the work site to employers with more than 100 workers. That's because we don't offer the group product upfront. You can bet someone else will. I truly believe that if the employer wants group products and Aflac offers of them, they'll choose Aflac over the competition. And that is proving to be true.
As you'll recall from both group and individual policies, we started driving sales earlier this year through specific product pushes called Smart launches. Through this coordinated sales and marketing efforts, we look at the existing accounts, particularly those accounts most likely to need a particular product, within our field force resources strategically and efficiently target these accounts. 
Our first Smart launch was held in the first quarter and focused on promoting dental product. Building on the success of that effort, dental sales increased 44.1% over the second quarter of 2010. Our second Smart launch promotes the critical care recovery product, which was previously called specified health event product. Because the Smart launch begins in the middle of the second quarter, it's too early to quantify its full impact, but we're excited about how our sales is embracing both the product itself and the Smart launch. 
On the distribution side, our strategy, we've said many times before, today's recruits are tomorrow's sales. Field force recruiting to benefit from a targeted national advertising campaign, generating a 10.2% increase recruits for the second quarter and 11.9% for the first half of the year. We believe it proved Aflac U.S. sales not only reflect our intense focus on supporting our field with enhanced products, including group products, but also reflects better resources and training that helps our sales force better approach selling in the current environment. 
We will continue to help our entire distribution network, new and veteran agents, as well as brokers, with ways they can improve their performance, because they are essential part of our strategy and our success. We continue to believe the U.S. is a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind. We also believe the expectations at Aflac U.S. sales growth for 2011 will be flat to up 5% is reasonable. Our sales and recruiting trends are working in our favor, and I feel even better today than I did at the Analyst Meeting in May, and I'm optimistic that these trends will continue. It's clear that the addition of the group product platform and our growing broker initiative only served to enhance our ability to leverage Aflac's brand to reach more customers, large and small, across the United States. 
Now let update you on AFLAC Incorporated results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's financial performance. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.56 for the quarter or 15.6% or $3.19 for the first 6 months. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 7.4% for the quarter and 8% for the first 6 months. Consistent with the company's previous stated proactive investment derisking objectives, net earnings in the second quarter included pretax realized investment losses of $668 million, or $453 million after-tax which is $0.96 per diluted share. 
During the second quarter of 2011, we sold investment securities with an amortized cost of $1.5 billion resulting in a realized pretax loss of $182 million. The most notable sales in the quarter included several transactions that lowered our exposure to Peripheral Eurozone holdings. In addition, the company impaired certain securities resulting in a pretax loss of $528 million. These impairments included exposures to 2 Portuguese banks. As a result of our proactive investment derisking program, AFLAC has significantly reduced peripheral Eurozone, perpetual and financial exposures on an amortized cost basis. As the world stands today, we believe we have substantially completed our proactive investment derisking program from a realized investment loss perspective. And we are comfortable with the current holdings in our below investment grade securities. Our own realized loss position and below investment grades was $470 million at the end of the second quarter, out of $93 billion in investment portfolio. The last time our unrealized loss position in this category was that low was 2008 pre-financial crisis. Let me tell you that if we thought there was a question with the remaining below investment grade holdings, this would have been the quarter to take in the action by either selling or impairing them. 
The strength of our capital position has allowed us to pursue our proactive investment derisking program to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance shareholder value for the long-term. As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a top priority for us. Although we've not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the second quarter, we estimate our RBC ratio will be within the range of 480% to 520% at the end of June. 
Additionally, we estimate that the solvency margin ratio will be between 520% to 535% based on the revised calculation methods for the quarter ending June 30, 2011. In Japan, even with significant proactive investment derisking program in the second quarter, our preliminary solvency margin ratio calculation shows a slight improvement over the solvency margin of 512% for the quarter ending March 31, 2011.  We are comfortable with this level, and absent a significant change in the market such as a sudden spike in interest rates, we anticipated it will improve.  We also believe these ratios, our overall financial condition prove solid support to our A credit rating. 
As you'll recall, 2010 marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Our objective remains to increase the cash dividend generally in line with the earnings growth before the impact of the yen. The board will again evaluate the dividend increase later this year, but I am confident we will extend our consecutive annual dividend increases to 29 years. 
Additionally, you'll recall that we resumed our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2010. We purchased 1 million shares in the second quarter, bringing the total number of shares purchased for the 6 months to 4.1 million shares. We anticipate ending up at the low end of the 6 million to 12 million shares repurchase target in 2011. 
Despite the challenges of the low interest rate environment especially in Japan, we now have 2 good quarters under our belt. Additionally, we believe we've substantially completed our proactive investment derisking program from a realized investment loss perspective. From an operational standpoint, I think we've done a very good job in managing our expenses. But keep in mind as the year progresses we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly on marketing and IT initiatives. 
Taking all those factors into consideration, I want to reaffirm our 2011 objective of growing operating earnings per diluted share at 8%, excluding the impact of the yen. Looking ahead, with this clarity and the year half completed, we expect 2012 earnings per diluted share to increase 2% to 5% on a currency neutral basis. This upward provision to our 2012 earnings objective assumes no additional significant investment losses and no meaningful decline in interest rates. 
Furthermore, once the effects of the proactive investment derisking program and low investment rates have fully integrated into the financial results, we would expect the range of earnings growth in the future years to improve. 
I'm pleased with Aflac's overall results for the quarter and for the 6 months. And I can tell you the global financial challenges we've all seen, especially in the changes in the investment environment, have always served to reenergize my enthusiasm as the CEO of this company. And I wouldn't trade places with any other CEO in the world. 
And now, let me turn the program back to Robin. Robin?"

Beginning with the top line in the interim, revenues were up 3.7% for the quarter, investment income was down 5% for the quarter, but excluding the impact of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar denominated investment income, net investment income declined 0.9% in the quarter. 
The annualized persistency rate excluding annuities was strong for the first half of 2011 at 94.3% compared with 94.0% in 2010. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to total premium to decline slightly to over last year. It was 69.9% in the quarter compared to 70.0% a year ago. The expense ratio for the quarter was 19.2% down from 19.9% a year ago and a pretax margin remained stable at 21.1% in the quarter.  Pretax earnings increased 3.4% for the quarter in yen terms. 
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at a rate of 2.16%, including dollars. The blended rate was 2.67%. 
As part of our strategy to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar denominated purchases totaling $1 billion in the quarter, the total amount purchased through the end of June 2011 was $2.5 billion. The yield on these investments through June 30 was 4.72%. The portfolio yield was 3.51% at the end of June down 5 basis points from the end of March, and 20 basis points lower than a year ago.
Next, I'll turn to Aflac U.S.. Total revenues rose 4.0% for the quarter. The annualized persistency rate for the first half of the year improved significantly at an increase to 75.2% up from 71.1% a year ago. Persistency in U.S. was higher as a result of a return to more normalized rate in 2011 after the decline of persistency in 2010 from the loss of a large account. 
Looking at our operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio to total premiums was 57.0% compared with 57.1% a year ago. The operating expense ratio declined from 31.3% to 31%, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be started later in the year. The profit margin for the quarter was 18.4% compared with 17.7% a year ago. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.72% versus 6.11% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of June was 6.7% down 8 basis points from the first quarter and 28 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. In June, we issued JPY 50 billion in the bond market totaling JPY 50 billion or approximately $625 million. Noninsurance interest expense in the second quarter was $41 million compared with $31 million a year ago, primarily reflecting our debt issuance in the second half of 2010 of $750 million. 
Parent company and Other expenses declined slightly from $16 million to $15 million in the second quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S., both for the second quarter. Pretax margins rose slightly from 19.3% to 19.5%, and the after-tax margin increased slightly from 12.6% to 12.7%. 
On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.6% compared with 34.7% a year ago. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.60 compared with $1.23 in 2010. And realized investment losses were $0.96 a share this year compared with $0.12 in 2010. 
During the quarter, we realized investment losses of $453 million net of tax. $118 million were attributable to the sales of holdings primarily in the various peripheral Eurozone, perpetual and financial securities. $343 million resulted from our impairments primarily in the peripheral zone, perpetual and securities of the financial sector. 
We also had a $27 million net after-tax investment gain associated with foreign exchange impact and primarily passed through the activities. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.56. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.11 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per share increased 7.4% for the quarter. 
Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2011. As we mentioned in our analyst meeting in May, given the continued low interest rate environment, especially in Japan, along with our concentrated efforts to derisk the portfolio, we expect to increase operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen by 8%. Assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. If the yen averages $0.80 to $0.85 for the quarter, we would expect operating earnings to be $1.54 to $1.60 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of 8% growth and the yen averages $0.80 to $0.85 for the full year, we would expect operating EPS to be somewhere in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. 
Now, we will turn our attention to your questions. To be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to 1 question. And if you would first state your name and your company. We'll begin taking questions."

The cash position right now, is the holding company is a good after the recent debt offering. We've got roughly $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion. We have to make the payment on the maturing same around notes of about $400 million in September. So let's anticipate that. And so we've got about $700 million or so with the Life company -- I mean of the holding company. Having gone through the substantial bulk of the derisking process from a realized loss perspective, we're now looking in our tax projections for the remainder of 2011 and doing cash flow planning for 2011 and '12. Let me just say that from a cash perspective, tax is a significant item that we have to look out for and watch. Because the realized losses are deductible for tax purposes in Japan, we get a tax benefit from them, but in the U.S. and the consolidated return, we don't get to take a tax benefit for realized losses unless we have offsetting realized gains. So what happens from a cash perspective is that you reduce your income in the FSA statements in Japan, you get a tax benefit for it. It reduces the normal repatriation that occurs between Japan and the U.S. But in the U.S., we've got to pay the same amount of tax and we would have paid if we didn't have the realized losses. So with a lower foreign tax credit, it means more cash is going out of the U.S. And so we've got a cash management exercise in front of us, and we're running through the numbers as we speak. We'll say that we're doing some developing, some mitigation strategies that we can use to generate capital gains that we can use to offset some of these realized losses that are otherwise not deductible for tax purposes. And as you know in the statutory accounting, a lot of the taxes were handled pretty much on the cash basis. There's some nominal deferred tax credits and the like that you can take advantage of. But we pretty much reached the limit on our admissible deferred tax credits on the statutory. And so we're looking more statutory taxes being incurred on a cash basis. That didn't totally answer your question in terms of numbers, but I don't have the numbers at the moment because we are finalizing the statutory results and running through that tax planning process. But we are very pleased that we think we've got the bulk of the losses behind us. I think it will fair well for us not having to also the strong operating earnings but realize losses for RBC purposes, for solvency margin purposes and the like. And ultimately our cash position will improve even more."

One of the disappointments at the fab meeting was the view that we got from management that derisking and share repurchase were mutually exclusive exercises, at least to some extent. And I guess, if we look at where we are today, you're saying that derisking is substantially done, and also if we update the uncommitted cash flow analysis that you gave us at the fab meeting, the number you came up with then I think was $565 million for this year. But that assumed no refinancing of debt. So now we've got $625 million that's coming in that's not assumed in that calculation. So the uncommitted cash at the holding company just now is around $1.2 billion or twice what you guys had said at fab. So I understand the tax management and everything else, but I also know that there's extraordinary dividend capacity. If you needed to do that, I'm sure you could probably do that. $1.2 billion of uncommitted cash at the holding company at current share price, which happy to say 5% higher than it was yesterday, was 26 million shares. So I was wondering if you can maybe, Kriss, go a little bit more detail on this, because I think this was obviously a point that a lot of people were focused on."

So to me, they're directly linked. And when we were on the fab meeting, we, quite frankly, weren't totally sure what the level of financial loss associated with derisking would be, but we aggressively pursued it, not only after fab but before fab. We did a lot of derisking in the first quarter and we followed it up with more in the second quarter. So now we've got more visibility. And so that outlook for share repurchase is significantly improved. And I'll be able to give you a better update and anticipate a share repurchase activity after we complete this cash management exercise we're going through now trying to project our tax position and our cash position and our statutory earnings for the remainder of 2011, taking into account the realized losses that we incurred this quarter. I can say that from an earnings perspective, we don't need to do a lot of share repurchase in the remainder of 2011 to make our earnings target. And we're somewhat -- you know we're always conservatively biased when we're looking at meeting our earnings estimates and certainly significant levels of share purchase bolster earnings capability. Part of the reason we're raising the guidance for 2012 from 0 to 5 to 2 to 5 was we kind of eliminated some of the murkiness associated with the cloud around how much realized loss we would end up taking as part of derisking and how much share repurchase we were going to be able to do. Put out there an assumption that we might do a share repurchase in 2012. But I think that's off the table now. We'll definitely be able to do some share repurchase if our operating assumptions are met. But whether we're in a position to apply $1 billion or $2 billion to share purchase, we just hadn't determined yet. But those are still pretty high numbers. Because we do still have a fairly uncertain outlook I think as far as weather economic developments. I mean we got to get the stupid debt deal done in the U.S. for 1 thing, and who knows how that's going to affect world markets. But we've assumed that as of this day, and with no materially adverse economic developments, we're going to be in good shape."

We now have 2 data points and 3 and 4 before I begin to make predictions. Am I happy with where we are? Yes, I'm very happy with where we are. If we take the first quarter and you take out the additional day, it drops it from 6 back to 5 and if you take the extra day and add it to the second quarter, it takes it right from 6 back to 7. So I'm very happy, I think the second quarter is better performance for the first quarter in terms of what I think, and I'm hoping to continue to see things move. Again this is only our second big year in group business. We don't know how the fourth quarter is going to pan out. We continue to see positive signs as we move toward. But the fourth quarter from last year is a large number. So I want to see where things go. I think some time in October if not January, I'm going to feel comfortable but it will be a mistake not to say that momentum is extremely high. I've been traveling around the company meeting with our sales associates, they seem extremely optimistic. And I think that what we've done with our product portfolio has put that into place that combined with our product marketing to be very successful going forward. But it's too early to say that the turn is completely in when you got the economic factors where they are. We've dealt in the last few years with the economy being very difficult. I know this morning we got a good report on jobs supposedly, but in reality, we're not seeing jobs as optimistic out there in terms of small businesses as they were 180 days ago. So I want to see what's going to happen. I think our team is executing well with some performance places we can continue to do better. But at the same time, there are economic factors that continue to hang over us and that overhang will dictate how high we can go both the remainder of this year as well as sales in 2012."

I don't have those sales projections directly in front of me. But I believe that there are actual expenses probably somewhat lower for child endowment sales than we had in the projection, partly because Dan and I have been directing Aflac Japan to reduce promotional efforts on child endowment and to increased promotional efforts on both the new cancer product and the WAYS product. And so we're trying to reemphasize the desirability of selling the higher margin products. That's -- it's really the lower child endowment margin that's been driving the benefit ratio up some, and the overall margin preventing the expansion at the same level we've seen in the past. So we think the trends are moving in the right direction relative to selling higher margin products. Let me just leave you at that."

There's a lot of the context, it's not legally evident when you look at our exposure to Spain. It's a similar situation in Italy. I would point out, in Italy, our financial exposure in Italy is extremely low. It's $183 million and that is senior indebtedness, and I don't think anybody is looking at burden sharing for senior debt, particularly in view of the recent releases as a result of the Basel III pronouncements of last week.

We're moving, we're growing and we're seeing positive growth in that. I feel confident that we continue to build those relationships. Relationships on the local level have a long since been like it's done. We brought almost $200 million for several years leading up to a launching of our broker initiatives. The relationships at the regional level are coming on faster. It's just a level of our ability to get in and out of the brokerage offices. And the relationships on a national level have done well in terms of our procurement on the corporate level, and now we're beginning to move them down toward the producer level. So do I feel good about what's going on? I think we're executing a plan, I think we're moving in a right direction, I think we can always continue to find ways operationally improve.

I'm pleased with Aflac's overall financial and operational performance in the second quarter. I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings growth and capital strength objectives. 
With half the year behind us, we believe we have substantially completed our proactive investment de-risking program from a realized investment loss perspective. I'll give you more details later, but first, I'll begin with a review of our operations in Japan and the United States. 
Aflac Japan generated strong financial results for both the second quarter and the first 6 months of the year. Revenue growth rose 3.7% for both the quarter and the first 6 months. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand, resulting in solid earnings growth for the quarter and for the 6 months. We are particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. New annualized premium sales in yen exceeded our expectations and rose 6.6% to JPY 36.1 billion for the quarter, which was a record for the second quarter production. 
For the first half of the year, total new sales rose 9.4%. These results are even more remarkable when you consider that Aflac Japan overcame challenges resulting from the most destructive and devastating natural disaster in Japan's history. With the expanding bank channel in mind, Aflac Japan has developed innovative products that align well with the product needs and banks. Bank sales continued a strong growth trend with sales of JPY 7.6 billion, which represents an increase of 95.6% over the second quarter of 2010. Sales through banks accounted for more than 21% of the total sales for the second quarter. I'll mention how we believe more banks, mega banks, in particular would step up their efforts in selling Aflac products, and that's exactly what we've been seeing. 
At the end of June, Aflac Japan was represented by 367 banks or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. While many banks have agreed to sell our products, turning that agreement from ink on paper into sales does not happen overnight, especially with more than 20,000 branches representing 367 banks. It will take some time to facilitate training in all these locations. But we're continuing to see sales steadily improving at many of these bank branches as training continues and the banks expand their offering of Aflac's products. In many of these banks, sales representatives have gained experience at selling our products, and their confidence level in sales ability has also grown. 
WAYS, which is especially popular with banks, was again a key driver to the growth in the second quarter. You will recall that WAYS in our unique hybrid whole life product that can be converted to a fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefits when the policy holder reaches a predetermined age. WAYS has been a phenomenal sales growth story, and in the second quarter generated an increase of 190.7% compared with the second quarter of 2010. Consumers find WAYS attractive because of its guaranteed principle and future flexibility of its benefit options. Banks like to sell this product because of the high premium and attractive commissions. And Aflac's profit margin on WAYS is more than double the profit margin for child endowment. On top of that, the profit margin is significantly enhanced even further when the policy holders elect to pay all their premiums upfront through the discounted advanced premium option.  Importantly, 90% of the company's customers at the banks choose this type of payment. As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of the innovative and flexible products to grow significantly in 2011. 
With respect to child endowment product, as we expected, sales decline posting a decrease of 1.4% for the quarter. Furthermore, we have already seen sales of child endowment decline so far in July, and we expect sales of child endowment to continue to decline significantly for the remainder of the year. First and foremost, as we told you, we are shifting our focus from selling child endowment towards selling WAYS and our new cancer product, DAYS. 
Second, having sold the child endowment product for 2 years now, we've already cycled through major first pass at selling our child endowment product to the eligible target of families in young people. At this range, the remaining growth will primarily come from newborns, bearing in mind that Japan's birthrate is low. And finally, the government's towns and cities [ph] that initially helped fuel demand for this product is being re-evaluated for possible reduction or elimination. As such, we expect child endowment sales to diminish.
The foundation of the product portfolio has been and continues to be our cancer and medical products. Importantly, we maintained our position as the #1 seller of cancer and medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. 
Following the March 2011 introduction of DAYS, cancer insurance sales increased 12.4% for the quarter. The enhancements to this new base policy speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatments, as well as our commitment to remaining the #1 provider of cancer insurance in Japan. Sales of cancer insurance accounted for 24.4% of the total sales.
I don't think when the earthquake and the tsunami struck, followed by the nuclear issue, that anyone would have believed that Aflac Japan sales would be up 6.6% for the second quarter and 9.4% for the first 6 months. This is a remarkable achievement and I am extremely proud of Aflac Japan. 
As I've told you, following 2 years of strong sales results, the same comparisons get tougher as the year goes on, especially in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, with better-than-expected sales results in the first and second quarter, we are upwardly reviving Aflac sales target to achieve flat to up 5% sales increase. 
Now let me turn to our U.S. Operation. We are very pleased with Aflac U.S. performance from both a sales and a financial perspective. Aflac U.S. generated a 5.9% increase in new annualized premium for the second quarter, and a 6.1% sales increase for the first 6 months. These results have benefited greatly from the addition of group products to the Aflac U.S. product portfolio. We are especially encouraged to see that the production from veteran agents continued to increase. Additionally, we continue to see crossover where Aflac's career agents embraced group products. To me, it boils down to giving our customers the choice between group and individual products. When it comes to selling group versus individual products, I've told our entire U.S. sales force many times that I'm product neutral. I don't care whether they sell group or individual products, but I do want both products to be offered at the work site to employers with more than 100 workers. That's because we don't offer the group product upfront. You can bet someone else will. I truly believe that if the employer wants group products and hears Aflac offers them, they'll choose Aflac over the competition. And that is proving to be true.
As you'll recall from both group and individual policies, we started driving sales earlier this year through specific product pushes called Smart Launches. Through these coordinated sales and marketing efforts, we look at the existing accounts, particularly those accounts most likely that need a particular product, within a line our field force resources strategically and efficiently target these accounts. 
Our first Smart Launch was held in the first quarter and focused on promoting dental product. Building on the success of that effort, dental sales increased 44.1% over the second quarter of 2010. Our second Smart Launch promotes the critical care recovery product, which was previously called a specified health event product. Because this Smart Launch begins in the middle of the second quarter, it's too early to quantify its full impact, but we're excited about how our sales is embracing both the product itself and the Smart Launch. 
On the distribution side, our strategy, we've said many times before that today's recruits are tomorrow's sales. Field force recruiting continues to benefit from a targeted national advertising campaign, generating a 10.2% increase of recruits for the second quarter and 11.9% for the first half of the year. We believe it proved Aflac's U.S. sales, not only reflect our intense focus on supporting our field with enhanced products, including group products, but also reflects better resources and training that helps our sales force better approach selling in the current environment. 
We will continue to help our entire distribution network, new and veteran agents, as well as brokers, with ways they can improve their performance, because they are essential part of our strategy and our success. We continue to believe the U.S. is a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind. We also believe the expectations at Aflac U.S. sales growth for 2011 will be flat to up 5% is reasonable. Our sales and recruiting trends are working in our favor, and I feel even better today than I did at the Analyst Meeting in May, and I'm optimistic that these trends will continue. It's clear that the addition of the group product platform and our growing broker initiative only served to enhance our ability to leverage Aflac's brand to reach more customers, large and small, across the United States. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Inc. results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's financial performance. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.56 for the quarter, or 15.6% or $3.19 for the first 6 months. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 7.4% for the quarter and 8% for the first 6 months. Consistent with the company's previous stated proactive investment de-risking objectives, net earnings in the second quarter included pretax realized investment losses of $668 million, or $453 million after-tax, which is $0.96 per diluted share. 
During the second quarter of 2011, we sold investment securities with an amortized cost of $1.5 billion, resulting in a realized pretax loss of $182 million. The most notable sales in the quarter included several transactions that lowered our exposure to Peripheral Eurozone Holdings (sic) [Securities]. In addition, the company impaired certain securities resulting in a pretax loss of $528 million. These impairments included exposures to 2 Portuguese banks. As a result of our proactive investment de-risking program, AFLAC has significantly reduced Peripheral Eurozone, Perpetual and Financial exposures on an amortized cost basis. As the world stands today, we believe we have substantially completed our proactive investment de-risking program from a realized investment loss perspective and we are comfortable with the current holdings in our below investment grade securities. Our unrealized loss position and below investment grades was $470 million at the end of the second quarter out of $93 billion in investment portfolio. The last time our unrealized loss position in this category was that low, was 2008 pre-financial crisis. Let me tell you that if we thought there was a question with the remaining below investment grade holdings, this would have been the quarter to have taken the action by either selling or impairing them. 
The strength of our capital position has allowed us to pursue our proactive investment de-risking program to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance shareholder value for the long-term. As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a top priority for us. Although we've not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the second quarter, we estimate our RBC ratio will be within the range of 480% to 520% at the end of June. 
Additionally, we estimate that the solvency margin ratio will be between 520% to 535%, based on the revised calculation methods for the quarter ending June 30, 2011. In Japan, even with significant proactive investment de-risking program in the second quarter, our preliminary solvency margin ratio calculation shows a slight improvement over the solvency margin of 512% for the quarter ending March 31, 2011.  We are comfortable with this level, and absent a significant change in the market such as a sudden spike in interest rates, we anticipate it will improve. We also believe these ratios, our overall financial condition prove solid support to our A credit rating. 
As you'll recall, 2010 marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Our objective remains to increase the cash dividend, generally in line with the earnings growth before the impact of the yen. The board will again evaluate the dividend increase later this year, but I am confident we will extend our consecutive annual dividend increases to 29 years. 
Additionally, you'll recall that we resumed our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2010. We purchased 1 million shares in the second quarter, bringing in the total number of shares purchased for the 6 months to 4.1 million shares. We anticipate ending up at the low end of the 6 million to 12 million shares repurchase target in 2011. 
Despite the challenges of the low interest rate environment especially in Japan, we now have 2 good quarters under our belt. Additionally, we believe we've substantially completed our proactive investment de-risking program from a realized investment loss perspective. From an operational standpoint, I think we've done a very good job in managing our expenses. But keep in mind, as the year progresses, we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly on marketing and IT initiatives. 
Taking all those factors into consideration, I want to reaffirm our 2011 objective of growing operating earnings per diluted share at 8%, excluding the impact of the yen. Looking ahead with this clarity and the year half completed, we expect 2012 earnings per diluted share to increase 2% to 5% on a currency neutral basis. This upward revision to our 2012 earning objective assumes no additional significant investment losses and no meaningful decline in interest rates. 
Furthermore, once the effects of the proactive investment de-risking program and low investment rates had fully integrated into the financial results, we would expect the range of earnings growth in the future years to improve. 
I'm pleased with Aflac's overall results for the quarter and for the 6 months. And I can tell you the global financial challenges, we've all seen, especially in the changes in the investment environment, have only served to re-energize my enthusiasm as the CEO of this company. And I wouldn't trade places with any other CEO in the world. 
And now, let me turn the program back to Robin. Robin?"

But excluding the impact of the stronger yen",863,"Thank you, Dan. Let me get through some second quarter numbers starting with Japan. Beginning with the top, in the interim's revenues were up 3.7% for the quarter, investment income was down 5% for the quarter. But excluding the impact of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar denominated investment, net investment income declined 0.9% in the quarter. 
The annualized persistency rate, excluding annuities, was strong for the first half of 2011 at 94.3% compared with 94.0% in 2010. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to total premiums that declined slightly to over last year, it was 69.9% in the quarter compared with 70.0% a year ago. The expense ratio for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 19.9% a year ago and a pretax margin remained stable at 21.1% in the quarter.  Pretax earnings increased 3.4% for the quarter in yen terms. 
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at a rate of 2.16%, including dollars. The blended rate was 2.67%. 
As part of our strategy to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar denominated purchases totaling $1 billion in the quarter, the total amount purchased through the end of June 2011 was $2.5 billion. The yield on these investments through June 30 was 4.72%. The portfolio yield was 3.51% at the end of June, down 5 basis points from the end of March and 20 basis points lower than a year ago.
Next, I'll turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 4.0% for the quarter. The annualized persistency rate for the first half of the year improved significantly in an increase to 75.2%, up from 71.1% a year ago. Persistency in U.S. was higher as a result of a return to a more normalized rate in 2011 after the decline of persistency in 2010 from the loss of a large account. 
Looking at our operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio to total premiums was 57.0% compared with 57.1% a year ago. The operating expense ratio declined from 31.3% to 31%, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be started later in the year. The profit margin for the quarter was 18.4% compared with 17.7% a year ago. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.72% versus 6.11% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of June was 6.7%, down 8 basis points from the first quarter and 28 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. In June, we issued JPY 50 billion in the Samurai bond market, totaling JPY 50 billion or approximately $625 million. Noninsurance interest expense in the second quarter was $41 million compared with $31 million a year ago, primarily reflecting our debt issuance in the second half of 2010 of $750 million. 
Parent Company and other expenses declined slightly from $16 million to $15 million in the second quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S., both for the second quarter. Pretax margins rose slightly from 19.3% to 19.5%, and the after-tax margin increased slightly from 12.6% to 12.7%. 
On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.6% compared with 34.7% a year ago. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.60 compared with $1.23 in 2010. And realized investment losses were $0.96 a share this year compared with $0.12 in 2010. 
During the quarter, we realized investment losses of $453 million net of tax. $118 million were attributable to the sale of our holdings primarily in the various Peripheral Eurozone, Perpetual and Financial Securities. $343 million resulted from our impairments primarily in the Peripheral zone, Perpetual and securities of the financial sector. 
We also had a $27 million net after-tax investment gain associated with foreign exchange impact and primarily passive derivative activities. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.56. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.11 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per share increased 7.4% for the quarter. 
Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2011. As we mentioned in our analyst meeting in May, given the continued low interest rate environment, especially in Japan, along with our concentrated efforts to de-risk the portfolio, we expect to increase operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen by 8%. Assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. If the yen averages $0.80 to $0.85 for the third quarter, we would expect operating earnings to be at $1.54 to $1.60 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of 8% growth and the yen averages $0.80 to $0.85 for the full year, we would expect operating EPS to be somewhere in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. 
Now, we will turn our attention to your questions. To be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to one question. And if you would first state your name and your company. We'll begin taking questions."

And so we've got about $700 million or so with the Life company -- I mean at the holding company. Having gone through the substantial bulk of the de-risking process from a realized loss perspective, we're now looking in our tax projections for the remainder of 2011 and doing cash flow planning for 2011 and '12. Let me just say that from a cash perspective, tax is a significant item that we have to look out for and watch because the realized losses are deductible for tax purposes in Japan, we get a tax benefit from them. But in the U.S., in the consolidated return, we don't get to take a tax benefit for realized losses unless we have offsetting realized gains. So what happens from a cash perspective is that you reduce your income in the FSA statements in Japan, you get a tax benefit for it. It reduces the normal repatriation that occurs between Japan and the U.S. But in the U.S., we've got to pay the same amount of tax, and we would have paid if we didn't have the realized losses. So with a lower foreign tax credit, it means more cash is going out of the U.S. And so we've got a cash management exercise in front of us, and we're running through the numbers as we speak. We'll say that we're doing some developing, some mitigation strategies that we can use to generate capital gains that we can use to offset some of these realized losses that are otherwise not deductible for tax purposes. And as you know, in the statutory accounting, a lot of the taxes were handled pretty much on a cash basis. There are some nominal deferred tax credits and the like that you can take advantage of but we pretty much reached the limit on our admissible deferred tax credits on the statutory. And so we're looking more at statutory taxes being incurred on a cash basis. That didn't totally answer your question in terms of numbers, but I don't have the numbers at the moment because we are finalizing the statutory results and running through the tax planning process. But we are very pleased that we think we've got the bulk of the losses behind us. I think it'll fare well for us not having to also the strong operating earnings but realize losses for RBC purposes, for solvency margin purposes and the like. And ultimately, our cash position will improve even more."

I guess one of the disappointments at the fab meeting, I think, was the view that we got from management, that de-risking and share repurchase were mutually exclusive exercises, at least to some extent. And I guess, if we look at where we are today, you're saying that de-risking is substantially done, and also if we update the uncommitted cash flow analysis that you gave us at the fab meeting, the number you came up with then was, I think, $565 million for this year. But that assumed no refinancing of debt. So now we've got $625 million that's coming in that was not assumed in that calculation. So the uncommitted cash at the holding company just now is around $1.2 billion or twice what you guys had said at fab. So I understand the tax management and everything else, but I also know that there's extraordinary dividend capacity. If you needed to do that, I'm sure you could probably do that. $1.2 billion of uncommitted cash at the holding company at current share price, which happy to say is 5% higher than it was yesterday, is 26 million shares. So I was wondering if you can maybe, Kriss, go in a little bit more detail on this, because I think this was obviously a point that a lot of people were focused on."

So to me, they're directly linked. And when we're on the fab meeting, we, quite frankly, weren't totally sure what the level of financial loss associated with de-risking would be, but we aggressively pursued it, not only after fab but before fab. We did a lot of de-risking in the first quarter and we followed it up with more in the second quarter. So now we've got more visibility. And so that outlook for share repurchase is significantly improved. And I'll be able to give you a better update and on anticipated share repurchase activity after we complete this cash management exercise we're going through now trying to project our tax position and our cash position and our statutory earnings for the remainder of 2011, taking into account the realized losses that we incurred this quarter. I can say that from an earnings perspective, we don't need to do a lot of share repurchase in the remainder of 2011 to make our earnings target. And we're somewhat -- we're always conservatively biased when we're looking at meeting our earnings estimates and certainly significant levels of share repurchase bolster earnings capability. Part of the reason we'd raise the guidance for 2012 from 0 to 5 to 2 to 5 was we kind of eliminated some of the murkiness associated with the cloud around how much realized loss we would end up taking as part of de-risking, and how much share repurchase we were going to be able to do. Put out there in assumption that we might do no share repurchase in 2012. But I think that's off the table now. We'll definitely be able to do some share repurchase if our operating assumptions are met. But whether we're in a position to apply $1 billion or $2 billion to share repurchase, we just hadn't determined yet. But those are still pretty high numbers, because we do still have a fairly uncertain outlook, I think, as far as other economic developments. I mean, we've got to get the stupid debt deal done in the U.S. for one thing, and who knows how that's going to affect world markets. But we've assumed that as of this day, and with no materially adverse economic developments, we're going to be in good shape."

Yes, I'm very happy with where we are.

But it's too early to say that the turn is completely in when you've got the economic factors where they are. We've dealt in the last few years with the economy being very difficult. I know this morning we've got a good report on jobs supposedly, but in reality, we're not seeing jobs as optimistic out there in terms of small businesses as they were 180 days ago. So I want to see what's going to happen. I think our team is executing well with some performance places. We can continue to do better.

It's really the lower child endowment margin that's been driving the benefit ratio up some, and the overall margin preventing the expansion at the same level we've seen in the past.

And basically, they've made a pass at everybody, and now it's only the newborns. And in addition to that, there's a question of whether or not the government will even keep it or certainly reduce it.

Of our government exposures, 70% of those exposures have below investment grade put language. And that is a provision that's unique to the exposures we've negotiated. In our non-government, non-financial exposures in Spain, about 50% of our electric utilities, which is really the major component of our exposure to nongovernment spending exposure, have leveraged and/or interest coverage covenants of our nonutility industrial exposures, thinking about half of them have below investment grade puts on them. There's a lot of the context, it's not legally evident when you look at our exposure to Spain. It's a similar situation in Italy. I would point out, in Italy, our financial exposure in Italy is extremely low. It's $183 million and that is senior indebtedness, and I don't think anybody is looking at burden sharing for senior debt, particularly in view of the recent releases as a result of the Basel III pronouncements of last week. We do have a direct exposure to the government of Italy, which we're comfortable with in our utilities and industrials. Our utilities exposure in Italy of over 70% of those exposures have blown to us in grade put language. And our industrial exposure about 15% have a similar covenant protection to what I just described in Spain. So in the aggregate, it's not enough to just look at what the numbers are, but what the projections are that we have and individual credits that are nongovernment in both countries we're very comfortable with."

We're growing and we're seeing positive growth in that. I feel confident that we continue to build those relationships. Relationships on the local level have a long since been like it's done. We brought almost $200 million for several years, leading up to a launching of our broker initiative. The relationships at the regional level are coming on faster. It's just a level of our ability to get in and out of the brokerage offices.

I'm pleased with Aflac's overall financial and operational performance in the second quarter. I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings growth and capital strength objectives. 
With half the year behind us, we believe we have substantially completed our proactive investment de-risking program from a realized investment loss perspective. I'll give you more details later, but first, I'll begin with a review of our operations in Japan and the United States. 
Aflac Japan generated strong financial results for both the second quarter and the first 6 months of the year. Revenue growth rose 3.7% for both the quarter and the first 6 months. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand, resulting in solid earnings growth for the quarter and for the 6 months. We are particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. New annualized premium sales in yen exceeded our expectations and rose 6.6% to JPY 36.1 billion for the quarter, which was a record for the second quarter production. 
For the first half of the year, total new sales rose 9.4%. These results are even more remarkable when you consider that Aflac Japan overcame challenges resulting from the most destructive and devastating natural disaster in Japan's history. With the expanding bank channel in mind, Aflac Japan has developed innovative products that align well with the product needs of banks. Bank sales continued a strong growth trend with sales of JPY 7.6 billion, which represents an increase of 95.6% over the second quarter of 2010. Sales through banks accounted for more than 21% of the total sales for the second quarter. I'll mention how we believe more banks, mega banks, in particular would step up their efforts in selling Aflac products, and that's exactly what we've been seeing. 
At the end of June, Aflac Japan was represented by 367 banks or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. While many banks have agreed to sell our products, turning that agreement from ink on paper into sales does not happen overnight, especially with more than 20,000 branches representing 367 banks. It will take some time to facilitate training at all these locations. But we're continuing to see sales steadily improving at many of these bank branches as training continues and the banks expand their offering of Aflac's products. In many of these banks, sales representatives have gained experience at selling our products, and their confidence level in sales ability has also grown. 
WAYS, which is especially popular with banks, was again a key driver to the growth in the second quarter. You will recall that WAYS in our unique hybrid whole life product that can be converted to a fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefits when the policy holder reaches a predetermined age. WAYS has been a phenomenal sales growth story, and in the second quarter generated an increase of 190.7% compared with the second quarter of 2010. Consumers find WAYS attractive because of its guaranteed principle and future flexibility of its benefit options. Banks like to sell this product because of the high premium and attractive commissions. And Aflac's profit margin on WAYS is more than double the profit margin for child endowment. On top of that, the profit margin is significantly enhanced even further when the policy holders elect to pay all their premiums upfront through the discounted advanced premium option.  Importantly, 90% of the company's customers at the banks choose this type of payment. As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of the innovative and flexible products to grow significantly in 2011. 
With respect to child endowment product, as we expected, sales decline posting a decrease of 1.4% for the quarter. Furthermore, we have already seen sales of child endowment decline so far in July, and we expect sales of child endowment to continue to decline significantly for the remainder of the year. First and foremost, as we told you, we are shifting our focus from selling child endowment towards selling WAYS and our new cancer product, DAYS. 
Second, having sold the child endowment product for 2 years now, we've already cycled through major first pass at selling our child endowment product to the eligible target of families in young people. At this range [ph], the remaining growth will primarily come from newborns, bearing in mind that Japan's birthrate is low. And finally, the government's towns and cities [ph] that initially helped fuel demand for this product is being re-evaluated for possible reduction or elimination. As such, we expect child endowment sales to diminish.
The foundation of the product portfolio has been and continues to be our cancer and medical products. Importantly, we maintained our position as the #1 seller of cancer and medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. 
Following the March 2011 introduction of DAYS, cancer insurance sales increased 12.4% for the quarter. The enhancements to this new base policy speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatments, as well as our commitment to remaining the #1 provider of cancer insurance in Japan. Sales of cancer insurance accounted for 24.4% of the total sales.
I don't think when the earthquake and the tsunami struck, followed by the nuclear issue, that anyone would have believed Aflac Japan sales would be up 6.6% for the second quarter and 9.4% for the first 6 months. This is a remarkable achievement and I am extremely proud of Aflac Japan. 
As I've told you, following 2 years of strong sales results, the same comparisons get tougher as the year goes on, especially in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, with better-than-expected sales results in the first and second quarter, we are upwardly revising Aflac sales target to achieve flat to up 5% sales increase. 
Now let me turn to our U.S. operation. We are very pleased with Aflac U.S. performance from both a sales and a financial perspective. Aflac U.S. generated a 5.9% increase in new annualized premium for the second quarter, and a 6.1% sales increase for the first 6 months. These results have benefited greatly from the addition of group products to the Aflac U.S. product portfolio. We are especially encouraged to see that the production from veteran agents continued to increase. Additionally, we continue to see crossover where Aflac's career agents embraced group products. To me, it boils down to giving our customers the choice between group and individual products. When it comes to selling group versus individual products, I've told our entire U.S. sales force many times that I'm product neutral. I don't care whether they sell group or individual products, but I do want both products to be offered at the work site to employers with more than 100 workers. That's because we don't offer the group product upfront, you can bet someone else will. I truly believe that if the employer wants group products and hears Aflac offers them, they'll choose Aflac over the competition. And that is proving to be true.
As you'll recall from both group and individual policies, we started driving sales earlier this year through specific product pushes called Smart Launches. Through these coordinated sales and marketing efforts, we look at the existing accounts, particularly those accounts most likely that need a particular product. We then align our field force resources strategically and efficiently target these accounts. 
Our first Smart Launch was held in the first quarter and focused on promoting dental product. Building on the success of that effort, dental sales increased 44.1% over the second quarter of 2010. Our second Smart Launch promotes the critical care recovery product, which was previously called a specified health event product. Because this Smart Launch begins in the middle of the second quarter, it's too early to quantify its full impact, but we're excited about how our sales is embracing both the product itself and the Smart Launch. 
On the distribution side, our strategy, we've said many times before that today's recruits are tomorrow's sales. Field force recruiting continues to benefit from a targeted national advertising campaign, generating a 10.2% increase of recruits for the second quarter and 11.9% for the first half of the year. We believe improved Aflac's U.S. sales, not only reflect our intense focus on supporting our field with enhanced products, including group products, but also reflects better resources and training that helps our sales force better approach selling in the current environment. 
We will continue to help our entire distribution network, new and veteran agents, as well as brokers, with ways they can improve their performance, because they are essential part of our strategy and our success. We continue to believe the U.S. is a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind. We also believe the expectations at Aflac U.S. sales growth for 2011 will be flat to up 5% is reasonable. Our sales and recruiting trends are working in our favor, and I feel even better today than I did at the Analyst Meeting in May, and I'm optimistic that these trends will continue. It's clear that the addition of the group product platform and our growing broker initiative only served to enhance our ability to leverage Aflac's brand to reach more customers, large and small, across the United States. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Inc. results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's financial performance. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.56 for the quarter, or 15.6% or $3.19 for the first 6 months. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 7.4% for the quarter and 8% for the first 6 months. Consistent with the company's previous stated proactive investment de-risking objectives, net earnings in the second quarter included pretax realized investment losses of $668 million, or $453 million after-tax, which is $0.96 per diluted share. 
During the second quarter of 2011, we sold investment securities with an amortized cost of $1.5 billion, resulting in a realized pretax loss of $182 million. The most notable sales in the quarter included several transactions that lowered our exposure to Peripheral Eurozone Holdings (sic) [Securities]. In addition, the company impaired certain securities resulting in a pretax loss of $528 million. These impairments included exposures to 2 Portuguese banks. As a result of our proactive investment de-risking program, Aflac has significantly reduced Peripheral Eurozone, Perpetual and Financial exposures on an amortized cost basis. As the world stands today, we believe we have substantially completed our proactive investment de-risking program from a realized investment loss perspective and we are comfortable with the current holdings in our below investment grade securities. Our unrealized loss position and below investment grades was $470 million at the end of the second quarter out of $93 billion in investment portfolio. The last time our unrealized loss position in this category was that low, was 2008 pre-financial crisis. Let me tell you that if we thought there was a question with the remaining below investment grade holdings, this would have been the quarter to have taken the action by either selling or impairing them. 
The strength of our capital position has allowed us to pursue our proactive investment de-risking program to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance shareholder value for the long term. As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a top priority for us. Although we've not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the second quarter, we estimate our RBC ratio will be within the range of 480% to 520% at the end of June.  
Additionally, we estimate that the solvency margin ratio will be between 520% to 535%, based on the revised calculation methods for the quarter ending June 30, 2011. In Japan, even with significant proactive investment de-risking program in the second quarter, our preliminary solvency margin ratio calculation shows a slight improvement over the solvency margin of 512% for the quarter ending March 31, 2011.  We are comfortable with this level, and absent a significant change in the market such as a sudden spike in interest rates, we anticipate it will improve. We also believe these ratios, our overall financial condition prove solid support to our single A credit rating. 
As you'll recall, 2010 marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Our objective remains to increase the cash dividend, generally in line with the earnings growth before the impact of the yen. The board will again evaluate the dividend increase later this year, but I am confident we will extend our consecutive annual dividend increases to 29 years. 
Additionally, you'll recall that we resumed our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2010. We purchased 1 million shares in the second quarter, bringing in the total number of shares purchased for the 6 months to 4.1 million shares. We anticipate ending up at the low end of the 6 million to 12 million shares repurchase target in 2011. 
Despite the challenges of the low interest rate environment especially in Japan, we now have 2 good quarters under our belt. Additionally, we believe we've substantially completed our proactive investment de-risking program from a realized investment loss perspective. From an operational standpoint, I think we've done a very good job in managing our expenses. But keep in mind, as the year progresses, we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly on marketing and IT initiatives. 
Taking all those factors into consideration, I want to reaffirm our 2011 objective of growing operating earnings per diluted share at 8%, excluding the impact of the yen. Looking ahead with this clarity and the year half completed, we expect 2012 earnings per diluted share to increase 2% to 5% on a currency neutral basis. This upward revision to our 2012 earning objective assumes no additional significant investment losses and no meaningful decline in interest rates. 
Furthermore, once the effects of the proactive investment de-risking program and low investment rates have fully integrated into the financial results, we would expect the range of earnings growth in the future years to improve. 
I'm pleased with Aflac's overall results for the quarter and for the 6 months. And I can tell you the global financial challenges we've all seen, especially in the changes in the investment environment, have only served to re-energize my enthusiasm as the CEO of this company. And I wouldn't trade places with any other CEO in the world. 
And now, let me turn the program back to Robin. Robin?"

Beginning with the top line, in the interim's revenues were up 3.7% for the quarter, investment income was down 5% for the quarter. But excluding the impact of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar denominated investment income, net investment income declined 0.9% in the quarter. 
The annualized persistency rate, excluding annuities, was strong for the first half of 2011 at 94.3% compared with 94.0% in 2010. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to total premiums that declined slightly to over last year, it was 69.9% in the quarter compared with 70.0% a year ago. The expense ratio for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 19.9% a year ago and a pretax margin remained stable at 21.1% in the quarter.  Pretax earnings increased 3.4% for the quarter in yen terms. 
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at a rate of 2.16%, including dollars. The blended rate was 2.67%. 
As part of our strategy to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar denominated purchases totaling $1 billion in the quarter, the total amount purchased through the end of June 2011 was $2.5 billion. The yield on these investments through June 30 was 4.72%. The portfolio yield was 3.51% at the end of June, down 5 basis points from the end of March and 20 basis points lower than a year ago.
Next, I'll turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 4.0% for the quarter. The annualized persistency rate for the first half of the year improved significantly and it increased to 75.2%, up from 71.1% a year ago. Persistency in U.S. was higher as a result of a return to a more normalized rate in 2011 after the decline of persistency in 2010 from the loss of a large account. 
Looking at our operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio to total premiums was 57.0% compared with 57.1% a year ago. The operating expense ratio declined from 31.3% to 31%, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be started later in the year. The profit margin for the quarter was 18.4% compared with 17.7% a year ago. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.72% versus 6.11% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of June was 6.7%, down 8 basis points from the first quarter and 28 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. In June, we issued JPY 50 billion in the Samurai bond market, totaling JPY 50 billion or approximately $625 million. Noninsurance interest expense in the second quarter was $41 million compared with $31 million a year ago, primarily reflecting our debt issuance in the second half of 2010 of $750 million. 
Parent Company and other expenses declined slightly from $16 million to $15 million in the second quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S., both for the second quarter. Pretax margins rose slightly from 19.3% to 19.5%, and the after-tax margin increased slightly from 12.6% to 12.7%. 
On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.6% compared with 34.7% a year ago. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.60 compared with $1.23 in 2010. And realized investment losses were $0.96 a share this year compared with $0.12 in 2010. 
During the quarter, we realized investment losses of $453 million net of tax. $118 million were attributable to the sale of our holdings primarily in the various Peripheral Eurozone, Perpetual and Financial Securities. $343 million resulted from our impairments primarily in the Peripheral zone, Perpetual and securities of the financial sector. 
We also had a $27 million net after-tax investment gain associated with foreign exchange impact and primarily passive derivative activities. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.56. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.11 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per share increased 7.4% for the quarter. 
Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2011. As we mentioned in our Analyst Meeting in May, given the continued low interest rate environment, especially in Japan, along with our concentrated efforts to de-risk the portfolio, we expect to increase operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen by 8%. Assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. If the yen averages $0.80 to $0.85 for the third quarter, we would expect operating earnings to be at $1.54 to $1.60 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of 8% growth and the yen averages $0.80 to $0.85 for the full year, we would expect operating EPS to be somewhere in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. 
Now, we will turn our attention to your questions. To be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to one question. And if you would first state your name and your company. We'll begin taking questions."

You've bumped up the 2012 guidance range a bit and it sounds like that has a lot to do with greater clarity about capital position, the fact that you've done the heavy lifting on the portfolio. So that kind of clarifies the capital position. But there's also been this issue in terms of how you'd be positioned with cash. I'm wondering if you can talk about sort of stat earnings for this year, how you're set up in terms of regular dividend capacity for next year, and maybe what the holding company cash position is post the recent yen debt rate."

The cash position right now at the holding company is good after the recent debt offering. We've got roughly $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion. We have to make the payment on the maturing Samurai notes of about $400 million in September. So let's anticipate that and say we've got about $700 million or so with the Life company -- I mean at the holding company. Having gone through the substantial bulk of the de-risking process from a realized loss perspective, we're now looking at our tax projections for the remainder of 2011 and doing cash flow planning for 2011 and '12. Let me just say that from a cash perspective, tax is a significant item that we have to look out for and watch because the realized losses are deductible for tax purposes in Japan, and we get a tax benefit from them. But in the U.S., in the consolidated return, we don't get to take a tax benefit for realized losses unless we have offsetting realized gains. So what happens from a cash perspective is that you reduce your income in the FSA statements in Japan, you get a tax benefit for it. It reduces the normal repatriation that occurs between Japan and the U.S. But in the U.S., we've got to pay the same amount of tax we would have paid if we didn't have the realized losses. So with a lower foreign tax credit, it means more cash is going out of the U.S. And so we've got a cash management exercise in front of us, and we're running through the numbers as we speak. We'll say that we're doing some -- developing some mitigation strategies that we can use to generate capital gains that we can use to offset some of these realized losses that are otherwise not deductible for tax purposes. And as you know, in the statutory accounting, a lot of the taxes were handled pretty much on a cash basis. There are some nominal deferred tax credits and the like that you can take advantage of but we pretty much reached the limit on our admissible deferred tax credits on the statutory. And so we're looking more at statutory taxes being incurred on a cash basis. That didn't totally answer your question in terms of numbers, but I don't have the numbers at the moment because we are finalizing the statutory results and running through the tax planning process. But we are very pleased that we think we've got the bulk of the losses behind us. I think it'll fare well for us not having to offset the strong operating earnings by realize losses for RBC purposes, for solvency margin purposes and the like. And ultimately, our cash position will improve even more."

I guess one of the disappointments at the fab meeting, I think, was the view that we got from management, that de-risking and share repurchase were mutually exclusive exercises, at least to some extent. And I guess, if we look at where we are today, you're saying that de-risking is substantially done, and also if we update the uncommitted cash flow analysis that you gave us at the fab meeting, the number you came up with then was, I think, $565 million for this year. But that assumed no refinancing of debt. So now we've got $625 million that's coming in that was not assumed in that calculation. So the uncommitted cash at the holding company now is around $1.2 billion or twice what you guys had said at fab. So I understand the tax management and everything else, but I also know that there's extraordinary dividend capacity. If you needed to do that, I'm sure you could probably do that. $1.2 billion of uncommitted cash at the holding company at current share price, which happy to say is 5% higher than it was yesterday, is 26 million shares. So I was wondering if you can maybe, Kriss, go in a little bit more detail on this, because I think this was obviously a point that a lot of people were focused on."

So to me, they're directly linked. And when we were at the fab meeting, we, quite frankly, weren't totally sure what the level of financial loss associated with de-risking would be, but we aggressively pursued it, not only after fab but before fab. We did a lot of de-risking in the first quarter and we followed it up with more in the second quarter. So now we've got more visibility. And so that outlook for share repurchase is significantly improved. And I'll be able to give you a better update, Ed, on anticipated share repurchase activity after we complete this cash management exercise we're going through now trying to project our tax position and our cash position and our statutory earnings for the remainder of 2011, taking into account the realized losses that we incurred this quarter. I can say that from an earnings perspective, we don't need to do a lot of share repurchase in the remainder of 2011 to make our earnings target. And we're somewhat -- we're always conservatively biased when we're looking at meeting our earnings estimates and certainly significant levels of share repurchase bolster earnings capability. Part of the reason we raised the guidance for 2012 from 0 to 5 to 2 to 5 was we kind of eliminated some of the murkiness associated with the cloud around how much realized loss we would end up taking as part of de-risking, and how much share repurchase we were going to be able to do. I put out there in assumption that we might do no share repurchase in 2012. But I think that's off the table now. We'll definitely be able to do some share repurchase if our operating assumptions are met. But whether we're in a position to apply $1 billion or $2 billion to share repurchase, we just hadn't determined yet. But those are still pretty high numbers, because we do still have a fairly uncertain outlook, I think, as far as other economic developments. I mean, we've got to get the stupid debt deal done in the U.S. for one thing, and who knows how that's going to affect world markets. But we've assumed that as of this day, and with no materially adverse economic developments, we're going to be in good shape."

So I want to see what's going to happen. I think our team is executing well with some performance places. We can continue to do better.

If we were offered opportunities to change investments in other areas, we'll evaluate it and see what it offers. We are truly going through a restructuring now, and viewing ourself from a pre-financial crisis to a post-financial crisis of our investments. And everything's on the table of looking at what will be our best strategy going forward to manage this company. And I really believe our operational issues are minor. I think we're running on, especially consider the economies, I think we're doing great operationally. So my biggest issue out there is investments. And we have a board that has an investment committee that is very laser-focused on this. And you're going to see us concentrating and giving more information to keep it as transparent as we can, everything we're doing and how we're doing it going forward."

It's $183 million and that is senior indebtedness, and I don't think anybody is looking at burden sharing for senior debt, particularly in view of the recent releases as a result of the Basel III pronouncements of last week. We do have direct exposure to the government of Italy, which we're comfortable with in our utilities and industrials.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with Aflac's overall financial and operational performance in the third quarter. I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings",2487,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with Aflac's overall financial and operational performance in the third quarter. I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings growth and capital strength objectives. I'll begin this morning with a review of our operations in Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong financial results for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. Revenue growth in yen rose 4.8% for the quarter and 4.1% for the first 9 months. Although investment yields declined on new money, we saw solid earnings growth for the quarter and for the first 9 months. We are particularly pleased with the tremendous sales momentum in the quarter. The new annualized premium sales rose 22.2% to YEN 42.3 billion for the quarter, which significantly exceeded our expectations. Even more impressive, production in the third quarter set all-time quarterly records.
For the first 9 months of the year, total new annualized premium sales rose 13.9%. Third quarter bank channel sales, by far, exceeded our expectations generating YEN 14.5 billion in production. That represents an increase of 146.6% over the third quarter of 2010 and a 90.7% increase over the second quarter of 2011. Bank sales in the third quarter accounted for 34.4% of total sales. We are proud of Aflac Japan's outstanding sales results. This is particularly true following the challenges from the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Keep in mind that for several months after the disaster, Aflac Japan shifted sales and marketing resources that included relocating both people and budget from the nonbank channel to the disaster stricken areas. Some of the negative impact from this natural disaster that held back our traditional sales force was masked by the strong bank sales in the second and third quarter.
Let me remind you how the bank sales progressed. As I mentioned, we believe that more banks would step up their effort in selling Aflac products once other banks experienced success and that's exactly what happened. While Shenkan and regional banks were early adapters in terms of selling our products, we've seen new annualized premium dramatically increase in the megabanks started selling the products. These strong bank sales reflect Aflac Japan's impressive ability to develop relevant products such as WAYS, our unique hybrid whole life product, that appeals to banks and Japanese consumers alike. WAYS has been a primary driver of Aflac Japan's remarkable sales increase. As you are aware, the average premium for our WAYS policies sold through the banks. The primary distributing outlet for the product is about 10x the average premium for the cancer in medical product. That makes WAYS a very strong contributor to Aflac Japan's top line growth that has contributed to the continued rapid growth of bank sales in 2011.
WAYS generated a third quarter sales increase of 362.8% for the same period in 2010 and a 99.3% over the second quarter of 2011. Sales of WAYS accounted for 31.7% of Aflac Japan's total sales in the third quarter. Without the discounted advanced premium option where policyholders pay all their premiums upfront, the profit margin for WAYS is about 14%, which is more than double the profit margin for child endowment. With the discounted advanced premium option, WAYS profit margin is enhance around 18%. It's important to note that 90% of the customers at the bank elect to pay premiums upfront through this payment option.
Sales of cancer insurance were solid, particularly WAYS, the new base cancer product introduced in March, WAYS Plus, which upgrades older cancer policies. In the third quarter, new annualized premium for the cancer insurance rose 8.5%. What's even more telling, however, is the number of cancer policies sold on a standalone basis increased an impressive 32.7%. Clearly, the success of DAYS has been somewhat overshadowed by the lower average premium, which is about 15% less than the older base policy. The premium difference is largely due to the fact that the new policy does not have cash surrender value option.
As our traditional sales force focus on selling the new cancer product, medical sales declined. Despite this decline, the medical category still accounts for 25% -- 20% of our total sales. Importantly, we maintained our position as the number 1 seller of cancer and medical products in Japan. That affirms Aflac's reputation as a strong product innovator and trusted brand. The solid platform we've established with these 2 pillar products has allowed us to leverage our competitive advantages, such as branding and administrative efficiencies. As anticipated, third quarter sales for child endowment product continued to decline for the second consecutive quarter, posting a decrease of 8% in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, we expect child endowment sales to continue declining as the distribution channels focus on selling WAYS and our new cancer product, DAYS. Also keep in mind that we're selling the child endowment product for more than 2 years so we've already cycled through the first major pass at selling this product is the most eligible targeted marketed families with young children.
As we look to the remainder of the year, if sales in the fourth quarter are flat to the fourth quarter of 2010, our expectation would be that sales would increase 10.1% for the year and I'm confident we will achieve that or better.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. We are very pleased with Aflac's U.S. performance from both a financial and a sales perspective. Revenues rose 4% for the quarter and 3.7% for the first 9 months. Persistency continued to be strong. While earnings growth was down slightly for the quarter, earnings for the 9 months grew 2.7%, which was in line with our expectations. Aflac U.S. generated a 5% increase in new annualized premium sales for the quarter and a 5.7% increase for the first 9 months. These results had benefited significantly from the addition of group products to Aflac U.S. product portfolio. In fact, group product sales have exceeded our expectations for both the third quarter and the year. Our sales and marketing areas, which are more closely aligned than ever, have synchronized their efforts by creating strategies that continue to benefit our sales results. You'll recall that in January we rolled out Smart Launch, which is a coordinated sales and marketing effort. These campaigns, we analyze our existing accounts to determine which accounts are most likely to need a particular product. We then align our field force resources to strategically and effectively target these accounts with that product or products.
Following the success of the first quarter launch of our dental product, we rolled out the Smart Launch to promote critical care and recovery product mid second quarter. As a result, sales of the critical care and recovery were up 11.9% in the third quarter. We will maintain this successful initiative to promote more products.
On the distribution side of the strategy, field force recruiting continued to benefit from targeted national advertising campaign, generating a 10.4% increase in recruits for the third quarter. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit recruiting gains, generating a 11.4% increase for the first 9 months. Also, our distribution strategy has grown through the addition of group product platforms, which has also helped us make inroads into the growing market initiatives with brokers. It's too early to say we turned the corner. However, I believe that given the challenging economic environment, our success in expanding our distribution network and achieving a sales increase of more than 5% for the first 9 months is outstanding for the U.S. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Incorporated results. Overall, we're pleased Aflac's consolidated performance. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% to $1.66 for the quarter, an increase of 15.4% to $4.86 for the first 9 months. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.3% for the quarter and 8.1% for the first 9 months, keeping us in line with the 2011 earnings per share objective of an 8% increase before the impact of the yen. Our better-than-expected results in the quarter benefited from the continued expense management especially in Japan.
Turning to our investment activities. I want to update you on what we've accomplished in the third quarter. As you'll recall, we stated in the second quarter that we believed our proactive investment derisking program is largely behind us from a realized loss perspective. That assume that we live in a static world. However, we obviously operate in a dynamic economic environment, which means we need to be especially vigilant in monitoring our portfolio and this is exactly what we've done and will continue to do. 
Let we remind you how successful we've been in substantially derisking our investment portfolio from January of 2008 and the end of the third quarter. Over this period, we have dramatically cut our holdings in foreign and financial investments in the PIIG countries from 5.9% to 2.4% of the total portfolio. We've also lowered our investments and perpetual securities from 14.7% to 7.4% which is about 1/2. I'd like to point out that none of the perpetual securities we currently own are in the PIIG countries. Additionally, our investment in financial exposures have been meaningfully reduced from 42% to the total of 28% in the portfolio. 
I also want to update you on some of the steps that we've taken to mitigate interest rate risk impacting our solvency margin. First of all, we sold a portion of our JGB Holdings classified as available for sale. We then purchased the same amount of securities and placed these purchase securities as held in maturity. Furthermore, all new money purchased of the JGB's this quarter have been placed in held in maturity category. Recognizing that our economic environment is continually evolving, we are paying particular attention to the investment governance through enhanced risk management and investment policies. We will continue to closely assess the securities we hold and if we determine they are no longer appropriate for the investment portfolio, we'll take action and move them off the balance sheet. 
With both operating segments doing well, I've devoted most of my time this year to the investment area. Our objective is for Aflac to be a world-class investment organization that pays particular attention to the needs of the insurance operations through the effective ALM and capital adequacy management as well as the expectation of shareholders through investment income growth. It goes without saying that this subjective is in the best interest of the policyholders. The changes prompted by the financial crisis has highlighted the need for the enhanced global analysis and state of the art investment systems. In response to this, our priority is to add to the talent of an investment management team and improve the overall investment function. At the financial briefing in May, we told you as far as our investment function goes, everything was on the table. We felt the first thing we needed to do was to hire a Global Chief Investment Officer. Ultimately, out of 100 candidates we screened, we selected Eric Kirsch. Through his 3 decades of industry experience that includes Bankers Trust, Deutsche Asset Management and Global Sites. Eric has proven to be a very strong team builder and leader. I think that having the expertise and presence on the ground in New York is an integral part of Aflac's future investment success. Eric understands the investment risk and the challenges we face and we think he's an excellent addition to the Aflac team. He officially joins Aflac on November 1 and we expect that by the time we will release fourth quarter earnings, he will have evaluated the investment function and be able to expand on Aflac's future global strategy.
Now let me make a few comments about our capital position. As we've communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a top priority for us. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the third quarter, we estimate the RBC will be within the range of 500 to 540 at the end of September. Additionally, we estimate that the solvency margin ratio will be within the range of 555 to 575 based on the revised calculation methods for the quarter ending September 30, 2011. These strong capital ratios demonstrate our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of the policyholders and the bondholders. Our strong capital position has enabled us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders for the 29th consecutive year. I'm very pleased with this action by the Board of Directors, which increases the cash dividend by 10%. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate that is in line or somewhat better than the earnings per share growth. I believe dividends are an important component of the value we provide to investors.
Another way to reward shareholders is through share repurchase programs. In the third quarter of 2011, we purchased 1 million shares bringing the number of shares purchased for the first 9 months to 5.1 million. We anticipate purchasing 6 million shares in 2011. And in 2012, we anticipate our share repurchase activity will increase.
With 3 quarters of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well-positioned for another year of solid financial performance. Our earnings outlook for the year remains unchanged. Our objective is an 8% increase in earnings per share, excluding the impact of the yen. As such, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding the impact of the yen, to increase 7.6%. Our fourth quarter earnings will be impacted by higher expenses, particularly in marketing and IT initiatives following 3 quarters where we've held back on spending, particularly in Japan.
Looking ahead, I want to reiterate our expectation that 2012 operating earnings per diluted share will increase 2% to 5% on the currency neutral basis. We anticipate this 2012 earnings per share objective will establish a new baseline for earnings growth. This 2% to 5% range reflects the integration of investment losses and the low interest rate associated with the proactive investment derisking program on a GAAP basis. 
Remember, we told you we believed our proactive investment derisking program was substantially completed in the second quarter and we continue to believe that today. I am already looking for 2013 and beyond when we expect the rate of earnings growth to improve over 2012. Hopefully, all the major derisking is over. I am very pleased with Aflac's financial and operating results for the quarter in the first 9 months and I can tell you the global financial challenges that we've seen, especially with the changes in the investment environment have only served to energize my enthusiasm as CEO of the company and I still wouldn't trade places with anybody as CEO in the world.

The persistency rate improved in the quarter with",1072,"Thanks, Dan. Let me briefly go through some third quarter numbers starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 4.8% for the quarter. Investment income was up 0.9%. The persistency rate improved in the quarter with annualized rate, excluding annuities, for the first 9 months of 2011 at 94.4% compared with 94.1% a year ago. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio of the total premiums rose slightly over the year, it was 70.0% in the quarter compared to 70.4% a year ago. The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.7%, down from 19.2% in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be started later in the year, including IT and marketing initiatives that Dan alluded to. Reflecting the lower benefit and expense ratios, the pretax profit margin rose slightly from 21.2% to 21.7% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 7.5% in yen terms.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.12%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 2.26%.
The portfolio yield was 3.42% at the end of September, down 9 basis points from the end of June and down 22 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 4.0% for the quarter and the persistency rate improved significantly and was about 76.0% in the quarter. The annualized rate for the 9 months was 75.9%, up from 72.6% a year ago. The increase in persistency in large part reflects a return to a more normalized number following the loss of a large account at the end of 2009, resulting in the lower than usual persistency numbers throughout 2010.
And looking at operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio to total premiums increased over last year. It was 59.1% in the quarter compared to 58.1% a year ago. The higher benefit ratio is largely the result of increased claims in the quarter, reflecting a return to a more normal utilization rate after claims in Q1 and Q2 were unusually low. The operating expense ratio increased slightly going from 30.5% a year ago to 31.1%. IT and other expenses increased slightly during the quarter, in line with our expectations. The profit margin for the quarter was 16.4% compared to 17.7% a year ago. As a result, pretax operating earnings declined 3.8% for the quarter. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.77% versus 5.69% a year ago and the yield on the portfolio at the end of September was 6.72%, down 4 basis points from the second quarter and down 24 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. As you will have read in the press release, we will adopt the new DAC guidelines on January 1, 2012. Based on December 31, 2010, the retrospect of adoption of this accounting standard will result in the estimated after-tax cumulative charge to the company's retained earnings of approximately $500 million to $700 million or 4.5% to 6.3% of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2010. We also estimate the adoption of the standard will result in an immaterial increase in income in '11, '12 and all the preceding years impacted by the retrospect of adoption. These numbers largely reflect the nature of our business with our sales associates being 100% commission-based and approximately 70% of our expenses that we capitalize are commissions. The remaining 30% is associated with administrative costs and of these administrative unit costs, 75% will continue to be capitalized under the new DAC guidelines.
Noninsurance interest expense in the third quarter was $44 million compared to $37 million a year ago. This higher interest expense primarily reflects the impact from our debt issuance of $750 million senior notes 2010 in 3Q 2010 and the Samurai notes that we issued in July of this year. Parent Company and other expenses increased from $11 million to $15 million in the third quarter. Total company operating margins showed a slight increase, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and pretax margins went from 19.4% to 19.6%. After-tax margin improved slightly from 12.7% to 12.8%. On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.5% compared with 34.6% a year ago.
Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.59 compared to $1.46 in 2010. Realized net investment after-tax losses were $0.07 per share this quarter compared to $0.01 share gain in 2010. During the quarter, we realized investment gains of approximately $200 million net of tax from the sale of several securities including the remaining holdings of our Portuguese financial institutions, a portion of our U.S. Treasury holdings that we sold and a part of our swap program with JGBs in which we sold a portion of JGBs that we're classified as available for sale, repurchase these and put them in held to maturity.
We also had $108 million net investment realized losses attributable to impairments of certain debt and perpetual securities. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% to $1.66. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.09 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen impact, operating earnings per share increased 8.3% for the quarter. 
Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2011. As you've heard Dan say, we reaffirmed our objective for 2011 of an 8% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. With that in mind, if operating earnings per share increased 8% for the year and the yen averages 75 to 80 for the remainder of the year, the fourth quarter, we would expect operating EPS to be, for the fourth quarter, $1.45 to $1.52. Now that compares to First Call estimates of $1.55. Remember what Dan said in both the U.S. and Japan, we expect IT expenditures related and also marketing and advertising expenditures to increase substantially in the fourth quarter.
Using the same foreign currency exemption, also, we would expect for the year operator earnings will be $6.30 to $6.37 per diluted share. 
Now we're going to turn to your questions. To be fair to everybody, please remember to limit yourself to 1 question and only 1 follow-up that relates to your initial question. Now we'll be able -- we will be happy to take your 1 question."

So it will largely depend on how the perpetual Tier 1 and upper Tier 2 assets are valued in the market on a go forward basis. There were a couple of the securities, 1 in particular, that we would have impaired under the equity model this quarter, but we did have credit concerns, which is why we took credit impairments for on a GAAP FSA and a stack basis. So I think it's a little bit too early to see how this all plays out. We're all certainly encouraged that there was a deal struck and that they are continuing to work the problem. Fortunately for us, we don't have any direct Greek exposure any longer. Again, we'll just have to monitor it. I don't think it will have any direct impact though on how we take the impairments and what's the credit view change."

But let me kind of say that our current outlook is that we will spend and I think you're getting primarily to share repurchases.

But let me kind of say that our current outlook is that we will spend and I think you're getting primarily to share repurchases. You know, we declared an increase in dividend of about 10% this quarter. That's going to take our dividend expenses paid out apparent to around $600 million a year. Recall, we haven't changed the dividend at all since the financial crisis started. We've increased the dividend every year and share repurchase has been the variable in our utilization of free cash flow. Historically, pre-financial crisis our share repurchase commitment approximated the amount we were able to get out of Japan via profit repatriation and I think that the amount of profit repatriation will continue to be a primary driver of the fund available for share repurchase. Now to some extent, statutory capacity and profit repatriation are highly correlated. Japan does form the substantial percentage of our statutory earnings but there are some things that we are not able to allocate to Japan like a corporate interest expense and shareholder dividends that are funded in large part out of statutory cash flow, not counting profit repatriation. So let me just say that in our minds, we correlate proper repatriation and funds available for share repurchase quite significantly. I was pointing out to Robin just this morning that 2007 we repurchased about $575 million of stock and we basically doubled down in 2008 and almost $1.5 billion when you guys convinced me we had excess capital, late 2007, early 2008. And then the financial crisis hit and everything changed and when we started taking realized losses on investment securities, that impacted FSA, basis earnings and stat earnings and all earnings and we had to cut back on profit repatriation and therefore, we had to cut back on share repurchase and we didn't do any share repurchase in 2009 and not again until the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2010. We have resumed share repurchase in 2011 as you well know and this year we intend that we expect to buy about 6 million shares and spend about $10 million. Next year based on our current best estimates, we anticipate repatriating somewhere around YEN 45 billion, which at today's exchange rate should approximately about $600 million and we would expect to commit that amount to share repurchase. Now say we I want to get away to quoting a number of shares, I'd rather go toward dollar amounts because you know at current exchange rates, so to speak, because the share price has been volatile and I'll let you guys make an estimate of what you think the press we buy is going to be price per share so I'll let you determine the number of shares but guidance as far as share repurchase at say the mid-70s in the yen/dollar exchange rate is going to be around $600 million or better stated, on a yen basis, about YEN 45 billion.
In 2013, we think we can double approximately our profit repatriation to about the YEN 90 billion to YEN 95 billion level. So what that means is that we'll be able to double share repurchase between 2011 and 2012 and double it again in 2013. Right now that's the best guidance I can give you and I thought about trying to get into the details behind all this but Ed, I'd need a 1/2 hour session with flip charts and all that and they won't give it to me right now."

I think the, as I mentioned, the nonbank channels, a lot of the expenses they incurred, because remember 5% of our production came from the affected area.

Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some statements in the teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they're prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. 
Now I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and our operations in Japan and the U.S. I'll then follow-up with a few financial highlights for the quarter in the first 9 months, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dan?"

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with Aflac's overall financial and operational performance in the third quarter. I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings",2499,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with Aflac's overall financial and operational performance in the third quarter. I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings growth and capital strength objectives. I'll begin this morning with a review of our operations in Japan. 
Aflac Japan generated strong financial results for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. Revenue growth in yen rose 4.8% for the quarter and 4.1% for the first 9 months. Although investment yields declined on new money, we saw solid earnings growth for the quarter and for the first 9 months. We are particularly pleased with the tremendous sales momentum in the quarter. The new annualized premium sales rose 22.2% to JPY 42.3 billion for the quarter, which significantly exceeded our expectations. Even more impressive, production in the third quarter set an all-time quarterly records. For the first 9 months of the year, total new annualized premium sales rose 13.9%. 
Third quarter bank channel sales, by far, exceeded our expectations generating JPY 14.5 billion in production. That represents an increase of 146.6% over the third quarter of 2010 and a 90.7% increase over the second quarter of 2011. Bank sales in the third quarter accounted for 34.4% of total sales. We are proud of Aflac Japan's outstanding sales results. This is particularly true following the challenges from the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Keep in mind that for several months after the disaster, Aflac Japan shifted sales and marketing resources that included relocating both people and budget from the nonbank channel to the disaster-stricken areas. Some of the negative impact from this natural disaster that held back our traditional sales force was masked by the strong bank sales in the second and third quarter.
Let me remind you how the bank sales progressed. As I mentioned, we believe that more banks would step up their effort in selling Aflac products once other banks experienced success, and that's exactly what happened. While Shenkan [ph] and regional banks were early adapters in terms of selling our products, we've seen new annualized premium dramatically increase in the mega banks who started selling the products. These strong bank sales reflect Aflac Japan's impressive ability to develop relevant products such as WAYS, our unique hybrid whole-life product, that appeals to banks and Japanese consumers alike. WAYS has been a primary driver of Aflac Japan's remarkable sales increase. As you are aware, the average premium for our WAYS policies sold through the banks, the primary distributor and outlet for the product, is about 10x the average premium for the cancer in medical product. That makes WAYS a very strong contributor to Aflac Japan's top line growth that has contributed to the continued rapid growth of bank sales in 2011.
WAYS generated a third quarter sales increase of 362.8% for the same period in 2010 and a 99.3% over the second quarter of 2011. Sales of WAYS accounted for 31.7% of Aflac Japan's total sales in the third quarter. Without the discounted advanced premium option where policyholders pay all their premiums upfront, the profit margin for WAYS is about 14%, which is more than double the profit margin for child endowment. With the discounted advanced premium option, WAYS profit margin is enhanced around 18%. It's important to note that 90% of the customers at the bank, elect to pay premiums upfront through this payment option.
Sales of cancer insurance were solid, particularly WAYS (sic) [DAYS], the new base cancer product introduced in March, WAYS Plus (sic) [DAYS Plus], which upgrades older cancer policies. In the third quarter, new annualized premium for the cancer insurance rose 8.5%. What's even more telling, however, is the number of cancer policies sold on a stand-alone basis increased an impressive 32.7%. Clearly, the success of DAYS has been somewhat overshadowed by the lower average premium, which is about 15% less than the older base policy. The premium difference is largely due to the fact that the new policy does not have cash surrender value option. 
As our traditional sales force focus on selling the new cancer product, medical sales declined. Despite this decline, the medical category still accounts for 20% of our total sales. Importantly, we maintained our position as the #1 seller of cancer and medical products in Japan. That affirms Aflac's reputation as a strong product innovator and trusted brand. The solid platform we've established with these 2 pillar products has allowed us to leverage our competitive advantages, such as branding and administrative efficiencies. As anticipated, third quarter sales of child endowment product continued to decline for the second consecutive quarter, posting a decrease of 8% in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, we expect child endowment sales to continue declining as the distribution channels focus on selling WAYS and our new cancer product, DAYS. Also keep in mind that we're selling the child endowment product for more than 2 years so we've already cycled through the first major pass at selling this product to the most eligible targeted, marketed families with young children. As we look to the remainder of the year, if sales in the fourth quarter are flat to the fourth quarter of 2010, our expectation would be that sales would increase 10.1% for the year and I am confident we will achieve that or better.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operation. We are very pleased with Aflac's U.S. performance from both a financial and a sales perspective. Revenues rose 4% for the quarter and 3.7% for the first 9 months. Persistency continued to be strong. While earnings growth was down slightly for the quarter, earnings for the 9 months grew 2.7%, which was in line with our expectations. Aflac U.S. generated a 5% increase in new annualized premium sales for the quarter and a 5.7% increase for the first 9 months. These results had benefited significantly from the addition of group products to Aflac U.S. product portfolio. In fact, group product sales have exceeded our expectations for both the third quarter and the year. 
Our sales and marketing areas, which are more closely aligned than ever, have synchronized their efforts by creating strategies that continue to benefit our sales results. You will recall that in January, we rolled out Smart Launch, which is a coordinated sales and marketing effort. With these campaigns, we analyze our existing accounts to determine which accounts are most likely to need a particular product. We then align our field force resources to strategically and effectively target these accounts with that product or products.  Following the success of the first quarter launch of our dental product, we rolled out the Smart Launch to promote critical care and recovery product mid-second quarter. As a result, sales of the critical care and recovery were up 11.9% in the third quarter. We will maintain this successful initiative to promote more products.
On the distribution side of the strategy, field force recruiting continued to benefit from targeted national advertising campaign, generating a 10.4% increase in recruits for the third quarter. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit recruiting gains, generating a 11.4% increase for the first 9 months. Also, our distribution strategy has grown through the addition of group product platforms, which has also helped us make inroads into the growing market initiatives with brokers. It's too early to say we turned the corner. However, I believe that given the challenging economic environment, our success in expanding our distribution network and achieving a sales increase of more than 5% for the first 9 months is outstanding for the U.S. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Incorporated results. Overall, we're pleased Aflac's consolidated performance. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% to $1.66 for the quarter, an increase of 15.4% to $4.86 for the first 9 months. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.3% for the quarter and 8.1% for the first 9 months, keeping us in line with the 2011 earnings per share objective of an 8% increase before the impact of the yen. Our better-than-expected results in the quarter benefited from the continued expense management especially in Japan.
Turning to our investment activities. I want to update you on what we've accomplished in the third quarter. As you will recall, we've stated in the second quarter that we believed our proactive investment derisking program is largely behind us from a realized loss perspective. That assume that we live in a static world. However, we obviously operate in a dynamic economic environment, which means we need to be especially vigilant in monitoring our portfolio and this is exactly what we've done and will continue to do. 
Let we remind you how successful we've been in substantially derisking our investment portfolio from January of 2008 and the end of the third quarter. Over this period, we have dramatically cut our holdings in foreign and financial investments in the PIIG (sic) [PIIGS] countries from 5.9% to 2.4% of the total portfolio. We've also lowered our investments and perpetual securities from 14.7% to 7.4% which is about 1/2. I'd like to point out that none of the perpetual securities we currently own are in the PIIG (sic) [PIIGS] countries. Additionally, our investment in financial exposures have been meaningfully reduced from 42% to the total of 28% in the portfolio. 
I also want to update you on some of the steps that we've taken to mitigate interest rate risk impacting our solvency margin. First of all, we sold a portion of our JGB Holdings classified as available for sale. We then purchased the same amount of securities and placed these purchase securities as held to maturity. Furthermore, all new money purchased of the JGBs this quarter have been placed in held to maturity category. Recognizing that our economic environment is continually evolving, we are paying particular attention to the investment governance through enhanced risk management and investing policies. We will continue to closely assess the securities we hold and if we determine they are no longer appropriate for the investment portfolio, we'll take action and move them off the balance sheet. 
With both operating segments doing well, I've devoted most of my time this year to the investment area. Our objective is for Aflac to be a world-class investment organization that pays particular attention to the needs of the insurance operations through the effective ALM and capital adequacy management, as well as the expectation of shareholders through investment income growth. It goes without saying that this objective is in the best interest of the policyholders. 
The changes prompted by the financial crisis has highlighted the need for the enhanced global analysis and state-of-the-art investment systems. In response to this, our priority is to add to the talent of an investment management team and improve the overall investment function. At the Financial Analyst Briefing in May, we told you as far as our investment function goes, everything was on the table. We felt the first thing we needed to do was to hire a Global Chief Investment Officer. Ultimately, out of 100 candidates we screened, we selected Eric Kirsch. Through his 3 decades of industry experience that includes Bankers Trust, Deutsche Asset Management and Goldman Sachs. Eric has proven to be a very strong team builder and leader. I think that having the expertise and presence on the ground in New York is an integral part of Aflac's future investment success. Eric understands the investment risk and the challenges we face, and we think he's an excellent addition to the Aflac team. He officially joins Aflac on November 1. And we expect that by the time we release fourth quarter earnings, he will have evaluated the investment function and be able to expand on Aflac's future global strategy.
Now let me make a few comments about our capital position. As we've communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a top priority for us. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the third quarter, we estimate the RBC will be within the range of 500 to 540 at the end of September. Additionally, we estimate that the solvency margin ratio will be within the range of 555 to 575, based on the revised calculation methods for the quarter ending September 30, 2011. These strong capital ratios demonstrate our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of the policyholders and the bondholders. 
Our strong capital position has enabled us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders for the 29th consecutive year. I am very pleased with this action by the Board of Directors, which increases the cash dividend by 10%. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate that is in line or somewhat better than the earnings per share growth. I believe dividends are an important component of the value we provide to investors.
Another way to reward shareholders is through share repurchase program. In the third quarter of 2011, we purchased 1 million shares bringing the number of shares purchased for the first 9 months to 5.1 million. We anticipate purchasing 6 million shares in 2011. And in 2012, we anticipate our share repurchase activity will increase.
With 3 quarters of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well positioned for another year of solid financial performance. Our earnings outlook for the year remains unchanged. Our objective is an 8% increase in earnings per share, excluding the impact of the yen. As such, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding the impact of the yen, to increase 7.6%. Our fourth quarter earnings will be impacted by higher expenses, particularly in marketing and IT initiatives following 3 quarters where we've held back on the spending, particularly in Japan.
Looking ahead, I want to reiterate our expectation that 2012 operating earnings per diluted share will increase 2% to 5% on the currency neutral basis. We anticipate this 2012 earnings per share objective will establish a new baseline for earnings growth. This 2% to 5% range reflects the integration of investment losses and the low interest rate associated with the proactive investment derisking program on a GAAP basis. 
Remember, we told you we believed our proactive investment derisking program was substantially completed in the second quarter, and we continue to believe that today. I am already looking for 2013 and beyond when we expect the rate of earnings growth to improve over 2012. Hopefully, all the major derisking is over. I am very pleased with Aflac's financial and operating results for the quarter in the first 9 months. And I can tell you the global financial challenges that we've seen, especially with the changes in the investment environment have only served to reenergize my enthusiasm as CEO of the company, and I still wouldn't trade places with anybody as CEO in the world.

Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 4.8% for the quarter. Investment income was up 0.9%. The persistency rate improved in the quarter with the annualized rate, excluding annuities, for the first 9 months of 2011 at 94.4% compared with 94.1% a year ago. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to the total premiums rose slightly over the year, it was 70.0% in the quarter compared to 70.4% a year ago. The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.7% down from 19.2% in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be started later in the year, including IT and marketing initiatives that Dan alluded to. Reflecting the lower benefit and expense ratios, the pretax profit margin rose slightly from 21.2% to 21.7% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 7.5% in yen terms. For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.12%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 2.26%. The portfolio yield was 3.42% at the end of September, down 9 basis points from the end of June and down 22 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 4.0% for the quarter and the persistency rate improved significantly and was about 76.0% in the quarter. The annualized rate for the 9 months was 75.9%, up from 72.6% a year ago. The increase in persistency in large part reflects a return to a more normalized number following the loss of a large account at the end of 2009, resulting in the lower than usual persistency numbers throughout 2010. 
In looking at operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio to total premiums increased over last year. It was 59.1% in the quarter compared to 58.1% a year ago. The higher benefit ratio is largely the result of increased claims in the quarter, reflecting a return to a more normal utilization rate after claims in Q1 and Q2 were unusually low. The operating expense ratio increased slightly going from 30.5% a year ago to 31.1%. IT and other expenses increased slightly during the quarter in line with our expectations. The profit margin for the quarter was 16.4% compared to 17.7% a year ago. As a result, pretax operating earnings declined 3.8% for the quarter. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.77% versus 5.69% a year ago and the yield on the portfolio at the end of September was 6.72%, down 4 basis points from the second quarter and down 24 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. As you will have read in the press release, we will adopt the new DAC guidelines on January 1, 2012. Based on December 31, 2010, the retrospect of adoption of this accounting standard will result in the estimated after-tax cumulative charge to the company's retained earnings of approximately $500 million to $700 million or 4.5% to 6.3% of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2010. We also estimate the adoption of the standard will result in an immaterial increase in income in '11, '12 and all the preceding years impacted by the retrospect of adoption. These numbers largely reflect the nature of our business with our sales associates being 100% commission-based and approximately 70% of our DAC expenses that we capitalize are commissions. The remaining 30% is associated with administrative costs. And of these administrative unit costs, 75% of these will continue to be capitalized under the new DAC guidelines.
Noninsurance interest expense in the third quarter was $44 million compared to $37 million a year ago. This higher interest expense primarily reflects the impact from our debt issuance of $750 million senior notes 2010 in 3Q 2010, and the Samurai notes that we issued in July of this year. Parent Company and other expenses increased from $11 million to $15 million in the third quarter. Total company operating margins showed a slight increase reflecting improved profitability of Aflac Japan, and pretax margins went from 19.4% to 19.6%. After-tax margin improved slightly from 12.7% to 12.8%. On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.5% compared with 34.6% a year ago.
Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.59 compared to $1.46 in 2010. Realized net investment after-tax losses were $0.07 per share this quarter compared to $0.01 share gain in 2010. During the quarter, we realized investment gains of approximately $200 million net of tax from the sale of several securities including the remaining holdings of our Portuguese financial institutions, a portion of our U.S. Treasury holdings that we've sold and a part of our swap program with JGBs in which we sold a portion of JGBs that were classified as available for sale, repurchase these and put them in held to maturity.
We also had $108 million net investment realized losses attributable to impairments of certain debt and perpetual securities. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% to $1.66. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.09 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen impact, operating earnings per share increased 8.3% for the quarter. 
Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2011. As you've heard Dan say, we reaffirmed our objective for 2011 of an 8% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. With that in mind, if operating earnings per share increased 8% for the year and the yen averages 75 to 80 or the remainder of the year, the fourth quarter, we would expect operating EPS to be, for the fourth quarter, $1.45 to $1.52. Now that compares to First Call estimates of $1.55. Remember what Dan said in both the U.S. and Japan, we expect IT expenditures related, and also marketing and advertising expenditures to increase substantially in the fourth quarter. Using the same foreign currency exemption also, we would expect for the year operator earnings will be $6.30 to $6.37 per diluted share. 
Now we're going to turn to your questions. To be fair to everybody, please remember to limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up that relates to your initial question. Now we'll be able -- we will be happy to take your one question."

Just as a reminder, the different impairment treatments for perpetual securities is on a GAAP basis only and it's purely price based. So it will largely depend on how the perpetual Tier 1 and upper Tier 2 assets are valued in the market on a go-forward basis. There were a couple of the securities, one in particular, that we would have impaired under the equity model this quarter, but we did have credit concerns, which is why we took credit impairments on a GAAP, FSA and a stat basis. So I think it's a little bit too early to see how this all plays out. We're all certainly encouraged that there was a deal struck and that they're continuing to work the problem. Fortunately, for us, we don't have any direct grief [ph]  Exposure any longer. But again, we'll just have to monitor it. I don't think it will have any direct impact though on how we take the impairments unless the credit views changed."

Ed, let me just start out with that and I'll try not to make the answer too long. But let me kind of say that our current outlook is that we will spend and -- I think you're getting primarily to share repurchase. As you know, we declared an increase",604,"Okay. Ed, let me just start out with that and I'll try not to make the answer too long. But let me kind of say that our current outlook is that we will spend and -- I think you're getting primarily to share repurchase. As you know, we declared an increase in dividend of about 10% this quarter. That's going to take our dividend expenses paid out of apparent to around $600 million a year. Recall, we haven't changed the dividend at all since the financial crisis started. We've increased the dividend every year and share repurchase has been the variable in our utilization of free cash flow. Historically, pre-financial crisis, our share repurchase commitment approximated the amount we were able to get out of Japan via profit repatriation. And I think that the amount of profit repatriation will continue to be a primary driver of the fund available for share repurchase. Now to some extent, statutory capacity and profit repatriation are highly correlated. Japan does form the substantial percentage of our statutory earnings but there are some things that we are not able to allocate to Japan like corporate interest expense and shareholder dividends that are funded in large part out of statutory cash flow, not counting profit repatriation. So let me just say that in our minds, we correlate proper repatriation and funds available for share repurchase quite significantly. I was pointing out to Robin just this morning that 2007, we repurchased about $575 million of stock and we basically doubled down in 2008 and bought almost $1.5 billion when you guys convinced me we had excess capital, late 2007, early 2008. And then the financial crisis hit and everything changed. And when we started taking realized losses on investment securities, that impacted FSA basis earnings and stat earnings and all earnings. And we had to cut back on profit repatriation and therefore, we had to cut back on share repurchase. And we didn't do any share repurchase in 2009 and not again until the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2010. We have resumed share repurchase in 2011, as you well know. And this year we intend -- that we expect to buy about 6 million shares and spend about $300 million. Next year based on our current best estimates, we anticipate repatriating somewhere around JPY 45 billion, which at today's exchange rate should approximate about $600 million. And we would expect to commit that amount to share repurchase. Now say, I want to get away from quoting a number of shares, I'd rather go toward dollar amounts because at current exchange rate, so to speak, because the share price has been volatile. And I'll let you guys make an estimate of what you think the price we buy is going to be, the price per share, so I'll let you determine the number of shares. But guidance as far as share repurchase at, say, the mid-70s in the yen-dollar exchange rate is going to be around $600 million or better stated, on a yen basis, about JPY 45 billion. In 2013, we think we can double approximately our profit repatriation to about the JPY 90 billion to JPY 95 billion level. So what that means is that we'll be able to double share repurchase between 2011 and 2012, and double it again in 2013. Right now, that's the best guidance I can give you. And I thought about trying to get into the details behind all this but, Ed, I'd need a 1/2 hour session with flip charts and all that, and they won't give it to me right now."

We have seen a tremendous number of new entrants attempting to come into the market, primarily entrants that are attempting to leverage themselves out of major medical or at least open up new air facets of their business as a result of continued pressure on margins with medical loss ratios continuing to go up, as well as the broker market continue to push certain companies to offer those products so that they can raise their total revenue they're taking in.

250178,141818346,179609,"AFLAC Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Aflac Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with Aflac's overall financial and operational performance in the third quarter. I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings",2499,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with Aflac's overall financial and operational performance in the third quarter. I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings growth and capital strength objectives.
I'll begin this morning with a review of our operations in Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong financial results for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. Revenue growth in yen rose 4.8% for the quarter and 4.1% for the first 9 months. Although investment yields declined on new money, we saw solid earnings growth for the quarter and for the first 9 months. We are particularly pleased with the tremendous sales momentum in the quarter. The new annualized premium sales rose 22.2% to JPY 42.3 billion for the quarter, which significantly exceeded our expectations. Even more impressive, production in the third quarter set all-time quarterly records. For the first 9 months of the year, total new annualized premium sales rose 13.9%. 
Third quarter bank channel sales by far exceeded our expectations, generating JPY 14.5 billion in production. That represents an increase of 146.6% over the third quarter of 2010 and a 90.7% increase over the second quarter of 2011. Bank sales in the third quarter accounted for 34.4% of total sales.
We are proud of Aflac Japan's outstanding sales results. This is particularly true following the challenges from the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Keep in mind that for several months after the disaster, Aflac Japan shifted sales and marketing resources. That included relocating both people and budget from the nonbank channel to the disaster-stricken areas. Some of the negative impact from this natural disaster that held back our traditional sales force was masked by the strong bank sales in the second and third quarter.
Let me remind you how the bank sales progressed. As I mentioned, we believe that more banks would step up their effort in selling Aflac products once other banks experienced success, and that's exactly what happened. While shinkin and regional banks were early adapters in terms of selling our products, we've seen new annualized premium dramatically increase in the mega banks who started selling the products.
These strong bank sales reflect Aflac Japan's impressive ability to develop relevant products such as WAYS, our unique hybrid whole-life product, that appeals to banks and Japanese consumers alike. WAYS has been a primary driver of Aflac Japan's remarkable sales increase. As you are aware, the average premium for our WAYS policies sold through the banks, the primary distributor and outlet for the product, is about 10x the average premium for the cancer and medical product. That makes WAYS a very strong contributor to Aflac Japan's top line growth that has contributed to the continued rapid growth of bank sales in 2011.
WAYS generated a third quarter sales increase of 362.8% for the same period in 2010 and a 99.3% over the second quarter of 2011. Sales of WAYS accounted for 31.7% of Aflac Japan's total sales in the third quarter. Without the discounted advanced premium option where policyholders pay all their premiums upfront, the profit margin for WAYS is about 14%, which is more than double the profit margin for child endowment. With the discounted advanced premium option, WAYS profit margin is enhanced around 18%. It's important to note that 90% of the customers at the bank elect to pay premiums upfront through this payment option.
Sales of cancer insurance were solid, particularly WAYS (sic) [DAYS], the new base cancer product introduced in March, WAYS Plus (sic) [DAYS Plus], which upgrades older cancer policies. In the third quarter, new annualized premium for the cancer insurance rose 8.5%. What's even more telling, however, is the number of cancer policies sold on a stand-alone basis increased an impressive 32.7%. Clearly, the success of DAYS has been somewhat overshadowed by the lower average premium, which is about 15% less than the older base policy. The premium difference is largely due to the fact that the new policy does not have cash surrender value option. 
As our traditional sales force focused on selling the new cancer product, medical sales declined. Despite this decline, the medical category still accounts for 25 -- 20% of our total sales. Importantly, we maintained our position as the #1 seller of cancer and medical products in Japan. That affirms Aflac's reputation as a strong product innovator and trusted brand.
The solid platform we've established with these 2 pillar products has allowed us to leverage our competitive advantages, such as branding and administrative efficiencies. As anticipated, third quarter sales of child endowment product continued to decline for the second consecutive quarter, posting a decrease of 8% in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, we expect child endowment sales to continue declining as the distribution channels focus on selling WAYS and our new cancer product, DAYS. Also keep in mind that we're selling the child endowment product for more than 2 years, so we've already cycled through the first major pass at selling this product to the most eligible targeted, marketed families with young children.
As we look to the remainder of the year, if sales in the fourth quarter are flat to the fourth quarter of 2010, our expectation would be that sales would increase 10.1% for the year and I am confident we will achieve that or better.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operation. We are very pleased with Aflac's U.S. performance from both a financial and a sales perspective. Revenues rose 4% for the quarter and 3.7% for the first 9 months. Persistency continued to be strong. While earnings growth was down slightly for the quarter, earnings for the 9 months grew 2.7%, which was in line with our expectations. Aflac U.S. generated a 5% increase in new annualized premium sales for the quarter and a 5.7% increase for the first 9 months. These results had benefited significantly from the addition of group products to Aflac U.S. product portfolio. In fact, group product sales have exceeded our expectations for both the third quarter and the year. 
Our sales and marketing areas, which are more closely aligned than ever, have synchronized their efforts by creating strategies that continue to benefit our sales results. You will recall that in January, we rolled out Smart Launch, which is a coordinated sales and marketing effort. With these campaigns, we analyze our existing accounts to determine which accounts are most likely to need a particular product. We then align our field force resources to strategically and effectively target these accounts with that product or products.
Following the success of the first quarter launch of our dental product, we rolled out the Smart Launch to promote critical care and recovery product mid-second quarter. As a result, sales of the critical care and recovery were up 11.9% in the third quarter. We will maintain this successful initiative to promote more products.
On the distribution side of the strategy, field force recruiting continued to benefit from targeted national advertising campaign, generating a 10.4% increase in recruits for the third quarter. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit recruiting gains, generating an 11.4% increase for the first 9 months. Also, our distribution strategy has grown through the addition of group product platforms, which has also helped us make inroads into the growing our market initiatives with brokers. It's too early to say we turned the corner. However, I believe that given the challenging economic environment, our success in expanding our distribution network and achieving a sales increase of more than 5% for the first 9 months is outstanding for the U.S. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Incorporated results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated performance. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% to $1.66 for the quarter, an increase of 15.4% to $4.86 for the first 9 months. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.3% for the quarter and 8.1% for the first 9 months, keeping us in line with the 2011 earnings per share objective of an 8% increase before the impact of the yen. Our better-than-expected results in the quarter benefited from the continued expense management, especially in Japan.
Turning to our investment activities. I want to update you on what we've accomplished in the third quarter. As you will recall, we stated in the second quarter that we believed our proactive investment de-risking program is largely behind us from a realized loss perspective. That assumed that we live in a static world. However, we obviously operate in a dynamic economic environment, which means we need to be especially vigilant in monitoring our portfolio, and this is exactly what we've done and will continue to do. 
Let me remind you how successful we've been in substantially de-risking our investment portfolio from January of 2008 and the end of the third quarter. Over this period, we have dramatically cut our holdings in foreign and financial investments in the PIIG (sic) [PIIGS] countries from 5.9% to 2.4% of the total portfolio. We've also lowered our investments in perpetual securities from 14.7% to 7.4% which is about half. I'd like to point out that none of the perpetual securities we currently own are in the PIIG (sic) [PIIGS] countries. Additionally, our investment in financial exposures have been meaningfully reduced from 42% to the total of 28% in the portfolio. 
I also want to update you on some of the steps that we've taken to mitigate interest rate risk impacting our solvency margin. First of all, we sold a portion of our JGB holdings classified as available for sale. We then purchased the same amount of securities and placed these purchased securities as held to maturity. Furthermore, all new money purchased of the JGBs this quarter have been placed in held-to-maturity category. Recognizing that our economic environment is continually evolving, we are paying particular attention to the investment governance through enhanced risk management and investing policies. We will continue to closely assess the securities we hold and if we determine they are no longer appropriate for the investment portfolio, we'll take action and move them off the balance sheet. 
With both operating segments doing well, I've devoted most of my time this year to the investment area. Our objective is for Aflac to be a world-class investment organization that pays particular attention to the needs of the insurance operations through the effective ALM and capital adequacy management, as well as the expectation of shareholders through investment income growth. It goes without saying that this objective is in the best interest of the policyholders. 
The changes prompted by the financial crisis has highlighted the need for the enhanced global analysis and state-of-the-art investment systems. In response to this, our priority is to add to the talent of the investment management team and improve the overall investment function. At the Financial Analyst Briefing in May, we told you as far as our investment function goes, everything was on the table.
We felt the first thing we needed to do was to hire a Global Chief Investment Officer. Ultimately, out of 100 candidates we screened, we selected Eric Kirsch. Through his 3 decades of industry experience that includes Bankers Trust, Deutsche Asset Management and Goldman Sachs, Eric has proven to be a very strong team builder and leader. I think that having the expertise and presence on the ground in New York is an integral part of Aflac's future investment success. Eric understands the investment risk and the challenges we face, and we think he's an excellent addition to the Aflac team. He officially joins Aflac on November 1. And we expect that by the time we release fourth quarter earnings, he will have evaluated the investment function and be able to expand on Aflac's future global strategy.
Now let me make a few comments about our capital position. As we've communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a top priority for us. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the third quarter, we estimate the RBC will be within the range of 500 to 540 at the end of September. Additionally, we estimate that the solvency margin ratio will be within the range of 555 to 575, based on the revised calculation methods for the quarter ending September 30, 2011. These strong capital ratios demonstrate our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of the policyholders and the bondholders. 
Our strong capital position has enabled us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders for the 29th consecutive year. I am very pleased with this action by the Board of Directors, which increases the cash dividend by 10%. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate that is in line or somewhat better than the earnings per share growth. I believe dividends are an important component of the value we provide to investors.
Another way to reward shareholders is through share repurchase program. In the third quarter of 2011, we purchased 1 million shares, bringing the number of shares purchased for the first 9 months to 5.1 million. We anticipate purchasing 6 million shares in 2011. And in 2012, we anticipate our share repurchase activity will increase.
With 3 quarters of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well positioned for another year of solid financial performance. Our earnings outlook for the year remains unchanged. Our objective is an 8% increase in earnings per share, excluding the impact of the yen. As such, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding the impact of the yen, to increase 7.6%. Our fourth quarter earnings will be impacted by higher expenses, particularly in marketing and IT initiatives, following 3 quarters where we've held back on the spending, particularly in Japan.
Looking ahead, I want to reiterate our expectation that 2012 operating earnings per diluted share will increase 2% to 5% on the currency neutral basis. We anticipate this 2012 earnings per share objective will establish a new baseline for earnings growth. This 2% to 5% range reflects the integration of investment losses and the low interest rate associated with the proactive investment de-risking program on a GAAP basis. Remember, we told you we believed our proactive investment de-risking program was substantially completed in the second quarter, and we continue to believe that today. I am already looking for 2013 and beyond when we expect the rate of earnings growth to improve over 2012. Hopefully, all the major de-risking is over.
I am very pleased with Aflac's financial and operating results for the quarter in the first 9 months. And I can tell you the global financial challenges that we've seen, especially with the changes in the investment environment, have only served to reenergize my enthusiasm as CEO of the company, and I still wouldn't trade places with anybody as CEO in the world. Robin?"

Let me briefly go through some third quarter numbers starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 4.8% for the quarter. Investment income was up 0.9%. The persistency rate improved in the quarter with",1071,"Thanks, Dan. Let me briefly go through some third quarter numbers starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 4.8% for the quarter. Investment income was up 0.9%. The persistency rate improved in the quarter with the annualized rate, excluding annuities, for the first 9 months of 2011 at 94.4% compared with 94.1% a year ago. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to the total premiums rose slightly over the year. It was 70.0% in the quarter compared to 70.4% a year ago.
The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.7%, down from 19.2% in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be started later in the year, including IT and marketing initiatives that Dan alluded to. Reflecting the lower benefit and expense ratios, the pretax profit margin rose slightly from 21.2% to 21.7% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 7.5% in yen terms. For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.12%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 2.26%. The portfolio yield was 3.42% at the end of September, down 9 basis points from the end of June and down 22 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 4.0% for the quarter and the persistency rate improved significantly and was about 76.0% in the quarter. The annualized rate for the 9 months was 75.9%, up from 72.6% a year ago. The increase in persistency in large part reflects a return to a more normalized number following the loss of a large account at the end of 2009, resulting in the lower-than-usual persistency numbers throughout 2010. 
In looking at operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio to total premiums increased over last year. It was 59.1% in the quarter compared to 58.1% a year ago. The higher benefit ratio is largely the result of increased claims in the quarter, reflecting a return to a more normal utilization rate after claims in Q1 and Q2 were unusually low. The operating expense ratio increased slightly, going from 30.5% a year ago to 31.1%. IT and other expenses increased slightly during the quarter in line with our expectations. The profit margin for the quarter was 16.4% compared to 17.7% a year ago. As a result, pretax operating earnings declined 3.8% for the quarter. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.77% versus 5.69% a year ago and the yield on the portfolio at the end of September was 6.72%, down 4 basis points from the second quarter and down 24 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. As you will have read in the press release, we will adopt the new DAC guidelines on January 1, 2012. Based on December 31, 2010, the retrospective adoption of this accounting standard will result in the estimated after-tax cumulative charge to the company's retained earnings of approximately $500 million to $700 million, or 4.5% to 6.3%, of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2010. We also estimate the adoption of the standard will result in an immaterial increase in income in '11, '12 and all the preceding years impacted by the retrospective adoption. These numbers largely reflect the nature of our business with our sales associates being 100% commission-based, and approximately 70% of our DAC expenses that we capitalize are commissions. The remaining 30% is associated with administrative costs. And of these administrative unit costs, 75% of these will continue to be capitalized under the new DAC guidelines.
Noninsurance interest expense in the third quarter was $44 million compared to $37 million a year ago. This higher interest expense primarily reflects the impact from our debt issuance of $750 million senior notes 2010 in 3Q 2010, and the Samurai notes that we issued in July of this year. Parent Company and other expenses increased from $11 million to $15 million in the third quarter.
Total company operating margins showed a slight increase, reflecting improved profitability of Aflac Japan, and pretax margin went from 19.4% to 19.6%. After-tax margin improved slightly from 12.7% to 12.8%. On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.5% compared with 34.6% a year ago. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.59 compared to $1.46 in 2010.
Realized net investment after-tax losses were $0.07 per share this quarter compared to $0.01 share gain in 2010. During the quarter, we realized investment gains of approximately $200 million net of tax from the sale of several securities, including the remaining holdings of our Portuguese financial institutions; a portion of our U.S. Treasury holdings that we've sold; and a part of our swap program with JGBs in which we sold a portion of JGBs that were classified as available for sale, repurchased these and put them in held to maturity. We also had $108 million net investment realized losses attributable to impairments of certain debt and perpetual securities.
As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% to $1.66. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.09 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen impact, operating earnings per share increased 8.3% for the quarter. 
Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2011. As you've heard Dan say, we reaffirmed our objective for 2011 of an 8% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. With that in mind, if operating earnings per share increased 8% for the year and the yen averages 75 to 80 for the remainder of the year, the fourth quarter, we would expect operating EPS to be, for the fourth quarter, $1.45 to $1.52. Now that compares to First Call estimates of $1.55. Remember what Dan said. In both the U.S. and Japan, we expect IT expenditures related, and also marketing and advertising expenditures to increase substantially in the fourth quarter. Using the same foreign currency exemption also, we would expect for the year operating earnings will be $6.30 to $6.37 per diluted share. 
Now we're going to turn to your questions. To be fair to everybody, please remember to limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up that relates to your initial question. Now we'll be able -- we will be happy to take your one question."

So I think it's a little bit too early to see how this all plays out. We're all certainly encouraged that there was a deal struck and that they're continuing to work the problem. Fortunately for us, we don't have any direct Greek exposure any longer. But again, we'll just have to monitor it.

Ed, let me just start out with that and I'll try not to make the answer too long. But let me kind of say that our current outlook is that we will spend and -- I think you're getting primarily to share repurchase. As you know, we declared an increase",606,"Okay. Ed, let me just start out with that and I'll try not to make the answer too long. But let me kind of say that our current outlook is that we will spend and -- I think you're getting primarily to share repurchase. As you know, we declared an increase in dividend of about 10% this quarter. That's going to take our dividend expenses paid out of the parent to around $600 million a year. Recall that we haven't changed the dividend at all since the financial crisis started. We've increased the dividend every year and share repurchase has been the variable in our utilization of free cash flow. Historically, pre-financial crisis, our share repurchase commitment approximated the amount we were able to get out of Japan via profit repatriation. And I think that the amount of profit repatriation will continue to be a primary driver of the funds available for share repurchase. Now to some extent, statutory capacity and profit repatriation are highly correlated. Japan does form the substantial percentage of our statutory earnings, but there are some things that we are not able to allocate to Japan like corporate interest expense and shareholder dividends that are funded in large part out of statutory cash flow, not counting profit repatriation. So let me just say that in our minds, we correlate proper repatriation and funds available for share repurchase quite significantly. I was pointing out to Robin just this morning that 2007, we repurchased about $575 million of stock, and we basically doubled down in 2008 and bought almost $1.5 billion when you guys convinced me we had excess capital, late 2007, early 2008. And then the financial crisis hit and everything changed. And when we started taking realized losses on investment securities, that impacted FSA-basis earnings and stat earnings and all earnings. And we had to cut back on profit repatriation and therefore, we had to cut back on share repurchase. And we didn't do any share repurchase in 2009 and not again until the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2010. We have resumed share repurchase in 2011, as you well know. And this year we intend -- we expect to buy about 6 million shares and spend about $300 million. Next year based on our current best estimates, we anticipate repatriating somewhere around JPY 45 billion, which at today's exchange rate should approximate about $600 million. And we would expect to commit that amount to share repurchase. Now I'll say I want to get away from quoting a number of shares. I'd rather go toward dollar amounts because -- at current exchange rates, so to speak, because the share price has been volatile. And I'll let you guys make an estimate of what you think the price we buy is going to be, the price per share, so I'll let you determine the number of shares. But guidance as far as share repurchase at, say, the mid-70s in the yen-dollar exchange rate is going to be around $600 million or better stated, on a yen basis, about JPY 45 billion. In 2013, we think we can double approximately our profit repatriation to about the JPY 90 billion to JPY 95 billion level. So what that means is that we'll be able to double share repurchase between 2011 and 2012, and double it again in 2013. Right now, that's the best guidance I can give you. And I thought about trying to get into the details behind all this but, Ed, I'd need a 1/2 hour session with flip charts and all that, and they won't give it to me right now."

I think, as I mentioned, the nonbank channels, a lot of the expenses that occurred -- because remember, 5% of our production came from the affected area. We put a lot of additional funds and resources there to help the people, so we had to tighten the budget in other places. We continue to let the money flow at the bank channel.

And also, after the earthquake for some period of time, their business was disrupted through that limitation on the usage of the supply of the electricity and the disrupted traffic lines, et cetera. And so this year -- and also many of the corporate affiliate agents lost their opportunities to do the group marketing, typically done in early April.

We have seen a tremendous number of new entrants attempting to come into the market, primarily entrants that are attempting to leverage themselves out of major medical or at least open up new facets of their business as a result of continued pressure on margins with medical loss ratios continuing to go up, as well as the broker market continue to push certain companies to offer those products so that they can raise their total revenue they're taking in. That said, we don't think it's had an adverse affect on our sales in any way. In fact, we believe that our recent competitive focus, especially on our traditional competitors, has worked very well for us. And we believe that, if anything, the additional companies coming into our industry will help raise the overall penetration of the market rather than creating market share wars. So I feel good about our competitive positioning at this time, and I think that, that has been buoyed to a great extent by our ability to compete in both ends of the market. The acquisition of CAIC, as Dan said in his speech, has exceeded our expectations both for the quarter and for the year, and so Aflac Group is doing very well. We have a minimum group size there of 100. We make rare exceptions to that. So the average case size that we're writing in Columbia is north of 100. We don't actually give out specific numbers, but I'll tell you that we focus on selling accounts that are really 500 and over in that particular market.

Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some statements in the teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they're prospective in nature.

I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings",2499,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with Aflac's overall financial and operational performance in the third quarter. I believe we've established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings growth and capital strength objectives.
I'll begin this morning with a review of our operations in Japan. Aflac Japan generated strong financial results for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. Revenue growth in yen rose 4.8% for the quarter and 4.1% for the first 9 months. Although investment yields declined on new money, we saw solid earnings growth for the quarter and for the first 9 months. We are particularly pleased with the tremendous sales momentum in the quarter. The new annualized premium sales rose 22.2% to JPY 42.3 billion for the quarter, which significantly exceeded our expectations. Even more impressive, production in the third quarter set all-time quarterly records. For the first 9 months of the year, total new annualized premium sales rose 13.9%. 
Third quarter bank channel sales by far exceeded our expectations, generating JPY 14.5 billion in production. That represents an increase of 146.6% over the third quarter of 2010 and a 90.7% increase over the second quarter of 2011. Bank sales in the third quarter accounted for 34.4% of total sales.
We are proud of Aflac Japan's outstanding sales results. This is particularly true following the challenges from the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Keep in mind that for several months after the disaster, Aflac Japan shifted sales and marketing resources. That included relocating both people and budget from the nonbank channel to the disaster-stricken areas. Some of the negative impact from this natural disaster that held back our traditional sales force was masked by the strong bank sales in the second and third quarter.
Let me remind you how the bank sales progressed. As I mentioned, we believe that more banks would step up their effort in selling Aflac products once other banks experienced success, and that's exactly what happened. While shinkin and regional banks were early adapters in terms of selling our products, we've seen new annualized premium dramatically increase in the mega banks who started selling the products.
These strong bank sales reflect Aflac Japan's impressive ability to develop relevant products such as WAYS, our unique hybrid whole-life product, that appeals to banks and Japanese consumers alike. WAYS has been a primary driver of Aflac Japan's remarkable sales increase. As you are aware, the average premium for our WAYS policies sold through the banks, the primary distributor and outlet for the product, is about 10x the average premium for the cancer and medical product. That makes WAYS a very strong contributor to Aflac Japan's top line growth that has contributed to the continued rapid growth of bank sales in 2011.
WAYS generated a third quarter sales increase of 362.8% for the same period in 2010 and a 99.3% over the second quarter of 2011. Sales of WAYS accounted for 31.7% of Aflac Japan's total sales in the third quarter. Without the discounted advanced premium option where policyholders pay all their premiums upfront, the profit margin for WAYS is about 14%, which is more than double the profit margin for child endowment. With the discounted advanced premium option, WAYS profit margin is enhanced around 18%. It's important to note that 90% of the customers at the bank elect to pay premiums upfront through this payment option.
Sales of cancer insurance were solid, particularly WAYS (sic) [DAYS], the new base cancer product introduced in March, WAYS Plus (sic) [DAYS Plus], which upgrades older cancer policies. In the third quarter, new annualized premium for the cancer insurance rose 8.5%. What's even more telling, however, is the number of cancer policies sold on a stand-alone basis increased an impressive 32.7%. Clearly, the success of DAYS has been somewhat overshadowed by the lower average premium, which is about 15% less than the older base policy. The premium difference is largely due to the fact that the new policy does not have cash surrender value option. 
As our traditional sales force focused on selling the new cancer product, medical sales declined. Despite this decline, the medical category still accounts for 25 -- 20% of our total sales. Importantly, we maintained our position as the #1 seller of cancer and medical products in Japan. That affirms Aflac's reputation as a strong product innovator and trusted brand.
The solid platform we've established with these 2 pillar products has allowed us to leverage our competitive advantages, such as branding and administrative efficiencies. As anticipated, third quarter sales of child endowment product continued to decline for the second consecutive quarter, posting a decrease of 8% in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, we expect child endowment sales to continue declining as the distribution channels focus on selling WAYS and our new cancer product, DAYS. Also keep in mind that we're selling the child endowment product for more than 2 years, so we've already cycled through the first major pass at selling this product to the most eligible targeted, marketed families with young children.
As we look to the remainder of the year, if sales in the fourth quarter are flat to the fourth quarter of 2010, our expectation would be that sales would increase 10.1% for the year and I am confident we will achieve that or better.
Now let me turn to the U.S. operation. We are very pleased with Aflac's U.S. performance from both a financial and a sales perspective. Revenues rose 4% for the quarter and 3.7% for the first 9 months. Persistency continued to be strong. While earnings growth was down slightly for the quarter, earnings for the 9 months grew 2.7%, which was in line with our expectations. Aflac U.S. generated a 5% increase in new annualized premium sales for the quarter and a 5.7% increase for the first 9 months. These results had benefited significantly from the addition of group products to Aflac U.S. product portfolio. In fact, group product sales have exceeded our expectations for both the third quarter and the year. 
Our sales and marketing areas, which are more closely aligned than ever, have synchronized their efforts by creating strategies that continue to benefit our sales results. You will recall that in January, we rolled out Smart Launch, which is a coordinated sales and marketing effort. With these campaigns, we analyze our existing accounts to determine which accounts are most likely to need a particular product. We then align our field force resources to strategically and effectively target these accounts with that product or products.
Following the success of the first quarter launch of our dental product, we rolled out the Smart Launch to promote critical care and recovery product mid-second quarter. As a result, sales of the critical care and recovery were up 11.9% in the third quarter. We will maintain this successful initiative to promote more products.
On the distribution side of the strategy, field force recruiting continued to benefit from targeted national advertising campaign, generating a 10.4% increase in recruits for the third quarter. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit recruiting gains, generating an 11.4% increase for the first 9 months. Also, our distribution strategy has grown through the addition of group product platforms, which has also helped us make inroads into the growing our market initiatives with brokers. It's too early to say we turned the corner. However, I believe that given the challenging economic environment, our success in expanding our distribution network and achieving a sales increase of more than 5% for the first 9 months is outstanding for the U.S. 
Now let me update you on Aflac Incorporated results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated performance. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% to $1.66 for the quarter, an increase of 15.4% to $4.86 for the first 9 months. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.3% for the quarter and 8.1% for the first 9 months, keeping us in line with the 2011 earnings per share objective of an 8% increase before the impact of the yen. Our better-than-expected results in the quarter benefited from the continued expense management, especially in Japan.
Turning to our investment activities. I want to update you on what we've accomplished in the third quarter. As you will recall, we stated in the second quarter that we believed our proactive investment de-risking program is largely behind us from a realized loss perspective. That assumed that we live in a static world. However, we obviously operate in a dynamic economic environment, which means we need to be especially vigilant in monitoring our portfolio, and this is exactly what we've done and will continue to do. 
Let me remind you how successful we've been in substantially de-risking our investment portfolio from January of 2008 and the end of the third quarter. Over this period, we have dramatically cut our holdings in foreign and financial investments in the PIIG (sic) [PIIGS] countries from 5.9% to 2.4% of the total portfolio. We've also lowered our investments in perpetual securities from 14.7% to 7.4% which is about half. I'd like to point out that none of the perpetual securities we currently own are in the PIIG (sic) [PIIGS] countries. Additionally, our investment in financial exposures have been meaningfully reduced from 42% to the total of 28% in the portfolio. 
I also want to update you on some of the steps that we've taken to mitigate interest rate risk impacting our solvency margin. First of all, we sold a portion of our JGB holdings classified as available for sale. We then purchased the same amount of securities and placed these purchased securities as held to maturity. Furthermore, all new money purchased of the JGBs this quarter have been placed in held-to-maturity category. Recognizing that our economic environment is continually evolving, we are paying particular attention to the investment governance through enhanced risk management and investing policies. We will continue to closely assess the securities we hold and if we determine they are no longer appropriate for the investment portfolio, we'll take action and move them off the balance sheet. 
With both operating segments doing well, I've devoted most of my time this year to the investment area. Our objective is for Aflac to be a world-class investment organization that pays particular attention to the needs of the insurance operations through the effective ALM and capital adequacy management, as well as the expectation of shareholders through investment income growth. It goes without saying that this objective is in the best interest of the policyholders. 
The changes prompted by the financial crisis has highlighted the need for the enhanced global analysis and state-of-the-art investment systems. In response to this, our priority is to add to the talent of the investment management team and improve the overall investment function. At the Financial Analyst Briefing in May, we told you as far as our investment function goes, everything was on the table.
We felt the first thing we needed to do was to hire a Global Chief Investment Officer. Ultimately, out of 100 candidates we screened, we selected Eric Kirsch. Through his 3 decades of industry experience that includes Bankers Trust, Deutsche Asset Management and Goldman Sachs, Eric has proven to be a very strong team builder and leader. I think that having the expertise and presence on the ground in New York is an integral part of Aflac's future investment success. Eric understands the investment risk and the challenges we face, and we think he's an excellent addition to the Aflac team. He officially joins Aflac on November 1. And we expect that by the time we release fourth quarter earnings, he will have evaluated the investment function and be able to expand on Aflac's future global strategy.
Now let me make a few comments about our capital position. As we've communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a top priority for us. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the third quarter, we estimate the RBC will be within the range of 500 to 540 at the end of September. Additionally, we estimate that the solvency margin ratio will be within the range of 555 to 575, based on the revised calculation methods for the quarter ending September 30, 2011. These strong capital ratios demonstrate our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of the policyholders and the bondholders. 
Our strong capital position has enabled us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders for the 29th consecutive year. I am very pleased with this action by the Board of Directors, which increases the cash dividend by 10%. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate that is in line or somewhat better than the earnings per share growth. I believe dividends are an important component of the value we provide to investors.
Another way to reward shareholders is through share repurchase program. In the third quarter of 2011, we purchased 1 million shares, bringing the number of shares purchased for the first 9 months to 5.1 million. We anticipate purchasing 6 million shares in 2011. And in 2012, we anticipate our share repurchase activity will increase.
With 3 quarters of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well positioned for another year of solid financial performance. Our earnings outlook for the year remains unchanged. Our objective is an 8% increase in earnings per share, excluding the impact of the yen. As such, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding the impact of the yen, to increase 7.6%. Our fourth quarter earnings will be impacted by higher expenses, particularly in marketing and IT initiatives, following 3 quarters where we've held back on the spending, particularly in Japan.
Looking ahead, I want to reiterate our expectation that 2012 operating earnings per diluted share will increase 2% to 5% on the currency neutral basis. We anticipate this 2012 earnings per share objective will establish a new baseline for earnings growth. This 2% to 5% range reflects the integration of investment losses and the low interest rate associated with the proactive investment de-risking program on a GAAP basis. Remember, we told you we believed our proactive investment de-risking program was substantially completed in the second quarter, and we continue to believe that today. I am already looking for 2013 and beyond when we expect the rate of earnings growth to improve over 2012. Hopefully, all the major de-risking is over.
I am very pleased with Aflac's financial and operating results for the quarter in the first 9 months. And I can tell you the global financial challenges that we've seen, especially with the changes in the investment environment, have only served to reenergize my enthusiasm as CEO of the company, and I still wouldn't trade places with anybody as CEO in the world. Robin?"

Let me briefly go through some third quarter numbers starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 4.8% for the quarter. Investment income was up 0.9%. The persistency rate improved in the quarter with",1071,"Thanks, Dan. Let me briefly go through some third quarter numbers starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 4.8% for the quarter. Investment income was up 0.9%. The persistency rate improved in the quarter with the annualized rate, excluding annuities, for the first 9 months of 2011 at 94.4% compared with 94.1% a year ago. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to the total premiums rose slightly over the year. It was 70.0% in the quarter compared to 70.4% a year ago.
The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.7%, down from 19.2% in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be started later in the year, including IT and marketing initiatives that Dan alluded to. Reflecting the lower benefit and expense ratios, the pretax profit margin rose slightly from 21.2% to 21.7% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 7.5% in yen terms. For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.12%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 2.26%. The portfolio yield was 3.42% at the end of September, down 9 basis points from the end of June and down 22 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 4.0% for the quarter and the persistency rate improved significantly and was about 76.0% in the quarter. The annualized rate for the 9 months was 75.9%, up from 72.6% a year ago. The increase in persistency in large part reflects a return to a more normalized number following the loss of a large account at the end of 2009, resulting in the lower-than-usual persistency numbers throughout 2010. 
In looking at operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio to total premiums increased over last year. It was 59.1% in the quarter compared to 58.1% a year ago. The higher benefit ratio is largely the result of increased claims in the quarter, reflecting a return to a more normal utilization rate after claims in Q1 and Q2 were unusually low. The operating expense ratio increased slightly, going from 30.5% a year ago to 31.1%. IT and other expenses increased slightly during the quarter in line with our expectations. The profit margin for the quarter was 16.4% compared to 17.7% a year ago. As a result, pretax operating earnings declined 3.8% for the quarter. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.77% versus 5.69% a year ago and the yield on the portfolio at the end of September was 6.72%, down 4 basis points from the second quarter and down 24 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items in the quarter. As you will have read in the press release, we will adopt the new DAC guidelines on January 1, 2012. Based on December 31, 2010, the retrospective adoption of this accounting standard will result in the estimated after-tax cumulative charge to the company's retained earnings of approximately $500 million to $700 million, or 4.5% to 6.3%, of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2010. We also estimate the adoption of the standard will result in an immaterial increase in income in '11, '12 and all the preceding years impacted by the retrospective adoption. These numbers largely reflect the nature of our business with our sales associates being 100% commission-based, and approximately 70% of our DAC expenses that we capitalize are commissions. The remaining 30% is associated with administrative costs. And of these administrative unit costs, 75% of these will continue to be capitalized under the new DAC guidelines.
Noninsurance interest expense in the third quarter was $44 million compared to $37 million a year ago. This higher interest expense primarily reflects the impact from our debt issuance of $750 million senior notes 2010 in 3Q 2010, and the Samurai notes that we issued in July of this year. Parent Company and other expenses increased from $11 million to $15 million in the third quarter.
Total company operating margins showed a slight increase, reflecting improved profitability of Aflac Japan, and pretax margin went from 19.4% to 19.6%. After-tax margin improved slightly from 12.7% to 12.8%. On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.5% compared with 34.6% a year ago. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.59 compared to $1.46 in 2010.
Realized net investment after-tax losses were $0.07 per share this quarter compared to $0.01 share gain in 2010. During the quarter, we realized investment gains of approximately $200 million net of tax from the sale of several securities, including the remaining holdings of our Portuguese financial institutions; a portion of our U.S. Treasury holdings that we've sold; and a part of our swap program with JGBs in which we sold a portion of JGBs that were classified as available for sale, repurchased these and put them in held to maturity. We also had $108 million net investment realized losses attributable to impairments of certain debt and perpetual securities.
As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% to $1.66. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.09 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen impact, operating earnings per share increased 8.3% for the quarter. 
Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2011. As you've heard Dan say, we reaffirmed our objective for 2011 of an 8% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. With that in mind, if operating earnings per share increased 8% for the year and the yen averages 75 to 80 for the remainder of the year, the fourth quarter, we would expect operating EPS to be, for the fourth quarter, $1.45 to $1.52. Now that compares to First Call estimates of $1.55. Remember what Dan said. In both the U.S. and Japan, we expect IT expenditures related, and also marketing and advertising expenditures to increase substantially in the fourth quarter. Using the same foreign currency exemption also, we would expect for the year operating earnings will be $6.30 to $6.37 per diluted share. 
Now we're going to turn to your questions. To be fair to everybody, please remember to limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up that relates to your initial question. Now we'll be able -- we will be happy to take your one question."

Just as a reminder, the different impairment treatments for perpetual securities is on a GAAP basis only and it's purely price based. So it will largely depend on how the perpetual Tier 1 and upper Tier 2 assets are valued in the market on a go-forward basis. There were a couple of the securities, one in particular, that we would have impaired under the equity model this way -- this quarter, but we did have credit concerns, which is why we took credit impairments for -- on a GAAP, FSA and a stat basis. So I think it's a little bit too early to see how this all plays out. We're all certainly encouraged that there was a deal struck and that they're continuing to work the problem. Fortunately for us, we don't have any direct Greek exposure any longer. But again, we'll just have to monitor it. I don't think it will have any direct impact though on how we take the impairments unless the credit views change."

Ed, let me just start out with that and I'll try not to make the answer too long. But let me kind of say that our current outlook is that we will spend and -- I think you're getting primarily to share repurchase. As you know, we declared an increase",606,"Okay. Ed, let me just start out with that and I'll try not to make the answer too long. But let me kind of say that our current outlook is that we will spend and -- I think you're getting primarily to share repurchase. As you know, we declared an increase in dividend of about 10% this quarter. That's going to take our dividend expenses paid out of the parent to around $600 million a year. Recall that we haven't changed the dividend at all since the financial crisis started. We've increased the dividend every year and share repurchase has been the variable in our utilization of free cash flow. Historically, pre-financial crisis, our share repurchase commitment approximated the amount we were able to get out of Japan via profit repatriation. And I think that the amount of profit repatriation will continue to be a primary driver of the funds available for share repurchase. Now to some extent, statutory capacity and profit repatriation are highly correlated. Japan does form the substantial percentage of our statutory earnings, but there are some things that we are not able to allocate to Japan like corporate interest expense and shareholder dividends that are funded in large part out of statutory cash flow, not counting profit repatriation. So let me just say that in our minds, we correlate proper repatriation and funds available for share repurchase quite significantly. I was pointing out to Robin just this morning that 2007, we repurchased about $575 million of stock, and we basically doubled down in 2008 and bought almost $1.5 billion when you guys convinced me we had excess capital, late 2007, early 2008. And then the financial crisis hit and everything changed. And when we started taking realized losses on investment securities, that impacted FSA-basis earnings and stat earnings and all earnings. And we had to cut back on profit repatriation and therefore, we had to cut back on share repurchase. And we didn't do any share repurchase in 2009 and not again until the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2010. We have resumed share repurchase in 2011, as you well know. And this year we intend -- we expect to buy about 6 million shares and spend about $300 million. Next year based on our current best estimates, we anticipate repatriating somewhere around JPY 45 billion, which at today's exchange rate should approximate about $600 million. And we would expect to commit that amount to share repurchase. Now I'll say I want to get away from quoting a number of shares. I'd rather go toward dollar amounts because -- at current exchange rates, so to speak, because the share price has been volatile. And I'll let you guys make an estimate of what you think the price we buy is going to be, the price per share, so I'll let you determine the number of shares. But guidance as far as share repurchase at, say, the mid-70s in the yen-dollar exchange rate is going to be around $600 million or better stated, on a yen basis, about JPY 45 billion. In 2013, we think we can double approximately our profit repatriation to about the JPY 90 billion to JPY 95 billion level. So what that means is that we'll be able to double share repurchase between 2011 and 2012, and double it again in 2013. Right now, that's the best guidance I can give you. And I thought about trying to get into the details behind all this but, Ed, I'd need a 1/2 hour session with flip charts and all that, and they won't give it to me right now."

And is that just a channel that perhaps run its course? And then the other one, on the individual independents, it seems pretty much every quarter now, the tails are growing at a much slower pace than associates. And I'm not sure what's happening there unless what you're reporting as licensed associates may also include the bank reps. Maybe we can just get some clarification."

The traditional agents, both corporate and -- affiliated corporate and individuals, are not doing very well this year. They're affected to some extent by the earthquake and the tsunami which happened in March this year. As Dan mentioned, 5% of our business came from that affected area. And that -- a major part of that 5% was used to be sold by these traditional agents. That's one reason. And also, after the earthquake for some period of time, their business was disrupted through that limitation on the usage of the supply of the electricity and the disrupted traffic lines, et cetera. And so this year -- and also many of the corporate affiliate agents lost their opportunities to do the group marketing, typically done in early April. So many factors have affected them negatively this year. So if you take out those negative factors, I think their performance this year is not -- is better than it seems to be. So we're trying to reenergize the corporate affiliates as well as the individuals. So hopefully, they can start growing again in the next year and going forward."

We have seen a tremendous number of new entrants attempting to come into the market, primarily entrants that are attempting to leverage themselves out of major medical or at least open up new facets of their business as a result of continued pressure on margins with medical loss ratios continuing to go up, as well as the broker market continue to push certain companies to offer those products so that they can raise their total revenue they're taking in. That said, we don't think it's had an adverse affect on our sales in any way. In fact, we believe that our recent competitive focus, especially on our traditional competitors, has worked very well for us. And we believe that, if anything, the additional companies coming into our industry will help raise the overall penetration of the market rather than creating market share wars. So I feel good about our competitive positioning at this time, and I think that, that has been buoyed to a great extent by our ability to compete in both ends of the market. The acquisition of CAIC, as Dan said in his speech, has exceeded our expectations both for the quarter and for the year, and so Aflac Group is doing very well.
