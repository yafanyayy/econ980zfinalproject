Welcome to the call. I'll be off today with a review of the numbers. Mark Valentine, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will follow me with sales and operational highlights and marketplace",1710,"Thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the call. I'll be off today with a review of the numbers. Mark Valentine, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will follow me with sales and operational highlights and marketplace trends. Mike will be followed by Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, who will discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, is traveling today, but he will be dialing into the call.
Now I will turn to our results. All key measures in Q4 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by nearly $100 million. Our income statement performance was very good with adjusted EPS above our guidance and consensus, revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range and continued strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We again had excellent cash flow performance, with record levels of free cash flow reflective of strong earnings quality.
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q4 was $626 million, which is the second best result in company history. Bookings significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range and were up 26% sequentially and only slightly down from the record level in Q4 '09 that included two large contracts with investor-owned health systems. 
Mike will discuss our bookings in more detail, but performance is strong across the board, including software, managed services and professional services. And during the quarter, we signed two new IT clients in our second RevWorks client. 
Booking margins in Q4 was $530 million or 85% of total bookings. For the full year, bookings revenue was $1.99 billion, up 9% from 2009.
Our total backlog increased 17% year-over-year to $4.94 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.29 billion is 19% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $655 million, up 6% year-over-year.
Revenue in the quarter was $500.2 million, which is up 7% over a very tough comparable in Q4 '09. The revenue composition for Q4 was $164 million in System Sales, $132 million in Support and Maintenance, $195 million in Services and $9 million in Reimbursed Travel. For the year, revenue grew 11% to $1.85 billion.
System Sales revenue is the second highest result in company history and down only 4% from the top System Sales comparable in Q4 '09. System Sales were up 23% sequentially with strong growth across software, software and hardware revenue. For the year, System Sales grew 9%. Services revenue is up 19% compared to Q4 '09 and 16% for the year, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and Maintenance revenue increased 7% over Q4 '09 and 5% for the year.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $432 million. Global revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $68 million. For the full year, Domestic revenue grew 12% to $1.56 billion, and Global revenue grew 5% to $288 million. As a preview to the annual update over this is model that we provided our investment community meeting on March 10, I'd like or revise with total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2010.
Licensed software grew 6% to $268 million, with double-digit growth in the first three quarters and a Q4 result that was the second highest in the company history behind Q4 '09. Technology resale is up 16% to $176 million as growth and device resale and sublicense software offset the decline in traditional hardware resale. 
Subscriptions and transactions increased 7% to $106 million. Professional services revenue was $455 million, which is up 15% and reflects increased implementation activity. Managed services grew 19% to $294 million driven by continued strong demand for our hosting services. Supported maintenance was $517 million, which is up 5%, and Reimbursed Travel was up 7% to $32 million. we'll go into more business model detailed our invest in community meeting coming up.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 81%, which is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Gross margins were impacted this quarter by continued strength and device resale and an increase in third-party services. Going forward, we expect gross margins to remain in the low 80s. We still expect to continue expanding margins at the operating level. For the full year, gross margin was 82.7%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. System Sales margin increased 290 basis point sequentially but were down year-over-year due to higher levels of hardware and lower margins. 
Looking at operating spending, part quarter operating expenses were $295 million before share-based compensation expense of $7 million. Total operating expense was up 2% compared to Q4 '09. For the full year, operating expenses were $1.15 billion, up 6% from 2009. 
Sales in client service expenses were up 8% compared to Q4 '09, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. For the full year, sales in client service expenses were up 9%. 
Our investment in software development was down 6% compared to Q4 '09, reflecting continued leverage of our R&D investment. For the full year, investment in software development was flat. Going forward, we expect our R&D investment in growth but at a rate that is less than our revenue growth rate. G&A expense decreased 14% year-over-year in Q4 and grew 1% for the full year. 
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q4 was 22.1% before share-based compensation expense. This is an all-time high and have 110 basis points compared to Q4 '09, which is also a record. For the full year, operating margins were up 230 basis points to 20.8%. The margin expansion was driven primarily by a combination of increased profitability in our professional services, managed services and support business models, along with ongoing leverage of investments in R&D and SG&A expense for the next few years, we believe we could operating margins 100 to 200 basis points per year through ongoing efficiencies across our business models and expense leverage. 
Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $70.6 million or $0.82 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.3 million or $0.05 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $75 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.87, which is up 17% compared to Q4 '09. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $252.8 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.96. 
Our tax rate in Q4 was 32.8%, which benefited from the extension of the R&D tax credit. For the full year, our tax rate was 34.7%. note that this applies to annual tax rate to normalize Q4 tax expense result reduced results by $0.02.
Now to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $835 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $770 million in Q3. Total cash and investments include $571 million of cash and short-term investments and $264 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities over one year. Our total debt is $93 million, which is down from $119 million last quarter due to payments made during the quarter. Total accounts receivable ended the quarter at $477 million, which is up $14 million from Q3. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables were $140 million and represent 29% of total receivables compared to 30% in Q3.
Cash collections were $498 million, which is an all-time record. Third-party financings were $21 million, representing 4% of the total cash collected. Our DSO in Q4 was 87 days, which is down from 91 days in Q3 and down from 90 days in Q4 '09. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was an all-time high at $121.7 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $27 million, and capitalized software was $19.2 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was a record for the fourth quarter at $75.6 million.
For the full year, operating cash flow grew 31% to $456 million, and free cash flow grew 98% to $273 million. Free cash flow represents more than 100% of net earnings for both Q4 and the full year, demonstrating strong earnings quality. For the full year, capitalized software was $81 million, and capital expenditures were $102 million. 
As we discussed previously, we spent less on capital expenditures in 2010 than the $130 million to $150 million range we initially expected. In 2011, we anticipate capital expenditures to be closer to that range, but we expect to continue generating strong operating and free cash flow.
Moving to capitalized software. The $19.2 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 27% of the $71 million of total spending on development moment activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19 million, resulting in net capitalization of $0.2 million or less than 1% of the total. In Q1, we expect capitalized software to increase approximately $21 million as development time increases that administrative vacation time decreases relative to Q4. We expect amortization in Q1 to be approximately $19 million.
Now I'll go through the guidance. For Q1 revenue, we expect revenue between $475 million and $490 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 12% over Q1 '10. For full year, we expect revenue between $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion, with the midpoint representing 12% growth. 
We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.73 to $0.77 per share, reflecting about 20% growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $3.50 and $3.60 with the midpoint reflecting 20% growth. 
Q1 guidance is based on total spending before stock compensation expense of approximately $295 million to $300 million. Our estimate for stock compensation expense is approximately $0.05 for Q1 and $0.20 to 20% for the full year. Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $435 million to $465 million, with the midpoint of this range reflecting double-digit growth. 
In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q4 and the full year with all key metrics at or above our expected ranges. Specifically, we are pleased with our strong levels of bookings and record revenue, continued margin expansion and earnings growth and continued strong levels of free cash flow generation. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."
259627,118049566,100465,"Cerner Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2011",2011-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss sales and operational results and comment on the marketplace trends. Starting with the results highlights. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $626 million included 22 contracts over $5 mi",2050,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss sales and operational results and comment on the marketplace trends. 
Starting with the results highlights. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $626 million included 22 contracts over $5 million, which ties an all-time record said in Q3. 13 of these contracts were over $10 million, which is a level only surpassed in Q4 of '09 when we had 15 contracts over $10 million. For the year, we had a record 77 contracts over $5 million, including 43 over $10 million. By nearly all measures, 2010 was a good top line year for Cerner.
Looking at competitive wins, our bookings from new footprints were strong with 26% of bookings coming from outside of our core millennium installed base. This contributed to a record level of new bookings for the year, reflecting our strong competitive position that as a result of the depth and breadth of our solutions readiness to meet Meaningful Use and proven services capabilities. 
We remain bullish about our new footprint opportunities going into 2011 as many competitors still have strong longer-term solution gaps, constraint services capabilities and other types of uncertainty surrounding them. One example of our strong competitiveness is our selection in Q4 by a large academic medical center at purchase solutions to meet Meaningful Use for their inpatient and outpatient facilities. We competed against a private company that has historically done well in the academic space, and at the same time, we are displacing a large ambulatory vendor on the outpatient side. So all in all, a good solid win.
This quarter reflected bookings highs for the year across all business models come, including licensed software, technology resale, subscriptions, professional services and managed services. Almost all of our business units had strong quarters and years with 15 of 16 units exceeding plan for the year. Areas of particular strength include light house, clinical process automation, women's health, critical care, lab, physician practice, Healthe network and hub, revenue cycle, medical devices, imaging and community hospitals. Now I'll discuss in details around the progress we made across several parts of our business.
In our DeviceWorks business, we had a great quarter and a great year. Device resell revenue more than doubled over 2009 levels contributing to strong growth of total technology resale despite a decline in our traditional hardware resale. 
As we have discussed earlier, traditional sales of data center equipment continue to be pressured by the success of our own hosting capabilities. We are more than offsetting this trend by growing sales in new areas, such as these medical devices, where we add value to our clients by offering a single source for devices that are connected to an EMR at a workflow level. And we have a become a strategic reseller to the device manufacturers because we can help them differentiate their devices and provide them access to our large install base. 
Also in our Device business, sales of our iBus device connectivity solution nearly doubled and 2010, including a breakout year bringing iBus outside of our install base and proving the ability to connect devices to our competitors systems.
DeviceWorks is a great example of our ability to recognize a market opportunity quickly bring value to the marketplace through innovation and make it a meaningful contributor to Cerner's growth. To put this in perspective, cumulative revenue from device and iBus sales have exceeded $125 million since we've launched the business in 2007, and we believe we have just scratched the surface of the growth opportunity. For example, our relationship with CareFusion, which got off to a good start in 2010, will add meaningfully to our growth opportunity and the value that we provide our marketplace.
In the physician practice space, 2010 was a major turning point for us as the improvements we have made in the user interface and workflow began to be recognized by the industry. In addition to improving the look and feel of our physician solutions, we reduced time it takes to perform common functions by 35% and a pure number of clicks by 43%. This success is reflected in a strong year for our PowerWorks business, which had over 30% bookings growth, driven by selling through our large install base and being included as part of several new footprint sales.
Our ability to offer a fully integrated EMR that is very competitive across inpatient and outpatient venues is attractive to the growing number of hospitals and health systems that are influencing physician practices decisions or consolidating physicians. A good example of this is our success at the academic medical center I mentioned that selected us in both venues. We will continue to make significant IT investments to further advance our position EMR in building solutions over the next 12 months.
In addition to our strong integrated inpatient, outpatient offering, we differentiate from others in the industry with our ability and willingness to interoperate with other systems. By providing an option that doesn't require changing out all systems when the client doesn't want to lose the value of existing investments they have made, we are an attractive option compared to other suppliers that force the reinvestment because of their inability to connect to other systems.
Moving to our Professional Services business. We Had a strong quarter and a strong year. This organization continues to contribute nicely to the top and bottom line and represents a visible element to our revenue and earnings growth. Operationally, we are on schedule with the large multiphasic projects that were signed in Q4 of '09 and are doing a good job of keeping up with the initial stimulus demand. Our hiring and training processes are working well, and we are in a good position to stay on top of the demand as we move through the year.
Beyond our traditional implementation services, we had a record year of bookings for our lighthouse clinical process optimization services as many clients create their plans for stage two of Meaningful Use. Our CernerWorks Managed Services business had another great year and continues to represent a strong marketplace differentiator. We continue to gain efficiencies and reduce the total cost of ownership, such as our transition to Linux last year. Our growth prospects for Managed Services remain strong, including opportunities to do more Global Managed Services business.
Collectively, our proven and scalable professional services and our industry-leading Managed Services capabilities create a major differentiator in the marketplace when compared to others with fewer capabilities and greater reliance on third parties. Our newer services, including Cerner ITWorks and Cerner RevWorks, represent further differentiation in as well as a very large growth potential. 
In ITWorks, we added four clients in 2010, including two in Q4. Recall that ITWorks involves a strategic alignment with our clients, where we take over to IT operations and leverage our scale and services capabilities to improve quality and project throughput. The momentum with our ITWorks offering is building, and the pipeline of prospects increase significantly in the second half of 2010 largely because our clients are doing ITWorks as a way to strategically align with Cerner during a very critical period of execution.
Our Works business, Cerner RevWorks, which was launched after ITWorks, is off to a very good start. Building on a substantially improved patient accounting solution, RevWorks goes beyond solutions and transactions and provides operational services to help health care organizations improve their end-to-end revenue cycle functions. 
We signed our first RevWorks client in Q2 and are already seeing positive financial and operating results. Our second RevWorks client was signed in Q4, and we are targeting several more in 2011. With ICD-10 looming and the new payment structures associated with accountable care organizations, we expect a major wave of Revenue Cycle activity in the coming years and we believe we urge through the well positioned for it.
As Jeff will discuss, we're building the foundation for another leg of growth beyond stimulus, and our works and white space solution offerings. This foundation is our cloud-based healthy intent platform that we launched last year. We announced last quarter that initial offerings on this platform would be free to our clients to help drive rapid adoption and quickly prove the benefits of the platform. 
These offerings include semantic chart search assumptions rescue region. We are getting great feedback from our clients about the solutions and I believe these capabilities will soon differentiate Cerner and strengthening our competitiveness. I also expect these initial offerings to become proof points to set the stage for successful launches of additional solutions on our cloud platform.
Moving to the geographic mix of our results. As Mark indicated, our results this quarter were stronger in the U.S. and Global. Outside the U.S., results continue to be impacted by the weak global economy, but we still have a decent quarter and bounce back to 5% revenue growth after a decline in Q3. Our full year global revenue growth of 5% is respectable given the challenging economy, and we had good results in England, Spain, the Middle East and Australia. 
The fundamental problem of the health care cost growing faster than the overall economy exists in almost all countries, and IT continues to be viewed as a way to break this trend. From a solution standpoint, we are now prepared to take our community works solution to select global markets to allow for a lower cost Software-as-a-Service delivery model. We're also much better position to grow our managed services offerings outside of the U.S. in 2011.  As a result, we remain bullish about the global HIT market and there is no other HIT about it whatever global footprint our capabilities.
Turning back to the U.S. marketplace and looking back on 2010, the demand inside our install base, greenfield opportunities and replacement opportunities played out that them a slight we had expected. in our base, our demand for solutions and services that go beyond Meaningful Use stage one. Outside of our base, I'm very pleased with our competitiveness as we had a very strong win rate in 2010 and expected to continue, if not improve, in 2011. 
I believe our capability to go beyond Meaningful Use along with our services capabilities and capacity will continue to differentiate us as we move further into the stimulus era. This believe is reflected in our strong 2011 outlook. And looking beyond 2011, we still believe this will be a multi-year opportunity with each stage of the stimulus requirements building on the prior stage and additional demand for solutions and services being driven by the second-order effects of stimulus and health perform.
Regarding health perform, we continue to expect that to change many things in the health care landscape and create new opportunities for Cerner. We expect the increased volumes created by covering the uninsured to result capacity constraints that IT can help manage. And changes in reimbursement models and reporting requirements will be another fundamental driver for IT. 
The evolution of new care delivery models such as ACOs will also require technology investments and create opportunities for Cerner to play an expanded role in driving higher quality, better coordinated and more efficient care. 
Before closing I wanted to comment on the recent activity in the house and the repealing elements of health reform in stimulus. Our opinion is that this activity is unlikely the result in any material changes, particularly when you consider the long-standing support for HIT. There is really no debate that IT is a necessary element in our nation's focus on bending the health care cost care, while also improving quality. And we believe there will continue to be a shift our lighting provider reimbursements more directly with the quality of care and outcomes.
This, along with other changing regulatory requirements, like bubbled payments value-based purchasing and the move to ICD-10 creates a significant opportunity for Cerner to become more strategic to our clients as they look to navigate these fundamental changes. 
In closing, I'm very pleased with our results in 2010 and expect us to get have a strong year in 2011 and beyond. We are extremely well positioned to benefit from the stimulus-driven demand in coming years and have that many likes of growth beyond stimulus. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Last year, at this time, I discussed our vision for New Middle and health care. We believe New Middle can facilitate the sharing of relevant clinical and financial information between payers, consumers and providers, resulting in an enhanced care and reduced friction. 
In 2010, we introduced our cloud-based healthy intent platform, which is a key building block for New Middle. Our first offering on this platform is chart search, which leverages knowledge of the clinical meanings of words and phrases located within the EMR as well as the context in which those documents and files were produced to create algorithms that identify the most important this capability allows the physician to efficiently search for operations health record and identify of that information in a matter of seconds without localized knowledge of how the organization manages their chart.
For example, it will no longer be necessary to explore the post radiology reported is charger make., just answered a clinical concert. In our early pilots, will begin to see the potential of this first piece of a much more comprehensive intelligent platform. Seen that order patterns or views, both the clinical intent and practice preferences of an individual clinician comes to the surface, creating an opportunities for new wave of the potential computing that is more efficient and intelligent to specific user and patient combination. We think this launch is a new way of microapps, which otherwise would have to be pieced together manually.
As I indicated last quarter, we're 's offering this cloud-based service as a free subscription with no license or operating fees in order to speed adoption and set the stage for future cloud services. There is already been a high level of interest in this offering in leveraging our CernerWorks investments, we're able to complete the technical elements of the implementation without disruption to the operational system. Our goal is to have the majority of our U.S. clients using it by the end of this year. 
Beyond the power of the search capabilities, we believe this platform provides an opportunity to accelerate what has been slow progress in the industry at solving the challenges of interoperability across a large amount of unstructured clinical data, varying nomenclatures and manual mapping of metadata. We are anticipating the next wave of challenges across the industry dealing with information that is coming from outside the four walls of the practice. We're jumping from the current state environment that is focus on Meaningful Use, which will eliminate the paper record over time, while at the same time, attempting to shares subset of clinical information.
Moving to the ability to contextually the entire record without the localized burden. by quickly deploying this in our install base, we expect to be the major proof point to impact the continuity and coordination good patient care across nearly 1/3 of the U.S. market. 
In parallel, leveraging our experience from the national H1N1 surveillance project are two of our healthy intent platform is our first national health agent. Called the St. John's axis rescue agent in recognition of Cerner's first client is an intelligent surveillance agent using clinical algorithms developed in collaboration with our clients that can assistant of that and the conditions that indicate a patient may be developing sepsis, a potentially fatal condition in which the bloodstream is overwhelmed by bacteria.
Using the outcome of the chart search processing, relevant clinical data is tagged for detection you for a combination of clinical indicators to trigger the monitoring agent. And ultimately respond back to the provider organization on a threshold has been map. 
Early results based on initial client use of this algorithm will reflected remarkable reductions in sepsis mortality rates. And we believe that moving this capability to a health agent in the cloud creates an opportunity for us to quickly improve the outcomes of nearly 750,000 Americans who are infected by sepsis each year.
Another area where we were helping a coordinated and across the fragmented delivery system is with our Cerner network services. The Cerner network creates better clinical integration and coordination of care by facilitating secure electronic flow of data between hospitals, physician practices and other stakeholders regardless of the EHR system being used. 
In 2010, total bookings for Cerner network nearly tripled from the previous year as our clients looked us to help them buildout enterprise HIEs and leverage our Cerner network capabilities to help meet Meaningful Use requirements, such as e-prescribing, submission of summary care record and reporting of quality measures. The total volume across the Cerner network has increased substantially and now nearly 50 million clinical and financial transactions go across the network each month.
we've also continue to make strong progress of garnering our relationships with employers. As you know, employers pay for a large portion of health care and getting them gauge is a critical part of improving the quality and efficiency of the care. In 2010, we had five employers choose to use our employer clinic model and three chooses for wellness plans. In the future, we'll be introducing additional capabilities across the employer and providers basis such as the e-care and personalized plans for health. We'll share more on this in our March Investor Day.
In summary, the connections and networks we're building across employers, consumers and providers, combined with the intelligence we are building into our Healthe Intent platform, position us to disrupt and systemically accelerate the move towards a New Middle and health care. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

I will not talk about the bookings but it's we added about 20 clients to our base, and I would expect it to be at least that much into 2011. So it's a very active marketplace. And I think we're in a little bit of a sweet spot relative to what we can get to the right price point. We went from a clinical capability's perspective nine times out of 10. So the way we're approaching that market is very different than the way we approach the broader market. It's more of a TeleSales model with specific touches once we find opportunities versus main account strategy that we have in our broader base. That being said, the 100 beds and 203 bed hospital, market size is been a very active market. It continues -- 2010 was a good year for us. It was probably top to relative to the total number of new clients. We do preprints footprints we delivered in 2010. I would expect that to be the same into 2011. And it consists of both new entries into the marketplace as well as some rebounds coming from other suppliers that as the clients are voting, there's a little bit of no confidence on the curved platform and coming back to the marketplace. There's many more rebounds on that front than we really initially expected. And so, that's been good news, and that's really what fueled the high number of new footprints in that community hospital market."

Welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Mike Valentine, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will follow me with sales and operational highlights and marketplace trends. Mike will be followed by Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, who will discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, is traveling today, but he will be dialing into the call.
Now I will turn to our results. All key measures in Q4 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by nearly $100 million. Our income statement performance was very good with adjusted EPS above our guidance and consensus, revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range and continued strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We again had excellent cash flow performance, with record levels of free cash flow reflective of strong earnings quality.
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q4 was $626 million, which is the second best result in company history. Bookings significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range and were up 26% sequentially and only slightly down from the record level in Q4 '09 that included two large contracts with investor-owned health systems. 
Mike will discuss our bookings in more detail, but performance is strong across the board, including software, managed services and professional services. And during the quarter, we signed two new ITWorks clients and our second RevWorks client. Booking margins in Q4 was $530 million or 85% of total bookings. For the full year, bookings revenue was $1.99 billion, up 9% from 2009.
Our total backlog increased 17% year-over-year to $4.94 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.29 billion is 19% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $655 million, up 6% year-over-year.
Revenue in the quarter was $500.2 million, which is up 7% over the very tough comparable in Q4 '09. The revenue composition for Q4 was $164 million in System Sales, $132 million in Support and Maintenance, $195 million in Services and $9 million in Reimbursed Travel. For the year, revenue grew 11% to $1.85 billion.
System Sales revenue was the second highest result in company history and down only 4% from the tough System Sales comparable in Q4 '09. System Sales were up 23% sequentially with strong growth across software, sublicensed software and hardware revenue. For the year, System Sales grew 9%. Services revenue was up 19% compared to Q4 '09 and 16% for the year with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and Maintenance revenue increased 7% over Q4 '09 and 5% for the year.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $432 million. Global revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $68 million. For the full year, Domestic revenue grew 12% to $1.56 billion, and Global revenue grew 5% to $288 million. As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our investment community meeting on March 10, I'd like to provide with you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2010.
Licensed software grew 6% to $268 million with double-digit growth in the first three quarters and a Q4 result that was the second highest in the company history behind Q4 '09. Technology resale was up 16% to $176 million as growth in device resale and sublicensed software offset a decline in traditional hardware resale. 
Subscriptions and transaction increased 7% to $106 million. Professional services revenue was $455 million, which is up 15% and reflects increased implementation activity. Managed services grew 19% to $294 million driven by continued strong demand for our hosting services. Support and Maintenance was $517 million, which is up 5%, and Reimbursed Travel was up 7% to $32 million. We'll go into more business model detail at our investment community meeting coming up.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 81%, which is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Gross margins were impacted this quarter by continued strength in device resale and an increase in third-party services. Going forward, we expect gross margins to remain in the low 80s. But we still expect to continue expanding margins at the operating level. For the full year, gross margin was 82.7%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. System Sales margin increased 290 basis points sequentially but were down year-over-year due to higher levels of hardware and lower margins. 
Looking at operating spending, our fourth quarter operating expenses were $295 million before share-based compensation expense of $7 million. Total operating expense was up 2% compared to Q4 '09. For the full year, operating expenses were $1.15 billion, up 6% from 2009. 
Sales and client service expenses were up 8% compared to Q4 '09 driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. For the full year, sales and client service expenses were up 9%. 
Our investment in software development was down 6% compared to Q4 '09, reflecting continued leverage of our R&D investment. For the full year, investment in software development was flat. Going forward, we expect our R&D investment to grow but at a rate that is less than our revenue growth rate. G&A expense decreased 14% year-over-year in Q4 and grew 1% for the full year. 
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q4 was 22.1% before share-based compensation expense. This is an all-time high and up 110 basis points compared to Q4 '09, which was also a record. For the full year, operating margins were up 230 basis points to 20.8%. The margin expansion was driven primarily by a combination of increased profitability in our professional services, managed services and support business models along with ongoing leverage of investments in R&D and SG&A expense. For the next few years, we believe we could expand operating margins 100 to 200 basis points per year through ongoing efficiencies across our business models and expense leverage. 
Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $70.6 million or $0.82 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.3 million or $0.05 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $75 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.87, which is up 17% compared to Q4 '09. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $252.8 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.96. 
Our tax rate in Q4 was 32.8%, which benefited from the extension of the R&D tax credit. For the full year, our tax rate was 34.7%. Note that applying this annual tax rate to normalized Q4 tax expense will result to reduced results by $0.02.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $835 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $770 million in Q3. Total cash and investments include $571 million of cash and short-term investments and $264 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities over one year. Our total debt is $93 million, which is down from $119 million last quarter due to payments made during the quarter. Total accounts receivable ended the quarter at $477 million, which is up $14 million from Q3. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables were $140 million and represent 29% of total receivables compared to 30% in Q3.
Cash collections were $498 million, which is an all-time record. Third-party financings were $21 million, representing 4% of the total cash collected. Our DSO in Q4 was 87 days, which is down from 91 days in Q3 and down from 90 days in Q4 '09. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was an all-time high at $121.7 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $27 million, and capitalized software was $19.2 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was a record for a fourth quarter at $75.6 million.  For the full year, operating cash flow grew 31% to $456 million, and free cash flow grew 98% to $273 million. Free cash flow represents more than 100% of net earnings for both Q4 and the full year, demonstrating strong earnings quality. 
For the full year, capitalized software was $81 million, and capital expenditures were $102 million. As we discussed previously, we spent less on capital expenditures in 2010 than the $130 million to $150 million range we initially expected. In 2011, we anticipate capital expenditures to be closer to that range, but we expect to continue generating strong operating and free cash flow.
Moving to capitalized software. The $19.2 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 27% of the $71 million of total spending on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19 million, resulting in net capitalization of $0.2 million or less than 1% of the total. In Q1, we expect capitalized software to increase to approximately $21 million as development time increases and administrative and vacation time decreases relative to Q4. We expect amortization in Q1 to be approximately $19 million.
Now I'll go through the guidance. For Q1 revenue, we expect revenue between $475 million and $490 million with the midpoint reflecting growth of 12% over Q1 '10. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion with the midpoint representing 12% growth. 
We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.73 to $0.77 per share, reflecting about 20% growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $3.50 and $3.60 with the midpoint reflecting 20% growth. 
Q1 guidance is based on total spending before stock compensation expense of approximately $295 million to $300 million. Our estimate for stock compensation expense is approximately $0.05 for Q1 and $0.20 to $0.22 for the full year. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $435 million to $465 million with the midpoint of this range reflecting double-digit growth. 
In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q4 and the full year with all key metrics at or above our expected ranges. Specifically, we are pleased with our strong levels of bookings and record revenue, continued margin expansion and earnings growth and continued strong levels of free cash flow generation. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."
259627,118049566,100682,"Cerner Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2011",2011-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss sales and operational results and comment on new marketplace trends. Starting with the results highlights. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $626 million included 22 contracts over $5 mi",2061,"Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss sales and operational results and comment on new marketplace trends. 
Starting with the results highlights. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $626 million included 22 contracts over $5 million, which ties an all-time record set in Q3. 13 of these contracts were over $10 million, which is a level only surpassed in Q4 of '09 when we had 15 contracts over $10 million. For the year, we had a record 77 contracts over $5 million, including 43 over $10 million. By nearly all measures, 2010 was a good top line year for Cerner.
Looking at competitive wins, our bookings from new footprints were strong with 26% of bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium installed base. This contributed to a record level of new net bookings for the year, reflecting our strong competitive position that is a  result of the depth and breadth of our solutions readiness to meet Meaningful Use and proven services capabilities. 
We remain bullish about our new footprint opportunities going into 2011 as many competitors still have longer term solution gaps, constrained services capabilities and other types of uncertainty surrounding them. One example of our strong competitiveness is our selection in Q4 by a large academic medical center that purchased solutions to meet Meaningful Use for their inpatient and outpatient facilities. We competed against a private company that has historically done well in the academic space, and at the same time, we are displacing a large ambulatory vendor on the outpatient side. So all in all, a good solid win.
This quarter reflected bookings highs for the year across all business models, including licensed software, technology resale, subscriptions, professional services and managed services. Almost all of our business units had strong quarters and years with 15 of 16 units exceeding plan for the year. Areas of particular strength include Lighthouse, clinical process automation, women's health, critical care, lab, physician practice, Healthe network and hub, revenue cycle, medical devices, imaging and community hospitals. 
Now I'll discuss some details around the progress we made across several parts of our business. In our DeviceWorks business, we had a great quarter and a great year. Device resale revenue more than doubled over 2009 levels, contributing to strong growth of total technology resale despite a decline in our traditional hardware resale. 
As we have discussed earlier, traditional sales of data center equipment continue to be pressured by the success of our own hosting capabilities. We are more than offsetting this trend by growing sales in new areas, such as these medical devices, where we add value to our clients by offering a single source for devices that are connected to an EMR at a workflow level. And we have become a strategic reseller to the device manufacturers because we can help them differentiate their devices and provide them access to our large install base. 
Also in our Device business, sales of our iBus device connectivity solution nearly doubled in 2010, including a breakout year at bringing iBus outside of our installed base and proving the ability to connect devices to our competitors' systems.
DeviceWorks is a great example of our ability to recognize a market opportunity, quickly bring value to the marketplace through innovation and make it a meaningful contributor to Cerner's growth. To put this in perspective, cumulative revenue from Device and iBus sales have exceeded $125 million since we launched the business in 2007, and we believe we have just scratched the surface of the growth opportunity. For example, our relationship with CareFusion, which got off to a good [ph] [24:21] start in 2010, will add meaningfully to our growth opportunity and the value that we provide our marketplace.
In the physician practice space, 2010 was a major turning point for us as the improvements we have made to the user interface and workflow began to be recognized by the industry. In addition to improving the look and feel of our physician solutions, we reduced the time it takes to perform common functions by 35% and the pure number of clicks by 43%. This success is reflected in a strong year for our PowerWorks business, which had over 30% bookings growth driven by selling through our large installed base and being included as part of several new footprint sales.
Our ability to offer a fully integrated EMR that is very competitive across inpatient and outpatient venues is attractive to the growing number of hospitals and health systems that are influencing physician practice decisions or consolidating physicians. A good example of this is our success at the academic medical center I mentioned that selected us in both venues. We will continue to make significant IT investments to further advance our position in EMR and in billing solutions over the next 12 months.
In addition to our strong integrated inpatient-outpatient offering, we differentiate from others in the industry with our ability and willingness to interoperate with other systems. By providing an option that doesn't require changing out all systems when the client doesn't want to lose the value of existing investments they have made, we are an attractive option compared to other suppliers that force the reinvestment because of their inability to connect to other systems.
Moving to our Professional Services business. We had a strong quarter and a strong year. This organization continues to contribute nicely to the top and bottom line and represents a visible element to our revenue and earnings growth. Operationally, we are on schedule with the large multiphase projects that were signed in Q4 of '09 and are doing a good job of keeping up with the initial stimulus demand. Our hiring and training processes are working well, and we are in a good position to stay on top of the demand as we move through the year.
Beyond our traditional implementation services, we had a record year of bookings for our Lighthouse clinical process optimization services as many clients create their plans for stage two of Meaningful Use. Our CernerWorks Managed Services business had another great year and continues to represent a strong marketplace differentiator. We continue to gain efficiencies and reduce the total cost of ownership, such as our transition to Linux last year. Our growth prospects for managed services remain strong, including opportunities to do more global Managed Services business.
Collectively, our proven and scalable professional services and our industry-leading managed services capabilities create a major differentiator in the marketplace when compared to others with fewer capabilities and greater reliance on third parties. Our newer services, including Cerner ITWorks and Cerner RevWorks, represent further differentiation as well as a very large growth potential. 
In ITWorks, we added four clients in 2010, including two in Q4. Recall that ITWorks involves a strategic alignment with our clients where we take over their IT operations and leverage our scale and services capabilities to improve quality and project throughput. The momentum with our ITWorks offering is building, and the pipeline of prospects increased significantly in the second half of 2010 largely because our clients are viewing ITWorks as a way to strategically align with Cerner during a very critical period of execution.
Our Works business, Cerner RevWorks, which was launched after ITWorks, is off to a very good start. Building on a substantially improved patient accounting solution, RevWorks goes beyond solutions and transactions and provides operational services to help health care organizations improve their end-to-end revenue cycle functions. 
We signed our first RevWorks client in Q2 and are already seeing positive financial and operating results. Our second RevWorks client was signed in Q4, and we are targeting several more in 2011. With ICD-10 looming and the new payment structures associated with accountable care organizations, we expect a major wave of revenue cycle activity in the coming years and believe we are extremely well positioned for it.
As Jeff will discuss, we are building the foundation for another leg of growth beyond stimulus, and our Works and white space solution offerings. This foundation is our cloud-based Healthe Intent platform that we launched last year. We announced last quarter that initial offerings on this platform would be free to our clients to help drive rapid adoption and quickly prove the benefits of the platform. These offerings include Semantic Chart Search and substance rescue agent. We are getting great feedback from our clients about these solutions, and I believe these capabilities will further differentiate Cerner and strengthen our competitiveness. I also expect these initial offerings to become proof points to set the stage for successful launches of additional solutions on our cloud platform.
Moving to the geographic mix of our results. As Marc indicated, our results this quarter were stronger in the U.S. than globally. Outside the U.S., our results continue to be impacted by the weak global economy, but we still had a decent quarter and bounced back to 5% revenue growth after a decline in Q3. Our full year global revenue growth of 5% is respectable given the challenging economy, and we had good results in England, Spain, the Middle East and Australia. 
The fundamental problem of health care cost growing faster than the overall economy exists in almost all countries, and IT continues to be viewed as a way to break this trend. From a solution standpoint, we are now prepared to take our CommunityWorks solution to select global markets to allow for a lower cost Software as a Service delivery model. We're also much better positioned to grow our managed services offerings outside of the U.S. in 2011.  As a result, we remain bullish about the global HIT market, and there is no other HIT company with our global footprint or capabilities.
Turning back to the U.S. marketplace and looking back on 2010, the demand inside our installed base, greenfield opportunities and replacement opportunities played out pretty much like we had expected. In our base, I am pleased with the strong demand for solutions and services that go beyond Meaningful Use stage one. Outside of our base, I'm very pleased with our competitiveness as we had a very strong win rate in 2010 and expect it to continue, if not improve, in 2011. 
I believe our capability to go beyond Meaningful Use, along with our services capabilities and capacity, will continue to differentiate us as we move further into the stimulus era. This belief is reflected in our strong 2011 outlook. And looking beyond 2011, we still believe this will be a multiyear opportunity with each stage of the stimulus requirements building on the prior stage and additional demand for solutions and services being driven by the second order effects of stimulus and health reform.
Regarding health reform, we continue to expect that to change many things in the health care landscape and create new opportunities for Cerner. We expect the increased volumes created by covering the uninsured to result in capacity constraints that IT can help manage. And changes in reimbursement models and reporting requirements will be another fundamental driver for IT. 
The evolution of new care delivery models such as ACOs will also require technology investments and create opportunities for Cerner to play an expanded role in driving higher quality, better coordinated and more efficient care. 
Before closing, I wanted to comment on the recent activity in the House aimed at repealing elements of health reform and stimulus. Our opinion is that this activity is unlikely to result in any material changes, particularly when you consider the long-standing bipartisan support for HIT. There is really no debate that IT is a necessary element in our nation's focus on bending the health care cost curve while also improving quality. And we believe there will continue to be a shift to aligning provider reimbursements more directly with the quality of care and outcomes. This, along with other changing regulatory requirements, like bundled payments, value-based purchasing and the move to ICD-10, create a significant opportunity for Cerner to become more strategic to our clients as they look to navigate these fundamental changes. 
In closing, I am very pleased with our results in 2010 and expect us to have a strong year in 2011 and beyond. We are extremely well positioned to benefit from the stimulus-driven demand in coming years and have many legs of growth beyond stimulus. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

We believe a New Middle can facilitate the sharing of relevant",949,"Thanks, Mike. Today, I'm going to discuss our progress on innovation and our Employer and Network businesses. 
Last year at this time, I discussed our vision for a New Middle in health care. We believe a New Middle can facilitate the sharing of relevant clinical and financial information between payers, consumers and providers, resulting in enhanced care and reduced friction. 
In 2010, we introduced our cloud-based Healthe Intent platform, which is a key building block for New Middle. Our first offering on this platform is Chart Search, which leverages knowledge of the clinical meanings of words and phrases located within the EMR as well as the context in which those documents and files were produced to create algorithms that identify and rank the most important information contextually. 
This capability allows the physician to efficiently search for a patient's health record and identify relevant information in a matter of seconds without localized knowledge of how the organization manages their chart.
For example, it will no longer be necessary to explore the post-op notes, radiology report or discharge summary. Just enter the clinical concept. 
In our early pilots, we've begun to see the potential of this first piece of a much more comprehensive, intelligent platform. Seeing the early patterns of use, both the clinical intent and practice preferences of an individual clinician comes to the surface, creating opportunities for a new wave of contextual computing that is more efficient and intelligent to a specific user and patient combination. We think this launches a new wave of microapps, which otherwise would have to be pieced together manually.
As I indicated last quarter, we are offering this cloud-based service as a free subscription with no license or operating fees in order to speed adoption and set the stage for future cloud services. There has already been a high level of interest in this offering, and leveraging our CernerWorks investments, we're able to complete the technical elements of the implementation without disruption to the operational system. Our goal is to have a majority of our U.S. clients using it by the end of this year. 
Beyond the power of the search capabilities, we believe this platform provides an opportunity to accelerate what has been slow progress in the industry at solving the challenges of interoperability across a large amount of unstructured clinical data, varying nomenclatures and manual mapping of metadata. We're anticipating the next wave of challenges across the industry as dealing with information that is coming from outside the four walls of the practice. We're jumping from the current state environment that is focused on Meaningful Use, which will eliminate the paper record over time while at the same time attempting to share a subset of clinical information.
Moving to the ability to contextually share the entire record without a localized burden. By quickly deploying this in our installed base, we expect to create a major proof point that will impact the continuity and coordination of care across nearly 1/3 of the U.S. market. 
In parallel, leveraging our experience from the national H1N1 surveillance project, part two of our Healthe Intent platform launch is our first national health agent. Called the St. John's substance rescue agent in recognition of Cerner's first client, it is an intelligent surveillance agent using clinical algorithms developed in collaboration with our clients that can assist in detecting the conditions that indicate a patient may be developing sepsis, a potentially fatal condition in which the bloodstream is overwhelmed by bacteria. 
Using the outcome of the Chart Search processing, relevant clinical data is tagged for detection, looking for a combination of clinical indicators to trigger the monitoring agent and ultimately respond back to the provider organization when a threshold has been met. Early results based on initial client use of this algorithm reflected remarkable reductions in sepsis mortality rates. And we believe that moving this capability to a health agent in a cloud creates an opportunity for us to quickly improve the outcomes of nearly 750,000 Americans who are infected by sepsis each year.
Another area where we were helping coordinate information across the fragmented delivery system is with our Cerner Network services. The Cerner Network creates better clinical integration and coordination of care by facilitating secure electronic flow of data between hospitals, physician practices and other stakeholders regardless of the EHR system being used. 
In 2010, total bookings for Cerner Network nearly tripled from the previous year as our clients looked at us to help them build out enterprise HIEs and leverage our Cerner Network capabilities to help meet Meaningful Use requirements, such as e-prescribing, submission of summary care records and reporting of quality measures. The total volume across the Cerner Network has increased substantially. And now nearly 50 million clinical and financial transactions go across the network each month.
We've also continued to make strong progress at growing our relationships with employers. As you know, employers pay for a large portion of health care, and getting them to engage will be a critical part of improving the quality and efficiency of care. In 2010, we had five employers choose to use our employer clinic model and three chooses for wellness plans. In the future, we'll be introducing additional capabilities to cross the employer and providers spaces such as the eCare and personalized plans for health. We'll share more on this in our March Investor Day.
In summary, the connections and networks we're building across employers, consumers and providers, combined with the intelligence we are building into our Healthe Intent platform, position us to disrupt and systemically accelerate the move towards a New Middle in health care. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

So a big portion of our alignment was reaching into the academic side of the world, understanding their priorities and building a plan that met those requirements. So it was a broad, long selection process. We prevailed in the end, and we think it's a good example of execution. And really, one of the competitiveness issues that we've been investing in is around physician usability. That's especially important in an academic setting, and I think it was a good early proof point that the investments we've been making on that front are being recognized in the industry. And I think 2011 is about investments will put us in even better shape going forward. So I think that's how I'd describe that."

Welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Mike Valentine, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will follow me with sales and operational highlights and marketplace trends. Mike will be followed by Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, who will discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, is traveling today, but he will be dialing into the call.
Now I will turn to our results. All key measures in Q4 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by nearly $100 million. Our income statement performance was very good with adjusted EPS above our guidance and consensus, revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range and continued strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We again had excellent cash flow performance, with record levels of free cash flow reflected a strong earnings quality.
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q4 was $626 million, which is the second best result in company history. Bookings significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range and were up 26% sequentially and only slightly down from the record level in Q4 '09 that included two large contracts with investor-owned health systems. 
Mike will discuss our bookings in more detail, but performance was strong across the board, including software, managed services and professional services. And during the quarter, we signed two new ITWorks clients and our second RevWorks client. Booking margins in Q4 was $530 million or 85% of total bookings. For the full year, bookings revenue was $1.99 billion, up 9% from 2009.
Our total backlog increased 17% year-over-year to $4.94 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.29 billion is 19% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $655 million, up 6% year-over-year.
Revenue in the quarter was $500.2 million, which is up 7% over the very tough comparable in Q4 '09. The revenue composition for Q4 was $164 million in System Sales, $132 million in Support and Maintenance, $195 million in Services and $9 million in Reimbursed Travel. For the year, revenue grew 11% to $1.85 billion.
System Sales revenue was the second highest result in company history and down only 4% from the tough System Sales comparable in Q4 '09. System Sales were up 23% sequentially with strong growth across software, sublicensed software and hardware revenue. For the year, System Sales grew 9%. Services revenue was up 19% compared to Q4 '09 and 16% for the year with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and Maintenance revenue increased 7% over Q4 '09 and 5% for the year.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $432 million. Global revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $68 million. For the full year, Domestic revenue grew 12% to $1.56 billion, and Global revenue grew 5% to $288 million. As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our investment community meeting on March 10, I'd like to provide with you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2010.
Licensed software grew 6% to $268 million with double-digit growth in the first three quarters and a Q4 result that was the second highest in company history behind Q4 '09. Technology resale was up 16% to $176 million as growth in device resale and sublicensed software offset a decline in traditional hardware resale. 
Subscriptions and transactions increased 7% to $106 million. Professional services revenue was $455 million, which is up 15% and reflects increased implementation activity. Managed services grew 19% to $294 million driven by continued strong demand for our hosting services. Support and Maintenance was $517 million, which is up 5%, and Reimbursed Travel was up 7% to $32 million. We'll go into more business model detail at our investment community meeting coming up.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 81%, which is down 200 basis points year-over-year. Gross margins were impacted this quarter by continued strength in device resale and an increase in third-party services. Going forward, we expect gross margins to remain in the low 80s. But we still expect to continue expanding margins at the operating level. For the full year, gross margin was 82.7%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. System Sales margin increased 290 basis points sequentially but were down year-over-year due to higher levels of hardware at lower margins. 
Looking at operating spending, our fourth quarter operating expenses were $295 million before share-based compensation expense of $7 million. Total operating expense was up 2% compared to Q4 '09. For the full year, operating expenses were $1.15 billion, up 6% from 2009. 
Sales and client service expenses were up 8% compared to Q4 '09 driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. For the full year, sales and client service expenses were up 9%. 
Our investment in software development was down 6% compared to Q4 '09, reflecting continued leverage of our R&D investment. For the full year, investment in software development was flat. Going forward, we expect our R&D investment to grow but at a rate that is less than our revenue growth rate. G&A expense decreased 14% year-over-year in Q4 and grew 1% for the full year. 
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q4 was 22.1% before share-based compensation expense. This is an all-time high and up 110 basis points compared to Q4 '09, which was also a record. For the full year, operating margins were up 230 basis points to 20.8%. The margin expansion was driven primarily by a combination of increased profitability in our professional services, managed services and support business models along with ongoing leverage of investments in R&D and SG&A expense. For the next few years, we believe we could expand operating margins 100 to 200 basis points per year through ongoing efficiencies across our business models and expense leverage. 
Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $70.6 million or $0.82 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.3 million or $0.05 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $75 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.87, which is up 17% compared to Q4 '09. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $252.8 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.96. 
Our tax rate in Q4 was 32.8%, which benefited from the extension of the R&D tax credit. For the full year, our tax rate was 34.7%. Note that applying this annual tax rate to normalized Q4 tax expense would have reduced results by $0.02.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $835 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $770 million in Q3. Total cash and investments include $571 million of cash and short-term investments and $264 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities over one year. Our total debt is $93 million, which is down from $119 million last quarter due to payments made during the quarter. Total accounts receivable ended the quarter at $477 million, which is up $14 million from Q3. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables were $140 million and represent 29% of total receivables compared to 30% in Q3.
Cash collections were $498 million, which is an all-time record. Third-party financings were $21 million, representing 4% of the total cash collected. Our DSO in Q4 was 87 days, which is down from 91 days in Q3 and down from 90 days in Q4 '09. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was an all-time high at $121.7 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $27 million, and capitalized software was $19.2 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was a record for a fourth quarter at $75.6 million.  For the full year, operating cash flow grew 31% to $456 million, and free cash flow grew 98% to $273 million. Free cash flow represents more than 100% of net earnings for both Q4 and the full year, demonstrating strong earnings quality. 
For the full year, capitalized software was $81 million, and capital expenditures were $102 million. As we discussed previously, we spent less on capital expenditures in 2010 than the $130 million to $150 million range we initially expected. In 2011, we anticipate capital expenditures to be closer to that range, but we expect to continue generating strong operating and free cash flow.
Moving to capitalized software. The $19.2 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 27% of the $71 million of total spending on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19 million, resulting in net capitalization of $0.2 million or less than 1% of the total. In Q1, we expect capitalized software to increase to approximately $21 million as development time increases and administrative and vacation time decreases relative to Q4. We expect amortization in Q1 to be approximately $19 million.
Now I'll go through the guidance. For Q1 revenue, we expect revenue between $475 million and $490 million with the midpoint reflecting growth of 12% over Q1 '10. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion with the midpoint representing 12% growth. 
We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.73 to $0.77 per share, reflecting about 20% growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $3.50 and $3.60 with the midpoint reflecting 20% growth. 
Q1 guidance is based on total spending before stock compensation expense of approximately $295 million to $300 million. Our estimate for stock compensation expense is approximately $0.05 for Q1 and $0.20 to $0.22 for the full year. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $435 million to $465 million with the midpoint of this range reflecting double-digit growth. 
In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q4 and the full year with all key metrics at or above our expected ranges. Specifically, we are pleased with our strong levels of bookings and record revenue, continued margin expansion and earnings growth and continued strong levels of free cash flow generation. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss sales and operational results and comment on the marketplace trends. Starting with results highlights.

Today, I'm going to discuss sales and operational results and comment on the marketplace trends. 
Starting with results highlights. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $626 million included 22 contracts over $5 million, which ties an all-time record set in Q3. 13 of these contracts were over $10 million, which is a level only surpassed in Q4 of '09 when we had 15 contracts over $10 million. For the year, we had a record 77 contracts over $5 million, including 43 over $10 million. By nearly all measures, 2010 was a good top line year for Cerner.
Looking at competitive wins, our bookings from new footprints were strong with 26% of bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium installed base. This contributed to a record level of new footprint bookings for the year, reflecting our strong competitive position that is a result of the depth and breadth of our solutions, readiness to meet Meaningful Use and proven services capabilities. 
We remain bullish about our new footprint opportunities going into 2011 as many competitors still have longer term solution gaps, constrained services capabilities and other types of uncertainty surrounding them. One example of our strong competitiveness is our selection in Q4 by a large academic medical center that purchased solutions to meet Meaningful Use for their inpatient and outpatient facilities. We competed against a private company that has historically done well in the academic space, and at the same time, we are displacing a large ambulatory vendor on the outpatient side. So all in all, a good solid win.
This quarter reflected bookings highs for the year across all business models, including licensed software, technology resale, subscriptions, professional services and managed services. Almost all of our business units had strong quarters and years with 15 of 16 units exceeding plan for the year. Areas of particular strength include Lighthouse, clinical process optimization, women's health, critical care, lab, physician practice, Healthe network and hub, revenue cycle, medical devices, imaging and community hospitals. 
Now I'll discuss some details around the progress we made across several parts of our business. In our DeviceWorks business, we had a great quarter and a great year. Device resale revenue more than doubled over 2009 levels, contributing to strong growth of total technology resale despite a decline in our traditional hardware resale. 
As we have discussed earlier, traditional sales of data center equipment continue to be pressured by the success of our own hosting capabilities. We are more than offsetting this trend by growing sales in new areas, such as these medical devices, where we add value to our clients by offering a single source for devices that are connected to an EMR at a workflow level. And we have become a strategic reseller to the device manufacturers because we can help them differentiate their devices and provide them access to our large install base. 
Also in our Device business, sales of our iBus device connectivity solution nearly doubled in 2010, including a breakout year at bringing iBus outside of our installed base and proving the ability to connect devices to our competitors' systems.
DeviceWorks is a great example of our ability to recognize a market opportunity, quickly bring value to the marketplace through innovation and make it a meaningful contributor to Cerner's growth. To put this in perspective, cumulative revenue from Device and iBus sales have exceeded $125 million since we launched the business in 2007, and we believe we have just scratched the surface of the growth opportunity. For example, our relationship with CareFusion, which got off to a good [ph] start in 2010, will add meaningfully to our growth opportunity and the value that we provide our marketplace.
In the physician practice space, 2010 was a major turning point for us as the improvements we have made to the user interface and workflow began to be recognized by the industry. In addition to improving the look and feel of our physician solutions, we reduced the time it takes to perform common functions by 35% and the pure number of clicks by 43%. This success is reflected in a strong year for our PowerWorks business, which had over 30% bookings growth driven by selling through our large installed base and being included as part of several new footprint sales.
Our ability to offer a fully integrated EMR that is very competitive across inpatient and outpatient venues is attractive to the growing number of hospitals and health systems that are influencing physician practice decisions or consolidating physicians. A good example of this is our success at the academic medical center I mentioned that selected us in both venues. We will continue to make significant IT investments to further advance our physician EMR and billing solutions over the next 12 months.
In addition to our strong integrated inpatient-outpatient offering, we differentiate from others in the industry with our ability and willingness to interoperate with other systems. By providing an option that doesn't require changing out all systems when the client doesn't want to lose the value of existing investments they have made, we are an attractive option compared to other suppliers that force the reinvestment because of their inability to connect to other systems.
Moving to our Professional Services business. We had a strong quarter and a strong year. This organization continues to contribute nicely to the top and bottom line and represents a visible element to our revenue and earnings growth. Operationally, we are on schedule with the large multiphase projects that were signed in Q4 of '09 and are doing a good job of keeping up with the initial stimulus demand. Our hiring and training processes are working well, and we are in a good position to stay on top of the demand as we move through the year.
Beyond our traditional implementation services, we had a record year of bookings for our Lighthouse clinical process optimization services as many clients create their plans for stage two of Meaningful Use. Our CernerWorks Managed Services business had another great year and continues to represent a strong marketplace differentiator. We continue to gain efficiencies and reduce the total cost of ownership, such as our transition to Linux last year. Our growth prospects for managed services remain strong, including opportunities to do more global Managed Services business.
Collectively, our proven and scalable professional services and our industry-leading managed services capabilities create a major differentiator in the marketplace when compared to others with fewer capabilities and greater reliance on third parties. Our newer services, including Cerner ITWorks and Cerner RevWorks, represent further differentiation as well as a very large growth potential. 
In ITWorks, we added four clients in 2010, including two in Q4. Recall that ITWorks involves a strategic alignment with our clients where we take over their IT operations and leverage our scale and services capabilities to improve quality and project throughput. The momentum with our ITWorks offering is building, and the pipeline of prospects increased significantly in the second half of 2010 largely because our clients are viewing ITWorks as a way to strategically align with Cerner during a very critical period of execution.
Our other Works business, Cerner RevWorks, which was launched after ITWorks, is off to a very good start. Building on a substantially improved patient accounting solution, RevWorks goes beyond solutions and transactions and provides operational services to help healthcare organizations improve their end-to-end revenue cycle functions. 
We signed our first RevWorks client in Q2 and are already seeing positive financial and operating results. Our second RevWorks client was signed in Q4, and we are targeting several more in 2011. With ICD-10 looming and the new payment structures associated with accountable care organizations, we expect a major wave of revenue cycle activity in the coming years and believe we are extremely well positioned for it.
As Jeff will discuss, we are building the foundation for another leg of growth beyond stimulus, and our Works and white space solution offerings. This foundation is our cloud-based Healthe Intent platform that we launched last year. We announced last quarter that initial offerings on this platform would be free to our clients to help drive rapid adoption and quickly prove the benefits of the platform. These offerings include Semantic Chart Search and sepsis rescue agent. We are getting great feedback from our clients about these solutions, and I believe these capabilities will further differentiate Cerner and strengthen our competitiveness. I also expect these initial offerings to become proof points to set the stage for successful launches of additional solutions on our cloud platform.
Moving to the geographic mix of our results. As Marc indicated, our results this quarter were stronger in the U.S. than globally. Outside the U.S., our results continue to be impacted by the weak global economy, but we still had a decent quarter and bounced back to 5% revenue growth after a decline in Q3. Our full year global revenue growth of 5% is respectable given the challenging economy, and we had good results in England, Spain, the Middle East and Australia. 
The fundamental problem of healthcare cost growing faster than the overall economy exists in almost all countries, and IT continues to be viewed as a way to break this trend. From a solution standpoint, we are now prepared to take our CommunityWorks solution to select global markets to allow for a lower cost Software as a Service delivery model. We are also much better positioned to grow our managed services offerings outside of the U.S. in 2011.  As a result, we remain bullish about the global HIT market, and there is no other HIT company with our global footprint or capabilities.
Turning back to the U.S. marketplace and looking back on 2010, the demand inside our installed base, greenfield opportunities and replacement opportunities played out pretty much like we had expected. In our base, I am pleased with the strong demand for solutions and services that go beyond Meaningful Use stage one. Outside of our base, I'm very pleased with our competitiveness as we had a very strong win rate in 2010 and expect it to continue, if not improve, in 2011. 
I believe our capability to go beyond Meaningful Use, along with our services capabilities and capacity, will continue to differentiate us as we move further into the stimulus era. This belief is reflected in our strong 2011 outlook. And looking beyond 2011, we still believe this will be a multiyear opportunity with each stage of the stimulus requirements building on the prior stage and additional demand for solutions and services being driven by the second order effects of stimulus and health reform.
Regarding health reform, we continue to expect it to change many things in the healthcare landscape and create new opportunities for Cerner. We expect the increased volumes created by covering the uninsured to result in capacity constraints that IT can help manage. And changes in reimbursement models and reporting requirements will be another fundamental driver for IT. 
The evolution of new care delivery models such as ACOs will also require technology investments and create opportunities for Cerner to play an expanded role in driving higher quality, better coordinated and more efficient care. 
Before closing, I wanted to comment on the recent activity in the House aimed at repealing elements of health reform and stimulus. Our opinion is that this activity is unlikely to result in any material changes, particularly when you consider the long-standing bipartisan support for HIT. There is really no debate that IT is a necessary element in our nation's focus on bending the healthcare cost curve while also improving quality. And we believe there will continue to be a shift to aligning provider reimbursements more directly with the quality of care and outcomes. This, along with other changing regulatory requirements, like bundled payments, value-based purchasing and the move to ICD-10, create a significant opportunity for Cerner to become more strategic to our clients as they look to navigate these fundamental changes. 
In closing, I am very pleased with our results in 2010 and expect us to have a strong year in 2011 and beyond. We are extremely well positioned to benefit from the stimulus-driven demand in coming years and have many legs of growth beyond stimulus. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."
259627,118049566,100704,"Cerner Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2011",2011-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Today, I'm going to discuss our progress on innovation and our Employer and Network businesses. Last year at this time, I discussed our vision for a New Middle in healthcare. We believe a New Middle can facilitate the sharing of relevant c",953,"Thanks, Mike. Today, I'm going to discuss our progress on innovation and our Employer and Network businesses. 
Last year at this time, I discussed our vision for a New Middle in healthcare. We believe a New Middle can facilitate the sharing of relevant clinical and financial information between payers, consumers and providers, resulting in enhanced care and reduced friction. 
In 2010, we introduced our cloud-based Healthe Intent platform, which is a key building block for a New Middle. Our first offering on this platform is Chart Search, which leverages knowledge of the clinical meanings of words and phrases located within the EMR as well as the context in which those documents and files were produced to create algorithms that identify and rank the most important information contextually. 
This capability allows the physician to efficiently search for a patient's health record and identify relevant information in a matter of seconds without localized knowledge of how the organization manages their chart. For example, it will no longer be necessary to explore the post-op notes, radiology report or discharge summary. Just enter the clinical concept. 
In our early pilots, we've begun to see the potential of this first piece of a much more comprehensive, intelligent platform. Seeing the early patterns of use, both the clinical intent and practice preferences of an individual clinician comes to the surface, creating opportunities for a new wave of contextual computing that is more efficient and intelligent to a specific user and patient combination. We think this launches a new wave of microapps, which otherwise would have to be pieced together manually.
As I indicated last quarter, we are offering this cloud-based service as a free subscription with no license or operating fees in order to speed adoption and set the stage for future cloud services. There has already been a high level of interest in this offering, and leveraging our CernerWorks investments, we were able to complete the technical elements of the implementation without disruption to the operational system. Our goal is to have a majority of our U.S. clients using it by the end of this year. 
Beyond the power of the search capabilities, we believe this platform provides an opportunity to accelerate what has been slow progress in the industry at solving the challenges of interoperability across a large amount of unstructured clinical data, varying nomenclatures and manual mapping of metadata. We are anticipating the next wave of challenges across the industry as dealing with information that is coming from outside the four walls of the practice. We're jumping from the current state environment that is focused on Meaningful Use, which will eliminate the paper record over time while at the same time attempting to share a subset of clinical information.
Moving to the ability to contextually share the entire record without a localized burden. By quickly deploying this in our installed base, we expect to create a major proof point that will impact the continuity and coordination of care across nearly 1/3 of the U.S. market. 
In parallel, leveraging our experience from the national H1N1 surveillance project, part two of our Healthe Intent platform launch is our first national health agent. Called the St. John sepsis rescue agent in recognition of Cerner's first client, it is an intelligent surveillance agent using clinical algorithms developed in collaboration with our clients that can assist in detecting the conditions that indicate a patient may be developing sepsis, a potentially fatal condition in which the bloodstream is overwhelmed by bacteria. 
Using the outcome of the Chart Search processing, relevant clinical data is tagged for detection, looking for a combination of clinical indicators to trigger the monitoring agent and ultimately respond back to the provider organization when a threshold has been met. Early results based on the initial client use of this algorithm have reflected remarkable reductions in sepsis mortality rates. And we believe that moving this capability to a health agent in a cloud creates an opportunity for us to quickly improve the outcomes of nearly 750,000 Americans who are affected by sepsis each year.
Another area where we were helping coordinate information across the fragmented delivery system is with our Cerner Network services. The Cerner Network creates better clinical integration and coordination of care by facilitating secure electronic flow of data between hospitals, physician practices and other stakeholders regardless of the EHR system being used. 
In 2010, total bookings for Cerner Network nearly tripled from the previous year as our clients looked at us to help them build out enterprise HIEs and leverage our Cerner Network capabilities to help meet Meaningful Use requirements, such as e-prescribing, submission of summary care records and reporting of quality measures. The total volume across the Cerner Network has increased substantially. And now nearly 50 million clinical and financial transactions go across the network each month.
We've also continued to make strong progress at growing our relationships with employers. As you know, employers pay for a large portion of healthcare, and getting them to engage will be a critical part of improving the quality and efficiency of care. In 2010, we had five employers choose to use our employer clinic model and three chooses for wellness plans. In the future, we will be introducing additional capabilities that cross the employer and providers spaces such as eCare and personalized plans for health. We'll share more on this at our March Investor Day.
In summary, the connections and networks we are building across employers, consumers and providers, combined with the intelligence we are building into our Healthe Intent platform, position us to disrupt and systemically accelerate the move towards a New Middle in health care. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

And the other one was a decent-sized deal but not a number changing deal. So there wasn't a lot of the big deals that we saw in the year-ago quarter come through, but it was very broad.  One of the exciting things from my standpoint was one of the deals that we mentioned was over $10 million [ph] -- where we beat the private company and an ambulatory provider to take both the inpatient and outpatient provider status for that health system.

So for 75 beds and below, we've introduced the CommunityWorks offering. It's Software as a Service. It's not a highly customizable. So it's a fixed set of solutions with a fixed set of capabilities. And we've had a lot of success with it. Last year was our real first year of -- full first year of operation. I won't talk about total bookings, but we added about 20 clients to our base, and I would expect it to be at least that much into 2011. So it's a very active marketplace. And I think we're in a little bit of a sweet spot relative to if we can get to the right price point, we win from a clinical capabilities perspective nine times out of 10.  So the way we're approaching that market is very different than the way we approach the broader market. It's more of a telesales model with specific touches once we find lead opportunities versus a main account strategy that we have in our broader base.  That being said, the 100 beds to about 300-bed-hospital market size has been a very active market. It continues to -- 2010 was a good year for us. It was probably top two-ish relative to the total number of new clients we've -- new footprints we delivered in 2010. I would expect that to be the same into 2011. And it consists of both new entries into the marketplace as well as some rebounds coming from other suppliers that the clients are voting -- there's a little bit of vote of no confidence on their current platform and they're coming back to the marketplace. There's many more rebounds on that front than we really initially expected. And so that's been good news, and that's really what's fueled the high number of new footprints in that community hospital market."

As we announced last week, effective May 30, with my to thank Mike for his many contributions to Cerner and wish him well in the future. We are pleased and Mike, Neal, who is with us on the call today. Both seasoned leaders who have contributed significantly to Cerner success, and we look forward for that during insight on the call.
Now I'll turn to our results. All key measures in Q1 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by nearly $60 million. Our income statement performance was very good with revenue and adjusted EPS above our guidance and consensus and continued revenue extension expansion in earnings growth. We did have excellent cash flow performance, with record levels of free cash flow both reflective of strong earnings quality.
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q1 was $525 million, which is the best result for first quarter in the company's history. Bookings significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range anywhere up 30% from Q1 of '10. Bookings margin in Q1 was $443 million or 84% of total bookings.
The total backlog increased 19% year-over-year to $5.3 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.46 billion is 21% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $666 million, up 6% year-over-year.
Revenue in the quarter was $491.7 million, which is up 14% over Q1 of '10. The revenue and composition for Q1 was $140 million in system sales, $132 million in support and maintenance, $209 million in services and $10 million in reimbursed travel. System sales revenue generally reflects 20% growth from Q1 of 2010 with double-digit growth in all areas including software, hardware, device resale, sublicense software and subscriptions.
Our Device Resale business continues to gain significant traction, and at its best quarter, terms of revenue since we launched that business. Services revenues of 60% compared to Q1 of '10, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support maintenance revenue increased 4% over Q1 of '10. We expect growth in support to increase as we move through the year.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $420 million amounting to $71 million was down 7% against a tough Q1 comparable. It Was up 4% sequentially, and we expect stronger growth for the remainder of the year-based on strong Q1 global bookings and a strong pipeline.
Moving the gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 81.6%, which is down 260 basis points year-over-year and up 60 basis point sequentially. Gross margin continues to be impacted by strength in device resale and increased from third-party services. As we indicated last quarter, we expect gross margin to remain in the low 80s, but we expect to continue expanding operating margins, which we did again this quarter despite lower gross margins.
Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter operating expenses were $299.9 million before share based compensation expense of $7.4 million. Total operating expense was up 6% compared to Q1 of '10. Sales in client service expenses increased 7% compared to Q1 of '10, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. Our investment software development increased 6% compared to the year-ago quarter, and G&A expense increased 3% year-over-year.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q1 was 20.6% before share based compensation expense. This is up 180 basis points compared to Q1 of '10, which is at the high end of our 100 to 200 basis point target. Moving to earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were 600, or $64.6 million or $0.75 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings includes share based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.6 million or $0.05 per share.
Adjusted net earnings were $69.1 million and adjusted EPS was $0.80, which is up 27% compared to Q1 of '10. Our tax rate in Q1 was 32.9%, which benefited from lower foreign in taxes in the quarter.
For the full year, expect our tax rate to be 34.5%. Note that applying this annual tax rate to normalized Q1 tax expense would reduce our earnings per share by $0.02.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $949 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $835 million in Q4. Total cash and investments includes $611 million of cash and short-term investments and $338 million of highly rated corporate government bonds with maturities over one year. Our total debt is $101 million. 
Total accounts receivable ended the quarter at $469 million, which is up, down $8 million from Q4 due to strong cash collections.
Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables were $133 million and represent 28% of total receivables compared to 29% in Q4. Cash collections were $531 million, which is an all-time record. Third-party financings were $16 million representing 3% of total cash collected. Our DSO in Q1 was 87 days, which flat is compared to Q4 and down from 89 days in Q1 of '10.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was an all-time high of $126.5 million. Q1 capital expenditures were EBITDA $21.4 million and capitalized software was $20.5 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was an all-time record of $84.7 million. We do expect capital expenditures to increase as we move through the year, but we still expect to continue generating strong operating and free cash flow.
Moving to capitalized software. The $20.5 million of capitalized software in Q1 versus 28% of the $72.6 million of total spending on the development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19.1 million, resulting in net capitalization of $1.4 million or 1% of our total R&D investment.
For the rest of the year, we expect capitalized software to be between $20 million and $22 million per quarter and amortization of $19 million to $20 million. Now let me go to the guidance.
For Q2 revenue, we expect revenue between $505 million to $520 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 12% over Q2 of '10. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.07 billion and $2.12 billion, up from our previous range of $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion. 
We expect Q2 adjusted EPS before share based compensation expense to be $0.83 to $0.87 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 23% growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $3.55 and $3.62, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth. This is up from our previous range of $3.50 to $3.60.
Q2 guidance is based on total spending before share based compensation expense of approximately $303 million to $308 million. Our estimate for the impact of share based compensation expense is $0.05 to $0.06 for Q2 and $0.21 to $0.23 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $540 million to $570 million, with the midpoint of this range reflecting 19% growth. 
In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q2, with all the metrics at or above our expected ranges. Specifically, we are pleased with our strong levels of bookings and revenue, continued margin expansion and earnings growth and record levels of operating and free cash flow generation. With that, I'll turn it the call over to"
259627,129705810,119330,"Cerner Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. As a brief introduction to those of you I haven't had the opportunity Conoco thanks starting out as Executive in our finance organization where I worked as our controller and business development leader. Since 2002,",1266,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. As a brief introduction to those of you I haven't had the opportunity Conoco thanks starting out as Executive in our finance organization where I worked as our controller and business development leader. Since 2002, I've held several roles in our client organization, most recently been focused on driving new footprints as leader of our client development organization and owning search relationship with investor on the hospitals.
I've had responsibility for employer network service offerings. With that, that the discussion of sales results and marketplace trends. I'll start first with the results. We had a very strong quarter, included excellent product at expanding relationships with existing clients while also demonstrating our competitiveness by gaining several new clients. Our bookings revenue in Q1 at $525 million  reflects 30% growth over last year as all-time high for our first quarter. Bookings this quarter included 16 contracts over $5 million, 11 of which of over $10 million. this is also a record for first quarter. Our competitiveness was strong, with 26% of bookings turning from outside our core install base. Overall, the market is very active and I believe are very well positioned with our broad and deep solution portfolio, our readiness to meet meaningful use and proven service capabilities.
This is in contrast with many of our competitors that still have solution gaps, constrained service capabilities and other types of uncertainty surrounding them. As a result, I expect Cerner to have a record year of gaining new footprint in 2011.
The breath of our solutions and services are also reflected our bookings this quarter. We had good contributions from all business models, with particular strength in license software and professional services. Additionally, our agile business units continue to drive contribution across the wide range of solutions and services. With noteworthy strengthen in our lighthouse clinical optimization, laboratory, oncology, physician practice, Healthe network revenue cycle, medical devices and community hospitals. In the physician practice space, we had very strong results in Q1. The improvements we have made in the physician-user interface and workflow have begun to be and recognized by the industry. And I believe our Q1 results reflect building momentum for physician solutions. Our competitiveness have dramatically improved. And we now have wins in each quarter against our competitors in the physician office market.
While much of our success in the physician practice solution is driven by selling through our large installed base, it is important to note that many of our new hospitals footprints included selection of ambulatory solution in their core solutions. This is evidence of our ability to offer a fully integrated EMR that is very competitive across inpatient and outpatient successful addition is a highly valued capability. In addition to our strong integrated inpatient outpatient offering, we differentiate from others in the industry with our ability and willingness to interoperate with other systems. By providing an option that doesn't require changing our systems when the client doesn't want to is the value the investments they have made, we are an attractive option compared to other suppliers that force the investment because of their inability or unwillingness to connect to other systems. 
Moving to other highlights for the quarter, our device organization had another strong quarter including 2 new RX station agreements, good contributions from our carry infused CareFusion relationship, putting us in but to have our $40 million of revenue contribution this year, strong device resale with contributions from the resale of pumps, beds, monitors and communication devices, as well as good iBus device connectivity, including 7 new 7 footprints. The progress we have made in the device space with our clients and partners are being recognized by the industry. Today's announcement that will span Cerner and were honored with the 2011 Award for Excellence in bar code-enabled patient safety as a good example.
The final line of for the quarter is that designed our third RevWorks clients and have a strong pipeline for the balance of the year. With ICD-10 looming and the likely new payment structures associated with the Organizations, we expect a wave of revenue cycle activity in the coming years, and we I believe we are well positioned.
Let's move to the geographic mix of our results. Ans Marc mentioned, our global revenue was down year-over-year, but we did have strong global this quarter, particularly in Canada where we signed a large managed services contract and in England where we added 2 NHS Trusts. We Expect a strong start of the year from a bookings standpoint, along with strong global pipeline to translate to stronger contributions in our income statement by our global businesses as the year progresses.
At the macrolevel, the fundamental of healthcare costs growing faster than overall exists in almost all countries. And IT continues to be viewed as the way to break this trend. We believe Cerner is the best-positioned global HIT company, and we remain bullish about the potential of the global HIT market. 
Turning back to the U.S., I want to provide some marketplace observations. Overall, we are seeing an unprecedented level of activity in both inside our client base and new footprint opportunities. In our client base, we continue to see strong demand as our clients move forward meaningful use roadmaps. We have already have 12 hospitals in client base receive Medicaid incentive dollars for Stage 1 Meaningful Use and several others in the process of filing for Medicare incentives. As this activity ramps up, we expect to lead the industry in clients achieving Meaningful Use.
Importantly, we are seeing strong demand for solutions and services beyond Meaningful Use, as our clients prepare for other regulatory requirements and industry shifts. This includes clients looking for the revenue cycle capabilities to prepare for ICD-10 requirements, review their clinical processes, quality levels and reporting capabilities to be ready for value-placed purchasing and evaluating various strategies which will require additional IT investments to support capabilities such as evidence-based practices, predictive modeling, remote monitoring across all transitions of care.
All of these factors are also a major focus for our prospective clients. As a result, our readiness for Meaningful Use is just a way which I believe we will continue to do very well in new footprint opportunities. Our ability to demonstrate capabilities that enable prospective clients to navigate through Meaningful Use while preparing them to address the changing world beyond Meaningful Use makes us a very attractive choice compared to many competitors who are focused only on achieving the Meaningful Use hurl.
A final comment I would like to make on the marketplace is that I believe all the factors I have discussed will drive a multi-year period of strong demand that aligns very well to our core solutions and services. This is not just a 12 to 18 month wave that some people expect. Because of the multiple relates to Meaningful Use and the different levels of existing adoption across the industry, all of the purchasing related to the stimulus will not occur at once. 
Further, all the other industry dynamics, such as health reform, value-based purchasing, ICD-10 and will extend the wave of demand. I believe our capabilities are further even differentiated when you look beyond Safe 1 Meaningful Use and the IT needs that will be driven by the reform and value-based purchasing. As a result, I expect revenue to gain share gain to extend through this multiyear period. In summary, I'm very pleased with strong results in Q1, and I think we're well positioned for an outstanding year. With that I'll turn the call over to Mike."

For those of you I haven't met a t one of our Analyst Day and meetings at our headquarters, I've been with Cerner since 1996. For the last several years about responsibility for IP development CernerWorks, ITWorks and supports organizations. In my new role as COO, I have added responsibilities for elements in client organization activities, including sales and professional services. Today, I'm going to focus my comments on professional services, CernerWorks and ITWorks.
I'll start with our Professional Services business, which had a great start to the year with a record level of bookings for first quarter. The organization continues to contribute nicely to our income statement, representing a visible element of both revenue and earnings growth. Our execution on projects has been strong. And we remain ahead of schedule on most projects. We also remain on track with our hiring, which has allowed us to ensure our projects are fully staffed on the plan start base. We now have over 2,500 associates at our professional services organization, which is the largest IT consulting organization in healthcare IT organization in the world. We're also the most experienced with an average of more than 5 years of experience across our organization even when you include the recent increase in new hires, which often come directly from college campuses. Our size, scale, experience and ability to deliver editable outcomes at a predictable cost are major differentiators in the marketplace.
Another element of our differentiating services capabilities is CernerWorks Managed Services, which provide some of scale and service level. As an example, we support approximately 130,000 peak users to our data centers in Q1 and had an uptime approaching four 9 or 99.9% system availability. In addition to our unrivaled scale and service levels, we continue to bring down the cost of ownership, which makes the offering even more attractive to our clients. As a result, almost all new client select our managed services offering and our existing U.S. client base is steadily migrating.
More recently, the demand for these capabilities is picking up outside the U.S. as well. A good example is the large Canadian client that engaged us to provide our managed service offering in Q1. There are several additional global much services opportunities in our pipeline, so we expect global to become a meaningful contributor to this business in the future quarters.
We also continue to leverage our infrastructure and skills sets to add to our portfolio of managed services via the cloud delivery model. A recent example of these is skybox storage. Which is a secure enterprise cloud storage service that allows clients to expand storage capacity in a way that is seamlessly integrated with their existing data solutions. It allows for consolidation of storage for packs, radiology, lab and other clinical systems. Our ability to offer these on-demand service in a secure and easily accessible manner is generating a lot of interest among our existing clients and is something that can also be offered outside of our existing client base.
We also have other skybox cloud services for areas such as security, backup in desktop, which we offer high-quality service with low upfront and ongoing cost compared to traditional models. 
Moving on to Cerner ITWorks, while we did not sign an ITWorks client in Q1, we did have a scope expansion at an existing client, and we have a very strong pipeline of new clients. The demand is largely being driven by increased awareness of these success that we but in our first 6 clients. Many other clients are attracted to ITWorks because they realize they don't have enough internal capabilities to navigate beyond Stage 1 of Meaningful Use or address upcoming challenges related to the health reform, value-based purchasing and ICD-10.
With our existing ITWorks clients, we have quickly proven that this is not just another IT outsourcing service. ITWorks offers a strategic alignment with our clients that goes beyond traditional outsourcing. While part of the service does lead to the expected benefits of leveraging our scale to improve their basic IT operations, we've seen the most significant progress accelerating clinical adoption and innovation at the edges of healthcare. A great example of this is our first ITWorks client, University of Missouri, who went from stage 2 on a EMR adoption model to stage 6 in just 1 year. University of Missouri has also been a major contributor to our medical home, condition management and population health initiatives. 
Other ITWorks clients have proven to be cutting edge by being early adopters in new offerings such as Smart Rooms, Chart Search, physician iPad apps and RevWorks. Another noteworthy observation is that similar to CernerWorks, we are starting to see demand outside the U.S. for ITWorks offering. This new demand for services clearly enhances our growth opportunity in the coming years and align Cerner with the larger portion with the healthcare spending, not just in the U.S. but around the world.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Similar to past calls, I'm going to talk about some of our initiatives in Cerner's evolution from focus on helping clients automate the care process to focus on both health and care, as well as the role of our Healthe Intent platform in accelerating the impact of a digitized care delivery system. As and Mike, have discussed, Cerner is very well positioned for strong growth in coming years. Most of this growth will be tied to digitizing the core healthcare. We believe this digitization sets the stage for another significant wave of growth. Much of this will come from our focus on the health part of healthcare. Because when the course digitized, the level of consumer health awareness is possible. While the majority of the dialogue today is around cost, we see the entire landscape is more of an iceberg, with cost of care being above the surface. The much larger population and future costs associated with the health and well being of that population lurking below the surface. As we demonstrated during our Investor Day, the majority of the highlighted solutions were running in the cloud as part of our Healthe Intent platform. This allows us both to advance innovations more quickly based on the nature of that platform, but also introduces a new layer of capabilities above individual enterprise addressing the range of offerings from coordination in care, quality monitoring and consumer engagement. As many of you know, Cerner spent the last 5 years trying to crack the code on making health pay. We've made changes to our health plan prior to third-party administrator launched the new age on-site clinic and pharmacy incorporated biometric measurements for our population, realigned the economic incentive for Associates in our health plan and rolled out a data-driven wellness management program. We have also revamped our on-campus cafeterias to include healthier meals and encouraged fresh thinking about work environments, incorporating options such as standing workstations. As this past fall, our Executive Cabinet engaged our Associates in the weight-loss competition that has today, resulted in about 10 tons of weight loss across our associate base. These changes allowed us to do what all employers want to do: spend the healthcare cost curves significantly. But more importantly, improve the health status of our associates and their families. In addition, these health  initiatives and shaped our employer services offerings and provided insights to create solutions for our provider clients, who will soon be intended to drive healthier outcomes through new reimbursement models, such as accountable care organizations. I wanted to share some foundational statistics on a set of our early initiatives around this platform as we introduce both search and last fall and have also discuss our progress on the Cerner Network from time-to-time.
The quarter concept of cloud initiatives is data liquidity from the enterprised sources within healthcare. Recently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology announced the project directed reached a major milestone. This was a collaborative nationwide effort, with over 200 participants across more than 50 organizations to defining and create simple interrupt solution for healthcare, making that available as open source. As part of that effort, Cerner became the primary source code contributor to direct projects reference implementation. It shows both our commitment to interoperability across the industry and our fundamental understanding as the potential have for our health economy that data liquidity becomes reality more quickly.
The ability to contractually share information is a growing reality, driven by the meaningful use criteria, healthcare reform, increasing quality metrics and new coordination in care delivery models. Through our Cerner Network offerings, we have now achieved in the Robert interoperability with over 46 different EMR platforms across 40 health systems, 166 hospitals, more than 65,000 physicians. Just last month, we surpassed the $70 million transaction mark for the month. These are transactions that are specifically targeted to share information across providers, payers and patients. This represents more than a 50% growth in the last 6 months. And more importantly, we've seen a 5x growth in clinical volumes over the last 12 months.
We expect the clinical volumes will exceed financial by the end of this year and is driven by both the increase of EMR deployments and the early realization of what's possible when both ends of the communication are digitized. Most important, these are providing real efficiency and workflow savings within the care delivery process and will continue to yield new business model opportunities.
 After completing our pilot validation, with the Healthe Intent Chart Search late last year, we are now approaching 15% of our clients actively engaged in deployment and/or use of this solution. When Meaningful Use has the day-to-day attention of our clients, because this is a cloud service, we have been able to activate this offering without disruption to the Meaningful Use journeys. And on average is taking about 4 to 6 weeks implement in history. It only represents a fraction of the eventual volumes, but today, we have more than 40 terabytes of data growing at a rate of 230 gigabytes a day, processing and indexing between 250 and 350 million records daily. The advancement of the algorithms continue to grow as our volume and diversity of information grows with them.
As a byproduct to these efforts, we have also seen an increase in complementary solution demand, which also leverages the data liquidity web. Both ColonSentry the public automation solution in Halifax, a multi-year blended research and benchmarking repository, have seen progress from these efforts. Today, help fax contains more than 29 million unique individuals and as a sampling of clinical breadth, more than 1.7 billion lab results. We are on course to double the contribution volume to this platform by the end of the year. As we've previously mentioned, the St. John's sepsis agent, which targets the 750,000 Americans were affected by sepsis each year. This refined and improved using this very large contextually structured clinical repository, creating a closed loop for not only Discovery, but continuous and contextual improvement in clinical decision support. 
Last, I want to mention a recent announcement from earlier in the week. Cerner was selected by the Missouri Health Connection to enter in negotiations to be the technical service provider for the State of Missouri's Health Information Exchange. This too is a part of our Healthe Intent cloud-based services platform. The potential reach of this joint effort will cover over 750 provider organizations, 20,000 physicians and nearly 6 million Missourians, positioning Missouri to become one of the first clipboard-free states in the union. 
As we demonstrated to during the Analyst Day in March, there is a greater potential for the new to change the current state of healthcare and create a more significant opportunity around health than care. I wanted to take the time to step back and help frame some of the emerging building blocks reviewing the information and content that will make this possible.
With that I'll turn the call over for questions."

But overall, for the year, we will be probably at or below the $130 million that we previously used as our base.

We are getting good activity and we actually see the activities will extend from our installed base, from our current clients. We're highly competitive in the new clients that are entering the marketplace for acquisitions. Part of that new buying that got discussed here a second ago, some of our competitors installed base because there is a window here where it's going to force a lot of decisions. And there's probably not too many install bases that are in great shape. We are in great shape. We are not the only one, but there's a lot of people that put together not real strong companies over the last 20 years. And kind of strength as being applied here. And then you all got it, frankly globally, most because we've always focused on the clinical side, there is a strong marketplace outside the U.S. and you kind of throw a dart at it and we'll carry the story was happy with those countries.

We are pleased to have Zane Burke and Mike Nill with us on the call today. Zane and Mike are both seasoned leaders who have contributed significantly to Cerner's success, and we look forward to having them share their insights on the call.
Now I will turn to our results. All key measures in Q1 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by nearly $60 million. Our income statement performance was very good with revenue and adjusted EPS above our guidance and consensus and continued strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We again had excellent cash flow performance, with record levels of free cash flow both reflective of strong earnings quality.
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q1 was $525 million, which is the best result for first quarter in the company history. Bookings significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range and were up 30% from Q1 of '10. Bookings margin in Q1 was $443 million or 84% of total bookings.
The total backlog increased 19% year-over-year to $5.3 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.46 billion is 21% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totals $666 million, up 6% year-over-year.
Revenue in the quarter was $491.7 million, which is up 14% over Q1 of '10. The revenue composition for Q1 was $140 million in system sales, $132 million in support and maintenance, $209 million in services and $10 million in reimbursed travel. System sales revenue reflects 20% growth from Q1 of 2010 with double-digit growth in all areas including software, hardware, device resale, sublicensed software and subscriptions.
Our device resale business continues to gain significant traction, and had its best quarter in terms of revenue since we launched that business. Services revenues was up 16% compared to Q1 of '10, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support maintenance revenue increased 4% over Q1 of '10. We expect growth in support to increase as we move through the year.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $420 million. Global revenue to $71 million was down 7% against a tough Q1 comparable. It was up 4% sequentially, and we expect stronger growth for the remainder of the year based on strong Q1 global bookings and a strong pipeline.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 81.6%, which is down 260 basis points year-over-year and up 60 basis point sequentially. Gross margin continues to be impacted by strength in device resale and increased in third-party services. As we indicated last quarter, we expect gross margin to remain in the low 80s, but we expect to continue expanding operating margins, which we did again this quarter despite lower gross margins.
Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter operating expenses were $299.9 million before share-based compensation expense of $7.4 million. Total operating expense was up 6% compared to Q1 of '10. 
Sales and client service expenses increased 7% compared to Q1 of '10, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. Our investment in software development increased 6% compared to a year ago quarter, and G&A expense increased 3% year-over-year.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q1 was 20.6% before share-based compensation expense. This is up 180 basis points compared to Q1 of '10, which is at the high end of our 100 to 200 basis point target. 
Moving to earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were 600 -- or $64.6 million or $0.75 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings includes share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.6 million or $0.05 per share.
Adjusted net earnings were $69.1 million and adjusted EPS was $0.80, which is up 27% compared to Q1 of '10. Our tax rate in Q1 was 32.9%, which benefited from lower foreign taxes in the quarter.
For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be 34.5%. Note that applying this annual tax rate to normalized Q1 tax expense would have reduced earnings per share by $0.02.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $949 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $835 million in Q4. Total cash and investments includes $611 million of cash and short-term investments and $338 million of highly rated corporate government bonds with maturities over one year. Our total debt is $101 million. 
Total accounts receivable ended the quarter at $469 million, which is down $8 million from Q4 due to strong cash collections.
Contracts receivable, or the unbilled portion of receivables, were $133 million and represent 28% of total receivables compared to 29% in Q4. Cash collections were $531 million, which is an all-time record. Third-party financings were $16 million, representing 3% of total cash collected. Our DSO in Q1 was 87 days, which is flat compared to Q4 and down from 89 days in Q1 of '10.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was an all-time high of $126.5 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $21.4 million, and capitalized software was $20.5 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was an all-time record of $84.7 million. We do expect capital expenditures to increase as we move through the year, but we still expect to continue generating strong operating and free cash flow.
Moving to capitalized software. The $20.5 million of capitalized software in Q1 represents 28% of the $72.6 million of total spending on the development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19.1 million, resulting in net capitalization of $1.4 million or 1% of our total R&D investment.
For the rest of the year, we expect capitalized software to be between $20 million and $22 million per quarter and amortization of $19 million to $20 million. Now let me go to the guidance.
For Q2 revenue, we expect revenue between $505 million and $520 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 12% over Q2 of '10. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.07 billion and $2.12 billion, up from our previous range of $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion. 
We expect Q2 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.83 to $0.87 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 23% growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $3.55 and $3.62, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth. This is up from our previous range of $3.50 to $3.60.
Q2 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $303 million to $308 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is $0.05 to $0.06 for Q2 and $0.21 to $0.23 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $540 million to $570 million, with the midpoint of this range reflecting 19% growth. 
In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q2, with all key metrics at or above our expected ranges. Specifically, we are pleased with our strong levels of bookings and revenue, continued margin expansion and earnings growth and record levels of operating and free cash flow generation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

As a brief introduction for those of you I haven't had the opportunity to meet. I have been at Cerner since 1996, starting out as executive in our finance organization where I worked for Marc as our corporate contro",1311,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. As a brief introduction for those of you I haven't had the opportunity to meet. I have been at Cerner since 1996, starting out as executive in our finance organization where I worked for Marc as our corporate controller and business development leader. Since 2002, I have held several roles in our client organization, most recently been focused on driving new footprints as leader of our Client Development Organization and owning Cerner's relationship with investor-owned hospitals.  Additionally, I have had responsibility for employer network service offerings. 
With that, I'll move to the discussion of our sales results and marketplace trends. I'll start first with the results. We had a very strong quarter, included good progress at expanding our relationships with existing clients, while also demonstrating our competitiveness by gaining several new clients. Our bookings revenue in Q1 of $525 million reflects 30% growth over last year as all-time high for our first quarter. Bookings this quarter included 16 contracts over $5 million, 11 of which were over $10 million. This is also a record for first quarter. 
Our competitiveness was strong, with 26% of bookings turning from outside of our core Millennium installed base. Overall, the market is very active and I believe Cerner is extremely well positioned with our broad and deep solution portfolio, our readiness to meet Meaningful Use and proven service capabilities.
This is in contrast with many of our competitors that still have solution gaps, constrained service capabilities and other types of uncertainty surrounding them. As a result, I expect Cerner to have a record year of gaining new footprints in 2011.
The breadth of our solutions and services are also reflected in our bookings this quarter. We had good contributions from all business models, with particular strength in license software and professional services. Additionally, our agile business units continue to drive contribution across the wide range of solutions and services, with noteworthy strength in our Lighthouse clinical optimization, laboratory, oncology, physician practice, Healthe Network and Hub, revenue cycle, medical devices and community hospitals. In the physician practice space, we had very strong results in Q1. The improvements we have made in the physician-user interface and workflow have begun to be and recognized by the industry. And I believe our Q1 results reflect building momentum for physician solutions. Our competitiveness have dramatically improved. And we now have wins in each quarter against all competitors in the physician office market.
While much of our success in the physician practice solution is driven by selling through our large installed base, it is important to note that many of our new hospitals footprints included the selection of ambulatory solution in their core solutions. This is evidence of our ability to offer a fully integrated EMR [electronic medical record] that is very competitive across inpatient and outpatient venues is a highly valued capability. In addition to our strong integrated inpatient-outpatient offering, we differentiate from others in the industry with our ability and willingness to inter-operate with other systems. By providing an option that doesn't require changing out all systems when the client doesn't want to lose the value of the investments they have made, we are an attractive option compared to other suppliers that force the reinvestment because of their inability or unwillingness to connect to other systems. 
Moving to other highlights for the quarter: Our DeviceWorks organization had another strong quarter including 2 new RxStation agreements; good contributions from our carry infused CareFusion relationship, putting us on a path to have over $40 million of revenue contribution this year; strong device resale with contributions from the resale of pumps, beds, monitors and communication devices; as well as good iBus device connectivity, including 7 new footprints. The progress we have made in the device space with our clients and partners is being well recognized by the industry. Today's announcement that WellSpan, Cerner and Hospira were honored with the 2011 Way-Paver Award for Excellence in Barcode-Enabled Patient Safety is a good example.
A final highlight of for the quarter is that we signed our third RevWorks client and have a strong pipeline for the balance of the year. With ICD-10 looming and the likely new payment structures associated with Accountable Care Organizations, we expect a wave of revenue cycle activity in the coming years, and believe we are well positioned.
Let's move to the geographic mix of our results. As Marc mentioned, our global revenue was down year-over-year, but we did have a strong global bookings quarter, particularly in Canada where we signed a large managed services contract and in England where we added 2 NHS Trusts. We Expect a strong start of the year from a bookings standpoint, along with strong a global pipeline to translate to stronger contributions in our income statement by our global businesses as the year progresses.
At the macro level, the fundamental problem of healthcare costs growing faster than overall economy exists in almost all countries. And IT continues to be viewed as the way to break this trend. We believe Cerner is the best positioned global HIT [healthcare information technology] company, and we remain bullish about the potential of the global HIT market. 
Turning back to the U.S., I want to provide some marketplace observations. Overall, we are seeing an unprecedented level of activity both inside our client base and in new footprint opportunities. In our client base, we continue to see strong demand as our clients move forward with their Meaningful Use roadmaps. We have already had 12 hospitals in our client base receive Medicaid incentive dollars for Stage 1 Meaningful Use and several others in the process of filing for Medicare incentives. As this activity ramps up, we expect to lead the industry in clients achieving Meaningful Use.
Importantly, we are seeing strong demand for solutions and services beyond Meaningful Use, as our clients prepare for other regulatory requirements and industry shifts. This includes clients looking for the revenue cycle capabilities to prepare for ICD-10 requirements, review their clinical processes, quality levels and reporting capabilities to be ready for value-based purchasing and evaluating various ACO [Accountable Care Organization] strategies, which will require additional IT investments to support capabilities such as evidence-based practices, predictive modeling, remote monitoring across all transitions of care.
All of these factors are also a major focus for our prospective clients. As a result, our readiness for Meaningful Use is just a way why I believe we will continue to do very well in new footprint opportunities. Our ability to demonstrate capabilities that enable prospective clients to navigate through Meaningful Use while preparing them to address the changing world beyond Meaningful Use makes us a very attractive choice compared to many competitors who are focused only on achieving the Meaningful Use hurdle.
A final comment I would like to make on the marketplace is that I believe all the factors I have discussed will drive a multi-year period of strong demand that aligns very well to our core solutions and services. This is not just a 12 to 18 month wave that some people expect. Because of the multiple steps related to Meaningful Use and the different levels of existing adoption across the industry, all of the purchasing related to stimulus will not occur at once. 
Further, all the other industry dynamics, such as health reform, value-based purchasing, ICD-10 and HIPAA 5010 will extend the wave of demand. I believe our capabilities are further even differentiated when you look beyond Stage 1 Meaningful Use and at the IT needs that will be driven by reform and value-based purchasing. As a result, I expect our ability to gain share gain to extend through this multi-year period. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong results in Q1, and I think we're well positioned for an outstanding year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

For those of you I haven't met at one of our analysts' days or meetings at our headquarters, I've been with Cerner since 1996. For the last several years have had responsibility for IP development CernerWorks, ITWorks and support organizations. In my new role as COO, I have added responsibilities for elements of the client organization activities, including sales and professional services. Today, I'm going to focus my comments on professional services, CernerWorks and ITWorks.
I'll start with our professional services business, which had a great start to the year with a record level of bookings for our first quarter. The organization continues to contribute nicely to our income statement, representing a visible element of both revenue and earnings growth. Our execution on projects has been strong, and we remain ahead of schedule on most projects. 
We also remain on track with our hiring, which has allowed us to ensure our projects are fully staffed on the planned start dates. We now have over 2,500 associates in our professional services organization, which is the largest IT consulting organization in healthcare IT organization in the world. We are also the most experienced with an average of more than 5 years of experience across our organization even when you include the recent increase in new hires, which often come directly from college campuses. Our size, scale, experience and ability to deliver predictable outcomes at a predictable cost are major differentiators in the marketplace.
Another element of our differentiating services capabilities is CernerWorks managed services, which provides unmatched scale and service level. As an example, we support approximately 130,000 peak users to our data centers in Q1 and had an uptime approaching four nines or 99.9% system availability. In addition to our unrivaled scale and service levels, we continue to bring down the cost of ownership, which makes the offering even more attractive to our clients. As a result, almost all new client select our managed services offering and our existing U.S. client base is steadily migrating.
More recently, the demand for these capabilities is picking up outside the U.S. as well. A good example is the large Canadian client that engaged us to provide our managed service offering in Q1. There are several additional global managed services opportunities in our pipeline, so we expect global to become a meaningful contributor to this business in future quarters.
We also continue to leverage our infrastructure and skills sets to add to our portfolio of managed services via the cloud delivery model. A recent example of these is Skybox storage, which is a secure enterprise cloud storage service that allows clients to expand storage capacity in a way that is seamlessly integrated with their existing data solutions. It allows for consolidation of storage for PACS [Picture Archiving and Communications System], radiology, lab and other clinical systems. Our ability to offer these on-demand service in a secure and easily accessible manner is generating a lot of interest among our existing clients and is something that can also be offered outside of our existing client base.
We also have other Skybox cloud services for areas such as security, backup and desktop, which we offer high-quality service with low upfront and ongoing cost compared to traditional models. 
Moving on to Cerner ITWorks, while we did not sign an ITWorks client in Q1, we did have a scope expansion at an existing client, and we have a very strong pipeline for new clients. The demand is largely being driven by increased awareness of the success that we've had in our first 6 clients. Many other clients are attracted to ITWorks because they realize they don't have enough internal capabilities to navigate beyond Stage 1 of Meaningful Use or address upcoming challenges related to health reform, value-based purchasing and ICD-10. 
With our existing ITWorks clients, we have quickly proven that this is not just another IT outsourcing service. ITWorks offers a strategic alignment with our clients that goes beyond traditional outsourcing. While part of the service does lead to the expected benefits of leveraging our scale to improve their basic IT operations, we have seen the most significant progress at accelerating clinical adoption and innovation at the edges of healthcare. A great example of this is our first ITWorks client, University of Missouri, who went from Stage 2 on HIMSS EMR Adoption Model to Stage 6 in just one year. University of Missouri has also been a major contributor to our medical home, condition management and population health initiatives. 
Other ITWorks clients have proven to be cutting edge by being early adopters in new offerings such as Smart Rooms, Chart Search, Physician iPad apps and RevWorks. Another noteworthy observation is that similar to CernerWorks, we are starting to see demand outside the U.S. for ITWorks offering. This new demand for services clearly enhances our growth opportunity in the coming years and align Cerner with the larger portion of the healthcare spending, not just in the U.S. but around the world.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Similar to past calls, I'm going to talk about some of our initiatives in Cerner's evolution from a focus on helping clients automate the care process to focus on both health and care, as well as the role of our Healthe Intent platform in ac",1188,"Thanks, Mike. Similar to past calls, I'm going to talk about some of our initiatives in Cerner's evolution from a focus on helping clients automate the care process to focus on both health and care, as well as the role of our Healthe Intent platform in accelerating the impact of a digitized care delivery system. 
As Zane and Mike have discussed, Cerner is very well positioned for strong growth in coming years. Most of this growth will be tied to digitizing the core of healthcare. We believe this digitization sets the stage for another significant wave of growth. Much of this will come from our focus on the health part of healthcare, because when the core is digitized, a new level of consumer health awareness is possible. While the majority of the dialogue today is around cost, we see the entire landscape is more of an iceberg, with cost of care being above the surface. The much larger population and future costs associated with the health and well being of that population lurking below the surface. As we demonstrated during our investor day, the majority of the highlighted solutions were running in the cloud as part of our Healthe Intent platform. This allows us both to advance innovations more quickly based on the nature of that platform, but also introduces a new layer of capabilities above the individual enterprise, addressing the range of offerings from coordination of care, quality monitoring and consumer engagement. As many of you know, Cerner spent the last 5 years trying to crack the code on making good health pay. We've made changes to our health plan prior to third-party administrator launched the new age on-site clinic and pharmacy incorporated biometric measurements for our population, realigned the economic incentive for associates in our health plan and rolled out a data-driven wellness management program. 
We have also revamped our on-campus cafeterias to include healthier meals and encouraged fresh thinking about work environments, incorporating options such as standing workstations. As this past fall, our executive cabinet engaged our associates in the weight-loss competition that has today, resulted in about 10 tons of weight loss across our associate base. These changes allowed us to do what all employers want to do: bend the healthcare cost curves significantly. But more importantly, improve the health status of our associates and their families. In addition, these health  initiatives have shaped our employer services offerings and provided insights to create solutions for our provider clients, who will soon be incented to drive healthier outcomes through new reimbursement models, such as Accountable Care Organizations. 
I wanted to share some foundational statistics on a set of our early initiatives around this platform as we introduce both search and sepsis last fall and have also discussed our progress on the Cerner Network from time-to-time.
A core concept to fuel our cloud initiatives is data liquidity from the enterprised sources within healthcare. Recently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology announced the Project Direct had reached a major milestone. This was a collaborative nationwide effort, with over 200 participants across more than 50 organizations to define and create a simple interop solution for healthcare, making that available as open source. As part of that effort, Cerner became the primary source code contributor to Direct Project's Java Reference Implementation. It shows both our commitment to interoperability across the industry and our fundamental understanding of the potential ahead for our health economy, if data liquidity becomes a reality more quickly.
The ability to contextually share information is a growing reality, driven by the meaningful use criteria, healthcare reform, increasing quality metrics and new coordination in care delivery models. Through our Cerner Network offerings, we have now achieved interoperability with over 46 different EMR platforms across 40 health systems, 166 hospitals, more than 65,000 physicians. Just last month, we surpassed the $70 million transaction mark for the month. These are transactions that are specifically targeted to share information across providers, payers and patients. This represents more than a 50% growth in the last 6 months. And more importantly, we've seen a 5x growth in clinical volumes over the last 12 months.
We expect the clinical volumes will exceed financial by the end of this year and is driven by both the increase of EMR deployments and the early realization of what's possible when both ends of the communication are digitized. Most important, these are providing real efficiency and workflow savings within the care delivery process and will continue to yield new business model opportunities.
After completing our pilot validation, with the Healthe Intent, Chart Search, late last year, we are now approaching 15% of our clients actively engaged in deployment and/or use of this solution. While Meaningful Use has the day-to-day attention of our clients, because this is a cloud service, we have been able to activate this offering without disruption to the Meaningful Use journeys. And on average is taking about 4 to 6 weeks to implement and backload history. It only represents a fraction of the eventual volumes, but today, we have more than 40 terabytes of data, growing at a rate of 230 gigabytes a day, processing and indexing between 250 and 350 million records daily. The learning advancement of the algorithms continue to grow as our volume and diversity of information grows with them.
As a byproduct to these efforts, we have also seen an increase in complementary solution demand, which also leverages the data liquidity wave. Both Health Sentry, a public health submission solution, and Health Facts, a multi-year blended research and benchmarking repository, have seen progress from these efforts. Today, Health Facts contains more than 29 million unique individuals and as a sampling of clinical breadth, more than 1.7 billion lab results. We are on course to double the contribution volume to this platform by the end of the year. As we have previously mentioned, the St. John Sepsis agent, which targets the 750,000 Americans who are affected by sepsis each year. This refined and improved using this very large contextually structured clinical repository, creating a closed loop for not only discovery, but continuous and contextual improvement in clinical decision support. 
Last, I want to mention a recent announcement from earlier in the week. Cerner was selected by the Missouri Health Connection to enter in negotiations to be the technical service provider for the State of Missouri's Health Information Exchange. This too is a part of our Healthe Intent cloud-based services platform. The potential reach of this joint effort will cover over 750 provider organizations, 20,000 physicians and nearly 6 million Missourians, positioning Missouri to become one of the first clipboard-free states in the union. 
As we demonstrated to during analyst day in March, there is a greater potential for the new middle to change the current state of healthcare and create a more significant opportunity around health than care. I wanted to take the time to step back and help frame some of the emerging building blocks that are fueling the information and content that will make this possible.
With that I'll turn the call over for questions."

So for this quarter, we had approximately 25% to 30% range was coming from the 7-year type bookings. And that's probably actually a little bit lower than we've seen in the last, probably, 4 to 8 quarters. So I think bookings still is a very good measure of our future short term, and as well as longer-term opportunities, but this quarter there was no -- the over attainment on our bookings guidance was really broad. It was across the spectrum in every area, from services to software and managed services was right in its normal percent range of a bigger number.

And then I think we are demonstrating to you here to that there's a great team and there is this company is got a lot of talent. And the talent is broad and deep.

Zane and Mike are both seasoned leaders who have contributed significantly to Cerner's success, and we look forward to having them share their insights on the call.
Now I will turn to our results. All key measures in Q1 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by nearly $60 million. Our income statement performance was very good with revenue and adjusted EPS above our guidance and consensus and continued strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We again had excellent cash flow performance, with record levels of free cash flow both reflective of strong earnings quality.
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q1 was $525 million, which is the best result for first quarter in the company history. Bookings significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range and were up 30% from Q1 of '10. Bookings margin in Q1 was $443 million or 84% of total bookings.
The total backlog increased 19% year-over-year to $5.3 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.46 billion is 21% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totals $666 million, up 6% year-over-year.
Revenue in the quarter was $491.7 million, which is up 14% over Q1 of '10. The revenue composition for Q1 was $140 million in system sales, $132 million in support and maintenance, $209 million in services and $10 million in reimbursed travel. System sales revenue reflects 20% growth from Q1 of 2010 with double-digit growth in all areas including software, hardware, device resale, sublicensed software and subscriptions.
Our device resale business continues to gain significant traction, and had its best quarter in terms of revenue since we launched that business. Services revenues was up 16% compared to Q1 of '10, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support maintenance revenue increased 4% over Q1 of '10. We expect growth in support to increase as we move through the year.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $420 million. Global revenue to $71 million was down 7% against a tough Q1 comparable. It was up 4% sequentially, and we expect stronger growth for the remainder of the year based on strong Q1 global bookings and a strong pipeline.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 81.6%, which is down 260 basis points year-over-year and up 60 basis point sequentially. Gross margin continues to be impacted by strength in device resale and increased in third-party services. As we indicated last quarter, we expect gross margin to remain in the low 80s, but we expect to continue expanding operating margins, which we did again this quarter despite lower gross margins.
Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter operating expenses were $299.9 million for share-based compensation expense of $7.4 million. Total operating expense was up 6% compared to Q1 of '10. 
Sales and client service expenses increased 7% compared to Q1 of '10, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. Our investment in software development increased 6% compared to the year ago quarter, and G&A expense increased 3% year-over-year.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q1 was 20.6% before share-based compensation expense. This is up 180 basis points compared to Q1 of '10, which is at the high end of our 100 to 200 basis point target. 
Moving to earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were 600 -- or $64.6 million or $0.75 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings includes share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.6 million or $0.05 per share.
Adjusted net earnings were $69.1 million and adjusted EPS was $0.80, which is up 27% compared to Q1 of '10. Our tax rate in Q1 was 32.9%, which benefited from lower foreign taxes in the quarter.
For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be 34.5%. Note that applying this annual tax rate to normalized Q1 tax expense would have reduced earnings per share by $0.02.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $949 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $835 million in Q4. Total cash and investments includes $611 million of cash and short-term investments and $338 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities over one year. Our total debt is $101 million. 
Total accounts receivable ended the quarter at $469 million, which is down $8 million from Q4 due to strong cash collections.
Contracts receivable, or the unbilled portion of receivables, were $133 million and represent 28% of total receivables compared to 29% in Q4. Cash collections were $531 million, which is an all-time record. Third-party financings were $16 million, representing 3% of total cash collected. Our DSO in Q1 was 87 days, which is flat compared to Q4 and down from 89 days in Q1 of '10.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was an all-time high of $126.5 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $21.4 million, and capitalized software was $20.5 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was an all-time record of $84.7 million. We do expect capital expenditures to increase as we move through the year, but we still expect to continue generating strong operating and free cash flow.
Moving to capitalized software. The $20.5 million of capitalized software in Q1 represents 28% of the $72.6 million of total spending on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19.1 million, resulting in net capitalization of $1.4 million or 1% of our total R&D investment.
For the rest of the year, we expect capitalized software to be between $20 million and $22 million per quarter and amortization of $19 million to $20 million. Now let me go to the guidance.
For Q2 revenue, we expect revenue between $505 million and $520 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 12% over Q2 of '10. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.07 billion and $2.12 billion, up from our previous range of $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion. 
We expect Q2 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.83 to $0.87 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 23% growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $3.55 and $3.62, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth. This is up from our previous range of $3.50 to $3.60.
Q2 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $303 million to $308 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is $0.05 to $0.06 for Q2 and $0.21 to $0.23 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $540 million to $570 million, with the midpoint of this range reflecting 19% growth. 
In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q2, with all key metrics at or above our expected ranges. Specifically, we are pleased with our strong levels of bookings and revenue, continued margin expansion and earnings growth and record levels of operating and free cash flow generation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

As a brief introduction for those of you I haven't had the opportunity to meet. I have been at Cerner since 1996, starting out as an executive in our finance organization where I worked for Marc as our corporate con",1308,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. As a brief introduction for those of you I haven't had the opportunity to meet. I have been at Cerner since 1996, starting out as an executive in our finance organization where I worked for Marc as our corporate controller and business development leader. Since 2002, I have held several roles in our client organization, most recently being focused on driving new footprints as leader of our Client Development Organization and owning Cerner's relationship with investor-owned hospitals.  Additionally, I have had responsibility for employer network service offerings. 
With that, I'll move to the discussion of our sales results and marketplace trends. I'll start first with the results. We had a very strong quarter, included excellent progress at expanding our relationships with existing clients, while also demonstrating our competitiveness by gaining several new clients. Our bookings revenue in Q1 of $525 million reflects 30% growth over last year as all-time high for our first quarter. Bookings this quarter included 16 contracts over $5 million, 11 of which were over $10 million. This is also a record for first quarter. 
Our competitiveness was strong, with 26% of bookings turning from outside of our core Millennium installed base. Overall, the market is very active and I believe Cerner is extremely well positioned with our broad and deep solution portfolio, our readiness to meet Meaningful Use and proven service capabilities.
This is in contrast with many of our competitors that still have solution gaps, constrained service capabilities and other types of uncertainty surrounding them. As a result, I expect Cerner to have a record year of gaining new footprints in 2011.
The breadth of our solutions and services are also reflected in our bookings this quarter. We had good contributions from all business models, with particular strength in license software and professional services. Additionally, our agile business units continue to drive contribution across the wide range of solutions and services, with noteworthy strength in our Lighthouse clinical optimization, laboratory, oncology, physician practice, Healthe Network and Hub, revenue cycle, medical devices and community hospitals. In the physician practice space, we had very strong results in Q1. The improvements we have made to the physician-user interface and workflow have begun to be and recognized by the industry. And I believe our Q1 results reflect building momentum for physician solutions. Our competitiveness has dramatically improved. And we now have wins in each quarter against all competitors in the physician office market.
While much of our success in the physician practice solution is driven by selling through our large installed base, it is important to note that many of our new hospitals footprints included the selection of ambulatory solution in their core solutions. This is evidence of our ability to offer a fully integrated EMR [electronic medical record] that is very competitive across inpatient and outpatient venues is a highly valued capability. In addition to our strong integrated inpatient-outpatient offering, we differentiate from others in the industry with our ability and willingness to inter-operate with other systems. By providing an option that doesn't require changing out all systems when the client doesn't want to lose the value of the investments they have made, we are an attractive option compared to other suppliers that force the reinvestment because of their inability or unwillingness to connect to other systems. 
Moving to other highlights for the quarter: Our DeviceWorks organization had another strong quarter including 2 new RxStation agreements; good contributions from our CareFusion relationship, putting us on a path to have over $40 million of revenue contribution this year; strong device resale with contributions from the resale of pumps, beds, monitors and communication devices; as well as good iBus device connectivity, including 7 new footprints. The progress we have made in the device space with our clients and partners is being well recognized by the industry. Today's announcement that WellSpan, Cerner and Hospira were honored with the 2011 Way-Paver Award for Excellence in Barcode-Enabled Patient Safety is a good example.
A final highlight for the quarter is that we signed our third RevWorks client and have a strong pipeline for the balance of the year. With ICD-10 looming and the likely new payment structures associated with Accountable Care Organizations, we expect a wave of revenue cycle activity in the coming years, and believe we are well positioned.
Let's move to the geographic mix of our results. As Marc mentioned, our global revenue was down year-over-year, but we did have a strong global bookings quarter, particularly in Canada where we signed a large managed services contract and in England where we added 2 NHS Trusts. We expect a strong start of the year from a bookings standpoint, along with strong a global pipeline to translate to stronger contributions in our income statement by our global businesses as the year progresses.
At the macro level, the fundamental problem of healthcare costs growing faster than overall economy exists in almost all countries. And IT continues to be viewed as the way to break this trend. We believe Cerner is the best positioned global HIT [healthcare information technology] company, and we remain bullish about the potential of the global HIT market. 
Turning back to the U.S., I want to provide some marketplace observations. Overall, we are seeing an unprecedented level of activity both inside our client base and in new footprint opportunities. In our client base, we continue to see strong demand as our clients move forward with their Meaningful Use roadmaps. We have already had 12 hospitals in our client base receive Medicaid incentive dollars for Stage 1 Meaningful Use and several others in the process of filing for Medicare incentives. As this activity ramps up, we expect to lead the industry in clients achieving Meaningful Use.
Importantly, we are seeing strong demand for solutions and services beyond Meaningful Use, as our clients prepare for other regulatory requirements and industry shifts. This includes clients looking for the revenue cycle capabilities to prepare for ICD-10 requirements, reviewing their clinical processes, quality levels and reporting capabilities to be ready for value-based purchasing and evaluating various ACO [Accountable Care Organization] strategies, which will require additional IT investments to support capabilities such as evidence-based practices, predictive modeling, remote monitoring across all transitions of care.
All of these factors are also a major focus for our prospective clients. As a result, our readiness for Meaningful Use is just a way why I believe we will continue to do very well in new footprint opportunities. Our ability to demonstrate capabilities that enable prospective clients to navigate through Meaningful Use while preparing them to address the changing world beyond Meaningful Use makes us a very attractive choice compared to many competitors who are focused only on achieving the Meaningful Use hurdle.
A final comment I would like to make on the marketplace is that I believe all the factors I have discussed will drive a multi-year period of strong demand that aligns very well to our core solutions and services. This is not just a 12 to 18 month wave that some people expect. Because of the multiple steps related to Meaningful Use and the different levels of existing adoption across the industry, all of the purchasing related to stimulus will not occur at once. 
Further, all the other industry dynamics, such as health reform, value-based purchasing, ICD-10 and HIPAA 5010 will extend the wave of demand. I believe our capabilities are further even differentiated when you look beyond Stage 1 Meaningful Use and at the IT needs that will be driven by reform and value-based purchasing. As a result, I expect our ability to gain share to extend through this multi-year period. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong results in Q1, and I think we're well positioned for an outstanding year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

For those of you I haven't met at one of our analysts' days or meetings at our headquarters, I've been with Cerner since 1996. For the last several years have had responsibility for IP development CernerWorks, ITWorks and support organizations. In my new role as COO, I have added responsibilities for elements of the client organization activities, including sales and professional services. Today, I'm going to focus my comments on professional services, CernerWorks and ITWorks.
I'll start with our professional services business, which had a great start to the year with a record level of bookings for our first quarter. The organization continues to contribute nicely to our income statement, representing a visible element of both revenue and earnings growth. Our execution on projects has been strong, and we remain ahead of schedule on most projects. 
We also remain on track with our hiring, which has allowed us to ensure our projects are fully staffed on the planned start dates. We now have over 2,500 associates in our professional services organization, which is the largest IT consulting organization in healthcare IT organization in the world. We are also the most experienced with an average of more than 5 years of experience across our organization even when you include the recent increase in new hires, which often come directly from college campuses. Our size, scale, experience and ability to deliver predictable outcomes at a predictable cost are major differentiators in the marketplace.
Another element of our differentiating services capabilities is CernerWorks managed services, which provides unmatched scale and service levels. As an example, we support approximately 130,000 peak users to our data centers in Q1 and had an uptime approaching four nines or 99.9% system availability. In addition to our unrivaled scale and service levels, we continue to bring down the cost of ownership, which makes the offering even more attractive to our clients. As a result, almost all new clients select our managed services offering and our existing U.S. client base is steadily migrating.
More recently, the demand for these capabilities is picking up outside the U.S. as well. A good example is the large Canadian client that engaged us to provide our managed service offering in Q1. There are several additional global managed services opportunities in our pipeline, so we expect global to become a meaningful contributor to this business in future quarters.
We also continue to leverage our infrastructure and skills sets to add to our portfolio of managed services via the cloud delivery model. A recent example of this is Skybox storage, which is a secure enterprise cloud storage service that allows clients to expand storage capacity in a way that is seamlessly integrated with their existing data solutions. It allows for consolidation of storage for PACS [Picture Archiving and Communications System], radiology, lab and other clinical systems. Our ability to offer this on-demand service in a secure and easily accessible manner is generating a lot of interest among our existing clients and is something that can also be offered outside of our existing client base.
We also have other Skybox cloud services for areas such as security, backup and desktop, which we offer high-quality service with low upfront and ongoing cost compared to traditional models. 
Moving on to Cerner ITWorks, while we did not sign an ITWorks client in Q1, we did have a scope expansion at an existing client, and we have a very strong pipeline of new clients. The demand is largely being driven by increased awareness of the success that we've had at our first 6 clients. Many other clients are attracted to ITWorks because they realize they don't have enough internal capabilities to navigate beyond Stage 1 of Meaningful Use or address upcoming challenges related to health reform, value-based purchasing and ICD-10. 
With our existing ITWorks clients, we have quickly proven that this is not just another IT outsourcing service. ITWorks offers a strategic alignment with our clients that goes beyond traditional outsourcing. While part of the service does lead to the expected benefits of leveraging our scale to improve their basic IT operations, we have seen the most significant progress at accelerating clinical adoption and innovation at the edges of healthcare. A great example of this is our first ITWorks client, University of Missouri, who went from Stage 2 on HIMSS EMR Adoption Model to Stage 6 in just one year. University of Missouri has also been a major contributor to our medical home, condition management and population health initiatives. 
Other ITWorks clients have proven to be cutting edge by being early adopters of new offerings such as Smart Rooms, Chart Search, Physician iPad apps and RevWorks. Another noteworthy observation is that similar to CernerWorks, we are starting to see demand outside the U.S. for ITWorks offering. This new demand for services clearly enhances our growth opportunity in the coming years and aligns Cerner with the larger portion of the healthcare spending, not just in the U.S. but around the world.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."
259627,129705810,119497,"Cerner Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Similar to past calls, I'm going to talk about some of our new initiatives in Cerner's evolution from a focus on helping clients automate the care process to focus on both health and care, as well as the role of our Healthe Intent platform i",1192,"Thanks, Mike. Similar to past calls, I'm going to talk about some of our new initiatives in Cerner's evolution from a focus on helping clients automate the care process to focus on both health and care, as well as the role of our Healthe Intent platform in accelerating the impact of a digitized care delivery system. 
As Zane and Mike have discussed, Cerner is very well positioned for strong growth in coming years. Most of this growth will be tied to digitizing the core of healthcare. We believe this digitization sets the stage for another significant wave of growth. Much of this will come from our focus on the health part of healthcare, because when the core is digitized, a new level of consumer health awareness is possible. While the majority of the dialogue today is around cost, we see the entire landscape as more of an iceberg, witas the cost of care being above the surface. The much larger population and future costs associated with the health and well being of that population lurking below the surface. As we demonstrated during our investor day, the majority of the highlighted solutions were running in the cloud as part of our Healthe Intent platform. This allows us both to advance innovations more quickly based on the nature of that platform, but also introduces a new layer of capabilities above the individual enterprise, addressing the range of offerings from coordination of care, quality monitoring and consumer engagement. As many of you know, Cerner spent the last 5 years trying to crack the code on making good health pay. We've made changes to our health plan, hired a third-party administrator, launched the new age on-site clinic and pharmacy, incorporated biometric measurements for our population, realigned the economic incentive for associates in our health plan and rolled out a data-driven wellness management program. 
We have also revamped our on-campus cafeterias to include healthier meals and encouraged fresh thinking about work environments, incorporating options such as standing workstations. As this past fall, our executive cabinet engaged our associates in the weight-loss competition that has today, resulted in about 10 tons of weight loss across our associate base. These changes allowed us to do what all employers want to do: bend the healthcare cost curves significantly. But more importantly, improve the health status of our associates and their families. In addition, these health initiatives have shaped our employer services offerings and provided insights to create solutions for our provider clients, who will soon be incented to drive healthier outcomes through new reimbursement models, such as Accountable Care Organizations. 
I wanted to share some foundational statistics on a set of our early initiatives around this platform as we introduce both search and sepsis last fall and have also discussed our progress on the Cerner Network from time-to-time.
A core concept to fuel our cloud initiatives is data liquidity from the enterprised sources within healthcare. Recently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology announced that Project Direct had reached a major milestone. This was a collaborative nationwide effort, with over 200 participants across more than 50 organizations to define and create a simple interop solution for healthcare, and making that available as open source. As part of that effort, Cerner became the primary source code contributor to Direct Project's Java Reference Implementation. It shows both our commitment to interoperability across the industry and our fundamental understanding of the potential ahead for our health economy, if data liquidity becomes a reality more quickly.
The ability to contextually share information is a growing reality, driven by the meaningful use criteria, healthcare reform, increasing quality metrics and new coordination in care delivery models. Through our Cerner Network offerings, we have now achieved interoperability with over 46 different EMR platforms across 40 health systems, 166 hospitals, more than 65,000 physicians. Just last month, we surpassed the $70 million transaction mark for the month. These are transactions that are specifically targeted to share information across providers, payers and patients. This represents more than a 50% growth in the last 6 months. And more importantly, we've seen a 5x growth in clinical volumes over the last 12 months.
We expect the clinical volumes will exceed financial by the end of this year and is driven by both the increase of EMR deployments and the early realization of what's possible when both ends of the communication are digitized. Most important, these are providing real efficiency and workflow savings within the care delivery process and will continue to yield new business model opportunities.
After completing our pilot validation, with the Healthe Intent Chart Search, late last year, we are now approaching 15% of our clients actively engaged in deployment and/or use of this solution. While Meaningful Use has the day-to-day attention of our clients, because this is a cloud service, we have been able to activate this offering without disruption to the Meaningful Use journeys. And on average is taking about 4 to 6 weeks to implement and backload history. It only represents a fraction of the eventual volumes, but today, we have more than 40 terabytes of data, growing at a rate of 230 gigabytes a day, processing and indexing between 250 and 350 million records daily. The learning and advancement of the algorithms continue to grow as our volume and diversity of information grows with them.
As a byproduct to these efforts, we have also seen an increase in complementary solution demand, which also leverages the data liquidity wave. Both Health Sentry, a public health submission solution, and Health Facts, a multi-year blended research and benchmarking repository, have seen progress from these efforts. Today, Health Facts contains more than 29 million unique individuals and as a sampling of clinical breadth, more than 1.7 billion lab results. We are on course to double the contribution volume to this platform by the end of the year. As we have previously mentioned, the St. John Sepsis agent, which targets the 750,000 Americans who are affected by sepsis each year is refined and improved using this very large contextually structured clinical repository, creating a closed loop for not only discovery, but continuous and contextual improvement in clinical decision support. 
Last, I want to mention a recent announcement from earlier in the week. Cerner was selected by the Missouri Health Connection to enter in negotiations to be the technical service provider for the State of Missouri's Health Information Exchange. This too is a part of our Healthe Intent cloud-based services platform. The potential reach of this joint effort will cover over 750 provider organizations, 20,000 physicians and nearly 6 million Missourians, positioning Missouri to become one of the first clipboard-free states in the union. 
As we demonstrated to during analyst day in March, there is a greater potential for the new middle to change the current state of healthcare and create a more significant opportunity around health than care. I wanted to take the time to step back and help frame some of the emerging building blocks that are fueling the information and content that will make this possible.
With that I'll turn the call over for questions."

So for this quarter, we had approximately 25% to 30% range was coming from the 7-year type bookings. And that's probably actually a little bit lower than we've seen in the last, probably, 4 to 8 quarters. So I think bookings still is a very good measure of our future short term, and as well as longer-term opportunities, but this quarter there was no -- the over attainment on our bookings guidance was really broad. It was across the spectrum in every area, from services to software and managed services was right in its normal percent range of a bigger number. So it also contributed somewhat but it wasn't any unique longer-term type of duration."

And there's probably not too many install bases that are in great shape. We are in great shape. We are not the only one, but there's a lot of people that put together not real strong companies over the last 20 years. And there's kind of strength test being applied here. And then you all got it, frankly globally, most -- because we've always focused on the clinical side, there is a strong marketplace outside the U.S. and you kind of throw a dart at it and when we tell you the story what's happening in those countries.

We are clearly articulating to you all of this activity in the first half of this decade is creating -- is basically digitizing the content of healthcare. And we think there will be big fundamental changes outside of that, we have several ways of narrating that those kinds of changes, but the concept of a new middle is one of those. And then I think we are demonstrating to you today here, too, that there's a great team and this company has got a lot of talent. And the talent is broad and deep. So we have a combination of experience. We also have a passion and a passion to innovate. So those are my closing observations and comments. And with that, I'll wish you good evening.

Mike will be followed by Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, who will discuss strategic initiatives.  Neal Patterson. our Chairman, CEO and President, will be traveling today and not be joining us on the call. Now turning to our results. All key measures in Q2 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range by $80 million. Our income statement performance is very good, with revenue and adjusted EPS above our guidance and consensus, and continued strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We again had excellent cash flow performance with strong level of free cash flow reflective of good earnings quality.
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q2 was $650 million, which is the second-best results in company history, second only to Q4 of '09. Bookings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by about $100 million and we are up 39% from Q2 of 2010. Bookings margin in Q2 was $540 million or 83% of total bookings. I thought it wd be appropriate to provide some additional color on the strong bookings performance.
With respect to the $100 million attainment, half of the upside is related to 2 large contracts that were included in our original bookings guidance coming in above the risk weighted amounts we forecasted. These contracts were held soft as we announced this morning and our by key client awards that Michael discussed later. The remaining $50 million of upside came from strength across all of business models that led to a record 23 contracts over $5 million in the quarter.
Looking at the mix of long-term contracts, the ITWorks deal and overall strong hosting bookings led to bookings from long-term contracts being around 35% of total bookings, which is the high-end of historical levels which have averaged around 29%. Note that even if you just long-term bookings down to historical levels, our bookings still would have exceeded the high-end of our guidance range and grown approximately 30% year-over-year. In short, this was an outstanding bookings quarter no matter how you slice it.
Our bookings performance delivered 21% increase in total backlog to $5.41 billion, contract revenue backlog of $4.74 billion is 23% higher than a year ago. Total revenue backlog totaled $679 million, up 7% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was $524.2 million, which is up 15% over Q2 2010. The revenue composition for Q2 was $157 million in systems sales, $138 million in support and maintenance, $217 million in services and $12 million in reimbursed travel.
Systems sales revenue reflect 15% growth from Q2 of '10 driven by strong growth in software and subscriptions. Technology resale was basically flat. The strong growth in device resale offsetting decline in traditional technology resale. Revenue was up 18% compared to Q2 of '10 with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue is 8% over Q2 '10. Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $450 million. Global revenue of $74 million was down 1% year-over-year, but was up 5% sequentially, and we expect positive year-over-year growth for the remainder of the year based on strong global bookings in the first half of the year and a strong pipeline.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 81.2%, which is down 160 basis points year-over-year and down 40 basis points sequentially. Gross margin continues to be impacted by strength in device resale, which carries the lower margin than our traditional hardware resale and an increase in third-party services. As we have discussed previously, we expect gross margin to remain in the low 80s, but we still expect to continue expanding operating margin, which we did again this quarter despite the lower gross margin.
Looking at operating spending. Our second quarter operating expenses were $311.2 million before share-based compensation of $6.6 million. Our total operating expense is up 9% compared to Q2 of '10, with the majority of the growth driven by an increase in revenue generating associates in our business. Sales and client service expenses increased 11% compared to Q2 of '10, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. Our investment in software development increased 2% compared to Q2 of '10, reflecting continued leverage of our R&D investments. One way we are leveraging these resources is by moving some of them to support growth initiatives such as ITWorks.
G&A expenses increased 14% year-over-year, driven by personnel and non-personnel expenses related to increased hiring and training and expenses related to our resource systems acquisition. 
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q2 was 21.8% before share-based compensation expense. This is up 160 basis points compared to Q2 of '10 and aligned with our target of 100 to 200 basis point increase in 2011.
Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $72.0 million or $0.42 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings, include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.1 million or $0.02 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $76.1 million and adjusted EPS was $0.44, which is up 26% compared to Q2 of '10. Our tax rate in Q2 was 35.2% and we expect our tax rate to remain at approximately 35% for the rest of the year.
Now I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $1.01 billion of total cash and investments, up from $949 million in Q1. Total cash and investments include $682 million of cash and short-term investments, and $330 million highly rated corporate government bonds with maturities over 1 year. Our total debt is $115 million. Total accounts receivable in the quarter of $504 million which is up $35 million from Q1. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables, were $158 million and represent 31% of total receivable compared to 28% in Q1.
Cash collections were $509 million and third-party financings were $19 million, representing 4% of total cash collected. Our DSO in Q2 was 88 days, which is up 1 day compared to Q1 and flat compared to Q2 of 2010. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $122.1 million. Future capital expenditures were $30.3 million and capitalized software was $20.6 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $71.2 million. We expect capital expenditures in the second half of the year to be higher than the $50 million we have spent in the first half of the year. We still expect to continue generating strong operating and free cash flow.
Moving to capitalized software. The $20.6 million of capitalized software in Q2 represents 29% of the $70.5 million of total spending on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19.9 million, resulting in net capitalization of $0.7 million or 1% of our total R&D investments. For the rest of the year, we expect capitalized software to be between $20 million and $22 million per quarter, and amortization of $19 million to $20 million per quarter.
Now let me go through the guidance. For Q3 revenue, we expect revenue between $520 million and $540 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 15% over Q3 of 2010. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.09 billion and $2.12 billion, up from our previous range of $2.07 billion to $2.12 billion. We expect Q3 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.46 to $0.48 per share with the midpoint reflecting 24% growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $1.80 and $1.83, with the midpoint reflecting 23% growth. This is up from our previous range of $1.78 to $1.81.
Q3 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense or approximately $313 million to $318 million. Our estimates for the impact of share-based compensation expense is $0.02 to $0.03 for Q3 and $0.10 to $0.11 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $560 million to $600mil, with he midpoint of this range reflecting 17% growth over record bookings in Q3 2010.
In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q2, with all key metrics at or above our expected range us. Specifically, we are pleased with our record level of bookings in revenue, continued margin expansion, and earnings growth, and strong levels of operating and free cash flow generation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."
259627,137257132,148533,"Cerner Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be covering our sales results and marketplace trends. I'll start with the results. We had another quarter of record bookings, with strong growth both in our client base and in new footprints. Our booking",1638,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be covering our sales results and marketplace trends. I'll start with the results. We had another quarter of record bookings, with strong growth both in our client base and in new footprints. Our bookings revenue in Q2 of $650 million represents 39% growth over last year and is an all-time high for the second quarter. Bookings this quarter included 23 contracts over $5 million, which is all-time high. Nine of these contracts are over $10 million. The strength of our bookings this quarter came from a broad range of solutions and services. We have strong contributions from all business models, with particular strength in licensed software, professional services and managed services. As Michael discussed, we signed another ITWorks contract which contributed to the strength in professional and managed services bookings.
Additionally, we are selected by HealthSouth, the nation's largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services to provide a wide range of services and solutions for 97 rehabilitation facilities across 26 states. This is another example of a highly regarded investor-owned health systems selecting certain based on our proven ability to deliver value. It's important to note that this purchase is unrelated to ARRA as we have facilities are not eligible for stimulus dollars. We believe this represents the beginning of a trend where providers our automating across the transitions for the care and preparing for future healthcare models. Our agile business units also continued to drive contribution across a wide range of solutions and services with noteworthy strength like in clinical process optimization, women's health, laboratory, emergency, oncology, the Cerner Network and hub, revenue cycle, medical devices and community hospitals. An area of particular strength I want how that this quarter is our physicians solutions. After a strong Q1, we had record bookings quarter in Q2 and our year-to-date physician bookings are up over 50%. This includes strength in selling directly to physician practices and through our health system client base. As I discussed last quarter, the improvement we made to the physician user interface and workflow have been recognized by the industry and our strong year-to-date performance reflects this. We continued to see a desire in the market place to purchase a fully integrated inpatient and outpatient solution as providers look for tighter linkage across venues in anticipation of bundled payments, and being accountable for managing health and providing high-quality outcomes. We are very well-positioned to meet these needs and it's not showing up in our results.
We also differentiate from others in the industry with our ability and willingness to interoperate with other systems. This gives clients who've already a significant investment in non-Cerner able solutions flexibly that most other suppliers can't or won't offer. Another highlight for the quarter was strong performance by our DeviceWorks organizations, including good levels of iBus device connectivity sales, and a strong quarter of reselling CareFusion and other devices. As we have discussed, our device resell business was expected to more than offset the decline in traditional hardware resell that we have been experiencing as more client select our hosting options. This is playing out so far this year and I expect us to continue expanding our relationship with device manufactureres going forward.
Moving to new client development. Our competitiveness was very strong Q2, with 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core millennium base. This success crosses all segments ranging from small hospitals selecting our community works offerings to large multi-facility IDMs buying a broad suite of solutions and services. Our proven track record and success of our installed base plays a big role on our ability to get these new footprints. As an example, we are getting the attention of many prospective clients based on a leadership of our client base in receiving initial meaningful used dollars. Meanwhile, some other stalled base struggle with certain requirements such as getting data out of their systems.
Our clients have already received over $100 million, which we believe leads the industry in dollars received. Given our install base has the most live CPOE site and is using CPOE levels in the industry, we believe our clients will continue to lead the industry in receiving meaningful use dollars. I believe our competitive differentiation will continue to increase as we approach meaningful use Stage 2 and other industry requirements. We are having several discussions with prospective clients that are trying to meet Stage 1 requirements with their legacy systems, but are looking to align with a more proven and strategic supplier to meet their Stage 2 and 3 requirements, along with positioning themselves for healthcare reform, value-based purchasing, ICD-10, HIPAA 5010, a COs, data analytic abilities another industry should that they think will challenge the existing supplier. Because this requirements play out over an extended amount of time, I think our window of opportunity to gain market share will remain open for several years.
Moving to our global results. As Marc mentioned, our global revenue was flat year-over-year but we had a strong global bookings quarter and expect good global revenue growth for the rest of the year. A Q2 highlight was our contract with Sidra Medical and Research Center, reflected Cerner to them become the first hospital in Qatar to have a fully integrated healthcare system. This contract further demonstrates our strong market presence in the Middle East and positions us for additional business in the region. We also continued to deepen our presence in Abu Dhabi where we brought our maternity solution lie at 6 hospitals, representing our first women's health to go live in the region.
Other areas of global strength in the quarter were Canada and England where we continued our momentum after a strong Q1, and Australia where we had a solid bookings quarter along with 2 important go live in Victoria. We expect our strong global bookings in the first half of the year, along with the strong global pipeline, which translates to good contributions to our income statement in the second half of the year and beyond.
Turning back to the U.S., I want to provide some market place observations Similar to what I indicated last quarter, the market place is very strong and we are seeing unprecedented levels of demand. As you would expect, we continue to seeing strong demand as our clients move towards their useful roadmaps, the rising bars for Stages 2 and 3 is creating more incremental purchasing, as more of our clients begin to purchase solutions to meet a more challenging requirements such as medication administration and structured physician documentation. While meaningful uses of major topic with clients, we spent just as much time, or more, talking to clients about solutions and services with other regulatory requirements and industry trends that require planning beyond meaningful use. These include revenue cycle capabilities prepared for ICD-10 requirements, clinical process, quality optimization, and reporting capabilities to be ready for value-based purchasing, as well as solutions and services to facilitate ACO strategies. It is important to note that there are major financial incentives for providers to adopt technology beyond what is required for Meaningful Use. Just in our client base, we estimate there is approximately $3 billion of annual revenue at risk tied to value-based purchasing, Medicare 30-day readministration rules and quality reporting requirements which began in 2013. This ramps to an estimated $5 billion of revenue at risk in 2017 when the programs are fully implemented.
Our ability to demonstrate capabilities to help clients navigate through meaningful use while preparing them to address the changing world beyond meaningful use makes us an attractive choice compared to many competitors who are focused only on achieving the Meaningful Use. Refining our that our innovative platform and data analytics capabilities are becoming an increasingly important competitive advantage as most competitors or multiple systems that have not been integrated and those that are integrated using non-relational database, which makes getting data out of the system for data analytics very difficult. The awareness of the challenges is becoming more widespread in the industry and we believe this will be very good for Cerner.
I believe all the factors I have discussed will drive multiyear period of strong demand that aligned very well with our core solutions and services and not just a 12 to 18 month way that some people expect. Because of the multiple steps related his Meaningful Use and the different levels of existing adoption across the industry, all of the purchasing related to stimulus will not occur at once. Further, all the other industry dynamics such as healthcare or form, value-based purchasing, ICD-10 and HIPAA 5010 will extend the wave of demand. This extended growth period will also be augmented by increasing contributions for our new initiatives such as ITWorks and RevWorks as they begin to drive more income statement contribution.
Before closing, I'd like to provide some comments on our acquisition of Resource Systems. For those of you who aren't familiar with Resource Systems, they provide the care tracker point-of-care electronic documentation system currently utilized by more than 3,000 organizations, primarily within skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. This solution is very complementary to and will be integrated with our long-term care, EMR. There are more than 15,000 long-term care facilities in the United States and is expected to grow significantly as the population ages. Additionally, we believe that its ACO places focus pre-acute and post acute care, many of these care venues defined as post acute today, will evolve to fit a proactive model of managing health. We're already seeing strong interest for the integrated long-term care solutions that we are now uniquely positioned to offer. In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong results in Q2 and I think we are well-positioned for an outstanding year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

I'll start today by discussing ITWorks. As Marc and Zane mentioned, we signed our seventh ITWorks client in Q2. This client is a Health System with approximately 700 beds across 3 main facilities and is our largest",862,"Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today by discussing ITWorks. As Marc and Zane mentioned, we signed our seventh ITWorks client in Q2. This client is a Health System with approximately 700 beds across 3 main facilities and is our largest ITWorks client so far. This is also a displacement of a competitor that had been providing IT services to this client for 10 years. Our focus will be addressing infrastructure issues, completing the Meaningful Use roadmap, optimizing clinical processes and driving CPOE adoption.
Similar to other ITWorks clients, they're on a quest for better service and greater value than they were receiving from their existing IT services company. Our existing ITWorks clients also played as significant role in this clients position. They had excellent reference calls and site visits with 2 of our existing ITWorks clients. It's noteworthy that one of the reference clients had only been in ITWorks clients for 3 months but was able to share their positive experience with transitioning to Cerner, the rapid improvement in service and the value they are receiving by aligning with us.
We have quickly proven that ITWorks is not just another IT outsourcing service. ITWorks involves a strategic alignment with our clients that goes beyond traditional outsourcing. While part of the service does lead to the expected benefit of leveraging our scale to improve their basic IT operations, clients see the most significant progress at accelerating clinical adoption and innovation at the edge of healthcare. As we intended, ITWorks is following the pattern of our CernerWorks managed services business. It's a simple model. If we provide a high-quality service that provide superior value to our clients, it'll make for a compelling value proposition and client adoption will accelerate as proof points are established. We now have the proof points and the adoption is just beginning to accelerate. We believe that as we continue to get closer to the edge of the healthcare through ITWorks that it will change Cerner, our clients, and ultimately, healthcare. And along the way, it will contribute to many years of strong, predictable growth for Cerner.
We also had a strong good quarter in our revenue cycle business where we continued to drive benefit at our initial RevWorks clients with ongoing improvements in net revenue and reduction in operating expenses. We are also rapidly increasing the number of life patient accounting sites by selling 8 new footprints, and bringing 15 hospitals and 19 clinics live in Q2. We now have a total of 62 hospitals and 302 clinics live on patient accounting. An area of RevWorks, we've not discussed in the past but that is gaining traction, as our ambulatory revenue cycle offering. We have contracted with over 60 ambulatory clients for full building off our services so far this year and we have a strong pipeline moving forward. Similar to ITWorks, we believe that we have a compelling value proposition with RevWorks that will lead to accelerated adoption as we build the proof points.
In our professional services business, we had record bookings in each of the last 2 quarters. As I said last quarter, our professional services organization is the largest and most experienced healthcare IT services organization in the world. Our unmatched experience, coupled with our proven implementation tools and methodology, serve as a major competitive differentiator, particularly in the market environment where clients want predictable costs and predictable results. I'm pleased that we have been able to keep up with the hiring and training which hasallows us to stay aligned with our strong demand and quickly turn new hires into valuable, revenue generating associates.
Our CernerWorks managed services business had another outstanding quarter with very strong bookings and operational performance. CernerWorks is a foundation that has led to the launch of other service offerings such as ITWorks. And we believe it will be the platform for several other offerings in the future, with almost all new clients selecting managed services offering, and our existing U.S. client base steadily migrating, we have a substantial platform to leverage as a channel to roll out additional solutions and services.
A good example is Cerner Skybox Cloud Services that I mentioned last quarter. We call it as Skybox as a new suite of on-demand infrastructure and software services that are deployed hosted and managed by Cerner. These services currently include storage, messaging, backup and Virtual Desktop. We intend to rapidly expand the portfolio of services over the upcoming quarters by packaging existing CernerWorks capabilities into cloud-based offerings. Our speed to market with these services are very fast as evidenced by the fact that we've already sold 2 of these services to 2 clients for a total of $8 million of bookings this year. In closing, when you consider all of our works and professional services capabilities, the common factors that we have invested in creating highly scalable, reliable and predictable services that create great value for our clients. And this approach has led to an unmatched suite of services offerings that differentiate us in the marketplace and drive a significant portion of Cerner's predictable revenue and earnings growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff"

I frequently use this time to share some of our broader initiatives, but today, I thought it also shows some of the more specific offerings underway that are positioning Cerner and our clients as a platform for interoperability, a platform to measure and improve outcomes, and a platform to engage consumers. As both Zane and Mike have shared, there is growing momentum that continues to move the innovation bar on our ability to get beyond Meaningful Use a function and to extract true value from the growing digitization of the medical record across communities. As I've shared from time to time, our clients are aggressively taking advantage of the potential to share information across the fragmented provider landscape. With increasing levels of interoperability expectations, also comes new challenges to organizing communicate information across the geographic region. We continue to disrupt some of the more complicated challenges within our interoperability through deployment of our cloud services such search, which has grown by 104 terrabytes since last quarter,, a 260% increase. to frame this progress more broadly, I want to share some stats on our progress around  connectivity as well.
As we continue to expand our connections and those of our clients, we have seen a 20% increase year-over-year in ePrescribing transactions, with over 30,000 providers now activated. Our clinical transaction network is currently capable of linking to over 60 unique EMR suppliers, 20 of which are now actively connected. Our Cerner Network hub services now includes over 80 health systems, with 75% of those connecting to 2 or more non-Cerner EMR systems. Across our clinical exchange, HIE projects, we now have 23 HIE deployments, with 8 of those being regionally focused, actively sharing continuity of care documents between acute and ambulatory EMR systems.
As our cloud-based portfolio decision support agents expand, the progress in connecting providers regarless of their data sources becomes more and more important to position our clients for the journey towards ACOs and population health management. 
Shifting towards quality and outcomes, there is an accelerating momentum towards creating alignment of clinical contacts and reimbursement. And there are no signs from the policy front that this direction will change course. The expectation that healthcare becomes much more data-driven has broken through the surface, and more and more quality in outcome measures are finding their way into the reimbursement calculation. EMS quality measures, value-based purchasing and Medicare 30-day readmissions are just the beginning of a growing expectation that will change health providers are paid. With addressing any of the current budget discussion, the current quarter course at risk medical reimbursement will move from 4% in 2013 to 7% in 2017. As Zane mentioned, this is a $5 billion revenue risk in our current client base alone.
To make this more challenging, several of these programs are budget neutral, with winners and losers separated by comparison performance levels. We foresee that information management will become an increasing priority for our clients and in the market more widely. Our cloud-based data management solutions, our expertise in managing large data sets for research and our access to granular, realtime clinical information puts us in a unique position to innovate at a pace to meet the dynamic requirements ahead. We are quickly approaching an environment where recording about what has already happened is too late, as the intervention must occur realtime with embedded and proactive decision support.
As an example of our commitment in this space, Cerner has currently in a unique position with in our industry of being certified by the Joint Commission measures, as well as CMS approved for submission of inpatient, outpatient quality measures which we'll include the esubmission of Meaningful Use measures going forward. Many of these innovations are a byproduct of our own experiences as we attempt to manage the health of Cerner's population. As I shared last quarter, using Cerner Associates and family members as the living lab with help turn us cost curve while also improving the health of productivity of our associates. This is included filing our third-party administrator, launching the new age onsite credits and pharmacies, incorporating biometric measurements our population, realigning the economic incentives for our associates in our health plans, revamping our cafeteria to focus on healthier choices and rolling our data-driven management programs. These initiatives have led us to truly bend the healthcare cost curve with our per member accounts now tracking well below the national average and realizing $4 million in savings in 2010. All while the health status of our associates has steadily improved. We are using the success we've had at Cerner to shape our employee services offerings and provide insights to create solutions for our provider clients. We will soon be intended to drive healthier outcomes for new reimbursement models such as the Accountable Care Organizations. A recent example of building on the success we have had at Cerner is our Casey slim down challenge, which is a Kansas City metrowide weight loss competition that is modeled after a successful challenge at Cerner that has led to over 20,000 pounds being shed by our associates.
The Casey slim down challenge expense to individuals and employers in Kansas City and is aimed at improving the overall health and wellness of the community. There are already more than 80 employers participating in the challenge. As part of this challenge, all participants will be introduced to Cerner health and receive a personal health record at no cost that will allow them to securely track and interact with all aspects of their health. We have seen the use of PHRs in our own associate based increased significantly over the past several years where we found different ways to engage, connecting them to their health providers, and making them feel accountable and empowered to manage their health. Using Cerner Hub as a platform, we believe that we can scale our own experiences to our entire community.
As you know, we also have a much broader vision than just providing the PHR, and we will use Kansas City as our first regional initiatives to prove the value of an engaged consumer. This begins with the weight-loss competition which we're using to drive PHR adoption and jumpstart the creation of a network of employers, consumers, doctors and other stakeholders. As we drive adoption and create these connections to stakeholders, we will be advancing many of the necessary building blocks towards our vision of creating a new. By having the providers, consumers and employees connected, we'll have the ability to facilitate more seamless coordination of care across all venues, providing medical home, reduce friction in the payment process and incent proactive health engagement rather than reactive sick care. As discussed at our Investment Day in March, the financial opportunity associating with providing these elements across the communities is substantial. Just in the Kansas City region alone, we believe we could reduce the cost of healthcare by billions of dollars and generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue for Cerner while doing this. We have a lot of work to do to get there, but I believe we are on the right path.
With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

So with the exception of the community, of some smaller community work models where we can go at a faster implementation cycle and we still have runway there on that, on the Stage 1 elements and we'll have runway there for several quarters. But as it relates -- and so that piece it kind of goes into the smaller end of the marketplace. Most are actually in a full rip and replace when they're having the conversation around the Stage 2, what they need to do so that they'll say, I can get to a minimum Meaningful Use around perhaps the ED, around orders in that space, leverage that for their Stage 1 Meaningful Use and then go meet Stage 2 on a Cerner platform. And to do that, they're going to do a pretty much a rip and replace in that model. There are some cases where we may have a footprint and we're adding to that footprint. But I would put that as the small minority of the situation. So I think if you're looking at -- I wouldn't put them in the third, the third, the third, probably you've got that smaller end of the segment which is very active and very good for us, and then you've got the rest of the marketplace that's attacking Stage 2 and beyond, and that is a full rip and replace mode."

So a booking from an ITWorks deal will be the amount of revenue over that longer. Of time as we discussed that will comment just related to the services. That's part of the strategy, is that in itself, might not be high margin business, but the ability to sell additional software back and convert them to certain applications not only gets incremental Cerner Solutions software dollars, but also starts to support stream running from Cerner. So those are the kind of ad on sales in addition to being able to effectively help them manage their implementation and coexist with Cerner Solutions. So a lot of strategic reasons for doing that, but those contracts and we talk about them are just for the services."

Now turning to our results. All key measures in Q2 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range by $80 million. Our income statement performance is very good, with revenue and adjusted EPS above our guidance and consensus, and continued strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We again had excellent cash flow performance with strong level of the free cash flow reflective of good earnings quality.
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q2 was $650 million, which is the second-best result in company history, second only to Q4 of '09. Bookings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by about $100 million and we're up 39% from Q2 of 2010. Bookings margin in Q2 was $540 million or 83% of total bookings. I thought it'd be appropriate to provide some additional color on the strong bookings performance.
With respect to the $100 million over attainment, about half of the upside is related to 2 large contracts that were included in our original bookings guidance coming in above the risk-weighted amounts we forecasted. These contracts were HealthSouth, which we announced this morning, and our seventh ITWorks client contract that Michael will discuss later. The remaining $50 million of upside came from strength across all of business models that led to a record 23 contracts over $5 million in the quarter.
Looking at the mix of long-term contracts, the ITWorks deal and overall strong hosting bookings led to bookings from long-term contracts being around 35% of total bookings, which is the high end of historical levels which have averaged around 29%. Note that even if you adjust long-term bookings down to historical levels, our bookings still would have exceeded the high end of our guidance range and grown approximately 30% year-over-year. In short, this was an outstanding bookings quarter, no matter how you slice it.
Our bookings performance delivered 21% increase in total backlog to $5.41 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.74 billion is 23% higher than a year ago, the full revenue backlog totaled $679 million, up 7% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was $524.2 million, which is up 15% over Q2 2010. The revenue composition for Q2 was $157 million in systems sales; $138 million in support and maintenance; $217 million in services; and $12 million in reimbursed travel.
Systems sales revenue reflects 15% growth from Q2 of '10 driven by strong growth in software and subscriptions. Technology resale was basically flat. The strong growth in device resale offsetting decline in traditional technology resale. Services revenue was up 18% compared to Q2 of '10, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue is 8% over Q2 '10.
Looking at revenues by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $450 million. Global revenue of $74 million was down 1% year-over-year, but was up 5% sequentially, and we expect positive year-over-year growth for the remainder of the year, based on strong global bookings in the first half of the year and a strong pipeline.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 81.2%, which is down 160 basis points year-over-year and down 40 basis points sequentially. Gross margin continues to be impacted by strength in device resale, which carries the lower margin than our traditional hardware resale and an increase in third-party services. As we have discussed previously, we expect gross margin to remain in the low 80s, but we still expect to continue expanding operating margin, which we did again this quarter despite the lower gross margin.
Looking at operating spending. Our second quarter operating expenses were $311.2 million before share-based compensation of $6.6 million. Our total operating expense was up 9% compared to Q2 of '10, but a majority of the growth driven by an increase in revenue generating associates in our services business.
Sales and client service expenses increased 11% compared to Q2 of '10, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. Our investment in software development increased 2% compared to Q2 of '10, reflecting continued leverage of our R&D investments. One way we are leveraging these resources is by moving some of them to support growth initiatives, such as ITWorks.
G&A expenses increased 14% year-over-year, driven by personnel and non-personnel expenses related to increased hiring and training, and expenses related to our resource systems acquisition. 
Moving to operating margin. Our operating margin in Q2 was 21.8% before share-based compensation expense. This is up 160 basis points compared to Q2 of '10 and in line with our target of 100- to 200-basis point increase in 2011.
Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $72.0 million or $0.42 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings, include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.1 million or $0.02 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $76.1 million and adjusted EPS was $0.44, which is up 26% compared to Q2 of '10. Our tax rate in Q2 was 35.2%, we expect our tax rate to remain at approximately 35% for the rest of the year.
Now I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $1.01 billion of total cash and investments, up from $949 million in Q1. Total cash and investments include $682 million of cash and short-term investments, and $330 million of highly rated corporate government bonds with maturities over 1 year. Our total debt is $115 million. Total accounts receivable in the quarter of $504 million, which is up $35 million from Q1. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables, were $158 million and represent 31% of total receivable compared to 28% in Q1.
Cash collections were $509 million and third-party financings were $19 million, representing 4% of total cash collected. Our DSO in Q2 was 88 days, which is up 1 day compared to Q1, and flat compared to Q2 of 2010. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $122.1 million.
Q2's capital expenditures were $30.3 million and capitalized software was $20.6 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $71.2 million. We expect capital expenditures in the second half of the year to be higher than the $50 million we have spent first half of the year. We still expect to continue generating strong operating and free cash flow.
Moving to capitalized software. The $20.6 million of capitalized software in Q2 represents 29% of the $70.5 million of total spending on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19.9 million, resulting in net capitalization of $0.7 million or 1% of our total R&D investments. For the rest of the year, we expect capitalized software to be between $20 million and $22 million per quarter, and amortization of $19 million and $20 million per quarter.
Now let me go through the guidance. For Q3 revenue, we expect revenue between $520 million and $540 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 15% over Q3 of 2010. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.09 billion and $2.12 billion, up from our previous range of $2.07 billion to $2.12 billion. We expect Q3 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.46 to $0.48 per share with the midpoint reflecting 24% growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $1.80 and $1.83, with the midpoint reflecting 23% growth. This is up from our previous range of $1.78 to $1.81.
Q3 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense or approximately $313 million to $318 million. Our estimates for the impact of share-based compensation expense is $0.02 to $0.03 for Q3 and $0.10 to $0.11 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $560 million to $600 million, with the midpoint of this range reflecting 17% growth over record bookings in Q3 2010.
In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q2, with all key metrics at or above our expected ranges. Specifically, we are pleased with our record level of bookings in revenue, continued margin expansion, and earnings growth, and strong levels of operating and free cash flow generation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."
259627,137257132,148798,"Cerner Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be covering our sales results and marketplace trends. I'll start with the results. We had another quarter of record bookings, with strong growth both on our client base and our new footprints. Our bookin",1649,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be covering our sales results and marketplace trends. I'll start with the results. We had another quarter of record bookings, with strong growth both on our client base and our new footprints. Our bookings revenue in Q2 of $650 million represents 39% growth over last year and is all-time high for the second quarter.
Bookings this quarter included 23 contracts over $5 million, which is an all-time high. Nine of these contracts were over $10 million. The strength of our bookings this quarter came from a broad range of solutions and services. We have strong contributions from all business models, with particular strength in licensed software, professional services and managed services. As Michael discussed, we signed another ITWorks contract which contributed to the strength in professional and managed services bookings.
Additionally, we are selected by HealthSouth, the nation's largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services to provide a wide range of services and solutions for 97 rehabilitation facilities across 26 states. This is another example of a highly regarded investor-owned health system selecting Cerner, based on our proven ability to deliver value. It's important to note that this purchase is unrelated to ARRA as we have facilities -- are not eligible for stimulus dollars. We believe this represents the beginning of a trend where providers our automating across the transitions for the care and preparing for future healthcare models.
Our agile business units also continued to drive contribution across a wide range of solutions and services, with noteworthy strength like in Lighthouse clinical process optimization, women's health, laboratory, emergency, oncology, the Cerner Network and Hub, revenue cycle, medical devices and community hospitals.
An area of particular strength I want how that this quarter is our physician solutions. After a strong Q1, we had record bookings quarter in Q2 and our year-to-date physician bookings are up over 50%. These include strength in selling directly to physician practices and through our health system client base. As I discussed last quarter, the improvements we made to the physician-user interface and workflow have been recognized by the industry and our strong year-to-date performance reflects this. We continue to see a desire in the market place to purchase a fully integrated inpatient and outpatient solution, as providers look for tighter linkage across venues in anticipation of bundled payments and being accountable for managing health and providing high-quality outcomes. We are very well-positioned to meet these needs and it's not showing up in our results.
We also differentiate from others in the industry with our ability and willingness to inter-operate with other systems. This gives clients who have already made a significant investment in non-Cerner ambulatory solutions flexibility that most other suppliers can't or won't offer. Another highlight for the quarter was strong performance by our DeviceWorks organizations, including good levels of iBus device connectivity sales and a strong quarter of reselling CareFusion and other devices. As we have discussed, our device resell business was expected to more than offset the decline in traditional hardware resell that we have been experiencing, as more clients select our hosting option. This is playing out so far this year, and I expect us to continue expanding our relationship with device manufacturers going forward.
Moving to new client development. Our competitiveness was very strong Q2, with 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium base. This success crosses all segments ranging from small hospitals selecting our community works offering to large multi-facility IDNs buying a broad suite of solutions and services.
Our proven track record and success of our installed base plays a big role on our ability to get these new footprints. As an example, we are getting the attention of many prospective clients based on a leadership of our client base in receiving initial Meaningful Use dollars. Meanwhile, some other installed bases struggle with certain requirements, such as getting data out of their systems.
Our clients have already received over $100 million, which we believe leads the industry in dollars received. Given our installed base has the most live CPOE site and is using CPOE at the deepest [ph] level in the industry, we believe our clients will continue to lead the industry in receiving Meaningful Use dollars.
I believe our competitive differentiation will continue to increase as we approach Meaningful Use Stage 2 and other industry requirements. We're having several discussions with prospective clients that are trying to meet Stage 1 requirements with their legacy systems, but are looking to align with a more proven and strategic supplier to meet their Stage 2 and 3 requirements, along with positioning themselves for healthcare reform, value-based purchasing, ICD-10, HIPAA 5010, ACOs, data analytic capabilities and other industry shifts they think will challenge their existing supplier. Because these requirements play out over an extended amount of time, I think our window of opportunity to gain market share will remain open for several years.
Moving to our global results. As Marc mentioned, our global revenue was flat year-over-year, but we had a strong global bookings quarter and expect good global revenue growth for the rest of the year.
A Q2 highlight was our contract with Sidra Medical and Research Center, which selected Cerner to help them become the first hospital in Qatar to have a fully integrated healthcare system. This contract further demonstrates our strong market presence in the Middle East and positions us for additional business in the region. We also continue to deepen our presence in Abu Dhabi, where we brought our maternity solution live at 6 hospitals, representing our first women's health to go live in the region.
Other areas of global strength from the quarter were Canada and England, where we continued our momentum after a strong Q1, and Australia where we had a solid bookings quarter along with 2 important go-lives in Victoria. We expect our strong global bookings in the first half of the year, along with the strong global pipeline, which translate to good contributions to our income statement in the second half of the year and beyond.
Turning back to the U.S., I want to provide some marketplace observations. Similar to what I indicated last quarter, the market place is very strong and we are seeing unprecedented levels of demand. As you would expect, we continue seeing strong demand as our clients move towards their useful roadmaps. The rising bars for Stages 2 and 3 is creating more incremental purchasing, as more of our clients begin to purchase solutions to meet the more challenging requirements, such as medication administration and structured physician documentation.
While Meaningful Use is a major topic with clients, we spend just as much time or more, talking to clients about solutions and services to prepare for other regulatory requirements and industry trends that require planning beyond Meaningful Use. These include revenue cycle capabilities prepared for ICD-10 requirements, clinical process, quality optimization and reporting capabilities to be ready for value-based purchasing, as well as solutions and services to facilitate ACO strategies. It is important to note that there are major financial incentives for providers to adopt technology beyond what is required for Meaningful Use. Just in our client base, we estimate there is approximately $3 billion of annual revenue at risk tied to value-based purchasing, Medicare 30-day re-administration rules and quality reporting requirements, which began in 2013. This ramps to an estimated $5 billion of revenue at risk in 2017, when the programs are fully implemented.
Our ability to demonstrate capabilities to help clients navigate through Meaningful Use while preparing them to address the changing world beyond Meaningful Use, makes us an attractive choice compared to many competitors who are focused only on achieving the Meaningful Use hurdle. We are finding our that our innovative platform and data analytics capabilities are becoming an increasingly important competitive advantage as most competitors are roll-ups of multiple systems that have not been integrated, and those that are integrated using non-relational database, which makes getting data out of the system for data analytics very difficult. The awareness of these challenges is becoming more widespread in the industry, and we believe this will be very good for Cerner.
I believe all the factors I have discussed will drive a multiyear period of strong demand that aligns very well with our core solutions and services, and not just a 12- to 18-month way that some people expect. Because of the multiple steps related to Meaningful Use and the different levels of existing adoption across the industry, all of the purchasing related to stimulus will not occur at once.
Further, all the other industry dynamics such as healthcare reform, value-based purchasing, ICD-10 and HIPAA 5010 will extend the wave of demand. This extended growth period will also be augmented by increasing contributions for our new initiatives such as ITWorks and RevWorks as they begin to drive more income statement contribution.
Before closing, I'd like to provide some comments on our acquisition of Resource Systems. For those of you who aren't familiar with Resource Systems, they provide the care tracker point-of-care electronic documentation system currently utilized by more than 3,000 organizations, primarily within skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. This solution is very complementary to and will be integrated with our long-term care, EMR. There are more than 15,000 long-term care facilities in the United States and it's expected to grow significantly as the population ages.
Additionally, we believe that as ACOs place a focus on pre-acute and post-acute care, many of these care venues defined as post-acute today, will evolve to fit a proactive model of managing health. We're already seeing strong interest for the integrated long-term care solutions that we are now uniquely positioned to offer. In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong results in Q2 and I think we are well-positioned for an outstanding year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."
259627,137257132,148798,"Cerner Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today by discussing ITWorks. As Marc and Zane mentioned, we signed our seventh ITWorks client in Q2. This client is a health system with approximately 700 beds across 3 main facilities and is our largest",865,"Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today by discussing ITWorks. As Marc and Zane mentioned, we signed our seventh ITWorks client in Q2. This client is a health system with approximately 700 beds across 3 main facilities and is our largest ITWorks client so far. This is also a displacement of a competitor that had been providing IT services to this client for 10 years.
Our focus will be addressing infrastructure issues, completing the Meaningful Use roadmap, optimizing clinical processes and driving CPOE adoption.
Similar to other ITWorks clients, they're on a quest for better service and greater value than they were receiving from their existing IT services company. Our existing ITWorks clients also played as significant role in this client's decision. They had excellent reference calls and site visits with 2 of our existing ITWorks clients. It's noteworthy that one of the reference clients had only been a ITWorks client for 3 months, but was able to share their positive experience with transitioning to Cerner, the rapid improvement in service and the value they are receiving by aligning with us.
We have quickly proven that ITWorks is not just another IT outsourcing service. ITWorks involves a strategic alignment with our clients that goes beyond traditional outsourcing. While part of the service does lead to the expected benefit of leveraging our scale to improve their basic IT operations, clients see the most significant progress at accelerating clinical adoption and innovation at the edges of healthcare.
As we intended, ITWorks is following the pattern of our CernerWorks managed services business. It's a simple model. If we provide a high-quality service that provide superior value to our clients, it'll make for a compelling value proposition and client adoption will accelerate as proof points are established. We now have the proof points and the adoption is just beginning to accelerate.
We believe that as we continue to get closer to the edge of the healthcare through ITWorks, that it will change Cerner, our clients, and ultimately, healthcare. And along the way, it will contribute to many years of strong predictable growth for Cerner.
We also had a strong good quarter in our revenue cycle business, where we continue to drive benefits at our initial RevWorks clients, with ongoing improvements in net revenue and reduction in operating expenses. We are also rapidly increasing the number of live patient accounting sites by selling 8 new footprints, and bringing 15 hospitals and 19 clinics live in Q2. We now have a total of 62 hospitals and 302 clinics live on patient accounting.
An element of RevWorks we have not discussed as much in the past that is gaining traction, is our ambulatory revenue cycle offering. We have contracted with over 60 ambulatory clients for full billing office services so far this year, and we have a strong pipeline moving forward. Similar to ITWorks, we believe that we have a compelling value proposition with RevWorks that will lead to accelerated adoption as we build the proof points.
In our professional services business, we had record bookings in each of the last 2 quarters. As I said last quarter, our professional services organization is the largest and most experienced healthcare IT services organization in the world. Our unmatched experience, coupled with our proven implementation tools and methodology, serve as a major competitive differentiator, particularly in the market environment where clients want predictable costs and predictable results. I'm pleased that we have been able to keep up with the hiring and training which has allowed us to stay aligned with our strong demand and quickly turn new hires into valuable, revenue generating associates.
Our CernerWorks managed services business had another outstanding quarter with very strong bookings and operational performance. CernerWorks is the foundation that has led to the launch of other service offerings such as ITWorks, and we believe it will be the platform for several other offerings in the future. With almost all new clients selecting our managed services offering, and our existing U.S. client base steadily migrating, we have a substantial platform to leverage as a channel to roll out additional solutions and services.
A good example is Cerner's Skybox cloud services that I mentioned last quarter. We called it Skybox, as a new suite of on-demand infrastructure and software services that are deployed, hosted and managed by Cerner. These services currently include storage, messaging, backup and virtual desktop. We intend to rapidly expand the portfolio of services over the upcoming quarters by packaging existing CernerWorks capabilities into cloud-based offerings. Our speed to market with these services are very fast, as evidenced by the fact that we have already sold 2 of these services to 2 clients for a total of $8 million of bookings this year.
In closing, when you consider all of our works and professional services capabilities, the common factors that we have invested in creating highly scalable, reliable and predictable services that create great value for our clients. And this approach has led to an unmatched suite of services offerings that differentiate us in the marketplace and drive a significant portion of Cerner's predictable revenue and earnings growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

I frequently use this time to share some of our broader initiatives, but today, I thought I'd also share some of the more specific offerings underway that are positioning Cerner and our clients as a platform for interoperability, a platform",1213,"Thanks, Mike. I frequently use this time to share some of our broader initiatives, but today, I thought I'd also share some of the more specific offerings underway that are positioning Cerner and our clients as a platform for interoperability, a platform to measure and improve outcomes and a platform that engages consumers.
As both Zane and Mike have shared, there is a growing momentum that continues to move the innovation bar on our ability to get beyond Meaningful Use a function and to extract true value from the growing digitization of the medical record across communities.
As I've shared from time to time, our clients are aggressively taking advantage of the potential to share information across the fragmented provider landscape. With increasing levels of interoperability expectations, also comes new challenges to organize and communicate information across the geographic region. We continue to disrupt some of the more complicated challenges with interoperability, through deployment of our cloud services such Search, which has grown by 104 terabytes since last quarter, a 260% increase. To frame this progress more broadly, I want to share some stats on our progress around connectivity as well.
As we continue to expand our connections and those of our clients, we have seen a 20% increase year-over-year in e-prescribing transactions, with over 30,000 providers now activated.
Our clinical transaction network is currently capable of linking to over 60 unique EMR suppliers, 20 of which are now actively connected. Our Cerner Network hub services now includes over 80 health systems, with 75% of those connecting to 2 or more non-Cerner EMR systems.
Across our clinical exchange, HIE projects, we now have 23 HIE deployments, with 8 of those being regionally focused, actively sharing continuity of care documents between acute and ambulatory EMR systems.
As our cloud-based portfolio of decision support agents expand, the progress in connecting providers regardless of their data sources becomes more and more important to position our clients for the journey towards ACOs and population health management. 
Shifting towards quality and outcomes, there is an accelerating momentum towards creating alignment of clinical contacts and reimbursement. And there are no signs from the policy front that this direction will change course.
The expectation that healthcare becomes much more data-driven has broken through the surface, and more and more quality in outcome measures are finding their way into the reimbursement calculation. EMS quality measures, value-based purchasing and Medicare 30-day readmissions are just the beginning of the growing expectation that will change how providers are paid. Without addressing any of the current budget discussion, the current course is that at risk medical reimbursement will move from 4% in 2013 to 7% in 2017. As Zane mentioned, this is a $5 billion revenue risk in our current client base alone.
To make this more challenging, several of these programs are budget neutral, with winners and losers separated by comparison performance levels. We foresee that information management will become an increasing priority for our clients and in the market more widely. Our cloud-based data management solutions, our expertise in managing large data sets for research and our access to granular, realtime clinical information, puts us in a unique position to innovate at a pace to meet the dynamic requirements ahead. We are quickly approaching an environment where recording about what has already happened is too late, as the intervention must occur realtime, with embedded and proactive decision support.
As an example of our commitment in this space, Cerner is currently in a unique position within our industry as being certified by The Joint Commission for ORYX core measures, as well as CMS approval for submission of inpatient, outpatient hospital quality measures, which will include the e-submission of Meaningful Use measures going forward.
Many of these innovations are a byproduct of our own experiences as we attempt to manage the health of Cerner's population. As I shared last quarter, using Cerner Associates and family members of the Living Lab to advance Cerner's healthcare cost curve, while also improving the health of productivity of our associates. This is included filing our third-party administrator, launching new age on-site clinics and pharmacies, incorporating biometric measurements our population, realigning the economic incentives for our associates in our health plan, revamping our cafeterias to focus on healthier choices and rolling our data-driven wellness management programs. These initiatives have led us to truly bend the healthcare cost curve with our per member costs now tracking well below the national average and realizing $4 million in savings in 2010. All while the health status of our associates has steadily improved.
We are using the success we've had at Cerner to shape our employee services offerings and provide insights to create solutions for our provider clients. We will soon be intended to drive healthier outcomes for new reimbursement, models such as the Accountable Care Organizations. A recent example of building on the success we have had at Cerner is our KC Slimdown Challenge, which is the Kansas City metro-wide weight loss competition that is modeled after a successful challenge at Cerner that has led to over 20,000 pounds being shed by our associates.
The KC Slimdown Challenge expands this to individuals and employers in Kansas City and is aimed at improving the overall health and wellness of the community. There are already more than 80 employers participating in the challenge.
As part of this challenge, all participants will be introduced to Cerner health and receive a personal health record at no cost that will allow them to securely track and interact with all aspects of their health. We have seen the use of PHRs in our own associate base increased significantly over the past several years, where we have found different ways to engage, connecting them to their health providers and making them feel accountable and empowered to manage their health. Using Cerner Hub as a platform, we believe that we can scale our own experiences to an entire community.
As you know, we also have a much broader vision than just providing the PHR, and we will use Kansas City as our first regional initiative to prove the value of an engaged consumer. This begins with the weight-loss competition, which we are using to drive PHR adoption and jump-start the creation of a network of employers, consumers, doctors and other stakeholders. As we drive adoption and create these connections to stakeholders, we will be advancing many of the necessary building blocks towards our vision of creating a New Middle.
By having the providers, consumers and employees connected, we will have the ability to facilitate more seamless coordination of care across all venues, provide a medical home, reduce friction in the payment process and incent proactive health engagement rather than in reactive sick care.
As I discussed in our investor day in March, the financial opportunity associating with providing these elements across the communities is substantial. Just in the Kansas City region alone, we believe we could reduce the cost of healthcare by billions of dollars and generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue for Cerner while doing this. We have a lot of work to do to get there, but I believe we are on the right path.
With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

There were a couple of things that were kind of hidden in that new recommendation which are very positive for Cerner, particularly around meds administration and around the physician documentation. So there was a tightening of that around Stage 2, which is beneficial for us, because our percentage of clients that have purchased those solutions is still -- we still have opportunity, a fair amount of whitespace in that area, and that does create some good opportunity for us. And just anecdotally, what it did do was kind of reward people that were able to meet Stage 1 today and give them a longer period for Stage 2. So our clients, in general terms, are positioned actually to achieve their Meaningful Use dollars given the high level of CPOE adoption.

Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, will be traveling today and not be joining us on the call.
Now turning to our results. All key measures in Q2 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $80 million. Our income statement performance is very good, with revenue and adjusted EPS above our guidance and consensus, and continued strong margin expansion and earnings growth. We again had excellent cash flow performance with strong levels of free cash flow reflective of good earnings quality.
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q2 was $650 million, which is the second-best result in company history, second only to Q4 of '09. Bookings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by about $100 million and we're up 39% from Q2 of 2010. Bookings margin in Q2 was $540 million or 83% of total bookings. I thought it'd be appropriate to provide some additional color on the strong bookings performance.
With respect to the $100 million overattainment, about half of the upside is related to 2 large contracts that were included in our original bookings guidance coming in above the risk-weighted amounts we forecasted. These contracts were HealthSouth, which we announced this morning, and our seventh ITWorks client contract that Mike will discuss later. The remaining $50 million of upside came from strength across all business models that led to a record 23 contracts over $5 million in the quarter.
Looking at the mix of long-term contracts, the ITWorks deal and overall strong hosting bookings led to bookings from long-term contracts being around 35% of total bookings, which is the high end of historical levels which have averaged around 29%. Note that even if you adjust long-term bookings down to historical levels, our bookings still would have exceeded the high end of our guidance range and grown approximately 30% year-over-year. In short, this was an outstanding bookings quarter, no matter how you slice it.
Our bookings performance drove a 21% increase in total backlog to $5.41 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.74 billion is 23% higher than a year ago. The full revenue backlog totaled $679 million, up 7% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was $524.2 million, which is up 15% over Q2 2010. The revenue composition for Q2 was $157 million in systems sales; $138 million in support and maintenance; $217 million in services; and $12 million in reimbursed travel.
Systems sales revenue reflects 15% growth from Q2 of '10 driven by strong growth in software and subscriptions. Technology resale was basically flat, the strong growth in device resale offsetting decline in traditional technology resale. Services revenue was up 18% compared to Q2 of '10, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue is 8% over Q2 '10.
Looking at revenues by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $450 million. Global revenue of $74 million was down 1% year-over-year, but was up 5% sequentially, and we expect positive year-over-year growth for the remainder of the year, based on strong global bookings in the first half of the year and a strong pipeline.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 81.2%, which is down 160 basis points year-over-year and down 40 basis points sequentially. Gross margin continues to be impacted by strength in device resale, which carries a lower margin than our traditional hardware resale and an increase in third-party services. As we have discussed previously, we expect gross margin to remain in the low 80s, but we still expect to continue expanding operating margin, which we did again this quarter despite the lower gross margin.
Looking at operating spending. Our second quarter operating expenses were $311.2 million before share-based compensation of $6.6 million. Our total operating expense was up 9% compared to Q2 of '10, with a majority of the growth driven by an increase in revenue-generating associates in our services business.
Sales and client service expenses increased 11% compared to Q2 of '10, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. Our investment in software development increased 2% compared to Q2 of '10, reflecting continued leverage of our R&D investments. One way we are leveraging these resources is by moving some of them to support growth initiatives, such as ITWorks.
G&A expenses increased 14% year-over-year, driven by personnel and non-personnel expenses related to increased hiring and training, and expenses related to our resource systems acquisition. 
Moving to operating margin. Our operating margin in Q2 was 21.8% before share-based compensation expense. This is up 160 basis points compared to Q2 of '10 and in line with our target of 100- to 200-basis point increase in 2011.
Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $72.0 million or $0.42 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.1 million or $0.02 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $76.1 million and adjusted EPS was $0.44, which is up 26% compared to Q2 of '10. Our tax rate in Q2 was 35.2%, and we expect our tax rate to remain at approximately 35% for the rest of the year.
Now I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $1.01 billion of total cash and investments, up from $949 million in Q1. Total cash and investments include $682 million of cash and short-term investments, and $330 million of highly rated corporate government bonds with maturities over 1 year. Our total debt is $115 million. Total accounts receivable ended the quarter at $504 million, which is up $35 million from Q1. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables, were $158 million and represent 31% of total receivable compared to 28% in Q1.
Cash collections were $509 million and third-party financings were $19 million, representing 4% of total cash collected. Our DSO in Q2 was 88 days, which is up 1 day compared to Q1, and flat compared to Q2 of 2010. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $122.1 million.
Q2 capital expenditures were $30.3 million and capitalized software was $20.6 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $71.2 million. We expect capital expenditures in the second half of the year to be higher than the $50 million we have spent first half of the year. We still expect to continue generating strong operating and free cash flow.
Moving to capitalized software. The $20.6 million of capitalized software in Q2 represents 29% of the $70.5 million of total spending on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19.9 million, resulting in net capitalization of $0.7 million or 1% of our total R&D investments. For the rest of the year, we expect capitalized software to be between $20 million and $22 million per quarter, and amortization of $19 million to $20 million per quarter.
Now let me go through the guidance. For Q3 revenue, we expect revenue between $520 million and $540 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 15% over Q3 of 2010. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.09 billion and $2.12 billion, up from our previous range of $2.07 billion to $2.12 billion. We expect Q3 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.46 to $0.48 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 24% growth. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $1.80 and $1.83, with the midpoint reflecting 23% growth. This is up from our previous range of $1.78 to $1.81.
Q3 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense or approximately $313 million to $318 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is $0.02 to $0.03 for Q3 and $0.10 to $0.11 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $560 million to $600 million, with the midpoint of this range reflecting 17% growth over record bookings in Q3 2010.
In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q2, with all key metrics at or above our expected ranges. Specifically, we are pleased with our record level of bookings and revenue, continued margin expansion and earnings growth, and strong levels of operating and free cash flow generation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll be covering our sales results and marketplace trends. I'll start with the results. We had another quarter of record bookings, with strong growth both in our client base and our new footprints. Our bookin",1649,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be covering our sales results and marketplace trends. I'll start with the results. We had another quarter of record bookings, with strong growth both in our client base and our new footprints. Our bookings revenue in Q2 of $650 million represents 39% growth over last year and is all-time high for the second quarter.
Bookings this quarter included 23 contracts over $5 million, which is an all-time high. 9 of these contracts were over $10 million. The strength of our bookings this quarter came from a broad range of solutions and services. We had strong contributions from all business models, with particular strength in licensed software, professional services and managed services. As Mike will discuss, we signed another ITWorks contract which contributed to the strength in professional and managed services bookings.
Additionally, we were selected by HealthSouth, the nation's largest provider of inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services to provide a wide range of services and solutions for 97 rehabilitation facilities across 26 states. This is another example of a highly regarded investor-owned health system selecting Cerner, based on our proven ability to deliver value. It's important to note that this purchase is unrelated to ARRA, as rehab facilities are not eligible for stimulus dollars. We believe this represents the beginning of a trend where providers are automating across transitions of care and preparing for future healthcare models.
Our agile business units also continued to drive contribution across a wide range of solutions and services, with noteworthy strength in Lighthouse clinical process optimization, women's health, laboratory, emergency, oncology, the Cerner Network and Hub, revenue cycle, medical devices and community hospitals.
An area of particular strength I want to highlight this quarter is our physician solutions. After a strong Q1, we had record bookings quarter in Q2 and our year-to-date physician bookings are up over 50%. These include strength in selling directly to physician practices and through our health system client base. As I discussed last quarter, the improvements we made to the physician-user interface and workflow have been recognized by the industry and our strong year-to-date performance reflects this. We continue to see a desire in the marketplace to purchase a fully integrated inpatient and outpatient solution, as providers look for tighter linkage across venues in anticipation of bundled payments and being accountable for managing health and providing high-quality outcomes. We are very well positioned to meet these needs, and it is now showing up in our results.
We also differentiate from others in the industry with our ability and willingness to inter-operate with other systems. This gives clients who have already made a significant investment in non-Cerner ambulatory solutions flexibility that most other suppliers can't or won't offer. Another highlight for the quarter was strong performance by our DeviceWorks organizations, including good levels of iBus device connectivity sales and a strong quarter of reselling CareFusion and other devices. As we have discussed, our device resale business is expected to more than offset the decline in traditional hardware resale that we have been experiencing, as more clients select our hosting option. This is playing out so far this year, and I expect us to continue expanding our relationship with device manufacturers going forward.
Moving to new client development. Our competitiveness was very strong in Q2, with 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium base. This success crosses all segments, ranging from small hospitals selecting our community works offering to large multi-facility IDNs buying a broad suite of solutions and services.
Our proven track record and success of our installed base plays a big role in our ability to get these new footprints. As an example, we are getting the attention of many prospective clients based on the leadership of our client base in receiving initial Meaningful Use dollars. Meanwhile, some other installed bases struggle with certain requirements, such as getting data out of their systems.
Our clients have already received over $100 million, which we believe leads the industry in dollars received. Given our installed base has the most live CPOE sites and is using CPOE at the deepest level in the industry, we believe our clients will continue to lead the industry in receiving Meaningful Use dollars.
I believe our competitive differentiation will continue to increase as we approach Meaningful Use Stage 2 and other industry requirements. We're having several discussions with prospective clients that are trying to meet Stage 1 requirements with their legacy systems, but are looking to align with a more proven and strategic supplier to meet their Stage 2 and 3 requirements, along with positioning themselves for healthcare reform, value-based purchasing, ICD-10, HIPAA 5010, ACOs, data analytic capabilities and other industry shifts they think will challenge their existing supplier. Because these requirements play out over an extended amount of time, I think our window of opportunity to gain market share will remain open for several years.
Moving to our global results. As Marc mentioned, our global revenue was flat year-over-year, but we had another strong global bookings quarter and expect good global revenue growth for the rest of the year.
A Q2 highlight was our contract with Sidra Medical and Research Center, which selected Cerner to help them become the first hospital in Qatar to have a fully integrated healthcare system. This contract further demonstrates our strong market presence in the Middle East and positions us for additional business in the region. We also continue to deepen our presence in Abu Dhabi, where we brought our maternity solution live at 6 hospitals, representing our first women's health to go live in the region.
Other areas of global strength from the quarter were Canada and England, where we continued our momentum after a strong Q1, and Australia where we had a solid bookings quarter along with 2 important go-lives in Victoria. We expect our strong global bookings in the first half of the year, along with the strong global pipeline, which translate to good contributions to our income statement in the second half of the year and beyond.
Turning back to the U.S., I want to provide some marketplace observations. Similar to what I indicated last quarter, the marketplace is very strong and we are seeing unprecedented levels of demand. As you would expect, we continue seeing strong demand as our clients move toward their Meaningful Use roadmaps. The rising bars for Stages 2 and 3 is creating more incremental purchasing, as more of our clients begin to purchase solutions to meet the more challenging requirements, such as medication administration and structured physician documentation.
While Meaningful Use is a major topic with clients, we spend just as much time, or more, talking to clients about solutions and services to prepare for other regulatory requirements and industry trends that require planning beyond Meaningful Use. These include revenue cycle capabilities to prepare for ICD-10 requirements, clinical process, quality optimization and reporting capabilities to be ready for value-based purchasing, as well as solutions and services to facilitate ACO strategies. It is important to note that there are major financial incentives for providers to adopt technology beyond what is required for Meaningful Use. Just in our client base, we estimate there is approximately $3 billion of annual revenue at risk tied to value-based purchasing, Medicare 30-day re-administration rules and quality reporting requirements, which begin in 2013. This ramps to an estimated $5 billion of revenue at risk in 2017, when the programs are fully implemented.
Our ability to demonstrate capabilities to help clients navigate through Meaningful Use while preparing them to address the changing world beyond Meaningful Use, makes us an attractive choice compared to many competitors who are focused only on achieving the Meaningful Use hurdle. We are finding our that our innovative platform and data analytics capabilities are becoming an increasingly important competitive advantage, as most competitors are roll-ups of multiple systems that have not been integrated -- and those that are integrated using non-relational database, which makes getting data out of the system for data analytics very difficult. The awareness of these challenges is becoming more widespread in the industry, and we believe this will be very good for Cerner.
I believe all the factors I have discussed will drive a multiyear period of strong demand that aligns very well with our core solutions and services, and not just a 12- to 18-month way that some people expect. Because of the multiple steps related to Meaningful Use and the different levels of existing adoption across the industry, all of the purchasing related to stimulus will not occur at once.
Further, all the other industry dynamics such as healthcare reform, value-based purchasing, ICD-10 and HIPAA 5010 will extend the wave of demand. This extended growth period will also be augmented by increasing contributions from our new initiatives such as ITWorks and RevWorks as they begin to drive more income statement contribution.
Before closing, I'd like to provide some comments on our acquisition of Resource Systems. For those of you who aren't familiar with Resource Systems, they provide the care tracker point-of-care electronic documentation system currently utilized by more than 3,000 organizations, primarily within skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. This solution is very complementary to and will be integrated with our long-term care, EMR. There are more than 15,000 long-term care facilities in the United States and it's expected to grow significantly as the population ages.
Additionally, we believe that as ACOs place a focus on pre-acute and post-acute care, many of these care venues defined as post-acute today will evolve to fit a proactive model of managing health. We're already seeing strong interest for the integrated long-term care solutions that we are now uniquely positioned to offer. In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong results in Q2 and I think we are well positioned for an outstanding year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."
259627,137257132,149144,"Cerner Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today by discussing ITWorks. As Marc and Zane mentioned, we signed our seventh ITWorks client in Q2.

As Marc and Zane mentioned, we signed our seventh ITWorks client in Q2. This client is a health system with approximately 700 beds across 3 main facilities and is our largest ITWorks client so far. This is also a displacement of a competitor that had been providing IT services to this client for 10 years.
Our focus will be addressing infrastructure issues, completing the Meaningful Use roadmap, optimizing clinical processes and driving CPOE adoption.
Similar to other ITWorks clients, they're on a quest for better service and greater value than they were receiving from their existing IT services company. Our existing ITWorks clients also played a significant role in this client's decision. They had excellent reference calls and site visits with 2 of our existing ITWorks clients. It's noteworthy that one of the reference clients had only been an ITWorks client for 3 months but was able to share their positive experience with transitioning to Cerner, the rapid improvement in service and the value they are receiving by aligning with us.
We have quickly proven that ITWorks is not just another IT outsourcing service. ITWorks involves a strategic alignment with our clients that goes beyond traditional outsourcing. While part of the service does lead to the expected benefit of leveraging our scale to improve their basic IT operations, clients see the most significant progress at accelerating clinical adoption and innovation at the edges of healthcare.
As we intended, ITWorks is following the pattern of our CernerWorks managed services business. It's a simple model. If we provide a high-quality service that provides superior value to our clients, it'll make for a compelling value proposition and client adoption will accelerate as proof points are established. We now have the proof points and the adoption is just beginning to accelerate.
We believe that as we continue to get closer to the edge of the healthcare through ITWorks, that it will change Cerner, our clients, and ultimately, healthcare. And along the way, it will contribute to many years of strong predictable growth for Cerner.
We also had a strong good quarter in our revenue cycle business, where we continue to drive benefits at our initial RevWorks clients, with ongoing improvements in net revenue and reduction in operating expenses. We are also rapidly increasing the number of live patient accounting sites by selling 8 new footprints, and bringing 15 hospitals and 19 clinics live in Q2. We now have a total of 62 hospitals and 302 clinics live on patient accounting.
An element of RevWorks we have not discussed as much in the past that is gaining traction is our ambulatory revenue cycle offering. We have contracted with over 60 ambulatory clients for full billing office services so far this year, and we have a strong pipeline moving forward. Similar to ITWorks, we believe that we have a compelling value proposition with RevWorks that will lead to accelerated adoption as we build the proof points.
In our professional services business, we had record bookings in each of the last 2 quarters. As I said last quarter, our professional services organization is the largest and most experienced healthcare IT services organization in the world. Our unmatched experience, coupled with our proven implementation tools and methodology, serve as a major competitive differentiator, particularly in the market environment where clients want predictable costs and predictable results. I'm pleased that we have been able to keep up with the hiring and training which has allowed us to stay aligned with our strong demand and quickly turn new hires into valuable revenue-generating associates.
Our CernerWorks managed services business had another outstanding quarter with very strong bookings and operational performance. CernerWorks is the foundation that has led to the launch of other service offerings such as ITWorks, and we believe it will be the platform for several other offerings in the future. With almost all new clients selecting our managed services offering and our existing U.S. client base steadily migrating, we have a substantial platform to leverage as a channel to roll out additional solutions and services.
A good example is Cerner's Skybox cloud services that I mentioned last quarter. We called it Skybox. It's a new suite of on-demand infrastructure and software services that are deployed, hosted and managed by Cerner. These services currently include storage, messaging, backup and virtual desktop. We intend to rapidly expand the portfolio of services over the upcoming quarters by packaging existing CernerWorks capabilities into cloud-based offerings. Our speed to market with these services are very fast, as evidenced by the fact that we have already sold 2 of these services to 2 clients for a total of $8 million of bookings this year.
In closing, when you consider all of our works and professional services capabilities, the common factor is that we have invested in creating highly scalable, reliable and predictable services that create great value for our clients. And this approach has led to an unmatched suite of services offerings that differentiate us in the marketplace and drive a significant portion of Cerner's predictable revenue and earnings growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

I frequently use this time to share some of our broader initiatives, but today I thought I'd also share some of the more specific offerings underway that are positioning Cerner and our clients as a platform for interoperability, a platform t",1211,"Thanks, Mike. I frequently use this time to share some of our broader initiatives, but today I thought I'd also share some of the more specific offerings underway that are positioning Cerner and our clients as a platform for interoperability, a platform to measure and improve outcomes and a platform to engage consumers.
As both Zane and Mike have shared, there is a growing momentum that continues to move the innovation bar on our ability to get beyond Meaningful Use of functions and to extract true value from the growing digitization of the medical record across communities.
As I've shared from time to time, our clients are aggressively taking advantage of the potential to share information across the fragmented provider landscape. With increasing levels of interoperability expectations also comes new challenges to organize and communicate information across the geographic region. We continue to disrupt some of the more complicated challenges with interoperability through deployment of our cloud services such Search, which has grown by 104 terabytes since last quarter, a 260% increase. To frame this progress more broadly, I want to share some stats on our progress around connectivity as well.
As we continue to expand our connections and those of our clients, we have seen a 20% increase year-over-year in e-prescribing transactions, with over 30,000 providers now activated.
Our clinical transaction network is currently capable of linking to over 60 unique EMR suppliers, 20 of which are now actively connected. Our Cerner Network hub services now includes over 80 health systems, with 75% of those connecting to 2 or more non-Cerner EMR systems.
Across our clinical exchange, HIE projects, we now have 23 HIE deployments, with 8 of those being regionally focused, actively sharing continuity of care documents between acute and ambulatory EMR systems.
As our cloud-based portfolio of decision support agents expand, the progress in connecting providers regardless of their data sources becomes more and more important to position our clients for the journey towards ACOs and population health management. 
Shifting towards quality in outcomes, there is an accelerating momentum towards creating alignment of clinical context and reimbursement. And there are no signs from the policy front that this direction will change course.
The expectation that healthcare becomes much more data-driven has broken through the surface, and more and more quality-in-outcome measures are finding their way into the reimbursement calculation. EMS quality measures, value-based purchasing and Medicare 30-day readmissions are just the beginning of a growing expectation that will change how providers are paid. Without addressing any of the current budget discussions, the current course is that at risk medical reimbursement will move from 4% in 2013 to 7% in 2017. As Zane mentioned, this is a $5 billion revenue risk in our current client base alone.
To make this more challenging, several of these programs are budget neutral, with winners and losers separated by comparison performance levels. We foresee that information management will become an increasing priority for our clients and in the market more widely. Our cloud-based data management solutions, our expertise in managing large data sets for research and our access to granular, realtime clinical information puts us in a unique position to innovate at a pace to meet the dynamic requirements ahead. We are quickly approaching an environment where reporting about what has already happened is too late, as the intervention must occur realtime, with embedded and proactive decision support.
As an example of our commitment in this space, Cerner is currently in a unique position within our industry as being certified by The Joint Commission for ORYX core measures, as well as CMS-approved for submission of inpatient-outpatient hospital quality measures which will include the e-submission of Meaningful Use measures going forward.
Many of these innovations are a byproduct of our own experiences as we attempt to manage the health of Cerner's population. As I shared last quarter, using Cerner Associates and family members as a Living Lab, we have bent Cerner's healthcare cost curve, while also improving the health and productivity of our associates. This has included firing our third-party administrator, launching new age on-site clinics and pharmacies, incorporating biometric measurements for our population, realigning the economic incentives for our associates in our health plan, revamping our cafeterias to focus on healthier choices and rolling out data-driven wellness management programs. These initiatives have led us to truly bend the healthcare cost curve with our per member costs now tracking well below the national average and realizing $4 million in savings in 2010 -- all while the health status of our associates has steadily improved.
We are using the success we've had at Cerner to shape our employee services offerings and provide insights to create solutions for our provider clients. We will soon be intended to drive healthier outcomes for new reimbursement models such as the Accountable Care Organizations. A recent example of building on the success we have had at Cerner is our KC Slimdown Challenge, which is a Kansas City metro-wide weight loss competition that is modeled after a successful challenge at Cerner that has led to over 20,000 pounds being shed by our associates.
The KC Slimdown Challenge expands this to individuals and employers in Kansas City and is aimed at improving the overall health and wellness of the community. There are already more than 80 employers participating in the challenge.
As part of this challenge, all participants will be introduced to Cerner Health and receive a personal health record at no cost that will allow them to securely track and interact with all aspects of their health. We have seen the use of PHRs in our own associate base increase significantly over the past several years, where we have found different ways to engage, connecting them to their health providers and making them feel accountable and empowered to manage their health. Using Cerner Health as a platform, we believe that we can scale our own experiences to an entire community.
As you know, we also have a much broader vision than just providing the PHR, and we will use Kansas City as our first regional initiative to prove the value of an engaged consumer. This begins with the weight-loss competition, which we are using to drive PHR adoption and jump-start the creation of a network of employers, consumers, doctors and other stakeholders. As we drive adoption and create these connections to stakeholders, we will be advancing many of the necessary building blocks towards our vision of creating a New Middle.
By having the providers, consumers and employers connected, we will have the ability to facilitate more seamless coordination of care across all venues, provide a medical home, reduce friction in the payment process and incent proactive health engagement rather than reactive sick care.
As I discussed in our investor day in March, the financial opportunity associating with providing these elements across the communities is substantial. Just in the Kansas City region alone, we believe we could reduce the cost of healthcare by billions of dollars and generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue for Cerner while doing this. We have a lot of work to do to get there, but I believe we are on the right path.
With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

That's part of the strategy, is that in itself might not be a high margin business, but the ability to sell additional software back and convert them to Cerner applications of course not only gets you incremental Cerner Solutions software dollars, but also starts the support stream running from Cerner. So those are the kind of add-on sales, in addition to being able to effectively help them manage their implementation and coexist it with Cerner Solutions.

Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer will discuss operations. Mike will be followed by Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, who will discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, is traveling to date but should be available to join for Q&.A.
Now I'll turn to our results. All key measures in Q3 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Our income statement performance was excellent with revenue and adjusted EPS above expected levels and continued margin expansion in strong earnings growth. And we have very strong cash flow performance. 
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q3 was $650 million, which is the second-best result in company history, second only to Q4 of '09. Bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $50 million and we are up 31% from Q3 of '10. Bookings margin in Q3 was $534 million or 82% of total bookings. As Zane will discuss, the strength of bookings span across all business models. Our bookings performance drove a 21% increase in total backlog to $5.66 billion. The contract revenue backlog of $4.96 billion is 24% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $691 million, up 8% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was $571.6 million, which is up 24% over Q3 of '10 and about $30 million over our guidance. The revenue composition for Q3 was $189 million in system sales, $139 million in support and maintenance, $233 million in services and $11 million in reimbursed travel. The upside relative to our guidance was largely driven by higher system sales, as well as very strong services revenue. The system sales revenue reflects 41% growth from Q3 of '10, and included greater than 20% growth in licensed software and subscriptions, and over 50% growth in technology resale. The technology resale growth included record levels of device resale, reflective of rapidly increased traction in the resale of CareFusion and other devices. Even with strong software growth, even stronger growth in technology resale led to lower system sales margins of 55%. However, when you look at the growth in system sales margin dollars, it mimics the growth of revenue at a very strong 37%. 
Services revenue was up 22% compared to Q3 of '10 with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue increased 6% over Q3 of '10. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 27% year-over-year to $499 million. Global revenue was $72 million and grew 5% compared to a year ago period. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 78.9%, which is down compared to 82.9% of a year ago and 81.2% in Q2. The decline in gross margin was driven by the record levels of technology resale that I discussed, as well as an increase in third-party services. While significant upside in technology resale and higher third-party costs led the gross margins slightly below our target of 80% range, we still drove very strong gross margin dollars with growth of 18%. We also grow solid operating margin expansion despite the lower gross margin. 
Looking at operating spending. Our third quarter operating expenses were $323.3 million before share-based compensation expense of $7.5 million. Total operating expense was up 14% compared to Q3 '10 with the majority of the growth driven by an increase in revenue generating associates in our services businesses. Sales and client services expenses increased 16% compared to Q3 of '10, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. Our investment in software development increased 8% compared to Q3 of '10. We expect the continued growth our R&D investment in the coming years to accelerate innovation in areas Mike and Jeff will discuss. We expect we will be able to do this with R&D still growing slower than revenue so maintain the leverage we have achieved from our R&D investments. 
G&A expense increased 16% year-over-year, driven by personnel and other expenses related to increased hiring and training. 
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q3 was 22.4% before share-based compensation expense. And this was up 70 basis points compared to Q3 of '10. We still expect operating margin expansion in Q4 and for the full year to fall within the 100 to 200 basis point range we targeted at the beginning of the year. 
Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 was $78.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share. That net earnings include share-based compensation expense which had a net impact on earnings of $4.6 million or $0.03 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $83.5 million and adjusted EPS was $0.48, which is up 26% compared to Q3 of '10. The tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 36.1%. This is on a 1% higher than we projected due to a lower mix of non-U.S. earnings. And the higher tax rate reduced EPS by $0.01. We expect our tax rate to remain approximately 36% for Q4. 
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $1.09 billion of cash and investments, up from $1.01 billion in Q2. Total cash and investments include $755 million of cash and short-term investments, and $335 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities over 1 year. Our total debt is $134 million. Total receivables end of the quarter at $548 million, which is up $44 million from Q2. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables, were $103 million and was up represent 19% of total receivables compared to 31% in Q2. The favorable shift to a lower mix of contracts receivables is driven by a combination of increased billings that brought down contracts receivables and strong sales in the quarter that drove out accounts receivable. Cash collections were a record $533 million. Our DSO in Q3 was 87 days, which is down 1 day compared to Q2 and down 4 days compared to Q3 of '10. Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $129.2 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $23.9 million and capitalized software was $20.8 million. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $84.5 million. We expect capital expenditures to increase in Q4, but we still expect to generate strong free cash flow. 
Looking at next year, we do expect an increase in capital expenditures compared to the low $100 million range we had been at for the last 2 years. Some of this will be driven by the construction of additional space at the Kansas City Kansas campus that are needed for our growing associate base. We do not expect to have a material impact on our free cash flow as the construction will span multiple years and we will also be receiving incentives for a portion of the construction costs. 
Moving to capitalized software. The $20.8 million of capitalized software in Q3 represents 29% of the $72.4 million of total spending on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $20.9 million or $0.1 million more until we capitalized. 
Now let me go through the guidance. For Q4 revenue, we expect revenue between $575 million and $595 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 17% over Q4 of '10. This equates to a full year revenue between $2.16 billion and $2.18 billion, up from our previous range of $2.09 billion $2.12 billion. That represents full-year growth of 17%. We expect Q4 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.51 to $0.53 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 18% growth. This equates to full year adjusted EPS between $1.83 and $1.85, which is up from our previous range of $1.80 to $1.83 and reflects 24% growth. Q4 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $325 million to $330 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense in Q4 is $0.03. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $630 million to $670 million. This reflects modest growth over our strong Q4 '10 results, but would lead to full year bookings of about $2.5 billion, which is 24% growth over 2010. 
I would also like to provide our initial thoughts on 2012. The initial version of our 2012 plan supports the current 2012 consensus estimates for revenue and earnings per share. As always, we will continue to update our outlook on future earnings calls. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'm going to provide highlights of our sales results and cover marketplace trends. Starting with our results. We had another record quarter of bookings driven by robust demand in our client base and strong competitiveness in new footprint opportunities. Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $650 million represents 31% growth over last year and is all-time high from the third quarter. The strength in bookings this quarter was very broad with all business models contributing at least 24% growth. We also had an all-time high level of large contracts, with 25 contracts over $5 million and 16 over $10 million. The strength in our bookings is more impressive when you consider that we had a lower than normal level of contribution from long-term contracts, with no ITWorks or RevWorks clients this quarter. As Mike will discuss, our outlook for these businesses remained strong, we just didn't have any deals this quarter. One driver of the strength in our bookings and revenue this quarter was record results of our DeviceWorks organizations. This quarter's strength included record levels of our sales along with strong levels of reselling CareFusion, Pyxis medication dispensing devices. In addition, we had a strong iBus device connectivity sales and strong resale at devices such as infusion pumps, beds and monitoring devices. We also have 3 clients purchased Smart Rooms for the entire units to their hospital, which contributed to sell of multiple solutions and devices. 
Overall, we are seeing strong traction in this business as clients recognize the value of connected devices and device manufacturers recognize the value of our device connectivity platform and the strategic relationships we have with our clients. 
Q3 was also a record quarter for our physician solutions and included the 2 largest PowerWorks contracts in our history. With our record Q3 results, our year-to-date bookings for physician solutions now exceed our full year plan. We're clearly gaining traction and market share with the usability enhancements we have made and our ability to offer robust physician solutions that are fully integrated across inpatient and outpatient environments. As Mike will discuss, we are continuing to raise the bar on our physician solutions by further enhancing our usability and our mobile capabilities, which will widen differentiation in the marketplace. A major validation of the strength of our position solution also occurred in Q3 when a major IDN chose to replace their existing outpatient solution with Cerner Solutions, displacing our primary competitor in the process. They are also adding our revenue cycle solutions for both inpatient and outpatient which validates the improvements we've made in that space as well. 
Moving onto our global results. As Marc mentioned, our global revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q3 after being down in the first half of the year. We continued to see gradual improvements in most global markets and have some noteworthy areas of strength such as Canada, Australia and the Middle East. In England, there has been a lot of coverage of proposed changes to the national program. In the near term, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on Cerner as we expect our existing contracts to be honored. In the intermediate term, we believe the changes are positive as they create more opportunities for us to sell directly to trust in all regions. We are very well-positioned to do this and have already seen an increase in RFP activity. 
Another indication of strong global activity was the attendance by global clients at our Cerner Health Conference. Global attendance was up 34% compared to last year and included attendees from 13 countries. 
Moving to the overall marketplace and our competitiveness. We gain market share again in Q3 with 29% of bookings coming from outside of our corporate installed base. We continued to see both Greenfield opportunities and opportunities in several of our competitors client bases. Their clients are concerned about our competitors ability to keep up with meaningful use requirements, particularly when looking beyond Stage 1. In the coming years, we believe this vulnerability of our competitors installed base will increase with the requirements for value-based purchasing, Other stages of meaningful use, ACOs and data analytics capabilities. As a result, we believe we are in the early stages of a multiyear market share shift and we believe we are extremely well positioned to be a major share gain or during this time due to depth and breadth of our solutions that are ready today to help clients meet industry demands. 
Further, our unmatched services and delivery capabilities provide an important differentiator compared to competitors that can't offer them imprintable results. As an example of our competitiveness is Ventura County healthcare Agency selecting Cerner for a broad suite and Millennium solutions for 2 hospitals and over 40 ambulatory clinics. This selection of our primary competitor was driven by the strength of our integrated inpatient outpatient solutions, our predicable services delivery model and our ability to demonstrate a total lower cost of ownership. We also established a new footprint with a large investor owned company that owns or operates 200 ambulatory surgery centers and 14 surgical hospitals to implement a suite of clinical and financial solutions and majority of their surgical hospitals in order to achieve Meaningful Use. This footprint is notable because it's significantly increases our presence in the surgical hospital and ASP markets. 
Looking at general market place conditions, we continued to see robust demand and expected to continue for years to come. Our conviction that the market place is strong was reinforced in our recent health conference where we had over 10,000 total attendees, including a 15% increase in client attendance. We came away from the conference impressed with what our clients are accomplished which is evidenced by the great progress our clients have made with meaningful use achievement. It is clear that our clients recognize the importance of working closely with us going forward as they face the rising bar and new challenges in the year to come. From a macro view, we recognized that healthcare is likely to be targeted as part of the solution to the U.S. deficit but we believe the stimulus plan will remain intact and that other program such as value -based purchasing will drive ongoing IT adoption. While some level of cuts to our clients funding are likely, we expect any future clots to continue to be tied to quality and outcomes which will make IT adoption essential to remaining competitive. The linkage of reimbursement to quality and outcomes creates major financial motivation for IT adoption beyond Meaningful Use. As we have indicated, our client base could have approximately $3 billion of annual revenue at risk tied to value-based purchasing, Medicare 30-day readmissions rules and quality reporting requirements beginning in 2013. This ramps to an estimated $5 billion revenue at risk in 2017. These are significant levels of revenue and we are working closely with our clients to mitigate their risk. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong results in Q3 and I think we are very well-positioned for a strong finish to the year and ongoing success in years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, RevWorks and projects we are focused on that will further differentiate Cerner in the marketplace. I'll start with ITWorks. While we didn't gain any new ITWorks clients this quarter, we did have approximately $20 million worth of scope experience from bookings from existing ITWorks clients. This activity proves the benefit of the tighter alignment that is created with ITWorks and is evidence that there's still room to grow after the initial relationship is established. I've mentioned in the past how the success of our existing ITWorks clients is creating new demand as the word of our success gets out into the market. This was evident at the Cerner Health Conference where we had a separate track that provided prospective clients access to existing ITWorks clients. The prospects were able to hear firsthand about the acceleration of clinical adoption, increased associate satisfaction and rapid adoption of emerging technologies that has occurred at our current clients. Perhaps the most powerful statement about ITWorks at the conference has made by the CEO of an existing client who stated that becoming ITWorks client was the best decision he made in his 30-plus year career. We also have good activity associated with RevWorks at our healthcare conference. While RevWorks is ramping slower than ITWorks, we are building some strong examples with our initial clients that remain confident that the RevWorks business will be a big contributor to our growth in the coming years. We are building the foundation for success to rapid growth and adoption of our patient accounting solution while also building out broader revenue cycle capabilities. At a health conference, 2 existing RevWorks clients led a very well attended session where they shared their success and they've had, thus far increasing it revenue and reducing operating expenses. They highlighted the benefits of being strategically aligned with Cerner in an environment where revenue continues to be more closely tied to clinical information. 
Moving to the ambulatory market. I mentioned last quarter that we were gaining traction with RevWorks in the ambulatory setting. In Q3, we built on the success and we were selected by a large ambulatory client for full billing services for over 300 providers. 
Now I'll discuss some of the initiatives we are focusing on as we head into 2012. Our recent health conference served as the launch for several new services and capabilities that will continue to differentiate Cerner in the marketplace and create fuel for our growth. Our service skybus cloud services service we recent recently discussed with you that formally launched conference. Skybox a suite of on-demand infrastructure and software services that are deployed, hosted and managed by Cerner. These services currently include storage, messaging, backup and virtual desktop. Although of interested in these services extremely high healthcare conference and our pipeline is strong, we will continue to expand these services as we move into the next year. As Jeff will discuss, our investment in cloud capabilities also enables our healthy Healthe Intent platform includes Healthe Intent some charge and agents. Our conference also serve as a launch for key initiatives aimed at building on solution workforce enhancements which we have made over the past several years. We've already had significant success in the market place with capabilities such as our MPages web-based development kit that allows for the creation of rural, venue specific in information for our clients. At our healthcare conference, we lost project go, which will build on the success of MPages and also leverage the significant advancements in mobile technologies. Our solutions have always been device-agnostic. And clients currently have great flexibility with the way they can access our system. But the next step for us to optimize mobile devices as they are now to the point where we can accommodate a majority of the clinician workflow. Therefore, as part of project go, we are increasing our focus on developing applications for Apple and Android devices with the simple mantra of making these apps smart, fast and easy. I'm very excited about where we're going with this and I think it's really going to be a game changer. We already have the most robust suite of solutions with the deepest functionality in the industry by driving the clinician experience to the next level, I think we can significantly increase our competitive advantage. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As our client base continues to aggressively March allow the Meaningful Use journey, we are beginning to see a second wave of",1109,"Thanks, Mike. Zane and Mike have mentioned, CHC was a great chance for us to get a pulse of our clients momentum to the industry. As our client base continues to aggressively March allow the Meaningful Use journey, we are beginning to see a second wave of opportunities emerge. As we mentioned in prior calls, there is a historical pattern of second quarter FX industries digitized we think that we're other front edge of that cycle within healthcare. One thing that is very clear set our clients are facing an unprecedented amount of challenges and change. With the activity around Meaningful Use, the healthcare reform and the continuous policy tinkering to address the budget deficit, the pressures on our clients are substantial. For the most part, their only lever is information. There was as a result we are at a window that is so busy getting into the next milestone or dealing with the next activation date of a policy, there's little time for a provider clients or the industry to imagine a future state, let alone prepare for it. As both Zane and Mike I've mentioned, the new pace of change is helping fuel several of our works offering, and creating opportunities for new ones which I will discuss shortly. A year ago, at CHC we first launch the series of offerings around our Healthe Intent platform. This was the beginning of a journey to create a metadata layer, agnostic to source EMR to better position our clients for future proofing around the increasing use of quality standards, performance measures and eventually managing health populations. Our charts search efforts were an important building block to our future roadmap with about 80 clients engaged today, capturing greater than 30 million documents and 500 million results at a typical client, we are quickly building foundation of data for the Healthe Intent platform. As the platform has grown over the last year, we are now beginning to deploy sophisticated machinery and algorithms to support both mapping of clinical concepts, as well as creating an environment to advance clinical decision support algorithms such as sepsis. As an example of the new landscape of opportunities, last quarter, we launched Cerner mast accelerate our ability to discover and develop clinical agents using the high bread of published evidence and our health back research platform. Our healthcare has paid for and what is paid for is becoming more and more dynamic, challenging our provided by organizations to more rapidly bring the clinical and financial environments together. As an example, the more recent ACO guidelines have improved several of the requirements and will likely cause several of our fine organizations to once again strongly consider starting this journey. One core element of the regulation is quality measures with the anticipation of more and more measurements and clinical context being mapped to payment. We use the term future proofing internally as a design element for our solutions to adapt to new requirements virally without requiring an implementation projects or major upgrades to achieve compliance. The Healthe Intent platform is playing a strategic role in making this possible, allowing for deployment to occur at a nationwide scale. 
The next natural progression beyond measurement is management. their client adapt to an increasing rate of change, they will evolve more and more towards the learning organization model. We see this progressing towards the management system for healthcare. Not only managing the health of population, but managing the performance and innovation of care delivery in unison. Similar to the lifecycle on manufacturing digitized, creating enterprise resource planning platforms, we are seeing early stages of this evolves as more and more of the EMR becomes digitized, providing greater insights and correlations to the delivery environment. A key element of driving to a future state is aligning with our clients. Historically, measures of success with clients were tied to a project or implementation but as the industry morphs from a focus on meaningful use, process-based measures to a focus on outcomes, measurement and value, Cerner's success will be tied to that of our clients and vice versa. It was clear to us that our healthcare conference that our clients see the importance of becoming more aligned so we can face the current industry challenges together. The results were very clear that they're looking so as not only to be accountable for helping them meet current challenges, but also to keep pushing for an improved future state. 
Managing costs, resources and outcomes will drive a growing portfolio of new solution opportunities, all of which demand a different type of distribution and activation method. I want to highlight 2 activities within the quarter to build upon this evolving landscape. A recent acquisition of Clairvia sits well with the topic of my comments today. For those of you who aren't familiar with them, Clairvia provides workforce and patient management solutions to more than 400 organizations. Their predictive models, our EMR gnostic and enabled healthcare organizations Online that actual patient needs in real-time, thereby cutting costs and improving patient outcomes. With this acquisition, we are solidifying our commitment to the workforce management marketplace and interoperability to cloud -based solution such as Healthe Intent and CareAware, which focus on providing positive clinical operational and financial returns for our clients. By adding this rich data sets to the clinical context, the ability to provide more sophisticated algorithms and timely utilization of scarce resources, we should be in a position to improve the management a labor and skills across the continuum of care. The second would be 1 of our newer works Camassia mentioned earlier. Last quarter we signed our first quality works client. Bundling together our Lighthouse and decision support offerings into service-oriented model. Very similar to the approach of our other offerings in the workspace. We are now highly aligned with the clinical operational and financial performance of the clients organization. This provides clients the ability to gain access to both Cerner scale and skilled to adapt to the changing environment and requirements both at the local and national level. This is one of our earlier examples of creating new styles of alignment with our clients and SE&O seen with our other works offering, we anticipate that the increasing industry demand will make this an attractive offering for our clients as they navigate the uncertainty ahead. 
To summarize, we are seeing innovation opportunities to accelerate in the current environment to take more and more advantage of a digitizing platform as the urgency to extract the benefits of having more information is becoming more and more acute. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

So you hear a lot about CPOE and we've talked about that in the call for probably the last 2 years. As you move forward and everything is digitized, you now have conversations around diabetes or congestive heart failure, so conditions being able to take and utilize all of the data in the system about that patient and apply a completely different level of decision support to coordinate care both across venues, as well as implement evidence faster. So that second-order effect is you're seeing now in Washington a policy change that says, here is I won't to pay for or, as Zane mentioned, readmissions that occurred within 30 days, eventually may become your cost. So that's driving a whole new series of need to say how do manage that patient once they leave the facility and make sure they don't come back, which is a hold of a series of solutions that sit on top."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I will lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, Executive Vice President of our client organization, will follow me with sales highlights and marketplace trends. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations. Mike will be followed by Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, who will discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, is traveling today but should be able to join for Q&A.
Now I will turn to our results. All key measures in Q3 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Our income statement performance was excellent with revenue and adjusted EPS above expected levels and continued margin expansion and strong earnings growth, and we had very strong cash flow performance. 
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q3 was $650 million, which is the second best result in company history, second only to Q4 of '09. Bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $50 million, and we're up 31% from Q3 of '10. Bookings margin in Q3 was $534 million or 82% of total bookings. As Zane will discuss, the strength of bookings spanned across all business models. Our bookings performance drove a 21% increase in total backlog to $5.66 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.96 billion is 24% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $691 million, up 8% year-over-year. 
Revenue in the quarter was $571.6 million, which is up 24% over Q3 of '10 and about $30 million over our guidance. The revenue composition for Q3 was $189 million in system sales, $139 million in support and maintenance, $233 million in services and $11 million in reimbursed travel. The upside relative to our guidance was largely driven by higher system sales, as well as very strong services revenue. 
The system sales revenue reflects 41% growth from Q3 of '10, and included greater than 20% growth in licensed software and subscriptions and over 50% growth in technology resale. The technology resale growth included record levels of device resale, reflective of rapidly increased traction in the resale of CareFusion and other devices. Even with strong software growth, the even stronger growth in technology resale led to lower system sales margins of 55%. However, when you look at the growth in system sales margin dollars, it mimics the growth in revenue at a very strong 37%. 
Services revenue was up 22% compared to Q3 of '10 with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue increased 6% over Q3 of '10. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 27% year-over-year to $499 million. Global revenue was $72 million and grew 5% compared to a year-ago period. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 78.9%, which is down compared to 82.9% of a year ago and 81.2% in Q2. The decline in gross margin was driven by the record levels of technology resale that I discussed, as well as an increase in third-party services. While significant upside in technology resale and higher third-party costs led to gross margins slightly below our target of 80% range, we still drove very strong gross margin dollars with growth of 18%. We also drove solid operating margin expansion despite the lower gross margin. 
Looking at operating spending. Our third quarter operating expenses were $323.3 million before share-based compensation expense of $7.5 million. Total operating expense was up 14% compared to Q3 '10, with the majority of the growth driven by an increase in revenue-generating associates in our services businesses. Sales and client service expenses increased 16% compared to Q3 of '10, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. 
Our investment in software development increased 8% compared to Q3 of '10. We expect to continue growing our R&D investments in coming years to accelerate innovation in areas Mike and Jeff will discuss. We expect to be able to do this with R&D still growing slower than revenue, so we maintain the leverage we have achieved from our R&D investments. G&A expense increased 16% year-over-year, driven by personnel and other expenses related to increased hiring and training. 
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q3 was 22.4% before share-based compensation expense and was up 70 basis points compared to Q3 of '10. We still expect operating margin expansion in Q4 and for the full year to fall within the 100 to 200 basis point range we targeted at the beginning of the year. 
Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $78.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.6 million or $0.03 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $83.5 million and adjusted EPS was $0.48, which is up 26% compared to Q3 of '10. 
The tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 36.1%. This is about 1% higher than we projected due to a lower mix of non-U.S. earnings. The higher tax rate reduced EPS by $0.01. We expect our tax rate to remain at approximately 36% for Q4. 
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $1.09 billion of cash and investments, up from $1.01 billion in Q2. Total cash and investments include $755 million of cash and short-term investments and $335 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities over 1 year. Our total debt is $134 million. 
Total receivables ended the quarter at $548 million, which is up $44 million from Q2. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables, were $103 million and represent 19% of total receivables compared to 31% in Q2. The favorable shift to a lower mix of contracts receivable is driven by a combination of increased billings that brought down contracts receivable and strong sales in the quarter that drove up accounts receivable. Cash collections were a record $533 million. Our DSO in Q3 was 87 days, which is down 1 day compared to Q2 and down 4 days compared to Q3 of '10. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $129.2 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $23.9 million, and capitalized software was $20.8 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $84.5 million. We expect capital expenditures to increase in Q4, but we still expect to generate strong free cash flow. 
Looking at next year, we do expect an increase in capital expenditures compared to the low $100 million range we have been at for the last 2 years. Some of this will be driven by the construction of additional space at our Kansas City, Kansas campus that is needed for our growing associate base. We do not expect this to have a material impact on our free cash flow as the construction will span multiple years, and we will also be receiving incentives that will offset a portion of the construction costs. 
Moving to capitalized software. The $20.8 million of capitalized software in Q3 represents 29% of the $72.4 million of total spending on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $20.9 million or $0.1 million more than what we capitalized. 
Now let me go through the guidance. For Q4 revenue, we expect revenue between $575 million and $595 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 17% over Q4 of '10. This equates to a full year revenue between $2.16 billion and $2.18 billion, up from our previous range of $2.09 billion to $2.12 billion, and represents full year growth of 17%. We expect Q4 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.51 to $0.53 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 18% growth. This equates to full year adjusted EPS between $1.83 and $1.85, which is up from our previous range of $1.80 to $1.83 and reflects 24% growth. Q4 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $325 million to $330 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense in Q4 is $0.03. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $630 million to $670 million. This reflects modest growth over our strong Q4 '10 results, but would lead to full year bookings of about $2.5 billion, which is 24% growth over 2010. 
I would also like to provide our initial thoughts on 2012. The initial version of our 2012 plan supports the current 2012 consensus estimates for revenue and earnings per share. As always, we will continue to update our outlook on future earnings calls. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'm going to provide highlights of our sales results and cover marketplace trends. Starting with our results. We had another record quarter of bookings driven by robust demand in our client base and strong competitiveness in new footprint opportunities. Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $650 million represents 31% growth over last year and is all-time high for a third quarter. The strength in bookings this quarter was very broad with all business models contributing at least 24% growth. We also had an all-time high level of large contracts, with 25 contracts over $5 million and 16 over $10 million. 
The strength in our bookings is more impressive when you consider that we had a lower than normal level of contribution from long-term contracts, with no ITWorks or RevWorks clients this quarter. As Mike will discuss, our outlook for these businesses remains strong. We just didn't have any deals this quarter. 
One driver of the strength in our bookings and revenue this quarter was record results from our DeviceWorks organization. This quarter's strength included record levels of RxStation sales along with strong levels of reselling CareFusion Pyxis medication dispensing devices. In addition, we had strong iBus device connectivity sales and strong resale of devices such as infusion pumps, beds and monitoring devices. We also had 3 clients purchase Smart Rooms for the entire units of their hospital, which contributed to sale of multiple solutions and devices. Overall, we are seeing strong traction in this business as clients recognize the value of connected devices, and device manufacturers recognize the value of our device connectivity platform and the strategic relationships we have with our clients. 
Q3 was also a record quarter for our physician solutions and included the 2 largest PowerWorks contracts in our history. With our record Q3 results, our year-to-date bookings for physician solutions now exceed our full year plan. We are clearly gaining traction and market share with the usability enhancements we have made and our ability to offer robust physician solutions that are fully integrated across inpatient and outpatient environments. 
As Mike will discuss, we are continuing to raise the bar on our physician solutions by further enhancing our usability and our mobile capabilities, which will widen Cerner's differentiation in the marketplace. A major validation of the strength of our physician solution also include -- occurred in Q3 when a major IDN chose to replace their existing outpatient solution with Cerner Solutions, displacing our primary competitor in the process. They are also adding our revenue cycle solutions for both inpatient and outpatient, which validates the improvements we have made in that space as well. 
Moving on to our global results. As Marc mentioned, our global revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q3 after being down in the first half of the year. We continue to see gradual improvements in most global markets and have some noteworthy areas of strength such as Canada, Australia and the Middle East. 
In England, there has been a lot of coverage of proposed changes to the National Program. In the near term, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on Cerner as we expect our existing contracts to be honored. In the intermediate term, we believe the changes are positive as they create more opportunities for us to sell directly to trust in all regions. We are very well positioned to do this and have already seen an increase in RFP activity. 
Another indication of strong global activity was the attendance by global clients at our Cerner Health Conference. Global attendance was up 34% compared to last year and included attendees from 13 countries. 
Moving to the overall marketplace and our competitiveness. We gained market share again in Q3 with 29% of bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium installed base. We continue to see both greenfield opportunities and opportunities in several of our competitors' client bases. Their clients are concerned about our competitors' ability to keep up with Meaningful Use requirements, particularly when looking beyond Stage 1. 
In coming years, we believe this vulnerability of our competitors' installed base will increase with the requirements for Value-Based Purchasing, other stages of Meaningful Use, ACOs and data analytics capabilities. As a result, we believe we are in the early stages of a multiyear market share shift. And we believe we are extremely well positioned to be a major share gainer during this time due to depth and breadth of our solutions that are ready today to help clients meet industry demands. Further, our unmatched services and delivery capabilities provide an important differentiator compared to competitors that can't offer timely and predictable results. 
A recent example of our competitiveness is Ventura County Health Care Agency selecting Cerner for a broad suite of Millennium solutions for 2 hospitals and over 40 ambulatory clinics. This selection over our primary competitor was driven by the strength of our integrated inpatient and outpatient solution, our predicable services delivery model and our ability to demonstrate a total lower cost of ownership. 
We also established a new footprint with a large investor-owned company that owns or operates 200 ambulatory surgery centers and 14 surgical hospitals to implement a suite of clinical and financial solutions in majority of their surgical hospitals in order to achieve Meaningful Use. This footprint is notable because it significantly increases our presence in the surgical hospital and ASC markets. 
Looking at general market place conditions, we continue to see robust demand and expect it to continue for years to come. Our conviction that the marketplace is strong was reinforced at our recent health conference where we had over 10,000 total attendees, including a 15% increase in client attendance. We came away from the conference impressed with what our clients have accomplished, which is evidenced by the great progress our clients have made with Meaningful Use achievement. It is clear that our clients recognize the importance of working closely with us going forward as they face the rising bar and new challenges in the year to come. 
From a macro view, we recognize that healthcare is likely to be targeted as part of the solution to the U.S. deficit, but we believe the stimulus plan will remain intact, and that other program such as Value-Based Purchasing will drive ongoing IT adoption. While some levels of cuts to our clients' funding are likely, we expect any future cuts to continue to be tied to quality and outcomes, which will make IT adoption essential to remaining competitive. The linkage of reimbursement to quality and outcomes creates major financial motivation for IT adoption beyond Meaningful Use. As we have indicated, our client base could have approximately $3 billion of annual revenue at risk tied to Value-Based Purchasing, Medicare 30-day readmissions rules and quality reporting requirements beginning in 2013. This ramps to an estimated $5 billion of revenue at risk in 2017. These are significant levels of revenue, and we are working closely with our clients to mitigate their risk. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong results in Q3. And I think we are very well positioned for a strong finish to the year and ongoing success in years to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, RevWorks and projects we are focused on that will further differentiate Cerner in the marketplace. I'll start with ITWorks.

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, RevWorks and projects we are focused on that will further differentiate Cerner in the marketplace. I'll start with ITWorks. While we didn't gain any new ITWorks clients this quarter, we did have approximately $20 million worth of scope expansion bookings from existing ITWorks clients. This activity proves the benefit of the tighter alignment that is created with ITWorks and is evidence that there is still room to grow after the initial relationship is established. 
I've mentioned in the past how the success of our existing ITWorks clients is creating new demand as the word of our success gets out into the market. This was evident at the Cerner Health Conference where we had a separate track that provided prospective clients access to existing ITWorks clients. Prospects were able to hear firsthand about the acceleration of clinical adoption, increased associate satisfaction and rapid adoption of emerging technologies that has occurred at our current clients. Perhaps the most powerful statement about ITWorks at the conference was made by the CEO of an existing client who stated that becoming an ITWorks client was the best decision he made in his 30-plus year career. 
We also have a good -- we also had good activity associated with RevWorks at our healthcare conference. While RevWorks is ramping slower than ITWorks, we are building some strong examples with our initial clients and remain confident that the RevWorks business will be a big contributor to our growth in the coming years. We are building the foundation for success to rapid growth in adoption of our patient accounting solution while also building out broader revenue cycle capabilities. 
At our health conference, 2 existing RevWorks clients led a very well-attended session where they shared the success they've had thus far increasing net revenue and reducing operating expenses. They also highlighted the benefits of being strategically aligned with Cerner in an environment where revenue continues to be more closely tied to clinical information. 
Moving to the ambulatory market. I mentioned last quarter that we were gaining traction with RevWorks in the ambulatory setting. In Q3, we built on this success, and we were selected by a large ambulatory client for full billing services for over 300 providers. 
Now I'll discuss some of the initiatives we are focusing on as we head into 2012. Our recent health conference served as a launch for several new services and capabilities that will continue to differentiate Cerner in the marketplace and create fuel for our growth. 
Our Cerner Skybox cloud services is a service which we have previously discussed with you that formally launched at our conference. Skybox a suite of on-demand infrastructure and software services that are deployed, hosted and managed by Cerner. These services currently include storage, messaging, back-up and virtual desktop. The level of interest in these services was extremely high at the healthcare conference and our pipeline is strong. We will continue to expand these services as we move into the next year. 
As Jeff will discuss, our investment in cloud capabilities also enables our Healthe Intent platform, which today includes Healthe Intent Chart Search and Sepsis Agent. Our conference also served as a launch for key initiatives aimed at building on solution workflow enhancements, which we have made over the past several years. We've already had significant success in the marketplace with capabilities such as our mPages web-based development kit that allows for the creation of Role-venue cockpits of information for our clients. At our healthcare conference, we launched Project Go, which will build on the success of mPages and also leverage the significant advancements in mobile technologies. Our solutions have always been device-agnostic. And clients currently have great flexibility with the way they can access our system. But the next step for us is to optimize mobile devices as they are now to the point where we can accommodate a majority of the clinician workflow. Therefore, as part of Project Go, we are increasing our focus on developing applications for Apple and Android devices with a simple mantra of making these apps smart, fast and easy. 
I'm very excited about where we're going with this, and I think it's really going to be a game changer. We have already -- we already have the most robust suite of solutions with the deepest functionality in the industry. By driving the clinician experience to the next level, I think we can significantly increase our competitive advantage. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As Zane and Mike have mentioned, CHC was a great chance for us to get a pulse of our clients and the momentum of the industry. As our client base continues to aggressively march along the Meaningful Use journey, we are beginning to see a sec",1125,"Thanks, Mike. As Zane and Mike have mentioned, CHC was a great chance for us to get a pulse of our clients and the momentum of the industry. As our client base continues to aggressively march along the Meaningful Use journey, we are beginning to see a second wave of opportunities emerge. As we've mentioned in prior calls, there is a historical pattern of second order effects that emerge when an industry is digitized. We think that we are on the front edge of that cycle within healthcare. 
One thing that is very clear is that our clients are facing an unprecedented amount of challenges and change. With the activity around Meaningful Use, healthcare reform and the continuous policy tinkering to address the budget deficit, the pressures on our clients are substantial. For the most part, their only lever is information. As a result, we are in a window that is so busy getting to the next milestone or dealing with the next activation date of a policy. There is little time for our provider clients or the industry to imagine a future state, let alone prepare for it. As both Zane and Mike have mentioned, the new pace of change is helping fuel several of our works offerings and creating opportunities for new ones, which I will discuss shortly. 
A year ago, at CHC, we first launched the series of offerings around our Healthe Intent platform. This was the beginning of a journey to create a meta data layer, agnostic to source EMR to better position our clients for future proofing around the increasing use of quality standards, performance measures and eventually managing health of populations. 
Our Chart Search efforts are an important building block to our future roadmap. With about 80 clients engaged today, capturing greater than 30 million documents and 500 million results at a typical client, we are quickly building foundational data for the Healthe Intent platform. As the platform has grown over the last year, we are now beginning to deploy sophisticated machine learning algorithms to support both mapping of clinical concepts, as well as creating an environment to advance clinical decision support algorithms such as sepsis. As an example of the new landscape of opportunities, last quarter, we launched Cerner Math to accelerate our ability to discover and develop clinical agents using a hybrid of published evidence and our Health Facts research platform. 
How healthcare is paid for and what is paid for is becoming more and more dynamic, challenging our provider client organizations to more rapidly blend the clinical and financial environments together. As an example, the more recent ACO guidelines have improved several of the requirements and will likely cause several of our client organizations to once again strongly consider starting this journey. One core element of the regulations is quality measures, with the anticipation of more and more measurements and clinical context being mapped to payment. We use the term future proofing internally as a design element for our solutions to adapt to new requirements virally without requiring implementation projects or major upgrades to achieve compliance. The Healthe Intent platform is playing a strategic role in making this possible, allowing for deployment to occur at a nationwide scale. 
The next natural progression beyond measurement is management. As our clients adapt to an increasing rate of change, they will evolve more and more towards the learning organization model. We see this progressing towards a management system for healthcare. Not only managing the health of populations but managing the performance and innovation of care delivery in unison. Similar to the life cycle when manufacturing digitized, creating enterprise resource planning platforms, we are seeing early stages of this evolve as more and more of the EMR becomes digitized, providing greater insights and correlations to the delivery environment. 
A key element of driving to a future state is aligning with our clients. Historically, measures of success with clients were tied to a project or implementation. But as the industry morphs from a focus on Meaningful Use process-based measures to a focus on outcomes, measurement and value, Cerner's success will be tied to that of our clients and vice versa. It was clear to us at our healthcare conference that our clients see the importance of becoming more aligned, so we can face the current industry challenges together. It was also very clear that they're looking to us to not only be accountable for helping them meet current challenges but also to keep pushing for an improved future state. Managing costs, resources and outcomes will drive a growing portfolio of new solution opportunities, all of which demand a different type of distribution and activation method. 
I want to highlight 2 activities within the quarter that build upon this evolving landscape. Our recent acquisition of Clairvia fits well with the topic of my comments today. For those of you who aren't familiar with them, Clairvia provides workforce and patient management solutions to more than 400 organizations. Their predictive models are EMR agnostic and enable healthcare organizations to align resources with actual patient needs in real time, thereby cutting costs and improving patient outcomes. 
With this acquisition, we are solidifying our commitment to the workforce management marketplace and interoperable cloud-based solutions such as Healthe Intent and CareAware, which focus on providing positive clinical, operational and financial returns for our clients. By adding this rich data set to the clinical context, the ability to provide more sophisticated algorithms and timely utilization of scarce resources, we should be in a position to improve the management of labor and skills across the continuum of care. 
The second would be one of our newer works as I mentioned earlier. Last quarter, we signed our first QualityWorks client. Bundling together our Lighthouse and decision support offerings into a service-oriented model very similar to the approach of our other offerings in the Works space, we are now highly aligned with the clinical, operational and financial performance of the clients' organization. This provides clients the ability to gain access to both Cerner's scale and skill to adapt to the changing environment and requirements both at the local and national level. This is one of our earlier examples of creating a new style of alignment with our clients. And as we have seen with our other works offerings, we anticipate that the increasing industry demands will make this an attractive offering for our clients as they navigate the uncertainty ahead. 
To summarize, we are seeing innovation opportunities accelerate in the current environment to take more and more advantage of a digitizing platform as the urgency to extract the benefits of having more information is becoming more and more acute. 
With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

And [indiscernible] so relative to hitting the gross margin line, some of that upside of revenue won't hit the gross margin line as far because it will be some of that technology. And from an earnings perspective, keep in mind that the 36% tax rate compared to our 35% that we talked to you about previously, we had in Q3 and we expect in Q4, that costs us about another $0.01 of EPS every quarter that we have a 36% tax rate.

Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations. Mike will be followed by Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, who will discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, is traveling today but should be able to join for Q&A.
Now I will turn to our results. All key measures in Q3 were at or above our expected levels. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Our income statement performance was excellent with revenue and adjusted EPS above expected levels and continued margin expansion and strong earnings growth, and we had very strong cash flow performance. 
Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q3 was $650 million, which is the second best result in company history, second only to Q4 of '09. Bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $50 million, and we're up 31% from Q3 of '10. Bookings margin in Q3 was $534 million or 82% of total bookings. As Zane will discuss, the strength of bookings spanned across all business models. Our bookings performance drove a 21% increase in total backlog to $5.66 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $4.96 billion is 24% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $691 million, up 8% year-over-year. 
Revenue in the quarter was $571.6 million, which is up 24% over Q3 of '10 and about $30 million over our guidance. The revenue composition for Q3 was $189 million in system sales, $139 million in support and maintenance, $233 million in services and $11 million in reimbursed travel. The upside relative to our guidance was largely driven by higher system sales, as well as very strong services revenue. 
The system sales revenue reflects 41% growth from Q3 of '10, and included greater than 20% growth in licensed software and subscriptions and over 50% growth in technology resale. The technology resale growth included record levels of device resale, reflective of rapidly increased traction in the resale of CareFusion and other devices. Even with strong software growth, the even stronger growth in technology resale led to lower system sales margins of 55%. However, when you look at the growth in system sales margin dollars, it mimics the growth in revenue at a very strong 37%. 
Services revenue was up 22% compared to Q3 of '10 with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue increased 6% over Q3 of '10. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 27% year-over-year to $499 million. Global revenue was $72 million and grew 5% compared to a year-ago period. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 78.9%, which is down compared to 82.9% of a year ago and 81.2% in Q2. The decline in gross margin was driven by the record levels of technology resale that I discussed, as well as an increase in third-party services. While significant upside in technology resale and higher third-party costs led to gross margins slightly below our target of 80% range, we still drove very strong gross margin dollars with growth of 18%. We also drove solid operating margin expansion despite the lower gross margin. 
Looking at operating spending. Our third quarter operating expenses were $323.3 million before share-based compensation expense of $7.5 million. Total operating expense was up 14% compared to Q3 '10, with the majority of the growth driven by an increase in revenue-generating associates in our services businesses. Sales and client service expenses increased 16% compared to Q3 of '10, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. 
Our investment in software development increased 8% compared to Q3 of '10. We expect to continue growing our R&D investments in coming years to accelerate innovation in areas Mike and Jeff will discuss. We expect to be able to do this with R&D still growing slower than revenue, so we maintain the leverage we have achieved from our R&D investments. G&A expense increased 16% year-over-year, driven by personnel and other expenses related to increased hiring and training. 
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q3 was 22.4% before share-based compensation expense and was up 70 basis points compared to Q3 of '10. We still expect operating margin expansion in Q4 and for the full year to fall within the 100 to 200 basis point range we targeted at the beginning of the year. 
Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $78.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $4.6 million or $0.03 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $83.5 million and adjusted EPS was $0.48, which is up 26% compared to Q3 of '10. 
The tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 36.1%. This is about 1% higher than we projected due to a lower mix of non-U.S. earnings. The higher tax rate reduced EPS by $0.01. We expect our tax rate to remain at approximately 36% for Q4. 
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $1.09 billion of cash and investments, up from $1.01 billion in Q2. Total cash and investments include $755 million of cash and short-term investments and $335 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities over 1 year. Our total debt is $134 million. 
Total receivables ended the quarter at $548 million, which is up $44 million from Q2. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables, were $103 million and represent 19% of total receivables compared to 31% in Q2. The favorable shift to a lower mix of contracts receivable is driven by a combination of increased billings that brought down contracts receivable and strong sales in the quarter that drove up accounts receivable. Cash collections were a record $533 million. Our DSO in Q3 was 87 days, which is down 1 day compared to Q2 and down 4 days compared to Q3 of '10. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $129.2 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $23.9 million, and capitalized software was $20.8 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $84.5 million. We expect capital expenditures to increase in Q4, but we still expect to generate strong free cash flow. 
Looking at next year, we do expect an increase in capital expenditures compared to the low $100 million range we have been at for the last 2 years. Some of this will be driven by the construction of additional space at our Kansas City, Kansas campus that is needed for our growing associate base. We do not expect this to have a material impact on our free cash flow as the construction will span multiple years, and we will also be receiving incentives that will offset a portion of the construction costs. 
Moving to capitalized software. The $20.8 million of capitalized software in Q3 represents 29% of the $72.4 million of total spending on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $20.9 million or $0.1 million more than what we capitalized. 
Now let me go through the guidance. For Q4 revenue, we expect revenue between $575 million and $595 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 17% over Q4 of '10. This equates to a full year revenue between $2.16 billion and $2.18 billion, up from our previous range of $2.09 billion to $2.12 billion, and represents full year growth of 17%. We expect Q4 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.51 to $0.53 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 18% growth. This equates to full year adjusted EPS between $1.83 and $1.85, which is up from our previous range of $1.80 to $1.83 and reflects 24% growth. Q4 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $325 million to $330 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense in Q4 is $0.03. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $630 million to $670 million. This reflects modest growth over our strong Q4 '10 results, but would lead to full year bookings of about $2.5 billion, which is 24% growth over 2010. 
I would also like to provide our initial thoughts on 2012. The initial version of our 2012 plan supports the current 2012 consensus estimates for revenue and earnings per share. As always, we will continue to update our outlook on future earnings calls. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'm going to provide highlights of our sales results and cover marketplace trends. Starting with our results. We had another record quarter of bookings driven by robust demand in our client base and strong competitiveness in new footprint opportunities. Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $650 million represents 31% growth over last year and is all-time high for a third quarter. The strength in bookings this quarter was very broad with all business models contributing at least 24% growth. We also had an all-time high level of large contracts, with 25 contracts over $5 million and 16 over $10 million. 
The strength in our bookings is more impressive when you consider that we had a lower than normal level of contribution from long-term contracts, with no ITWorks or RevWorks clients this quarter. As Mike will discuss, our outlook for these businesses remains strong. We just didn't have any deals this quarter. 
One driver of the strength in our bookings and revenue this quarter was record results from our DeviceWorks organization. This quarter's strength included record levels of RxStation sales along with strong levels of reselling CareFusion Pyxis medication dispensing devices. In addition, we had strong iBus device connectivity sales and strong resale of devices such as infusion pumps, beds and monitoring devices. We also had 3 clients purchase Smart Rooms for the entire units of their hospital, which contributed to sale of multiple solutions and devices. Overall, we are seeing strong traction in this business as clients recognize the value of connected devices, and device manufacturers recognize the value of our device connectivity platform and the strategic relationships we have with our clients. 
Q3 was also a record quarter for our physician solutions and included the 2 largest PowerWorks contracts in our history. With our record Q3 results, our year-to-date bookings for physician solutions now exceed our full year plan. We are clearly gaining traction and market share with the usability enhancements we have made and our ability to offer robust physician solutions that are fully integrated across inpatient and outpatient environments. 
As Mike will discuss, we are continuing to raise the bar on our physician solutions by further enhancing our usability and our mobile capabilities, which will widen Cerner's differentiation in the marketplace. A major validation of the strength of our physician solution also include -- occurred in Q3 when a major IDN chose to replace their existing outpatient solution with Cerner Solutions, displacing our primary competitor in the process. They are also adding [ph] our revenue cycle solutions for both inpatient and outpatient, which validates the improvements we have made in that space as well. 
Moving on to our global results. As Marc mentioned, our global revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q3 after being down in the first half of the year. We continue to see gradual improvements in most global markets and have some noteworthy areas of strength such as Canada, Australia and the Middle East. 
In England, there has been a lot of coverage of proposed changes to the National Program. In the near term, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on Cerner as we expect our existing contracts to be honored. In the intermediate term, we believe the changes are a positive as they create more opportunities for us to sell directly to trust [ph] in all regions. We are very well positioned to do this and have already seen an increase in RFP activity. 
Another indication of strong global activity was the attendance by global clients at our Cerner Health Conference. Global attendance was up 34% compared to last year and included attendees from 13 countries. 
Moving to the overall marketplace and our competitiveness. We gained market share again in Q3 with 29% of bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium installed base. We continue to see both greenfield opportunities and opportunities in several of our competitors' client bases. Their clients are concerned about our competitors' ability to keep up with Meaningful Use requirements, particularly when looking beyond Stage 1. 
In coming years, we believe this vulnerability of our competitors' installed base will increase with the requirements for Value-Based Purchasing, other stages of Meaningful Use, ACOs and data analytics capabilities. As a result, we believe we are in the early stages of a multiyear market share shift. And we believe we are extremely well positioned to be a major share gainer during this time due to depth and breadth of our solutions that are ready today to help clients meet industry demands. Further, our unmatched services and delivery capabilities provide an important differentiator compared to competitors that can't offer timely and predictable results. 
A recent example of our competitiveness is Ventura County Health Care Agency selecting Cerner for a broad suite of Millennium solutions for 2 hospitals and over 40 ambulatory clinics. This selection over our primary competitor was driven by the strength of our integrated inpatient and outpatient solution, our predicable services delivery model and our ability to demonstrate a total lower cost of ownership. 
We also established a new footprint with a large investor-owned company that owns or operates 200 ambulatory surgery centers and 14 surgical hospitals to implement a suite of clinical and financial solutions in majority of their surgical hospitals in order to achieve Meaningful Use. This footprint is notable because it significantly increases our presence in the surgical hospital and ASC markets. 
Looking at general market place conditions, we continue to see robust demand and expect it to continue for years to come. Our conviction that the marketplace is strong was reinforced at our recent health conference where we had over 10,000 total attendees, including a 15% increase in client attendance. We came away from the conference impressed with what our clients have accomplished, which is evidenced by the great progress our clients have made with Meaningful Use achievement. It is clear that our clients recognize the importance of working closely with us going forward as they face a rising bar and new challenges in the year to come. 
From a macro view, we recognize that healthcare is likely to be targeted as part of the solution to the U.S. deficit, but we believe the stimulus plan will remain intact, and that other programs such as Value-Based Purchasing will drive ongoing IT adoption. While some levels of cuts to our clients' funding are likely, we expect any future cuts to continue to be tied to quality and outcomes, which will make IT adoption essential to remaining competitive. The linkage of reimbursement to quality and outcomes creates major financial motivation for IT adoption beyond Meaningful Use. As we have indicated, our client base could have approximately $3 billion of annual revenue at risk tied to Value-Based Purchasing, Medicare 30-day readmissions rules and quality reporting requirements beginning in 2013. This ramps to an estimated $5 billion of revenue at risk in 2017. These are significant levels of revenue, and we are working closely with our clients to mitigate their risk. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong results in Q3. And I think we are very well positioned for a strong finish to the year and ongoing success in years to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."
259627,141453310,179865,"Cerner Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, RevWorks and projects we are focused on that will further differentiate Cerner in the marketplace. I'll start with ITWorks.

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, RevWorks and projects we are focused on that will further differentiate Cerner in the marketplace. I'll start with ITWorks. While we didn't gain any new ITWorks clients this quarter, we did have approximately $20 million worth of scope expansion bookings from existing ITWorks clients. This activity proves the benefit of the tighter alignment that is created with ITWorks and is evidence that there is still room to grow after the initial relationship is established. 
I've mentioned in the past how the success of our existing ITWorks clients is creating new demand as the word of our success gets out into the market. This was evident at the Cerner Health Conference where we had a separate track that provided prospective clients access to existing ITWorks clients. Prospects were able to hear firsthand about the acceleration of clinical adoption, increased associate satisfaction and rapid adoption of emerging technologies that has occurred at our current clients. Perhaps the most powerful statement about ITWorks at the conference was made by the CEO of an existing client who stated that becoming an ITWorks client was the best decision he made in his 30-plus year career. 
We also have good activity associated with RevWorks at our healthcare conference. While RevWorks is ramping slower than ITWorks, we are building some strong examples with our initial clients and remain confident that the RevWorks business will be a big contributor to our growth in the coming years. We are building the foundation for success to rapid growth in adoption of our patient accounting solution while also building out broader revenue cycle capabilities. 
At our health conference, 2 existing RevWorks clients led a very well-attended session where they shared the success they've had thus far increasing net revenue and reducing operating expenses. They also highlighted the benefits of being strategically aligned with Cerner in an environment where revenue continues to be more closely tied to clinical information. 
Moving to the ambulatory market. I mentioned last quarter that we were gaining traction with RevWorks in the ambulatory setting. In Q3, we built on this success, and we were selected by a large ambulatory client for full billing services for over 300 providers. 
Now I'll discuss some of the initiatives we are focusing on as we head into 2012. Our recent health conference served as a launch for several new services and capabilities that will continue to differentiate Cerner in the marketplace and create fuel for our growth. 
Our Cerner Skybox cloud services is a service which we have previously discussed with you that formally launched at our conference. Skybox a suite of on-demand infrastructure and software services that are deployed, hosted and managed by Cerner. These services currently include storage, messaging, back-up and virtual desktop. The level of interest in these services was extremely high at the healthcare conference and our pipeline is strong. We will continue to expand these services as we move into the next year. 
As Jeff will discuss, our investment in cloud capabilities also enables our Healthe Intent platform, which today includes Healthe Intent Chart Search and Sepsis Agent. Our conference also served as a launch for key initiatives aimed at building on solution workflow enhancements, which we have made over the past several years. We've already had significant success in the marketplace with capabilities such as our MPages web-based development kit that allows for the creation of Role-venue cockpits of information for our clients. At our healthcare conference, we launched Project Go, which will build on the success of MPages and also leverage the significant advancements in mobile technologies. Our solutions have always been device-agnostic. And clients currently have great flexibility with the way they can access our system. But the next step for us is to optimize mobile devices as they are now to the point where we can accommodate a majority of the clinician workflow. Therefore, as part of Project Go, we are increasing our focus on developing applications for Apple and Android devices with a simple mantra of making these apps smart, fast and easy. 
I'm very excited about where we're going with this, and I think it's really going to be a game changer. We have already -- we already have the most robust suite of solutions with the deepest functionality in the industry. By driving the clinician experience to the next level, I think we can significantly increase our competitive advantage. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As Zane and Mike have mentioned, CHC was a great chance for us to get a pulse of our clients and the momentum of the industry. As our client base continues to aggressively march along the Meaningful Use journey, we are beginning to see a sec",1126,"Thanks, Mike. As Zane and Mike have mentioned, CHC was a great chance for us to get a pulse of our clients and the momentum of the industry. As our client base continues to aggressively march along the Meaningful Use journey, we are beginning to see a second wave of opportunities emerge. As we've mentioned in prior calls, there is a historical pattern of second order effects that emerge when an industry is digitized. We think that we are on the front edge of that cycle within healthcare. 
One thing that is very clear is that our clients are facing an unprecedented amount of challenges and change. With the activity around Meaningful Use, healthcare reform and the continuous policy tinkering to address the budget deficit, the pressures on our clients are substantial. For the most part, their only lever is information. As a result, we are in a window that is so busy getting to the next milestone or dealing with the next activation date of a policy. There is little time for our provider clients or the industry to imagine a future state, let alone prepare for it. As both Zane and Mike have mentioned, the new pace of change is helping fuel several of our works offerings and creating opportunities for new ones, which I will discuss shortly. 
A year ago, at CHC, we first launched the series of offerings around our Healthe Intent platform. This was the beginning of a journey to create a meta data layer, agnostic to the source EMR to better position our clients for future proofing around the increasing use of quality standards, performance measures and eventually managing health of populations. 
Our Chart Search efforts are an important building block to our future roadmap. With about 80 clients engaged today, capturing greater than 30 million documents and 500 million results at a typical client, we are quickly building foundational data for the Healthe Intent platform. As the platform has grown over the last year, we are now beginning to deploy sophisticated machine learning algorithms to support both mapping of clinical concepts, as well as creating an environment to advance clinical decision support algorithms such as sepsis. As an example of the new landscape of opportunities, last quarter, we launched Cerner Math to accelerate our ability to discover and develop clinical agents using a hybrid of published evidence and our Health Facts research platform. 
How healthcare is paid for and what is paid for is becoming more and more dynamic, challenging our provider client organizations to more rapidly blend the clinical and financial environments together. As an example, the more recent ACO guidelines have improved several of the requirements and will likely cause several of our client organizations to once again strongly consider starting this journey. One core element of the regulations is quality measures, with the anticipation of more and more measurements and clinical context being mapped to payment. We use the term future proofing internally as a design element for our solutions to adapt to new requirements virally without requiring implementation projects or major upgrades to achieve compliance. The Healthe Intent platform is playing a strategic role in making this possible, allowing for deployment to occur at a nationwide scale. 
The next natural progression beyond measurement is management. As our clients adapt to an increasing rate of change, they will evolve more and more towards the learning organization model. We see this progressing towards a management system for healthcare. Not only managing the health of populations but managing the performance and innovation of care delivery in unison. Similar to the life cycle when manufacturing digitized, creating enterprise resource planning platforms, we are seeing early stages of this evolve as more and more of the EMR becomes digitized, providing greater insights and correlations to the delivery environment. 
A key element of driving to a future state is aligning with our clients. Historically, measures of success with clients were tied to a project or implementation. But as the industry morphs from a focus on Meaningful Use process-based measures to a focus on outcomes, measurement and value, Cerner's success will be tied to that of our clients and vice versa. It was clear to us at our healthcare conference that our clients see the importance of becoming more aligned, so we can face the current industry challenges together. It was also very clear that they're looking to us to not only be accountable for helping them meet current challenges but also to keep pushing for an improved future state. Managing costs, resources and outcomes will drive a growing portfolio of new solution opportunities, all of which demand a different type of distribution and activation method. 
I want to highlight 2 activities within the quarter that build upon this evolving landscape. Our recent acquisition of Clairvia fits well with the topic of my comments today. For those of you who aren't familiar with them, Clairvia provides workforce and patient management solutions to more than 400 organizations. Their predictive models are EMR agnostic and enable healthcare organizations to align resources with actual patient needs in real time, thereby cutting costs and improving patient outcomes. 
With this acquisition, we are solidifying our commitment to the workforce management marketplace and interoperable cloud-based solutions such as Healthe Intent and CareAware, which focus on providing positive clinical, operational and financial returns for our clients. By adding this rich data set to the clinical context, the ability to provide more sophisticated algorithms and timely utilization of scarce resources, we should be in a position to improve the management of labor and skills across the continuum of care. 
The second would be one of our newer works as I mentioned earlier. Last quarter, we signed our first QualityWorks client. Bundling together our Lighthouse and decision support offerings into a service-oriented model very similar to the approach of our other offerings in the Works space, we are now highly aligned with the clinical, operational and financial performance of the clients' organization. This provides clients the ability to gain access to both Cerner's scale and skill to adapt to the changing environment and requirements both at the local and national level. This is one of our earlier examples of creating a new style of alignment with our clients. And as we have seen with our other works offerings, we anticipate that the increasing industry demands will make this an attractive offering for our clients as they navigate the uncertainty ahead. 
To summarize, we are seeing innovation opportunities accelerate in the current environment to take more and more advantage of a digitizing platform as the urgency to extract the benefits of having more information is becoming more and more acute. 
With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

And [indiscernible] so relative to hitting the gross margin line, some of that upside of revenue won't hit the gross margin line as far because it will be some of that technology. And from an earnings perspective, keep in mind that the 36% tax rate compared to our 35% that we talked to you about previously, we had in Q3 and we expect in Q4, that costs us about another $0.01 of EPS every quarter that we have a 36% tax rate.

And I guess, I'm just kind of wondering how are you guys sizing up the remaining hospital decisions to be made?

There are still greenfields out there, and there are still people making decisions as to how they are going to get to Stage 1 and buy a new technology. But at this point, we could see people getting to Stage 1 using their existing supplier and then looking for other options. And that's one reason that we see an increase in our pipeline and strength going into 2012 as those decisions for some of our competitors are coming back into the marketplace. The good news is the that they'll have some funding from the stimulus State 1 dollars they've received.

Inside of both revenue cycle, as well as the medical records process, physician documentation is creating, I'll say, more interest or focus on those areas where coding occurs. It's not only a back-end process around dropping the claim, but it drives things more upstream such as computer-assisted coding. And where we see some of the newer opportunities is moving that coding to actually the point of care, point of decision and get it out of the back office. So that's where working with our clients, we see greater opportunities, but it is creating a lot of activity within the base, which is all good."
