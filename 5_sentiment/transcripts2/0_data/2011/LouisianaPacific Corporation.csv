And thank all of you, who are joining us on this conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010. With me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO; as well as Mike Kinney, our primary Investor Relations contact.I",1987,"Thank you. And thank all of you, who are joining us on this conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010. With me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO; as well as Mike Kinney, our primary Investor Relations contact.
Iâ€™ll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010. I'll follow this with some comments on the performance of each of our individual segments and then talk about some selected balance sheet items. 
After I finish my comments, Rick will take over to discuss the general market environment, in which LP has been operating, his perspective on our operating results, and some thoughts on the outlook for the first quarter of 2011. And then as the moderator did say, we will then open it up for a Q&A session.
And as we have done in the past, we are doing a webcast of this call today. This could be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that will be reviewed in conjunction with this and I will referencing those slides in my comments.
Additionally, we did filed an 8-K this morning that has supplemental information in that including our press release and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA. For your information, we will be filing our annual Form 10-K early in March. Before we start with the comments, I do want to remind participants about the forward-looking statement, comment that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation and also the non-GAAP financial information language included on Slide 3 of the presentation.  As I said, we have provided a reconciliation in the presentation and in the 8-K filing that we made in this morning. 
I'm not going to read these statements but I will incorporate them with this reference. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentations, this is a discussion of Q4 2010 results compared to the same quarter last year as well as Q3 of 2010. We're reporting today a net loss for the fourth quarter of $7 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $316 million in the quarter. 
At the same period last year, we reported a net loss of almost $50 million or $0.37 per diluted share and sales from continuing operations of $277 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was positive albeit it was a very low number, but it was positive in the quarter that compared to a loss of $20 million in Q4 of 2009. As a sidenote, this is the first positive EBITDA a quarter that we've enjoyed since 2005 fourth quarter. We did have a loss of $6.8 million in discontinued operation that was almost entirely related to increases in warranty reserves for two former product lines. We also note in this slide that there is quite a bit of movement in the tax rate between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q4 was 80% on net income but the effective tax benefit rate in Q4 of '09 was 27%. This is primarily the result of the true up that occurs every Q4 both in 2010 and 2009 caused by implying the estimated effect of annual tax benefit rate to full year results. I'll get to it in a minute. But looking at the full year, the tax benefit rate was 41% in 2010 and 35% in 2009.
On Slide 5 of the presentation is a brief reconciliation of special charges, I think the good news this quarter these special items were all positive. We did recognize a gain on the sale of a portion of our auction rate security portfolio, a $19 million gain. And I will note and I'll talk about it later although we sold these securities, we did retain all of our legal rights to pursue the issues of these instruments with the goal of full recovery in the investment and appropriate damages. 
Other items included a slight loss and impairment of long-lived assets and the reduction in the warranty and settlement reserves of $2.5 million. The impact of looking at the results without these items shows an adjusted loss from operations of $0.12 a share. 
Slide 6 of the presentation is a discussion of the full year results for 2010. We're reporting a net loss of $39 million and net sales of $1.4 billion. For the same period last year, we report a net loss of $121 million of sales of $1.1 billion. Off note here is our sales increased by 30% while the base housing market increased by about 7%, so clearly a good performance based on housing. 
Adjusted EBITDA, continuing operations of positive $82 million compared to loss of $44 million in 2009. For the year, the loss from discontinued operations was $10.4 million, almost all of that related to the warranty reserves mentioned above. And as I said earlier, the tax rate was 41% for 2010 versus 35% in the prior year.
Slide 7 of the presentation is a reconciliation of special items for the full year other than the items I talked about for the fourth quarter, the other big one was the write-down of our U.S. screen fiber investment that we took in Q3. And just as a reminder, that investment write-down was not deductible so the related tax provision does look a little bit unusual.
Now let me shift to the segments. On Slide 8 is our OSB segment. We had an operating loss of $30 million a quarter compared to a loss of $70 million in Q4 of last year. In the quarter we did have a 6% increase in volume and average sales price is about $4 million higher. The increase in the sales price accounted for $4 million improvement in earnings and in adjusted EBITDA. Offsetting the increase of pricing was the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which increased our cost more than revenue due to sales of U.S. We also absorbed increases in raw material costs, primarily electricity and resin. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment was $5 million better than the same quarter last year and $8 million lower than Q3, both price and volume were down. For the full year, OSB had an operating income of $26 million compared to a loss of $65 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $64 million in 2010 and a loss of $29 million in 2009. Pricing accounted for $102 million on LP produced products and another $11 million on product produced through our joint venture. The $1 million I will make on the purchases we make from our joint venture we record a 100% of the sales, but we only received 50% of profits on those sales.
Slide 9 of the presentation is our Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products plus commodity OSB produced Hayward mill. For the fourth quarter, Siding had an operating income of $12 million, which was an increase of over the $5 million reported in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the Siding segment was $16 million compared to $9 million in Q4 2009. For the quarter, sales were up 18% with unit volumes higher by 16% in SmartSide and 6% in CanExel. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were flat between periods while the CanExel price showed an increase of 14%. This was largely due to CanExel primarily being sold in Canada and with the strengthening of Canadian dollar it increased the U.S. equivalent sales price. For the full year, Siding had operating income of $51 million compared to $29 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods were $70 million versus $48 million. Higher OSB prices accounted for $9 million of the change and volume was responsible for the rest of the improvement.
Slide 10 is our Engineered Wood business. This includes our I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber and our Laminated Veneer Lumber. It also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by our joint venture with Abitibi or under a sales agreement with plywood. For Q4, EWP reported a loss of $6 million compared to a loss of $9 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the EWP segment was a negative $2 million in the fourth quarter versus a loss of $6 million the same quarter last year. 
Our volumes of I-Joist were down 18% while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 2% compared to 2009 same quarter. Pricing was up 8% in I-Joist and 17% in the combination LVL and LSL due to price increases we implemented in EWP to partially offset higher raw materials cost principally in OSB, veneer and lumber. 
For the year, EWP had an operating loss of $21 million compared to loss of $33 million in the same period last year, so a 30% improvement. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was a loss of $8 million compared to a loss of $20 million, so better than a 50% improvement. There's no slide for other building products, let me just make a few comments. We showed income of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of about the same amount in 2009.
For the quarter, sales were at $38 million, up 21% from the $31 million recorded in Q4 of last year, primarily driven by our South American operations. For the full year, other building products had an operating income of $6.1 million compared to income of about $1 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was $17.2 million in 2010 versus $11.5 million in 2009.
Couple of other things, we did have a foreign exchange again in the quarter compared to a foreign exchange gain of about $1.2 million compared to $3.1 million the same quarter last year. For the full year, foreign exchange was at $2.2 million gain compared to $13.4 million in 2009. That largely comes from the cash that we have in our Canadian operations held in Canadian dollars and the conversion of that. And then in 2009, we did have a U.S. denominated loan in our Chilean operation that created part of that gain as the Chilean currency strengthened against the U.S. dollar. 
Selling, general and administrative costs, they were at $31.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $32.4 million, so slightly down compared to the same period in 2009. For the full year, we're slightly higher at $119 million while a portion represents general corporate SG&A was lower by about $3 million.
Turn to Slide 11 of the presentation, on the balance sheet. Key balance sheet statistics cash, cash equivalents, investments from restricted cash is $436 million at the end of the year, just slightly down from where we began the year and this was after paying off $60 million in debt. Working capital was about $580 million, net cash position of over $210 million. We did keep our capital expenditures in the level that Rick had been talking about at $15 million and our book value per share was $9.23. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me just summarize our year-over-year results at a very high level.
We had an operating improvement of $125 million between the years. Higher sales prices accounted for about $130 million of that improvement with OSB being the bulk of it. Our LSL operational improvement, our Hayward mill added $5 million. Additional volume contributed about $22 million. But offsetting that is we did have high raw materials cost of about $25 million that reduced our results and then we have the Canadian currency when against, we're about $15 million. With that, let me turn over to Rick."

Curt explained everything so well, he didn't leave me much to say. So I'll be the color commentator today. It is clear and cold here in Nashville and after a significant snow and ice storm that went through here yesterday right at rush hour the whole town was gridlocked last night and it took me three hours and 40 minutes to drive 19 miles. That's nothing compared to what you experienced in the Northeast and Midwest, but it's significant for us. Along with an economic recession and housing, we also find ourselves in middle Tennessee in somewhat of a professional football recession, as the Titans are now without a starting quarterback and just announced a brand-new head coach this week. So in my prepared remarks this morning, I'm going to give you some observations on Q4. Look back at the whole year and then try to provide you with what it feels like entering into 2011.
Let's start with Q4 of '10. All of our businesses did perform better than in Q4 of '09, this includes OSB, Siding, Engineered Wood, Moldings and Brazil and Chile. And with this, we were able to tweaked out adjusted EBITDA, which was positive by a couple of hundred thousand dollars versus a negative of $20 million in Q4 of 2009. Our loss from operations did drop to $18 million from $51 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
In OSB, we operated at 63% of our currently available capacity and 50% of our total capacity, which includes a couple of indefinitely shut mills. Right now we have three mills that are running full and the rest are on some type of a flex schedule. Volume and price in OSB both declined from Q3, but were better than Q4 of 2009 as shown in our presentation. 
In our SmartSide and Siding line we had our best Q4 ever in the history of that product line in terms of both volume and profit, and that does exclude the OSB component, which is produced at our Hayward Siding mill and volume and pricing both contributed in the favorable comparisons. Engineered wood continues to struggle as it is our product line that is most heavily dependent and correlated upon two new residential starts, however, we reduced our losses from Q4 '09 with some price improvements throughout the year and help from additional international sales volume.
Although we do not report Chile and Brazil separately, we ended the year with both mills in Chile running full and our Brazil mill running at about 50%. And both countries were cash contributors.
Overall for Q4, our sense was that we didn't leave a lot on the table, and we got about all we could out of it under these market conditions. When I look back at the full year of 2010, I would characterize it about the same. We didn't leave much on the table for a year when we were anticipating 700,000 starts and we got just a little bit over 600,000 starts and I don't think that we misplayed too many cards. 
2010 was a year, if you remember were the first half business activity was better than the second. And in hindsight now, we realize that that was created by the tax incentive for homebuyers that simply pulled demand forward in the year. As a result, the demand from our customers and the pricing spike, which exceeded our expectations in March and April time frame, which did help us significantly from a cash preservation perspective. 
In Chile, OSB is growing in acceptance as a new residential construction product. Late into the year we had an estimated that the conversion to frames typical housing have gotten up to the 26% to 28% level. The unfortunate earthquake that took place in Chile last year seems to have accelerated our demand there and it has sped up the full running of our second mill in Chile, Lautaro. The frame build structure has held up much better during the earthquake and the masonry construction, which is the norm. And we believe that that will make frame build construction practices the standard rather than the exception going forward. 
The Chilean government has stated its plan to subsidize construction of 100,000 homes in 2011. Our increased international sales in Engineered Wood Products predominantly to Australia did provide additional volume for us to help dilute some fixed cost in that business. But increased new residential construction in the U.S. and higher lumber pricing are still a key to return to profitability in Engineered Wood. The progress in our Siding business continues to create excitement inside and outside the organization and create results as the value proposition for this product line becomes more obvious to the building and the repair and remodeling community. 
Net sales overall for LP improved as Curt said year-over-year by 30% of our larger increase and experienced in new residential starts. For LP overall, adjusted EBITDA was improved from a negative $44 million to a positive $82 million. That in the face of overcoming about $24 million of the year-to-year comparison of 2009 to 2010 increased in raw materials and the $12 million negative currency impact. Using most of the means that we have available to us last year, we were able to preserve our cash and cash equivalents beginning the year at $394 million and ending with $389 million in spite of our inability yet to divest shut assets that we have held for sale. 
Also in the year, we did retire $60 million worth of debt, and we added $10 million to our pension fund. I'd be remiss if I didn't brag on this organization a bit for what they did in safety in 2010, it was the best year in the history of LP, and we ended up with a total incident rate of 0.44, which we believe will also be again be industry-leading when the numbers for the industry become available. Only 16 people in LP including our international operations had a reportable safety incident in 2010. We continued to make good use of our Lean Six Sigma technology in 2010 with a 6.3:1 return level, doubling our target of 3.1 over the cost that we put into this program. These improvements permeate now most of the facets of our facets of our organization and they do help us offset inflation and our material increases. 
In 2009, we instituted a full-court press to ingrained improved quality of product and service much the way we have in safety. And we have two initiatives underway in this company in 2010. One is called LP by me made here, made right, which is internally focused. And we have another initiative which is externally focused called LP by me, customer focused and service driven. We think both of these initiatives will help further differentiate us in the future. Our claims on products manufactured in the last 12 to 18 months have dropped significantly as a result of this, and we are also developing a measurement system to assess customer satisfaction with our corporation. 
For the full year of 2010, our sales and marketing folks ended up with a little over 1,900 wins. I have defined a win for you in the past as a product placement with a new customer or an additional product placement with an existing customer. LP spent about $14 million in capital in 2010, and we begin the year with a little over 4,000 employees and we ended up the year with about 100 less people. 
As I look going into 2011, we built our plan this plan this year on a foundation of 700,000 new stores. That's all in. That includes single-family, multifamily and manufactured housing. That appears to be pretty much triangulated into the middle of the low estimates of between six and 650 and a high estimates of 750 to 800. As I noted earlier, in 2010, activity bounced in the first half of the year and then fell off in the second. This year we expect the activity to be slower in the first half of the year and somewhat better in the second. But the real fact is we don't know. And so we're concentrating on being agile and flexible enough to adapt to, however, the market unfolds this year. We are not yet getting any indications from our customers that they expect a big spring build or a surge in activity. My assessment of our customers as they are still very lean on product. They're taking a wait-and-see approach before tying up their cash and inventory. Some of this obviously is weather related as January weather was not conducive across the country for anybody to get too excited about building and that was also been demonstrated through the significant OSB pricing drop over the last couple of weeks as reported by random acts. 
In Siding, we're starting off the year with quite a healthy order file and Engineered Wood lags last year by a little bit. At this time, I expect our capital expenditures for 2011 to be about $50 million for our operations and another $20 million to $22 million to complete the transaction [ph] for 100% ownership of the OSB mill in Brazil. I will add that if the market does not unfold in an encouraging fashion, we have the ability to moderate the CapEx to our operations. My early concern for this year for 2011 is increasing raw material cost escalation, particularly anything related to energy or energy derivatives. At this point, we are expecting our raw material cost to increase above the magnitude that they did last year in 2011 and I think that oil prices is the big unknown variable. 
Overall, the key issues standing in the way of recovery in housing to a more normal level are pretty much the same. We've got to work through the large inventory of homes that are in foreclosure process or will enter that process. We have to see home prices start to turn upward and reduce the number of homeowners that are upside down in their mortgages. Home employment needs to be trending positive downward direction and at least we have a couple of data points on that lately. And all of this must boost consumer confidence. So until then, we are still pretty much in an endeavor of preserving cash while retaining the ability to capitalize on the upswings in the market going forward. With that said, I'll turn it back over to Curt for the question-and-answer period."

We expect to get again more market penetration in 2011 and base a plan on doing that. But we are nowhere near close to filling up that mill. But it's just really tough in the marketplace to get your customer to design this product into their building plans, et cetera in this kind of a market. With lumbar pricing having been so low over the last couple of year, that axis is a bit of a deterrent for the substitution that we're trying to create. That said, we're still confident that this is a very, very good product and in a more robust market, people will see the value proposition of that product. In terms of competitors, there are two mills that I know of in Canada that claimed to have the ability to produce similar technology product, neither one of them are doing much with that. One of them I think would yet need quite a bit of capital to complete. So in the short-term, we're not feeling pressure on that. In the longer term, we will just have to see how it plays out. They've only been two people in that product line or two companies in that product line up to now and entry has not been very easy. So it's hard for me at this point in time to judge that competitive threat. It's certainly if it comes, it will come when the market is much more robust."

Currently, most of the OSB that we sell is not for construction purposes. It's either used as packaging or it's as temporary fencing or it's used for any other thing that people can think of other than putting it on the side of a house. Our strategy there has been changed somewhat from the way we've thought, which was to be able to simply take our Chilean model of conversion. But we found that extremely difficult because of the bureaucracy that we have to fight our way through. So late last year, we changed the name of our strategy from conversion to adaptation and that we are trying to do now is to find places where OSB will fit into their current building practices until the acceptance of that product becomes greater. We are also attending their home building show here next month. We did the same thing last year, and we're starting to generate more interest for people that want to build frame housing. So currently if you're looking at what we're selling, almost all of it is not going in the construction. So that's a hard thing right now. But it's very exciting to us as we look at the home demand.

With me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO; as well as Mike Kinney, our primary Investor Relations contact.I",1992,"Thank you, and thank all of you who are joining us on this conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010. With me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO; as well as Mike Kinney, our primary Investor Relations contact.
Iâ€™ll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010. I'll follow this with some comments on the performance of each of our individual segments, and then talk about some selected balance sheet items. After I finish my comments, Rick will take over to discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, his perspective on our operating results for 2010 and some thoughts on the outlook  of 2011. And then as the moderator did say, we will then open it up for a Q&A session. 
As we have done in the past, we are doing a webcast of this call today. This could be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that will be reviewed in conjunction with this, and I will be referencing those slides in my comments.
Additionally, we did file an 8-K this morning that has supplemental information in that, including our press release and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA. For your information, we will be filing our annual Form 10-K early in March. 
Before I get started with the comments, I do want to remind participants about the forward-looking statement, comment that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation and also the non-GAAP financial information language included on Slide 3 of the presentation.  As I said, we have provided a reconciliation in the presentation and in the 8-K filing that we made this morning. I'm not going to re-read these statements, but I will incorporate them with this reference. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation. This is a discussion of Q4 2010 results compared to the same quarter last year, as well as Q3 of 2010. We're reporting today a net loss for the fourth quarter of $7 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $316 million in the quarter. At the same period last year, we reported a net loss of almost $50 million or $0.37 per diluted share and sales from continuing operations of $277 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was positive, albeit it was a very low number, but it was positive in the quarter. That compared to a loss of $20 million in Q4 of 2009. As a sidenote, this is the first positive EBITDA quarter that we've enjoyed since 2005. We did have a loss of $6.8 million in discontinued operation that was almost entirely related to increases in warranty reserves for two former product lines, vinyl sidings and decking. 
We also note in this slide that there is quite a bit of movement in the tax rate between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q4 was 80% on net income, but the effective tax benefit rate in Q4 of '09 was 27%. This is primarily the result of the true-up that occurs every Q4, both in 2010 and 2009, caused by applying the estimated effective annual tax benefit rate to full year results. I'll get to it in a minute, but looking at the full year, the tax benefit rate was 41% in 2010 and 35% in 2009.
On Slide 5 of the presentation is a brief reconciliation of special charges. I think the good news this quarter is special items were all positive. We did recognize a gain on the sale of a portion of our auction rate security portfolio, a $19 million gain. And I will note, and I'll talk about it later, although we sold these securities, we did retain all of our legal rights to pursue the issuers of these instruments with the goal of full recovery in the investment and appropriate damages. 
Other items included a slight loss and impairment of long-lived assets and the reduction in the warranty and settlement reserves of $2.5 million. The impact of looking at our results without these items shows an adjusted loss from operations of $0.12 a share. 
Slide 6 of the presentation is a discussion of the full year results for 2010. We're reporting a net loss of $39 million and net sales of $1.4 billion. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of $121 million and sales of $1.1 billion. Of note here is our sales increased by 30%, while the base housing market increased by about 7%, so clearly a good performance based on housing. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of positive $82 million compared to a loss of $44 million in 2009. For the year, the loss from discontinued operations was $10.4 million, almost all of that related to the warranty reserves mentioned above. And as I said earlier, the tax rate was 41% for 2010 versus 35% in the prior year.
Slide 7 of the presentation is a reconciliation of special items for the full year. Other than the items that I talked about for the fourth quarter, the other big one was the write-down of our U.S. GreenFiber investment that we took in Q3. And just as a reminder, that investment write-down was not deductible, so the related tax provision does look a little bit unusual.
Now let me shift to the segments. On Slide 8 is our OSB segment. We had an operating loss of $13 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $17 million in Q4 of last year. In the quarter, we did have a 6% increase in volume and average sales price is about $4 million higher. The increase in the sales price accounted for $4 million improvement in earnings and in adjusted EBITDA. Offsetting the increase in pricing was the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which increased our cost more than revenue due to sales in the U.S. We also absorbed increases in raw material costs, primarily electricity and resin. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment was $5 million better than the same quarter last year and $8 million lower than Q3, both price and volume were down. For the full year, OSB had an operating income of $26 million compared to a loss of $65 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $64 million in 2010 and a loss of $29 million in 2009. Pricing accounted for $102 million on LP-produced product and another $11 million on product produced through our joint venture. And one note I will make, on the purchases we make from our joint venture, we record 100% of the sales, but we only received 50% of profits on those sales.
Slide 9 of the presentation is our Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide siding and CanExel siding products plus commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the fourth quarter, Siding had an operating income of $12 million, which was an increase over the $5 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the Siding segment was $16 million compared to $9 million in Q4 2009. For the quarter, sales were up 18%, with unit volumes higher by 16% in SmartSide and 6% in CanExel. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were flat between periods, while the CanExel price showed an increase of 14%. This was largely due to CanExel primarily being sold in Canada, and with the strengthening Canadian dollar, it increased the U.S. equivalent sales price. For the full year, Siding had operating income of $51 million compared to $29 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $70 million versus $48 million. Higher OSB prices accounted for $9 million of the change, and volume was responsible for the rest of the improvement.
Slide 10 is our Engineered Wood business. This includes our I-Joist, laminated strand lumber and our laminated veneer lumber. It also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by our joint venture with Abitibi or under our sales agreement with Murphy Plywood. For Q4, EWP reported a loss of $6 million compared to a loss of $9 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the EWP segment was a negative $2 million in the fourth quarter versus a loss of $6 million in the same quarter last year. 
Our volumes of I-Joist were down 18%, while volumes of LVL/LSL were down 2% compared to 2009 same quarter. Pricing was up 8% in I-Joist and 17% in the combination LVL and LSL due to price increases we implemented in EWP to partially offset higher raw materials cost, principally in OSB, veneer and lumber. For the year, EWP had an operating loss of $21 million compared to a loss of $33 million in the same period last year, so a 30% improvement. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was a loss of $8 million compared to a loss of $20 million, so better than a 50% improvement. 
There's no slide for other building products, let me just make a few comments. We showed income of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of about the same amount in 2009. For the quarter, sales were at $38 million, up 21% from the $31 million recorded in Q4 of last year, primarily driven by our South American operations. For the full year, other building products had an operating income of $6.1 million compared to income of about $1 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $17.2 million in 2010 versus $11.5 million in 2009.
Couple of other things, we did have a foreign exchange gain in the quarter compared to -- a foreign exchange gain of about $1.2 million compared to $3.1 million in the same quarter last year. For the full year, foreign exchange was a $2.2 million gain compared to $13.4 million in 2009. That largely comes from the cash that we have in our Canadian operations held in Canadian dollars and the conversion of that. And then in 2009, we did have a U.S.-denominated loan in our Chilean operation that created part of that gain, as the Chilean currency strengthened against the U.S. dollar. 
Selling, general and administrative costs, they were at $31.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $32.4 million, so slightly down compared to the same period in 2009. For the full year, it was slightly higher at $119 million, while the portion that represents general corporate SG&A was lower by about $3 million.
Turn to Slide 11 of the presentation, on the balance sheet, key balance sheet statistics. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash is $436 million at the end of the year, just slightly down from where we began the year, and this was after paying off $60 million in debt. Working capital was about $580 million, net cash position of over $210 million. We did keep our capital expenditures in the level that Rick had been talking about at $15 million, and our book value per share was $9.23. 
Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me just summarize our year-over-year results at very high level. We had an operating improvement of $125 million between the years. Higher sales prices accounted for about $130 million of that improvement, with OSB being the bulk of it. Our LSL operational improvement at our Houlton mill added $5 million. Additional volume contributed about $22 million, but offsetting that is we did have high raw materials cost of about $25 million that reduced our results, and then we had the Canadian currency went against us for about $15 million. 
With that, let me turn over to Rick."

He didn't leave me much to say, so I'll be the color commentator today. 
It is clear and cold here in Nashville, and after a significant snow and ice storm that went through here yesterday right at rush hour, the whole town was gridlocked last night, and it took me three hours and 40 minutes to drive 19 miles. Now that's nothing compared to what you experienced in the Northeast and Midwest, but it's significant for us. Along with an economic recession in housing, we also find ourselves in middle Tennessee in somewhat of a professional football recession, as the Titans are now without a starting quarterback and just announced a brand-new head coach this week. So in my prepared remarks this morning, I'm going to give you some observations on Q4, look back at the whole year and then try to provide you with what it feels like entering into 2011.
Let's start with Q4 of '10. All of our businesses did perform better than in Q4 of '09. This includes OSB, Siding, Engineered Wood, Moulding, and Brazil and Chile. And with this, we were able to eke out adjusted EBITDA, which was positive by a couple of hundred thousand dollars versus a negative of $20 million in Q4 of 2009. Our loss from operations did drop to $18 million from $51 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
In OSB, we operated at 63% of our currently available capacity and 50% of our total capacity, which includes a couple of indefinitely shut mills. Right now, we have three mills that are running full, and the rest are on some type of a flex schedule. Volume and price in OSB both declined from Q3, but were better than Q4 of 2009, as shown in our presentation. 
In our SmartSide siding line, we had our best Q4 ever in the history of that product line in terms of both volume and profit, and that does exclude the OSB component, which is produced at our Hayward siding mill; and volume and pricing both contributed in the favorable comparisons. Engineered wood continues to struggle, as it is our product line that is most heavily dependent and correlated upon two new residential starts. However, we reduced our losses from Q4 '09, with some price improvements throughout the year and help from additional international sales volume. Although we do not report Chile and Brazil separately, we ended the year with both mills in Chile running full and our Brazil mill running at about 50%, and both countries were cash contributors.
Overall, for Q4, our sense was that we didn't leave a lot on the table, and we got about all we could out of it under these market conditions. When I look back at the full year of 2010, I would characterize it about the same. We didn't leave much on the table for a year when we were anticipating 700,000 starts and we got just a little bit over 600,000 starts, and I don't think that we misplayed too many cards. 
2010 was a year, if you remember, where the first half business activity was better than the second. And in hindsight now, we realized that, that was created by the tax incentive for homebuyers that simply pulled demand forward in the year. As a result, the demand from our customers and the pricing spike, which exceeded our expectations in March and April time frame, which did help us significantly from a cash preservation perspective. 
In Chile, OSB is growing in acceptance as a new residential construction product. Late into the year we had an estimated that the conversion to frames typical built housing had gotten up to the 26% to 28% level. The unfortunate earthquake that took place in Chile last year seems to have accelerated our demand there, and it has sped up the full running of our second mill in Chile, Lautaro. The frame-build structure has held up much better during the earthquake and the masonry construction, which is the norm. And we believe that, that will make frame build construction practices the standard rather than the exception going forward. The Chilean government has stated its plan to subsidize construction of 100,000 homes in 2011. 
Our increased international sales in Engineered Wood Products predominantly to Australia did provide additional volume for us to help dilute some fixed cost in that business, but increased new residential construction in the U.S. and higher lumber pricing are still a key to return to profitability in Engineered Wood. The progress in our Siding business continues to create excitement inside and outside the organization and create results as the value proposition for this product line becomes more obvious to the building and the repair and remodeling community. 
Net sales overall for LP improved, as Curt said, year-over-year by 30% of our larger increase than experienced in new residential starts. For LP overall, adjusted EBITDA was improved from a negative $44 million to a positive $82 million, and that in the face of overcoming about $24 million of the year-to-year comparison of 2009 to 2010 increase in raw materials and the $12 million negative currency impact. Using most of the means that we have available to us last year, we were able to preserve our cash and cash equivalents, beginning the year at $394 million and ending with $389 million in spite of our inability yet to divest shut assets that we have held for sale. 
Also in the year, we did retire $60 million worth of debt, and we added $10 million to our pension fund. I'd be remiss if I didn't brag on this organization a bit for what they did in safety in 2010. It was the best year in the history of LP, and we ended up with a total incident rate of 0.44, which we believe will also be again industry-leading when the numbers for the industry become available. Only 16 people in LP including our international operations had a reportable safety incident in 2010. 
We continued to make good use of our Lean Six Sigma technology in 2010, with a 6.3:1 return level, doubling our target of 3.1 over the cost that we put into this program. These improvements permeate now most of the facets of our organization, and they do help us offset inflation and raw material increases. 
In 2009, we instituted a full-court press to ingrain improved quality of product and service much the way we have in safety, and we have two initiatives under way in this company in 2010. One is called LP by me, made here, made right, which is internally focused; and we have another initiative which is externally focused called LP by me, customer focused and service driven. We think both of these initiatives will help further differentiate us in the future. Our claims on products manufactured in the last 12 to 18 months have dropped significantly as a result of this, and we are also developing a measurement system to assess customer satisfaction with our corporation. 
For the full year of 2010, our sales and marketing folks ended up with a little over 1,900 wins. I have defined a win for you in the past as a product placement with a new customer or an additional product placement with an existing customer. LP spent about $14 million in capital in 2010, and we begin the year with a little over 4,000 employees, and we ended up the year with about 100 less people. 
As I look going into 2011, we built our operating plan this year on a foundation of 700,000 new starts. That's all in. That includes single-family, multifamily and manufactured housing. That appears to be pretty much triangulated into the middle of the low estimates of between 600 and 650 and a high estimates of 750 to 800. As I noted earlier, in 2010, activity bounced in the first half of the year and then fell off in the second. This year, we expect the activity to be slower in the first half of the year and somewhat better in the second, but the real fact is we don't know. And so we're concentrating on being agile and flexible enough to adapt to however the market unfolds this year. 
We are not yet getting any indications from our customers that they expect a big spring build or a surge in activity. My assessment of our customers is they are still very lean on product. They are taking a wait-and-see approach before tying up their cash and inventory. Some of this obviously is weather-related, as January weather was not conducive across the country for anybody to get too excited about building, and that was also been demonstrated through the significant OSB pricing drop over the last couple of weeks, as reported by Random Lengths. 
In Siding, we are starting off the year with quite a healthy order file, and Engineered Wood lags last year by a little bit. At this time, I expect our capital expenditures for 2011 to be about $50 million for our operations and another $20 million to $22 million to complete the Masisa  transaction for 100% ownership of the OSB mill in Brazil. I will add that if the market does not unfold in an encouraging fashion, we have the ability to moderate the CapEx to our operations. My early concern for this year for 2011 is increasing raw material cost escalation, particularly anything related to energy or energy derivatives. At this point, we are expecting our raw material cost to increase about the magnitude that they did last year in 2011, and I think that oil price is the big unknown variable. 
Overall, the key issues standing in the way of recovery in housing to a more normal level are pretty much the same. We've got to work through the large inventory of homes that are in the foreclosure process or will enter that process. We have to see home prices start to turn upward and reduce the number of homeowners that are upside down in their mortgages. Unemployment needs to be trending in a positive downward direction, and at least we have a couple of data points on that lately. And all of this must boost consumer confidence. So until then, we are still, I think, pretty much in an endeavor of preserving cash while retaining the ability to capitalize on the upswings in the market going forward. 
With that said, I'll turn it back over to Curt for the question-and-answer period."

We did get significant growth year-over-year, '10 to '09, but the base obviously was low. We expect to get again more market penetration in 2011 and a base plan on doing that, but we are nowhere near close to filling up that mill. But it's just really tough in the marketplace to get your customer to design this product into their building plans, et cetera, in this kind of a market. With lumber pricing having been so low over the last couple of years, that acts as a bit of a deterrent for the substitution that we're trying to create. That said, we're still confident that this is a very, very good product, and in a more robust market, people will see the value proposition of that product. In terms of competitors, there are two mills that I know of in Canada that claimed to have the ability to produce similar technology product. Neither one of them are doing much with that. One of them I think would yet need quite a bit of capital to complete. So in the short term, we're not feeling pressure on that. In the longer term, we'll just have to see how it plays out. There have only been two people in that product line or two companies in that product line up to now, and entry has not been very easy. So it's hard for me at this point in time to judge that competitive threat. It's certainly, if it comes, it will come when the market is much more robust."

Our strategy there has been changed somewhat from the way we thought, which was to be able to simply take our Chilean model of conversion. But we found that extremely difficult because of the bureaucracy that we have to fight our way through. So late last year, we changed the name of our strategy from conversion to adaptation, and what we are trying to do now is to find places where OSB will fit into their current building practices until the acceptance of that product becomes greater. We are also attending their home building show here next month. We did the same thing last year, and we're starting to generate more interest for people that want to build frame-built housing. But currently, if you're looking at what we're selling, almost all of it is not going in the construction.

So our obstacle so far, and we keep looking at it and I keep pounding Jeff, our OSB guy, about how come we're not selling more to China. But we're just not taking bad business, and we haven't found that many opportunities where it actually was additive to our P&L for doing that. Now over time, if there is an additional uses for this product or if we can invent more specialty products which will go over there, we're certainly going to chase it when it seems to make sense.

With me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO; as well as Mike Kinney, our primary Investor Relations contact.
Iâ€™ll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010. I'll follow this with some comments on the performance of each of our individual segments and then talk about some selected balance sheet items. After I finish my comments, Rick will take over to discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, his perspective on our operating results for 2010 and some thoughts on the outlook of 2011. And then, as the moderator did say, we will then open it up for a Q&A session. 
As we have done in the past, we are doing a webcast of this call today. This could be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that will be reviewed in conjunction with this, and I will be referencing those slides in my comments.
Additionally, we did file an 8-K this morning that has supplemental information in that, including our press release and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA. For your information, we will be filing our annual Form 10-K early in March. 
Before I get started with the comments, I do want to remind participants about the forward-looking statements comment that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation and also the non-GAAP financial information language included on Slide 3 of the presentation. As I said, we have provided a reconciliation in the presentation and in the 8-K filing that we made this morning. I'm not going to re-read these statements, but I will incorporate them with this reference. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation. This is a discussion of Q4 2010 results compared to the same quarter last year, as well as Q3 of 2010. We're reporting today a net loss for the fourth quarter of $7 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $316 million in the quarter. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of almost $50 million or $0.37 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $277 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was positive, albeit it was a very low number, but it was positive in the quarter. That compared to a loss of $20 million in Q4 of 2009. As a side note, this is the first positive EBITDA quarter that we've enjoyed since 2005 -- fourth quarter since 2005. We did have a loss of $6.8 million in discontinued operation that was almost entirely related to increases in warranty reserves for two former product lines: vinyl siding and decking. 
We also note in this slide that there is quite a bit of movement in the tax rate between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q4 was 80% on net income, but the effective tax benefit rate in Q4 [of '09] [ph] was 27%. This is primarily the result of the true-up that occurs every Q4, both in 2010 and 2009, caused by applying the estimated effective annual tax benefit rate to full year results. I'll get to it in a minute, but looking at the full year, the tax benefit rate was 41% in 2010 and 35% in 2009.
On Slide 5 of the presentation is a brief reconciliation of special charges. I think the good news this quarter is special items were all positive. We did recognize a gain on the sale of a portion of our auction rate security portfolio, a $19 million gain. And I will note, and I'll talk about it later, although we sold these securities, we did retain all of our legal rights to pursue the issuers of these instruments with the goal of full recovery of the investment and appropriate damages. 
Other items included a slight loss and impairment of long-lived and a reduction in the warranty and settlement reserves of $2.5 million. The impact of looking at our results without these items shows an adjusted loss from operations of $0.12 a share. 
Slide 6 of the presentation is a discussion of the full year results for 2010. We're reporting a net loss of $39 million on net sales of $1.4 billion. For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of $121 million on sales of $1.1 billion. Of note here is our sales increased by 30%, while the base housing market increased by about 7% [ph], so clearly a good performance based on housing. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of positive $82 million compared to a loss of $44 million in 2009. For the year, the loss from discontinued operations was $10.4 million, almost all of that related to the warranty reserves mentioned above. And as I said earlier, the tax rate was 41% for 2010 versus 35% in the prior year.
Slide 7 of the presentation is a reconciliation of special items for the full year. Other than the items that I talked about for the fourth quarter, the other big one was the write-down of our U.S. GreenFiber investment that we took in Q3. And just as a reminder, that investment write-down was not deductible, so the related tax provision does look a little bit unusual.
Now let me shift to the segments. On Slide 8 is our OSB segment. We had an operating loss of $13 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $17 million in Q4 of last year. In the quarter, we did have a 6% increase in volume and average sales price is about $4 million higher. The increase in the sales price accounted for $4 million improvement in earnings and in adjusted EBITDA. Offsetting the increase in pricing was the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which increased our cost more than revenue due to sales in the U.S. We also absorbed increases in raw material costs, primarily electricity and resin. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment was $5 million better than the same quarter last year and $8 million lower than Q3. Both price and volume were down. For the full year, OSB had an operating income of $26 million compared to a loss of $65 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $64 million in 2010 and a loss of $29 million in 2009. Pricing accounted for $102 million on LP-produced product and another $11 million on product produced through our joint venture. And one note I will make, on the purchases we make from our joint venture, we record 100% of the sales, but we only received 50% of profits on those sales.
Slide 9 of the presentation is our Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products plus commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the fourth quarter, Siding had an operating income of $12 million, which was an increase over the $5 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the Siding segment was $16 million compared to $9 million in Q4 2009. For the quarter, sales were up 18%, with unit volumes higher by 16% in SmartSide and 6% in CanExel. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were flat between periods, while the CanExel price showed an increase of 14%. This was largely due to CanExel primarily being sold in Canada, and, with the strengthening Canadian dollar, it increased the U.S. equivalent sales price. For the full year, Siding had operating income of $51 million compared to $29 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $70 million versus $48 million. Higher OSB prices accounted for $9 million of the change, and volume was responsible for the rest of the improvement.
Slide 10 is our Engineered Wood business. This includes our I-Joist, laminated strand lumber and our laminated veneer lumber. It also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by our joint venture with Abitibi or under a sales agreement with Murphy Plywood. For Q4, EWP reported a loss of $6 million compared to a loss of $9 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the EWP segment was a negative $2 million in the fourth quarter versus a loss of $6 million in the same quarter last year.  
Our volumes of I-Joist were down 18%, while volumes of LVL/LSL were down 2% compared to 2009 same quarter. Pricing was up 8% in I-Joist and 17% in the combination of LVL and LSL due to price increases we implemented in EWP to partially offset higher raw materials cost, principally in OSB, veneer and lumber. For the year, EWP had an operating loss of $21 million compared to a loss of $33 million in the same period last year, so a 30% improvement. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was a loss of $8 million compared to a loss of $20 million, so better than a 50% improvement. 
There's no slide for other building products; let me just make a few comments. We showed income of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of about the same amount in 2009. For the quarter, sales were at $38 million, up 21% from the $31 million recorded in Q4 of last year, primarily driven by our South American operations. For the full year, other building products had an operating income of $6.1 million compared to income of about $1 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $17.2 million in 2010 versus $11.5 million in 2009.
Couple of other things, we did have a foreign exchange gain in the quarter compared to -- a foreign exchange gain of about $1.2 million compared to $3.1 million in the same quarter last year. For the full year, foreign exchange was a $2.2 million gain compared to $13.4 million in 2009. That largely comes from the cash that we have in our Canadian operations held in Canadian dollars and the conversion of that. And then in 2009, we did have a U.S.-denominated loan in our Chilean operation that created part of that gain, as the Chilean currency strengthened against the U.S. dollar. 
Selling, general and administrative costs, they were at $31.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $32.4 million, so slightly down compared to the same period in 2009. For the full year, it was slightly higher at $119 million, while the portion that represents general corporate SG&A was lower by about $3 million.
Turn to Slide 11 of the presentation, on the balance sheet, key balance sheet statistics. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash was $436 million at the end of the year, just slightly down from where we began the year, and this was after paying off $60 million in debt. Working capital was about $580 million, net cash position of over $210 million. We did keep our capital expenditures to the level that Rick had been talking about at $15 million, and our book value per ending share was $9.23. 
Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me just summarize our year-over-year results at very high level. We had an operating improvement of $125 million between the years. Higher sales prices accounted for about $130 million of that improvement, with OSB being the bulk of it. Our LSL operational improvement at our Houlton mill added $5 million. Additional volume contributed about $22 million, but offsetting that is we did have high raw materials costs of about $25 million that reduced our results, and then we had the Canadian currency went against us for about $15 million. 
With that, let me turn over to Rick."

He doesnâ€™t leave me much to say, so I'll be the color commentator today. 
It is clear and cold here in Nashville, and after a significant snow and ice storm that went through here yesterday right at rush hour, the whole town was gridlocked last night, and it took me three hours and 40 minutes to drive 19 miles. Now that's nothing compared to what you experience in the Northeast and Midwest, but it's significant for us. Along with an economic recession in housing, we also find ourselves in middle Tennessee in somewhat of a professional football recession, as the Titans are now without a starting quarterback and just announced a brand-new head coach this week. So in my prepared remarks this morning, I'm going to give you some observations on Q4, look back at the whole year and then try to provide you with what it feels like entering into 2011.
Let's start with Q4 of '10. All of our businesses did perform better than in Q4 of '09. This includes OSB, Siding, Engineered Wood, Moulding, and Brazil and Chile. And with this, we were able to eke out adjusted EBITDA, which was positive by a couple of hundred thousand dollars versus a negative of $20 million in Q4 of 2009. Our loss from operations did drop to $18 million from $51 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
In OSB, we operated at 63% of our currently available capacity and 50% of our total capacity, which includes a couple of indefinitely shut mills. Right now, we have three mills that are running full, and the rest are on some type of a flex schedule. Volume and price in OSB both declined from Q3, but were better than Q4 of 2009, as shown in our presentation. 
In our SmartSide siding line, we had our best Q4 ever in the history of that product line in terms of both volume and profit, and that does exclude the OSB component, which is produced at our Hayward siding mill; and volume and pricing both contributed in the favorable comparisons. Engineered wood continues to struggle, as it is our product line that is most heavily dependent and correlated upon two new residential starts. However, we reduced our losses from Q4 '09 with some price improvements throughout the year and help from additional international sales volume. Although we do not report Chile and Brazil separately, we ended the year with both mills in Chile running full and our Brazil mill running at about 50%, and both countries were cash contributors.
Overall, for Q4, our sense was that we didn't leave a lot on the table, and we got about all we could out of it under these market conditions. When I look back at the full year of 2010, I would characterize it about the same. We didn't leave much on the table for a year when we were anticipating 700,000 starts and we got just a little bit over 600,000 starts, and I don't think that we misplayed too many cards. 
2010 was a year, if you remember, where the first-half business activity was better than the second. And in hindsight now, we realized that, that was created by the tax incentive for homebuyers that simply pulled demand forward in the year. As a result, the demand from our customers and the pricing spike, which exceeded our expectations in March and April time frame, which did help us significantly from a cash preservation perspective. 
In Chile, OSB is growing in acceptance as a new residential construction product. Going into the year, we had estimated that the conversion to frame-stick-built housing had gotten up to the 26% to 28% level. The unfortunate quake that took place in Chile last year seems to have accelerated our demand there, and it has sped up the full running of our second mill in Chile, Lautaro. The frame-built structure has held up much better during the earthquake, and the masonry construction, which is the norm. And we believe that, that will make frame-built construction practices the standard rather than the exception going forward. The Chilean government has stated its plan to subsidize construction of 100,000 homes in 2011. 
Our increased international sales in Engineered Wood Products, predominantly to Australia, did provide additional volume for us to help dilute some fixed cost in that business, but increased new residential construction in the U.S. and higher lumber pricing are still a key to return to profitability in Engineered Wood. The progress in our Siding business continues to create excitement inside and outside the organization and create results as the value proposition for this product line becomes more obvious to the building and the repair and remodeling community. 
Net sales overall for LP improved, as Curt said, year-over-year by 30% of our larger increase than experienced in new residential starts. For LP overall, adjusted EBITDA was improved from a negative $44 million to a positive $82 million, and that in the face of overcoming about $24 million of the year-to-year comparison of 2009 to 2010 increase in raw materials and the $12 million negative currency impact. Using most of the means that we had available to us last year, we were able to preserve our cash and cash equivalents, beginning the year at $394 million and ending with $389 million in spite of our inability yet to divest shut assets that we have held for sale. 
Also in the year, we did retire $60 million worth of debt, and we added $10 million to our pension fund. I'd be remiss if I didn't brag on this organization a bit for what they did in safety in 2010. It was the best year in the history of LP, and we ended up with a total incident rate of 0.44, which we believe will also be again industry-leading when the numbers for the industry become available. Only 16 people in LP, including our international operations, had a reportable safety incident in 2010. 
We continued to make good use of our Lean Six Sigma technology in 2010, with a 6.3:1 return level, doubling our target of 3.1 over the cost that we put into this program. These improvements permeate now most of the facets of our organization, and they do help us offset inflation and raw material increases. 
In 2009, we instituted a full-court press to ingrain improved quality of product and service much the way we have in safety, and we have two initiatives under way in this company in 2010. One is called LP by me, made here, made right, which is internally focused; and we have another initiative which is externally focused called LP by me, customer focused and service driven. We think both of these initiatives will help further differentiate us in the future. Our claims on products manufactured in the last 12 to 18 months have dropped significantly as a result of this, and we are also developing a measurement system to assess customer satisfaction with our corporation. 
For the full year of 2010, our sales and marketing folks ended up with a little over 1,900 wins. I have defined a win for you in the past as a product placement with a new customer or an additional product placement with an existing customer. LP spent about $14 million in capital in 2010, and we began the year with a little over 4,000 employees, and we ended up the year with about 100 less people. 
As I look going into 2011, we built our operating plan this year on the foundation of 700,000 new starts. That's all in. That includes single-family, multifamily and manufactured housing. That appears to be pretty much triangulated into the middle of the low estimates of between 600,000 and 650,000 and the high estimates of 750,000 to 800,000. As I noted earlier, in 2010, activity bounced in the first half of the year and then fell off in the second. This year, we expect the activity to be slower in the first half of the year and somewhat better in the second, but the real fact is we don't know. And so we are concentrating on being agile and flexible enough to adapt to however the market unfolds this year. 
We are not yet getting any indications from our customers that they expect a big spring build or a surge in activity. My assessment of our customers is they are still very lean on product. They are taking a wait-and-see approach before tying up their cash in inventory. Some of this obviously is weather-related, as January weather was not conducive across the country for anybody to get too excited about building, and that was also been demonstrated through the significant OSB pricing drop over the last couple of weeks, as reported by Random Lengths. 
In Siding, we are starting off the year with quite a healthy order file, and Engineered Wood lags last year by a little bit. At this time, I expect our capital expenditures for 2011 to be about $50 million for our operations and another $20 million to $22 million to complete the Masisa transaction for 100% ownership of the OSB mill in Brazil. I will add that if the market does not unfold in an encouraging fashion, we have the ability to moderate the CapEx to our operations. My early concern for this year for 2011 is increasing raw material cost escalation, particularly anything related to energy or energy derivatives. At this point, we are expecting our raw material cost to increase about the magnitude that they did last year in 2011, and I think that oil price is the big unknown variable. 
Overall, the key issues standing in the way of recovery in housing to a more normal level are pretty much the same. We've got to work through the large inventory of homes that are in the foreclosure process or will enter that process. We have to see home prices start to turn upward and reduce the number of homeowners that are upside down in their mortgages. Unemployment needs to be trending in a positive downward direction, and at least we have a couple of data points on that lately. And all of this must boost consumer confidence. So until then, we are still, I think, pretty much in an endeavor of preserving cash while retaining the ability to capitalize on the upswings in the market going forward. 
With that said, I'll turn it back over to Curt for the question-and-answer period."

We did get significant growth year-over-year, '10 to '09, but the base, obviously, was low. We expect to get again more market penetration in 2011 and have based the plan on doing that, but we are nowhere near close to filling up that mill. But it's just really tough in the marketplace to get your customer to design this product into their building plans, et cetera, in this kind of a market. With lumber pricing having been so low over the last couple of years, that acts as a bit of a deterrent for the substitution that we're trying to create. That said, we're still confident that this is a very, very good product, and, in a more robust market, people will see the value proposition of that product. In terms of competitors, there are two mills that I know of in Canada that claim to have the ability to produce a similar technology product. Neither one of them are doing much with that. One of them I think would yet need quite a bit of capital to complete. So in the short term, we're not feeling pressure on that. In the longer term, we'll just have to see how it plays out. There have only been two people in that product line, or two companies in that product line up to now, and entry has not been very easy. So it's hard for me at this point in time to judge that competitive threat. It's certainly, if it comes, it will come when the market is much more robust."

But we found that extremely difficult because of the bureaucracy that we have to fight our way through. So late last year, we changed the name of our strategy from conversion to adaptation, and what we are trying to do now is to find places where OSB will fit into their current building practices until the acceptance of that product becomes greater. We are also attending their home building show here next month. We did the same thing last year, and we're starting to generate more interest for people that want to build frame-built housing. But currently, if you're looking at what we're selling, almost all of it is not going into construction. So that's a hard thing right now, but it's very exciting to us as we look at the home demand.

Well, if you take the run rate of December, that's what we can do this year before we start up the second line. So itâ€™s going to take us a little while to fill it out. But as youâ€™ve recognized, I mean, they have an underlying need for homes right now somewhere -- a deficit of about 6 million to 7 million, and their government has come out and said they're going to try to provide 4 million homes in the next two years, which we don't think is possible. But the stars are lining up pretty well for us there. It's just going to take a little bit of time."

Our obstacle in doing business over there has been that it's an unattractive market for us in terms of pricing. That is not the case, though, for Brazil. We probably have the opportunity with a specialty OSB product out of Brazil to maybe go to about 40 million feet over there. But that product is not being used for construction purposes. So our obstacle so far, and we keep looking at it and I keep hounding Jeff, our OSB guy, about how come we're not selling more to China. But we're just not taking bad [ph] business, and we haven't found that many opportunities where it actually was additive to our P&L for doing that. Now over time, if there is an additional uses for this product or if we can invent more specialty products which will go over there, we're certainly going to chase it when it seems to make sense.

As the moderator said, I'm Curt Stevens, the CFO. And with me today are Rick Frost our CEO; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, who are our primary Investor Relations contact. As I usually do, I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the quarter followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and then selected balance sheet items. Rick will then take over to discuss the general market environment in which we operated in the first quarter respective to the most recent operating results and some thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of the year. As we have done in the past, this call is also opened up to the public, and we're doing a webcast. And the website can be accessed at our public website. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that we'll be reviewing with my comments. I will be referencing those slides in my comments as we go through it.
We did file an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we intend to file our Form 10-Q right after this conference call.
Before I get on with my comments, I do want to remind participants about the forward-looking statement comments that is included on Slide 2 of the presentation and the discussion around the use of non-GAAP financial information that's included on Slide 3. There is an appendix attached to the presentation with some of the reconciliations and that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing that we made this morning. I'm not going to re-read these statements, but I will incorporate them with that reference.
Starting with Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the overall Q1 2011 results compared to the same quarter last year and to the prior quarter. We reported today a net loss of first quarter of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $332 million. For the same period last year, we also reported net loss of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of just under $300 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $10 million in the quarter compared to $3 million in Q1 of 2010. There was movement in the tax rate of continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q1 of this year was 23%. The primary difference between this and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate applicable to our earnings relate to state income taxes, the effect of foreign tax rates and increases of valuation allowances attributed to net operating loss carry forwards in various jurisdictions. In Q1 of 2010, the tax benefit rate was 31%, so the statutory rate blended for the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Slide 5 of the presentation is a brief discussion of some special charges we had in the quarter. As part of our ongoing review of long-lived assets held for sale, in this case, all the properties were assets held for sale, we did adjust downward the carrying values by $5.5 million to be more reflective of the value expected to derive from these assets in the future. Also in the quarter, we did settle with one of our vendors that resulted in about an $800,000 recovery of past cost. 
With that, let me talk about our segments. On Slide 6 is our OSB segment with an operating loss of $9 million in the quarter compared to $5 million operating loss in Q1 of 2010. For the quarter, we had an increase in volume of 18% but we had a lower average sales price of 5%. The decline in sales price accounted for approximately $7 million reduction in both the sales and the adjusted EBITDA. Offsetting this decrease were reductions in manufacturing costs due to the higher production volumes. Adjusted EBITDA for the continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was slightly positive to $300,000 compared to a positive $4 million in Q1 of last year. 
Slide 7 of the presentation is our Siding segment. This includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products and some OSB produced at our Hayward mill. For the first quarter, Siding had operating income of $4.7 million, significantly better than the $8.5 million the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the segment was $17.1 million compared to $13.8 million into Q1 of 2010. For the quarter, sales were up 18% for the unit volumes by 18% of SmartSide and down slightly in CanExel compared to the same quarter.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales price true up 2% due to product mix than the digital product pricing remaining relatively flat. At Siding, we did implement sales price increase that took effect on April 1 in SmartSide offset rising zinc borate and paper-related costs. CanExel prices showed an increase 18% but this was largely due to these products primarily being sold in Canada and the strength in Canadian dollar increase to U.S. equivalent sales.
Engineered Wood, at Slide 8 in the presentation. As a reminder, this is our I-Joist Laminated Strand Lumber produced in Houlton, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. This also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the AbitibiBowater JV or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q1, EWP recorded a loss of $5.5 million compared to a loss of $6.6 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in the segment was a negative $1.2 million compared to a loss of $3.1 million in Q1 of 2010. Volumes in I-Joist were down very significantly in the quarter of 35%, while volumes at the LVL were down 8% compared to the same quarter last year. We attribute this decline in volume to lower housing start and housing starts in Q1 was 10% lower than the prior year and where those housing starts were in Texas principally is a slab one grade vigilant technique that doesn't use much I-Joist.
Pricing at both I-Joist and LVL were up 8% to 9%, respectively. These were as a result of increases we put in place last year to offset higher raw material costs.
Another slide for another building products we make a few comments. This category includes our Moulding business, our Chilean and Brazilian operation and the U.S. GreenFiber joint venture plus our surplus property. Overall, we were nearly $3 million positive in the first quarter as compared to a little over break-even in the first quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased to over $6 million. Order sales were $46 million, up 11% from the $41 million recorded last year. Q1 was a good quarter of both Moulding in South America, although the U.S. GreenFiber results were down due to higher raw materials cost, primarily waste paper and pricing pressures from alternative installation products. Our SG&A cost, total SG&A was down about $2 million compared to the same quarter last year and the same was true for our general and corporate other expenses down about $2 million. 
Slide 9 of the presentation is the balance sheet. A couple of things I comment here. Cash, cash equivalent and investments and restricted cash was $362 million. Working capital was $585 million, a slight increase compared to the end of the year. Net cash was down, but it was down to do our usual seasonal build in inventory and accounts receivable. The inventory increase with respect was about a third in logs, a third in goods and a third and South American operations, which have ramped up production. 
Our accounts receivable, just as a reminder, we run bout 19 day sales outstanding. By the end of the year, we typically had only 7 days of sales in AR as we don't ship much product during the holidays. Much of this increase in working capital will come back to us in the next few quarters, particularly the loss. On the capital side, we were very parsimonious. The only about $3 million worth of capital and $2 million of that was for working capital.
Earnings per share was $9.07. A couple of other comments. I think in the fourth quarter, we did say we expected Canadian tax refund. We did not receive that in Q1 of this year, so it shows up in the receivables. But subsequently, we have received that refund. And then our auction rate securities, we did get bids from various parties on our portfolio. And as a result, we rolled up those securities by about $3.5 million in the quarter. And as you know, we are pursuing litigation against the principal issues of those instruments and hope to have some success in the future.
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

Curt, I want to thank you for that comment in calling me parsimonious. Most of the operating guys just called me cheap. It's already almost mid-May, which seems astounding that the first quarter 4 months of this year came so quickly. Beautiful here in Nashville today, we're going to see almost 90 degrees. And have Vancouver and done for game 6 tonight in our winter go home situation. 
Before I get started, I would share with you that today's call reminds me of the timing of the last investor conference that I spoke at in MontrÃ©al. The February starts number had just come out about 30 minutes before I was supposed to stand up and talk about the housing market for about an hour and February starts were I think the lowest, second lowest in recorded history at that time. So this morning's Wall Street Journal front-page article on housing isn't the best way to start my comments off.
I will begin my prepared remarks with a few comments on the building products market for Q1, make a few observations about each one of our business segments for Q1 and then end my relatively brief comments with a few current and forward-looking statements. I guess to make an understatement, Q1 provided disappointing building products activity. Unadjusted Q1 start single-family and multi-family together were almost 10% less than Q1 of 2010. And the March 2011 adjusted rate was only at the 549,000 level. Unadjusted single-family starts were down 21% from Q1 of last year at 89,000 units. Cited explanations for the whole level activity have been all over the board: severe weather, cautious lenders uncertainty about the future and unemployment, holding back the turnaround in single-family housing. But in general, I'd say it's hard to find much good news about single-family new residential construction as of yet this year.
Q1 of 2011 was without the advantage of the Home Buyer Tax Credit that was in place last year during Q1. And we started out the month of January with actually quite a bit of optimism, but that quickly faded as we've progressed through the year. So with that as the Q1 backdrop, I'll now make a few comments on LP's Q1 performance. Customarily, I'd start with safety and I'll do that again. After again winning the EPA award for being the safest company in our industry in 2010, we are off to a totally remarkable start in 2011 with a Q1 TIR of 0.20, which is over 50% better than last year's results. In terms of continuous improvement, our Lean Six Sigma teams performed well in Q1 with over 5.8 to 1 returns so far this year. And we look at these efforts that's going a long way at offsetting the raw materials increases that we are sustaining this year in mostly energy-related areas. Sales and marketing was in unadjusted housing starts now almost 10% for Q1. LP specialty product sales dollars were up almost 9% and our sales force was able to capture about 280 new wins during Q1. At this level of housing, the wins are becoming more difficult. 
For OSB, in Q1, LP's OSB operated at an effective capacity of about 67% and an overall capacity of 53%. We did sell 18% more volume in Q1 than a year ago but at an average sales price of 5% less. We entered January with random print in $200 per thousand range, but prices began to drop through February to march of the current random blueprint levels. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar has not particularly been our friend for the Canadian production that we have to sell in the U.S. And as well, we did experience some weather-related shipping issues with the Canadian net railroads, which caused some inventory problems north of the border. 
Siding continues to be our bright spot in this for building market with SmartSide sales volume up 18% in Q1 of this year compared to Q1 of last year. Our strategy of segmenting this product category is producing positive results. We're growing this product line and adding resources to this business to promote and support the growth. And we divided the Siding market into 5 segments: the retail big-box segment, the shed, non-residential, the remodeling segment, the multi-family segment and the single-family new construction segment. And we are pursuing growth in each area in an individually tailored manner.
Engineered Wood Products with new residential starts so far in the tank, as Curt mentioned. And with Engineered Wood so heavily tied to new starts, volumes of I-Joist and LVL were down and the improvements in losses quarter-to-quarter come from improvements in pricing to offset raw materials from last year and absolutely great cost control by our operations. As well, we were able to move a bit more volumes offshore. 
In South America, we continue to be pleased with our progress. Both Chile and Brazilian operations were profitable in Q1. The Chilean rebuilding activity created by last year's earthquake has begun now in earnest and both of our Chilean plants are running at full production on an annualized basis that should be somewhere around 240 million feet this year. In Brazil, we produced at an annualized rate of about 200 million square feet in Q1. Only about 10% of that production is currently going into Brazilian housing and about 25% is going into specialty exports to Asia and the rest is for general use in Brazil. We may be at a point by midyear where we decide to start the second thermal oil line at our Brazilian mill to increase the production capacity. 
Looking at Q2 and the rest of the year, it's again disappointing not to be able to see significant housing activity increase. A quick review of the revised forecast from the many forecasting services shows all revisions have occurred in a downward direction. And since at this time of reporting, it's about 622,000 single and multi-family for the year, and another 40,000 to 50,000 in manufactured housing. Q2 has started off very differently than a year ago, to say the least, when the month of April was quite robust for both OSB and Engineered Wood. As of yet, we have not felt nor experienced any spring bump in the construction activity. Our logic going into this year was that the first half of the year would be slower than the last half and the second half of this year would be stronger. The first assumption is proving true, and our visibility in the second half is not currently very clear.
Now one other item on our last call, I did offer some capital guidance for the year but said that I would adjust that amount as the year unfolded. I have done so based upon how this year started out. I am reducing our capital spending number to about $25 million plus the $22 million to $25 million for the completion of the Brazilian mill purchase. 
And with that, let me turn it back over to Curt for the question-and-answer period."

But we are encouraged and that we're up to about 10% of our product is going into building the way we build up here where a couple of years ago that was nothing. And we have a strategy to improve that every year. In the meantime, we're doing relatively well in terms of exports and then just general use of OSB for other purposes like furniture stock and concrete form, et cetera."

Engineered Wood Products I would tend to kind of agree with you in terms of we appear to be switching customers. We'll win one from someone else, and then they'll win one from us. And so some of the barriers there that we thought were tremendously important like software and the fact that it's more technical so it's harder to change out, that hasn't proved to be true. It seems to be a price game to a large degree right now in the Engineered Wood Products. And then in OSB, other than your contractual volume, the relationships are critically important in the value-added products. Our value-added products are of course a great barrier, the market-leading text yield plus our flooring products.

As the moderator said, I'm Curt Stevens, the CFO, and with me today are Rick Frost, our CEO; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, who are our primary Investor Relations contact. As I usually do, I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the quarter followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and then selected balance sheet items. Rick will then take over to discuss the general market environment in which we operated in the first quarter, his perspective on the most recent operating results and some thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of the year. As we have done in the past, this call is also opened up to the public, and we're doing a webcast, and the website can be accessed at our public website. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that we'll be reviewing with my comments. I will reference the slides in the presentation as I go through it.
We did file an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we intend to file our Form 10-Q right after this conference call.
Before I get on with my comments, I do want to remind the participants about the forward-looking statement comments that's included on Slide 2 of the presentation and the discussion around our use of non-GAAP financial information that's included on Slide 3. There is an appendix attached to the presentation with some of the reconciliations and that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing that we made this morning. I'm not going to reread these statements, but I will incorporate them without [ph]  Reference.
Starting with Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the overall Q1 2011 results compared to the same quarter last year and to the prior quarter. We reported today a net loss for the first quarter of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $332 million. For the same period last year, we also reported net loss of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of just under $300 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $10 million in the quarter compared to $3 million in Q1 of 2010. There was movement in the tax rate of continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q1 of this year was 23%. The primary difference between this and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate applicable to our earnings relate to state income taxes, the effect of foreign tax rates and increases of valuation allowances attributed to net operating loss carry forwards in various jurisdictions. In Q1 of 2010, the tax benefit rate was 31%, the statutory rate blended for the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Slide 5 of the presentation is a brief discussion of some special charges we had in the quarter. As part of our ongoing review of long-lived assets held for sale, in this case, all the properties were assets held for sale. We did adjust downward the carrying values by $5.5 million to be more reflective of the value expected to derive from these assets in the future. Also in the quarter, we did settle with one of our vendors that resulted in about an $800,000 recovery of past costs. 
With that, let me talk about our segments. On Slide 6 is our OSB segment, with an operating loss of $9 million in the quarter compared to $5 million operating loss in Q1 of 2010. For the quarter, we had an increase in volume of 18%, but we had a lower average sales price of 5%. The decline in sales price accounted for approximately $7 million reduction in both the sales and the adjusted EBITDA. Offsetting this decrease were reductions in manufacturing costs due to the higher production volumes. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was slightly positive at $300,000 compared to a positive $4 million in Q1 of last year. 
Slide 7 of the presentation is our Siding segment. This includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products and some OSB produced at our Hayward mill. For the first quarter, Siding had operating income of $4.7 million, significantly better than the $8.5 million recorded the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in this segment was $17.1 million compared to $13.8 million in Q1 of 2010. For the quarter, sales were up 18% and the unit volume is better by 18% in SmartSide and down slightly in CanExel compared to the same quarter.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales price were up 2% due to product mix, then the individual [ph] product pricing remaining relatively flat. As a side note, we did implement a sales price increase that took effect on April 1 in SmartSide offset rising zinc borate and paper-related [ph] costs. CanExel prices showed an increase of18% but this was largely due to these products primarily being sold in Canada and the strength in Canadian dollar increase to U.S. equivalent sales.
Engineered Wood, at Slide 8 in the presentation. As a reminder, this is our I-Joist Laminated Strand Lumber produced in Houlton, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. This also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi JV or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q1, EWP recorded a loss of $5.5 million compared to a loss of $6.6 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in this segment was a negative $1.2 million compared to a loss of $3.1 million in Q1 of 2010. Volumes in I-Joist were down very significantly in the quarter of 35%, while volumes at LVL/LSL were down 8% compared to the same quarter last year. We attribute this decline in volume to lower housing starts as housing starts in Q1 were 10% lower than the prior year, and where those housing starts were in Texas principally is a slab-on-grade building technique that doesn't use much I-Joist.
Pricing at both I-Joist and LVL were up 8% and 9%, respectively. These were as a result of increases we've put in place last year to offset higher raw material costs.
While there's no [ph] slide for other building products, we make a few comments. This category includes our Moulding business, our Chilean and Brazilian operations and the U.S. GreenFiber Cellulose joint venture plus our surplus property. Overall, we were nearly $3 million positive in the first quarter as compared to a little over breakeven in the first quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased to over $6 million. Order sales were $46 million, up 11% from the $41 million recorded last year. Q1 was a good quarter in both Moulding and [ph] South America, while the U.S. GreenFiber results were down due to higher raw materials cost, primarily waste paper and pricing pressures from alternative installation products. Our SG&A cost, total SG&A was down about $2 million compared to the same quarter last year, and the same was true for our general, corporate and other expenses down about $2 million. 
Slide 9 of the presentation is the balance sheet. A couple of things I comment here. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash was at $362 million. Working capital was $585 million, a slight increase compared to the end of the year. Net cash was down, but it was down due to the, our usual seasonal build in inventory and accounts receivable. The inventory increased with respect [ph] was about a third in logs, about a third in finished goods, and a third in our South American operations as we ramped up production. 
Our accounts receivable, just as a reminder, we run about 19 day sales outstanding, but at the end of the year, we typically only have 7 days of sales in AR as we don't ship much product during the holidays. Much of this increase in working capital will come back to us in the next few quarters, particularly the loss. On the capital side, we were very parsimonious. We only had about $3 million worth of capital and $2 million of that was for working capital piece value.
Book value per earnings [ph] share was $9.07. A couple of other comments. I think in the fourth quarter, we did say we expected a Canadian tax refund. We did not receive that in Q1 of this year, so it shows up in the receivables, but subsequently, we have received that refund. And then our auction rate securities, we did get bids from various parties on our portfolio, and as a result, we rolled out those securities by about $3.5 million in the quarter. And as you know, we are pursuing litigation against the principal issues of those instruments and hope to have some success in the future. With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

Curt, I want to thank you for that comment of calling me parsimonious. Most of the operating guys just called me cheap. It's already almost mid-May, which seems astounding that the first 4 months of this year have flown by so quickly. Beautiful here in Nashville today, we're going to see almost 90 degrees, and the Preds [Nashville Predators] have Vancouver in town for Game 6 tonight in a win-or-go-home situation. 
Before I get started, I would share with you that today's call reminds me of the timing of the last investor conference that I spoke at up in MontrÃ©al. The February starts number had just come out about 30 minutes before I was supposed to stand up and talk about the housing market for about an hour, and February starts were I think the lowest, second lowest in recorded history at that time. So this morning's Wall Street Journal front-page article on housing isn't the best way to start my comments off.
I will begin my prepared remarks with a few comments on the building products market for Q1, make a few observations about each one of our business segments for Q1, and then end my relatively brief comments with a few current and forward-looking statements. I guess to make an understatement, Q1 provided disappointing building products activity. Unadjusted Q1 starts single-family and multi-family together were almost 10% less than Q1 of 2010, and the March 2011 adjusted rate was only at the 549,000 level. Unadjusted single-family starts were down 21% from Q1 of last year at 89,000 units. Cited explanations for the low-level activity have been all over the board: severe weather, cautious lenders, uncertainty about the future and unemployment, holding back the turnaround in single-family housing, but in general, I'd say it's hard to find much good news about single-family new residential construction as of yet this year.
Q1 of 2011 was without the advantage of the Home Buyer's Tax Credit that was in place last year during Q1, and we started out the month of January with actually quite a bit of optimism, but that quickly faded as we've progressed through the year. So with that as the Q1 backdrop, I'll now make a few comments on LP's Q1 performance. Customarily, I'd start with safety and I'll do that again. After again winning the APA award for being the safest company in our industry in 2010, we are off to a totally remarkable start in 2011 with a Q1 TIR of 0.20, which is over 50% better than last year's results. In terms of continuous improvement, our Lean Six Sigma teams performed well in Q1 with over 5.8 to 1 returns so far this year, and we look at these efforts that's going a long way at offsetting the raw materials increases that we are sustaining this year in mostly energy-related areas. Sales and marketing within unadjusted housing starts down almost 10% for Q1, LP specialty product sales dollars were up almost 9%, and our sales force was able to capture about 280 new wins during Q1. At this level of housing, the wins are becoming more difficult. 
For OSB in Q1, LP's OSB operated at an effective capacity of about 67% and an overall capacity of 53%. We did sell 18% more volume in Q1 than a year ago but at an average sales price of 5% less. We entered January with random print in a $200 per thousand range, but prices began to drop through February to March to the current random blueprint levels. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar has not particularly been our friend for the Canadian production that we have to sell in the U.S., and as well, we did experience some weather-related shipping issues with the Canadian railroads, which caused some inventory problems north of the border. 
Siding continues to be our bright spot in this poor building market, with SmartSide sales volume up 18% in Q1 of this year compared to Q1 of last year. Our strategy of segmenting this product category is producing positive results. We're growing this product line and adding resources to this business to promote and support the growth. We've divided the Siding market into 5 segments: the Retail Big-box segment, the Shed Nonresidential, the Remodeling segment, the Multi-family segment and the Single-family New Construction segment, and we are pursuing growth in each area in an individually tailored manner.
Engineered Wood Products with new residential starts so far in the tank, as Curt mentioned, and with Engineered Wood so heavily tied to new starts, volumes of I-Joist and LVL were down and the improvements in losses quarter-to-quarter come from improvements in pricing to offset raw materials from last year and absolutely great cost control by our operations. As well, we were able to move a bit more volumes offshore. 
In South America, we continue to be pleased with our progress. Both Chilean and Brazilian operations were profitable in Q1. The Chilean rebuilding activity created by last year's earthquake has begun now in earnest, and both of our Chilean plants are running at full production on an annualized basis that should be somewhere around 240 million feet this year. In Brazil, we produced at an annualized rate of about 200 million square feet in Q1. Only about 10% of that production is currently going into Brazilian housing and about 25% is going into specialty exports to Asia and the rest is for general use in Brazil. We may be at a point by midyear where we decide to start the second thermal oil line at our Brazilian mill to increase the production capacity. 
Looking at Q2 and the rest of the year, it's again disappointing not to be able to see significant housing activity increase. A quick review of the revised forecast from the many forecasting services shows all revisions have occurred in a downward direction, and since at this time of reporting, it's about 622,000 single- and multi-family for the year, and another 40,000 to 50,000 in manufactured housing. Q2 has started off very differently than a year ago, to say the least, when the month of April was quite robust for both OSB and Engineered Wood. As of yet, we have not felt nor experienced any spring bump in the construction activity. Our logic going into this year was that the first half of the year would be slower than the last half, and the second half of this year would be stronger. The first assumption is proving true, and our visibility in the second half is not currently very clear.
One other item on our last call, I did offer some capital guidance for the year but said that I would adjust that amount as the year unfolded. I have done so based upon how this year has started out. I am reducing our capital spending number to about $25 million plus the $22 million to $25 million for the completion of the Brazilian mill purchase. And with that, let me turn it back over to Curt for the question-and-answer period."

I think overall, the impact in terms of probably your reference point around if there's like hurricanes, the price of OSB jumps, we have seen surprisingly little impact from the different weather occurrences and tragedies that have occurred around overall, which means that number one, it's early on the back-end of those; but number 2, the distribution channel has been able to handle that. So the overall impact has been relatively small. In terms of the impact on us specifically, we lost 10 days at the Hanceville mill due to a power outage, and then we lost about 4 or 5 days up in Maniwaki due to some weather-related stuff up there, but that's been the only impact on our inability to produce."

The first part of that question is based on what you're seeing out in the market.

One is that that will continue to stay at about the level it is now because at least in the near-end recovery of housing, you're going to see more starter homes because that's where the greatest pent-up demand is going to be. So you're seeing about somewhere around a 9% reduction in the amount of square feet for a start. The other camp says that more of the houses that are going to be built in the next couple of years are going to be houses that are built from the wealth effect, if you will, the money that's been made in the stock market over the last couple of years. And so that will actually offset and drive the average start for home up, which is not necessarily a good thing since that means that there's fewer homes being built. I don't know exactly how that's going to sugar out but I don't anticipate it -- my own opinion is I don't anticipate a drop in more than another 50 to 60 feet and then it's going to turn around and slowly start back up."

Now it's not doing great in the bear market, and my question is, do you think it's going to look materially different as we get into the bull market? Obviously it would be better now.

Those people, once they take our product are not switching back. Engineered Wood Products I would tend to kind of agree with you in terms of we appear to be switching customers. We'll win one from someone else and then they'll win one from us. And so some of the barriers there that we thought were tremendously important like software and the fact that it's more technical so it's harder to change out, that hasn't proved to be true.

Rick will then take over to discuss the general market environment in which we operated in the first quarter, his perspective on the most recent operating results and some thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of the year. 
As we have done in the past, this call is also opened up to the public, and we're doing a webcast, and the website can be accessed at our public website. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that we'll be reviewing with my comments. I will reference the slides in the presentation as I go through it.
We did file an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we intend to file our Form 10-Q right after this conference call.
Before I get on with my comments, I do want to remind the participants about the forward-looking statement comments that's included on Slide 2 of the presentation and the discussion around our use of non-GAAP financial information that's included on Slide 3. There is an appendix attached to the presentation with some of the reconciliations and that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing that we made this morning. I'm not going to reread these statements, but I will incorporate them without [ph]  reference.
Starting with Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the overall Q1 2011 results compared to the same quarter last year and to the prior quarter. We reported today a net loss for the first quarter of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $332 million. For the same period last year, we also reported net loss of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations just under $300 million.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a positive $10 million in the quarter compared to $3 million in Q1 of 2010. There was movement in the tax rate of continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate in Q1 of this year was 23%. The primary difference between this and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate applicable to our earnings relate to state income taxes, the effect of foreign tax rates and increases of valuation allowances attributed to net operating loss carry forwards in various jurisdictions. In Q1 of 2010, the tax benefit rate was 31%, the statutory rate blended for the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Slide 5 of the presentation is a brief discussion of some special charges we had in the quarter. As part of our ongoing review of long-lived assets held for sale, in this case, all the properties were assets held for sale. We did adjust downward the carrying values by $5.5 million to be more reflective of the value expected to derive from these assets in the future. Also in the quarter, we did settle with one of our vendors that resulted in about an $800,000 recovery of past costs. 
With that, let me talk about our segments. On Slide 6 is our OSB segment, with an operating loss of $9 million in the quarter compared to $5 million operating loss in Q1 of 2010. For the quarter, we had an increase in volume of 18%, but we had a lower average sales price of 5%. The decline in sales price accounted for approximately $7 million reduction in both the sales and the adjusted EBITDA. Offsetting this decrease were reductions in manufacturing costs due to the higher production volumes. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was slightly positive at $300,000 compared to a positive $4 million in Q1 of last year. 
Slide 7 of the presentation is our Siding segment. This includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products and some OSB produced at our Hayward mill. For the first quarter, Siding had operating income of $4.7 million, significantly better than the $8.5 million recorded the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in this segment was $17.1 million compared to $13.8 million in Q1 of 2010. For the quarter, sales were up 18% and the unit volume is better by 18% in SmartSide and down slightly in CanExel compared to the same quarter.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales price were up 2% due to product mix, then the individual [ph] product pricing remaining relatively flat. As a side note, we did implement a sales price increase that took effect on April 1 in SmartSide offset rising zinc borate and paper-related [ph] costs. CanExel prices showed an increase of18% but this was largely due to these products primarily being sold in Canada and the strength in Canadian dollar increase to U.S. equivalent sales.
Engineered Wood, at Slide 8 in the presentation. As a reminder, this is our I-Joist Laminated Strand Lumber produced in Houlton, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. This also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi JV or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q1, EWP recorded a loss of $5.5 million compared to a loss of $6.6 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in this segment was a negative $1.2 million compared to a loss of $3.1 million in Q1 of 2010. Volumes in I-Joist were down very significantly in the quarter of 35%, while volumes of LVL/LSL were down 8% compared to the same quarter last year. We attribute this decline in volume to lower housing starts as housing starts in Q1 were 10% lower than the prior year, and where those housing starts were in Texas principally is a slab-on-grade building technique that doesn't use much I-Joist.
Pricing at both I-Joist and LVL were up 8% and 9%, respectively. These were as a result of increases we've put in place last year to offset higher raw material costs.
While there's no [ph] slide for other building products, let me make a few comments. This category includes our Moulding business, our Chilean and Brazilian operations and the U.S. GreenFiber Cellulose joint venture plus our surplus property. Overall, we were nearly $3 million positive in the first quarter as compared to a little over breakeven in the first quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased to over $6 million. Order sales were $46 million, up 11% from the $41 million recorded last year. Q1 was a good quarter in both Moulding and [ph] South America, while the U.S. GreenFiber results were down due to higher raw materials cost, primarily waste paper and pricing pressures from alternative installation products. Our SG&A cost, total SG&A was down about $2 million compared to the same quarter last year, and the same was true for our general, corporate and other expenses down about $2 million. 
Slide 9 of the presentation is the balance sheet. A couple of things I comment here. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash was at $362 million. Working capital was $585 million, a slight increase compared to the end of the year. Net cash was down, but it was down due to the, our usual seasonal build in inventory and accounts receivable. The inventory increased with respect [ph] was about a third in logs, about a third in finished goods, and a third in our South American operations as we ramped up production. 
Our accounts receivable, just as a reminder, we run about 19 day sales outstanding, but at the end of the year, we typically only have 7 days of sales in AR as we don't ship much product during the holidays. Much of this increase in working capital will come back to us in the next few quarters, particularly the loss. On the capital side, we were very parsimonious. We only had about $3 million worth of capital and $2 million of that was for working capital piece value [ph].
Book value per earnings [ph] share was $9.07. A couple of other comments. I think in the fourth quarter, we did say we expected a Canadian tax refund. We did not receive that in Q1 of this year, so it shows up in the receivables, but subsequently, we have received that refund. And then our auction rate securities, we did get bids from various parties on our portfolio, and as a result, we rolled out those securities by about $3.5 million in the quarter. And as you know, we are pursuing litigation against the principal issues of those instruments and hope to have some success in the future. With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

We appreciate you listening in. Curt, I want to thank you for that comment of calling me parsimonious. Most of the operating guys just called me cheap.

Curt, I want to thank you for that comment of calling me parsimonious. Most of the operating guys just called me cheap. It's already almost mid-May, which seems astounding that the first 4 months of this year have flown by so quickly. It's beautiful here in Nashville today, we're going to see almost 90 degrees, and the Preds [Nashville Predators] have Vancouver in town for Game 6 tonight in a win-or-go-home situation. 
Before I get started, I would share with you that today's call reminds me of the timing of the last investor conference that I spoke at up in MontrÃ©al. The February starts number had just come out about 30 minutes before I was supposed to stand up and talk about the housing market for about an hour, and February starts where I think the lowest, second lowest in recorded history at that time. So this morning's Wall Street Journal front-page article on housing isn't the best way to start my comments off.
I will begin my prepared remarks with a few comments on the building products market for Q1, make a few observations about each one of our business segments for Q1, and then end my relatively brief comments with a few current and forward-looking statements. I guess to make an understatement, Q1 provided disappointing building products activity. Unadjusted Q1 starts single-family and multi-family together were almost 10% less than Q1 of 2010, and the March 2011 adjusted rate was only at the 549,000 level. Unadjusted single-family starts were down 21% from Q1 of last year at 89,000 units. Cited explanations for the low-level activity have been all over the board: severe weather, cautious lenders, uncertainty about the future and unemployment, holding back the turnaround in single-family housing, but in general, I'd say it's hard to find much good news about single-family new residential construction as of yet this year.
Q1 of 2011 was without the advantage of the Home Buyer's Tax Credit that was in place last year during Q1, and we started out the month of January with actually quite a bit of optimism, but that quickly faded as we've progressed through the year. So with that as the Q1 backdrop, I'll now make a few comments on LP's Q1 performance. Customarily, I'd start with safety and I'll do that again. After again winning the APA award for being the safest company in our industry in 2010, we are off to a totally remarkable start in 2011 with a Q1 TIR of 0.20, which is over 50% better than last year's results. In terms of continuous improvement, our Lean Six Sigma teams performed well in Q1 with over 5.8:1 return so far this year, and we look at these efforts that's going a long way at offsetting the raw materials increases that we are sustaining this year in mostly energy-related areas. Sales and marketing within unadjusted housing starts down almost 10% for Q1, LP specialty product sales dollars were up almost 9%, and our sales force was able to capture about 280 new wins during Q1. At this level of housing, the wins are becoming more difficult. 
For OSB in Q1, LP's OSB operated at an effective capacity of about 67% and an overall capacity of 53%. We did sell 18% more volume in Q1 than a year ago but at an average sales price of 5% less. We entered January with random print in a $200 per thousand range, but prices began to drop through February and March to the current random blueprint levels. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar has not particularly been our friend for the Canadian production that we have to sell in the U.S., and as well, we did experience some weather-related shipping issues with the Canadian railroads, which caused some inventory problems north of the border. 
Siding continues to be our bright spot in this poor building market, with SmartSide sales volume up 18% in Q1 of this year compared to Q1 of last year. Our strategy of segmenting this product category is producing positive results. We're growing this product line and adding resources to this business to promote and support the growth. We've divided the Siding market into 5 segments: the Retail Big-box segment, the Shed Nonresidential, the Remodeling segment, the Multi-family segment and the Single-family New Construction segment, and we are pursuing growth in each area in an individually tailored manner.
Engineered Wood Products with new residential starts so far in the tank, as Curt mentioned, and with Engineered Wood so heavily tied to new starts, volumes of I-Joist and LVL were down and the improvements in losses quarter-to-quarter come from improvements in pricing to offset raw materials from last year and absolutely great cost control by our operations. As well, we were able to move a bit more volumes offshore. 
In South America, we continue to be pleased with our progress. Both Chilean and Brazilian operations were profitable in Q1. The Chilean rebuilding activity created by last year's earthquake has begun now in earnest, and both of our Chilean plants are running at full production on an annualized basis that should be somewhere around 240 million feet this year. In Brazil, we produced at an annualized rate of about 200 million square feet in Q1. Only about 10% of that production is currently going into Brazilian housing and about 25% is going into specialty exports to Asia and the rest is for general use in Brazil. We may be at a point by midyear where we decide to start the second thermal oil line at our Brazilian mill to increase the production capacity. 
Looking at Q2 and the rest of the year, it's again disappointing not to be able to see significant housing activity increase. A quick review of the revised forecast from the many forecasting services shows all revisions have occurred in a downward direction, and since it's at this time of reporting, it's about 622,000 single- and multi-family for the year, and another 40,000 to 50,000 in manufactured housing. 
Q2 has started off very differently than a year ago, to say the least, when the month of April was quite robust for both OSB and Engineered Wood. As of yet, we have not felt nor experienced any spring bump in the construction activity. Our logic going into this year was that the first half of the year would be slower than the last half, and the second half of this year would be stronger. The first assumption is proving true, and our visibility in the second half is not currently very clear.
One other item on our last call, I did offer some capital guidance for the year but said that I would adjust that amount as the year unfolded. I have done so based upon how this year has started out. I am reducing our capital spending number to about $25 million plus the $22 million to $25 million for the completion of the Brazilian mill purchase. And with that, let me turn it back over to Curt for the question-and-answer period."

One is that that will continue to stay at about the level it is now because at least in the near-end recovery of housing, you're going to see more starter homes because that's where the greatest pent-up demand is going to be. So you're seeing about somewhere around a 9% reduction in the amount of square feet for a start. The other camp says that more of the houses that are going to be built in the next couple of years are going to be houses that are built from the wealth effect, if you will, the money that's been made in the stock market over the last couple of years. And so that will actually offset and drive the average start for home up, which is not necessarily a good thing since that means that there's fewer homes being built. I don't know exactly how that's going to sugar out but I don't anticipate it -- my own opinion is I don't anticipate a drop in more than another 50 to 60 feet and then it's going to turn around and slowly start back up."

And then the second question on Engineered Wood Products. If I leave aside I-Joist, Engineered Wood Products wasn't doing all that great in the bull market. Now it's not doing great in the bear market, and my question is, do you think it's going to look materially different as we get into the bull market? Obviously, it would be better now.

We'll win one from someone else and then they'll win one from us. 
And so some of the barriers there that we thought were tremendously important like software and the fact that it's more technical so it's harder to change out, that hasn't proved to be true.

And then, I'll turn it over to Rick, who will discuss the general market environment, which we operated last quarter, his perspective on our operating results and some thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2012.
As we have done in the past, weâ€™ve opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. This can be accessed at our public website, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion today is a presentation that we sent out with the release, and I will be referencing those pages as I go through my comments.
We've also filed an 8-K with supplemental information that will help with the understanding of this material and we expect to file our Form 10-Q later this afternoon.
Before I start, I want to remind you about the forward-looking statements, comments that's included on Slide 2 of the presentation and also on Slide 3 is a discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information. I'm not going to read either 1 of those but I am going to incorporate it by this reference. One final thing before I get to the numbers, I want to put this in context. I want to put it in a context of what housing has done in the second quarter and also in the backdrop of OSB pricing. In the first half of 2010, we believe that the government provided housing incentives did have a positive impact on both the actual and perceived activity in the quarter. As a result, we did see increased product demand in Q2 of last year and enjoyed favorable OSB pricing, particularly in the second quarter. The first half of this year started out with some degree of optimism in January and February, but this quickly faded with the adverse weather conditions across the country, lackluster housing demand in numbers and slowness in the retail sector. This affected the demand for building products, in both the first quarter and the second quarter and had an extremely adverse affect on our pricing for OSB. The bottom line in Q2 housing starts were down 4% year-over-year, and random links reported at average OSB pricing based on the benchmark North Central 716 declined by 42% or $123 a thousand. This affected LP's overall sales and operating earnings by $75 million, just due to the change in OSB pricing. With that as backdrop, let me talk about the earnings. We go to Slide 4 of the presentation. This is our earnings summary. We are reporting today a net loss for the second quarter of $35 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $363 million for the quarter. For the same quarter last year, we reported income of $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $448 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $7 million compared to income of $75 million in Q2 of 2010. There was movement in the tax rate, continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate at continuing operations in Q2 2001 was 20%, very similar to Q1. As we discussed last quarter, this is primarily related to the requirement of the valuation allowance against the use of certain of our losses in various jurisdictions above a specific threshold, and this is all due to the accounting rules. Compounding this is the discontinued operations we were required to use the statutory benefit rate of 38.7 which results in a slightly lower tax benefit rate on continuing operations. I'll talk about this in a minute, but that affected if you used a more normalized rate, that would have improved or lower the loss by about $0.04 to $0.05. In Q2 of last year, the tax benefit rate was 35%, which was the statutory rate blended for our various foreign pieces. Slide 5 of the presentation is to discuss the year-to-date results. For the year, we're reporting a net loss for the first 6 months of $59 million or $0.45 per share from net sales from continuing operations of about $700 million. For the same period last year, we reported breakeven results on sales from continuing operations of $745 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the 6 months was a positive $3 million compared to a positive $76 million in the first half of last year. The tax rate, as we discussed, was a little bit unique. On Slide 6 of the presentation is a reconciliation of special charges. We did take additional impairments principally on assets held for sale, about $2.5 million to adjust those book values to what we expect to receive in these future transactions. In the other operating charges and credits, there were 2 items a positive adjustment to a civil culture reserve and an increase in an environmental reserve that netted to a favorable $600,000. Without these items, earnings per share would have been a loss of $0.24 a share. We also used a more normalized tax benefit rate or EPS would have been a loss of $0.19 a share, relatively close to the $0.16 loss within the first call consensus.
Let me turn to the segments on Slide 7 of the presentation is OSB. We did have an operating loss of $23 million in the quarter compared to $48 million of income in Q2 of 2010. For the quarter, we had a 4% increase in volume, within lower average sales price of 36%. The decline in the sales price accounted for virtually all of that change in EBITDA of $71 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment was a loss of $13 million compared to a positive $58 million, again that same $71 million that we've talked about attributable to pricing. Year-to-date, OSB had a loss of $32 million compared to income of $43 million the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was a negative $13 million in 2011 compared to positive $62 million in 2010. Pricing was down 25% between the 2 years and accounted for almost all of this difference. Slide 8 of the presentation is our Siding segment. This includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products and also includes commodity OSB produced in our Hayward siding mill. Our operating income in this segment was $11.3 million, it was worst than the $22 million reported in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in the second was $15.3 million compared to $27.4 million. For the quarter, sales were down 9%, with the unit volumes down 8% in SmartSide and down 6% in CanExel, compared to the same quarter last year. The change in OSB pricing in this segment affected both sales and earnings by about $4.5 million.
For the quarter, our SmartSide average sales price was up 2% and that was due to a price increase that we put in on April 1. This was put in place to offset rising zinc, borate and paper overlay costs. Our CanExel prices has shown increase of 22%, but this is largely due to CanExel primarily being sold in Canada and the strengthening Canadian dollar increase to U.S. equivalent sales price. Year-to-date, signing at operating income of $24 million through the first 2 quarters compared to $30 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $32 million in 2011 and $41 million during the same period last year, with most of that change being the OSB pricing. Engineered Wood is Slide 9 in the presentation. Just as a reminder, this includes our I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber and our LVL products. It also includes sales from 2 of our joint venture mills with Abitibi and a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q2, EWP recorded a loss of a little over $3 million compared to a loss of about $4.5 million in Q2 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was breakeven in the quarter compared to a loss of $600,000 in Q2 2010. Volumes for I-Joist were down significantly to 29% while the combination of LVL and LSL were down slightly compared to same quarter last year. We attribute this decline to lower housing starts, as well as an increase in the multi-family versus single-family for which EWP is uses more product. Pricing was up 3% and 2%, respectively. These increases were result of price adjustments that we made last year to offset higher raw material costs. Year-to-date, the operating loss in EWP improved to a $9 million loss compared to an $11 million loss and adjusted EBITDA was just over $1 million compared to a loss of $4 million in the same period last year.
While there is no Slide for other building products, let me make a few comments. Overall, there's $2.2 million positive in the second quarter compared to about $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.5 million versus $6.5 million in 2010. Sales were up 5% to $50 million in the quarter, and then year-to-date, our other building products and operating income a little over $5 million compared to just short of $4 million last year. On total, sales, general and administrative costs are $28 million for the quarter, down about $1 million from the same quarter last year and the general corporate piece of that cost were $2 million lower than last year. On a year-to-date basis were down about $3 million in total SG&A from the same period last year. Slide 10 of the presentation is balance sheet. Some key balance sheet specifics there. We did have cash and investments of $368 million at the end of June. That was an increase of about $6 million from the end of March. Working capital is about $550 million, a net cash position of $140 million. This is down from the end of the year of by $70 million, $55 million of which is an increase in working capital for inventory and receivables that is based on seasonal activity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were at $8 million and book value per earning share was $8.88. A few other comments before I turn it to Rick. In the quarter, we did purchase the remaining 25 interest -- 25% interest in our LP Brazil mill, that was a price of about $24 million. The accounting for this minority interest is a bit complex, but basically the difference between the purchase price we paid and the non-controlling interest that we had on our balance sheet already, went through other comprehensive income. This showed up as additional equity for LP Corp. as an investing versus a financing activity on the cash flow statement. Other than the cash flow that went out, there was no impact on LP's financial statements in terms of this working capital. On our auction rate securities, we did have a slight increase in the value of the outright security that we recorded at the end of Q2. We do continue to pursue the litigation filed against the principal issuers of these instruments. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did sell all but the collateralized debt obligation portfolio -- portion of our portfolio and we've got net proceeds of that of about $19 million. So in Q3, we will recognize a gain of about $14 million associated with these ARS sales. With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

I realized there are a lot of competing news releases today, plus a lot of national suspense. On top of that, we just completed our Board of Directors meeting here at noon. So Curt",1427,"Good afternoon, everybody, and we do appreciate your interest in our call. I realized there are a lot of competing news releases today, plus a lot of national suspense. On top of that, we just completed our Board of Directors meeting here at noon. So Curt was kind enough to -- Kirk and his people were kind enough to get us ready for this call for this afternoon for a bit of a personal indulgence to me, I plan to escape to Maine this evening to spend some vacation time with my family, and so I'm looking forward to that and instead of waiting until next week, I getaway this evening. I'm going to begin my prepared remarks with an overview of some thoughts on Q2 and the market. I think that it's no secret, it's been well publicized that spring did come late across the U.S. and Canada and because of that, what building activity that did take place in Q2 started late. I think, if I couple this with the sense that we and our customers begin the year with a little bit more optimism and a little bit more wood, Q2 was not only slow in activity but we found our customers soon trying to conserve their cash and bleed done what inventories they had on hand during Q2. That was not a combination, that was terribly conducive to robust sales from our manufacturing facilities. I think we suffered all quarter from this combination across all 3 businesses and then judging from the performance of random link print of OSB prices, there appeared to be more wood on the market than there was demand for it. Along with U.S. starts being down 4% Q2 to Q2, the Canadian starts were also slowed by the late onset of spring and also forecast for Canada are projecting that Canada will be off 5% to 10% from last year in starts. I'll now direct a few comments towards what we did in the businesses, I usually begin with safety, I'll start there. We had extraordinary quarter operating safely at LP and year-to-date, our Osha TIR was down to 0.2 at the end of the second quarter. That is our best performance in LP's 38-year history and of special note as of today, our OSB business, the entire combination of all the mills has a string of 310 consecutive days without a recordable accident. Our continuous improvement engine of Lean Six Sigma continues to help us improve operations and partially offset raw material increases with a year-to-date return of over 6:1, so even in these market conditions, our folks continue to find significant improvement projects to work on. I usually talk to you about wins. Wins, if you remember, is defined as a product placement with the new customer or an additional product placement with an existing customer. We did quite well in Q2, our sales force received 538 new wins during Q2, which is almost 10% more than Q2 of 2010. Almost 20% of these wins were in our LSL product line, but I will admit that these wins are tougher to get and the wins are smaller as we stay at the bottom of this housing cycle. In our OSB segment, it was a tough Q2 as we watched, I think any enthusiasm that we had for a spring bounce in building activity fade away, and we experienced random prints steadily declining. LP's effective operating rate for Q2 was at 70%, which was only 3% higher than in Q1. And as Curt related, poor pricing and poor demand were pretty much the story there. Siding, if you're remember Q2 of last year was our best second quarter during what I'll call, the down years, and when we compare Q2 of this year to Q2 of 2010, we see about $10 million less in EBIT, I think the difference can be explained most simply by saying it was in 3 major areas. About $4.5 million of that was in the price and volume of the OSB that is sold out of our Hayward siding mill, about $4 million increase in our raw materials and we had warn you of that early in the year, around zinc borate and our overlay paper and then the other $2 million was related to the decrease in siding volume quarter-to-. Unit volume sales in SmartSide were off from Q2 of last year, about 8% but all in all still not a bad quarter for siding. Engineered Wood Products pretty much tread water financially in Q2, with overall sales being down a couple of million from last year but that was offset by some operated improvements to yield an overall break even in adjusted EBITDA. Year-to-date, we are ahead on LSL sales volumes by about 100,000 cubic meters. A few comments about South America, Chile continues to be a bright spot for us as both mills are operating at full capacity. About 87% of the product that we make in Chile is now being consumed in Chile and we are growing exports also to Argentina and Colombia. Chile is EBIT positive and a cash generator. Brazil's big news as Curt mentioned, is that we now own 100% of the Ponta Grossa mill. It's now EBIT positive and cash positive. We're producing about 16,000 cubic meters per month on 1 thermal oil line at that facility and we expect that sometime during the second half of this year, we will have to face the decision of starting up the second thermal oil line. Which may be of interest to you, we are exporting about 35% of the OSB volume made in Brazil, and the lion's share of that is going to China for non-structural uses. We are finding it a slow process to gain code approval to break in to Brazilian housing and we're working right now on wall and roof approval. In the meantime, we will be looking to see if there are additional countries that have attractive export situations.
As I look forward, I think back over the last few conferences that I've been to and as many of you have heard me say, we put our operating plan together for 2011 based upon an expectation of 700,000 starts all in. That was based upon the belief that the first half of this year would be slower than the first half of last year, but that the second half of this year would be stronger than the second half of last year. I guess, as I look at that, I'd say we got it half right. The first half of this year was definitely slower than last year but it doesn't look to me like the second half of this year is going to be much stronger. Right now, I think that we'll be fortunate to end the year at about 625,000 starts all in, in the U.S. So that's the guidance that I recently offered our LP folks, in terms of driving how they're going to do their spending, make their inventory decisions and their operating assumptions. As I look forward, most of the forecasted updates that we have related to 2012 are around that 700,000 number. There has been a little good news lately that the impact from foreclosures may not be quite as bad as the gloom and doom that was being spread to there, but I still think it comes back to having more certainty of an economic rebound needed by the general consumer and then how soon the country can get back to job creation. I feel pretty confident now that our capital expenditures for 2011 will not exceed the $20 million mark plus the $24.5 million that Curt mentioned in the completion of the Brazil mill purchase. And in terms of what's going on right now, OSB pricing particularly in the West is quite low, since we supply most of that volume from Canada, the 1.05, 1.06 Canadian dollar is quite problematic for us. In Siding, Canada has slowed a bit but our U.S. order file has recovered over Q2 levels and at Engineered Wood, distribution volume has built up in Australia, which is where we are exporting quite a bit of material and that's going to put us in a bit of a bind on our West Coast LVL volume. South American activity remains quite strong into the winter and the North American channel feels very, very lean right now. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Curt to run the Q&A."

Last quarter, we moved about 5 million feet out of North America to Asia. Admittedly at very lousy pricing. Most of that product did go to Korea, I am hopeful that we will start being able to put OSB from North America into China but the gain that we have to accomplish there is we have to try to strategically position that product in China where it's good business not just take a refuse business which means we have to try to position that's strategically into the housing market.

I know it's been a busy day for many of you.

I know it's been a busy day for many of you. As the moderator said, I'm Curt Stevens, the CFO; and with me today is Rick Frost, our CEO; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, who are primary Investor Relations contacts.
As I usually do, I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the quarter and then I will follow that with some comments of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. Then I'll turn it over to Rick, who will discuss the general market environment in which we operated last quarter, his perspective on our operating results and some thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2012. As we have done in the past, weâ€™ve opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And this can be accessed at our public website, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion today is a presentation that we sent out with the release, and I will be referencing those pages as I go through my comments. We've also filed an 8-K with supplemental information that will help with the understanding of this material, and we expect to file our Form 10-Q later this afternoon.
And again, before I start, I want to remind you about the forward-looking statement comment that's included on Slide 2 of the presentation, and also, on Slide 3 is a discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information. I'm not going to read either one of those, but I am going to incorporate it by this reference. One final thing before I get to the numbers, I want to put this in context. I want to put it in a context of what housing has done in the second quarter and also in the backdrop of OSB pricing. In the first half of 2010, we believe that the government-provided housing incentives did have a positive impact on both the actual and perceived activity in the quarter. As a result, we did see increased product demand in Q2 of last year and enjoyed favorable OSB pricing, particularly in the second quarter. The first half of this year started out with some degree of optimism, in January and February, but this quickly faded with the adverse weather conditions across the country, lackluster housing demand in numbers and slowness in the retail sector. This affected the demand for building products, in both the first quarter and the second quarter, and had an extremely adverse affect on our pricing for OSB. The bottom line, in Q2, housing starts were down 4% year-over-year, and Random Lengths reported that average OSB pricing, based on the benchmark North Central 7/16s, declined by 42% or $123 a thousand. This affected LP's overall sales and operating earnings by $75 million, just due to the change in OSB pricing.
With that as backdrop, let me talk about the earnings. If you go to Slide 4 of the presentation, this is our earnings summary. We are reporting, today, a net loss for the second quarter of $35 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $363 million for the quarter. For the same quarter last year, we reported income of $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $448 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $7 million compared to income of $75 million in Q2 of 2010. There was movement in the tax rate on continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate at continuing operations in Q2 2001 was 20%, very similar to Q1. As we discussed last quarter, this is primarily related to the requirement of the valuation allowance against the use of certain of our losses in various jurisdictions above a specific threshold, and this is all due to the accounting rules. Compounding this is in the discontinued operations, we were required to use the statutory benefit rate of 38.7% which results in a slightly lower tax benefit rate on continuing operations. I'll talk about this in a minute, but that affected -- if you used a more normalized rate, that would have improved or lowered the loss by about $0.04 to $0.05. In Q2 of last year, the tax benefit rate was 35%, which was the statutory rate blended for our various foreign pieces.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discuss of year-to-date results. For the year, we're reporting a net loss, for the first 6 months, of $59 million or $0.45 per share on net sales from continuing operations of about $700 million. For the same period last year, we reported breakeven results on sales from continuing operations of $745 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the 6 months was a positive $3 million compared to a positive $76 million in the first half of last year. And the tax rate, as we've discussed, was a little bit unique.
On Slide 6 of the presentation is a reconciliation of special charges. We did take additional impairment, principally on assets held for sale, of about $2.5 million to adjust those book values to what we expect to receive in these future transactions. In the other operating charges and credits, there were 2 items, a positive adjustment to a civil culture reserve and an increase in an environmental reserve that netted to a favorable $600,000. Without these items, earnings per share would have been a loss of $0.24 a share. If we also used a more normalized tax benefit rate, our EPS would have been a loss of $0.19 a share, relatively close to the $0.16 loss, it is the first call consensus.
Let me turn to the segments, on Slide 7 of the presentation is OSB. We did have an operating loss of $23 million in the quarter compared to $48 million of income in Q2 of 2010. For the quarter, we had a 4% increase in volume, with a lower average sales price of 36%. The decline in the sales price accounted for virtually all of that change in EBITDA of $71 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment was a loss of $13 million compared to a positive $58 million, again that same $71 million that we've talked about, attributable to pricing. Year-to-date, OSB had a loss of $32 million compared to income of $43 million the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was a negative $13 million in 2011 compared to a positive $62 million in 2010. Pricing was down 25% between the 2 years and accounted for almost all of this difference.
Slide 8 of the presentation, our Siding segment. This includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products and also includes commodity OSB produced in our Hayward siding mill. Operating income in this segment, $11.3 million, it was worse than the $22 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in the segment was $15.3 million compared to $27.4 million. For the quarter, sales were down 9%, with the unit volumes down 8% of the SmartSide and down 6% in CanExel compared to the same quarter last year. The change in OSB pricing in this segment affected both sales and earnings by about $4.5 million.
For the quarter, our SmartSide average sales price was up 2% and that was due to a price increase that we put in on April 1. This was put in place to offset rising zinc borate and paper overlay costs. Our CanExel prices has show increase of 22%, but this is largely due to CanExel primarily being sold in Canada and the strengthening Canadian dollar increase to U.S. equivalent of the sales price. Year-to-date, signing and operating income of $24 million through the first 2 quarters compared to $30 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $32 million in 2011 and $41 million during the same period last year, with most of that change being the OSB pricing.
Engineered Wood, in Slide 9 of the presentation. Just as a reminder, this includes our I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber and our LVL products. It also includes sales from 2 of our joint venture mills, with Abitibi, and a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q2, EWP recorded a loss of a little over $3 million compared to a loss of about $4.5 million in Q2 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was breakeven in the quarter compared to a loss of $600,000 in Q2 2010. Volumes for I-Joist were down significantly, 29%, while the combination of LVL and LSL were down slightly compared to same quarter last year. We attribute this decline to lower housing starts, as well as an increase in the multi-family versus single-family for which EWP uses more product. Pricing was up 3% and 2%, respectively. These increases were a result of the price adjustments that we made last year to offset higher raw material cost. Year-to-date, the operating loss in EWP improved to a $9 million loss compared to an $11 million loss and adjusted EBITDA was just over $1 million compared to a loss of $4 million in the same period last year.
While there is no Slide for other building products, let me make a few comments. Overall, it was $2.2 million positive in the second quarter compared to about $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.5 million versus $6.5 million in 2010. Sales were up 5% to $50 million in the quarter. And then year-to-date, our other building products and operating income, a little over $5 million compared to just short of $4 million last year. On total, sales, general and administrative costs are $28 million for the quarter, down about $1 million from the same quarter of last year, and the general corporate piece of that, costs were $2 million lower than last year. On a year-to-date basis we're down about $3 million in total SG&A from the same period last year.
Slide 10 of the presentation is balance sheet. Some key balance sheet statistics there. We did have cash and investments of $368 million at the end of June. That was an increase of about $6 million from the end of March. Working capital, about $550 million. In net cash, position of $140 million. This is down, from the end of the year, by $70 million, $55 million of which is an increase in working capital for inventory and receivables that is based on seasonal activity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were at $8 million and book value per earning share was $8.88. A few other comments before I turn it to Rick. In the quarter, we did purchase the remaining 25% interest in our LP Brazil mill, that was a price of about $24 million. The accounting for this minority interest is a bit complex, but basically the difference between the purchase price we paid and the non-controlling interest that we had on our balance sheet already, went through other comprehensive income. Well, this showed up as additional equity for LP Corp. as an investing versus a financing activity on the cash flow statement. So other than the cash flow that went out, there was no impact on LP's financial statements in terms of this working capital. On our auction rate securities, we did have a slight increase in the value of the auction rate security that we recorded at the end of Q2. We do continue to pursue the litigation filed against the principal issuers of these instruments. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did sell all but the collateralized debt obligation portion of our portfolio, and we got net proceeds of that of about $19 million. So in Q3, we will recognize a gain of about $14 million associated with these ARS sales.
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

On top of that, we just completed our Board of Directors meeting here at noon. So Curt was kind enough to get us -- Kirk and his people were kind enough to get us ready for this call for this afternoon. For a bit of a personal indulgence to me, I plan to escape to Maine this evening to spend some vacation time with my family, and so I'm looking forward to that. And instead of waiting until next week, I getaway this evening.
I'm going to begin my prepared remarks with an overview of some thoughts on Q2 and the market. I think that it's no secret, it's been well publicized, that spring did come late across the U.S. and Canada, and because of that, what building activity that did take place in Q2 started late. I think, if I coupled this with the sense that we and our customers begin the year with a little bit more optimism and a little bit more wood, Q2 was not only slow in activity but we found our customers soon trying to conserve their cash and bleed down what inventories they had on hand during Q2. That was not a combination that was terribly conducive to robust sales from our manufacturing facilities. I think we suffered, all quarter, from this combination across all 3 businesses. And then judging from the performance of Random Lengths print, of OSB prices, there appeared to be more wood on the market than there was demand for it. Along with U.S. starts being down 4% Q2-to-Q2, the Canadian starts were also slowed by the late onset of spring, and also, forecast for Canada are projecting that Canada will be off 5% to 10% from last year in starts.
I'll now direct a few comments towards what we did in the businesses. I usually begin with safety, I'll start there. We had an extraordinary quarter operating safely. At LP and year-to-date, our OSHA TIR was down to 0.2 at the end of the second quarter. That is our best performance in LP's 38-year history. And of special note, as of today our OSB business, the entire combination of all the mills has a string of 310 consecutive days without a recordable accident. Our continuous improvement engine of Lean Six Sigma continues to help us improve operations and partially offset raw material increases with a year-to-date return of over 6:1. So even in these market conditions, our folks continue to find significant improvement projects to work on. I usually talk to you about wins. Win, if you remember, is defined as a product placement with a new customer or an additional product placement with an existing customer. We did quite well in Q2, our sales force received 538 new wins during Q2, which is almost 10% more than Q2 of 2010. Almost 20% of these wins were in our LSL product line, but I will admit that these wins are tougher to get and the wins are smaller, as we stay at the bottom of this housing cycle. In our OSB segment, it was a tough Q2 as we watched, I think, any enthusiasm that we had for a spring bounce in building activity fade away, and we experienced random print steadily declining. LP's effective operating rate for Q2 was at 70%, which was only 3% higher than in Q1. And as Curt related, poor pricing and poor demand were pretty much the story there.
Siding, if you're remember, Q2 of last year was our best second quarter during, what I'll call, the down years. And when we compare Q2 of this year to Q2 of 2010, we see about $10 million less in EBIT, I think the difference can be explained most simply by saying it was in 3 major areas. About $4.5 million of that was in the price and volume of the OSB that is sold out of our Hayward siding mill, about $4 million increase in raw materials and we had warned you of that early in the year, around zinc borate and our overlay paper and then the other $2 million was related to the decrease in siding volume quarter-to-quarter. Unit volume sales in SmartSide were off from Q2 of last year, about 8%, but all in all still not a bad quarter for siding. Engineered Wood Products pretty much tread water financially in Q2, with overall sales being down a couple of million from last year, but that was offset by some operating improvements to yield an overall break even in adjusted EBITDA. Year-to-date, we are ahead on LSL sales volumes by about 100,000 cubic meters.
A few comments about South America, Chile continues to be a bright spot for us, as both mills are operating at full capacity. About 87% of the product that we make in Chile is now being consumed in Chile, and we are growing exports also, to Argentina and Colombia. Chile is EBIT positive and a cash generator. Brazil's big news, as Curt mentioned, is that we now own 100% of the Ponta Grossa mill. It's now EBIT positive and cash positive. We're producing at about 16,000 cubic meters per month on one thermal oil line at that facility and we expect that, sometime during the second half of this year, we will have to face the decision of starting up the second thermal oil line. Which may be of interest to you, we are exporting about 35% of the OSB volume made in Brazil, and the lion's share of that is going to China for non-structural uses. We are finding it a slow process to gain code approval to break in to Brazilian housing and we're working, right now, on wall and roof approval. In the meantime, we will be looking to see if there are additional countries that have attractive export situations.
As I look forward, I think back over the last few conferences that I've been to and as many of you have heard me say, we put our operating plan together for 2011 based upon an expectation of 700,000 starts all in. That was based upon the belief that the first half of this year would be slower than the first half of last year, but that the second half of this year would be stronger than the second half of last year. I guess, as I look at that, I'd say we got it half right. The first half of this year was definitely slower than last year but it doesn't look to me like the second half of this year is going to be much stronger. Right now, I think that we'll be fortunate to end the year at about 625,000 starts all in, in the U.S. So that's the guidance that I recently offered our LP folks, in terms of driving how they're going to do their spending, make their inventory decisions and their operating assumptions. As I look forward, most of the forecasted updates that we have, related to 2012, are around that 700,000 number. There has been a little good news lately, that the impact from foreclosures may not be quite as bad as the gloom and doom that was being spread there. But I still think it comes back to having more certainty of an economic rebound needed by the general consumer, and then how soon the country can get back to job creation. I feel pretty confident now that our capital expenditures for 2011 will not exceed the $20 million mark, plus the $24.5 million that Curt mentioned in the completion of the Brazil mill purchase. And in terms of what's going on right now. OSB pricing, particularly in the West, is quite low. Since we supply most of that volume from Canada, the CAD $1.05, CAD $1.06 is quite problematic for us. In Siding, Canada has slowed a bit but our U.S. order file has recovered over Q2 levels. And in Engineered Wood, distribution volume has built up in Australia, which is where we are exporting quite a bit of material. And that's going to put us in a bit of a bind on our West Coast LVL volume. South American activity remains quite strong into the winter, and the North American channel feels very, very lean right now.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Curt to run the Q&A."

So I think, for us, that's what we think, I don't know how anyone else would have much of a different approach to that. Probably part of that answer is when somebody admits that they start it, right? So if somebody wants to look good, they'll tell you 3 months into their process of getting started, that well we can do this in the 3 months and that's probably because they got 3 months already done."

I know it's been a busy day for many of you. As the moderator said, I'm Curt Stevens, the CFO; and with me today is Rick Frost, our CEO; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, who are primary Investor Relations contacts.
As I usually do, I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the quarter and then I will follow that with some comments of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. Then I'll turn it over to Rick, who will discuss the general market environment in which we operated last quarter, his perspective on our operating results and some thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2012. As we have done in the past, weâ€™ve opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And this can be accessed at our public website, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion today is a presentation that we sent out with the release, and I will be referencing those pages as I go through my comments. We've also filed an 8-K with supplemental information that will help with the understanding of this material, and we expect to file our Form 10-Q later this afternoon.
And again, before I start, I want to remind you about the forward-looking statement comment that's included on Slide 2 of the presentation, and also, on Slide 3 is a discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information. I'm not going to read either one of those, but I am going to incorporate it by this reference. One final thing before I get to the numbers, I want to put this in context. I want to put it in a context of what housing has done in the second quarter and also in the backdrop of OSB pricing. 
In the first half of 2010, we believe that the government-provided housing incentives did have a positive impact on both the actual and perceived activity in the quarter. As a result, we did see increased product demand in Q2 of last year and enjoyed favorable OSB pricing, particularly in the second quarter. The first half of this year started out with some degree of optimism, in January and February, but this quickly faded with the adverse weather conditions across the country, lackluster housing demand in numbers and slowness in the retail sector. This affected the demand for building products, in both the first quarter and the second quarter, and had an extremely adverse affect on our pricing for OSB. The bottom line, in Q2, housing starts were down 4% year-over-year, and Random Lengths reported that average OSB pricing, based on the benchmark North Central 7/16s, declined by 42% or $123 a thousand. This affected LP's overall sales and operating earnings by $75 million, just due to the change in OSB pricing.
With that as backdrop, let me talk about the earnings. If you go to Slide 4 of the presentation, this is our earnings summary. We are reporting, today, a net loss for the second quarter of $35 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $363 million for the quarter. For the same quarter last year, we reported income of $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $448 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $7 million compared to income of $75 million in Q2 of 2010. There was movement in the tax rate on continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate and continuing operations in Q2 2001 was 20%, very similar to Q1. As we discussed last quarter, this is primarily related to the requirement of the valuation allowance against the use of certain of our losses in various jurisdictions above a specific threshold, this is all due to the accounting rules. Compounding this is in the discontinued operations, we were required to use the statutory benefit rate of 38.7% which results in a slightly lower tax benefit rate on continuing operations. 
I'll talk about this in a minute, but that affected -- if you used a more normalized rate, that would have improved or lowered the loss by about $0.04 to $0.05. In Q2 of last year, the tax benefit rate was 35%, which was the statutory rate blended for our various foreign pieces.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discuss of year-to-date results. For the year, we're reporting a net loss, for the first 6 months, of $59 million or $0.45 per share on net sales from continuing operations of about $700 million. For the same period last year, we reported breakeven results on sales from continuing operations of $745 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the 6 months was a positive $3 million compared to a positive $76 million in the first half of last year. And the tax rate, as we've discussed, was a little bit unique.
On Slide 6 of the presentation is a reconciliation of special charges. We did take additional impairment, principally on assets held for sale, of about $2.5 million to adjust those book values to what we expect to receive in these future transactions. In the other operating charges and credits, there were 2 items, a positive adjustment to a civil culture reserve and an increase in an environmental reserve that netted to a favorable $600,000. Without these items, earnings per share would have been a loss of $0.24 a share. If we also used a more normalized tax benefit rate, our EPS would have been a loss of $0.19 a share, relatively close to the $0.16 loss, it is the first call consensus.
Let me turn to the segments, on Slide 7 of the presentation is OSB. We did have an operating loss of $23 million in the quarter compared to $48 million of income in Q2 of 2010. For the quarter, we had a 4% increase in volume, with a lower average sales price of 36%. The decline in the sales price accounted for virtually all of that change in EBITDA of $71 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment was a loss of $13 million compared to a positive $58 million, again that same $71 million that we've talked about, attributable to pricing. Year-to-date, OSB had a loss of $32 million compared to income of $43 million the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was a negative $13 million in 2011 compared to a positive $62 million in 2010. Pricing was down 25% between the 2 years and accounted for almost all of this difference.
Slide 8 of the presentation, our Siding segment. This includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products and also includes commodity OSB produced in our Hayward siding mill. Operating income in this segment, $11.3 million, it was worse than the $22 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in the segment was $15.3 million compared to $27.4 million. For the quarter, sales were down 9%, with the unit volumes down 8% of the SmartSide and down 6% in CanExel compared to the same quarter last year. The change in OSB pricing in this segment affected both sales and earnings by about $4.5 million.
For the quarter, our SmartSide average sales price was up 2% and that was due to a price increase that we put in on April 1. This was put in place to offset rising zinc borate and paper overlay costs. Our CanExel prices has show increase of 22%, but this is largely due to CanExel primarily being sold in Canada and the strengthening Canadian dollar increase to U.S. equivalent of the sales price. Year-to-date, signing and operating income of $24 million through the first 2 quarters compared to $30 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $32 million in 2011 and $41 million during the same period last year, with most of that change being the OSB pricing.
Engineered Wood, in Slide 9 of the presentation. Just as a reminder, this includes our I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber and our LVL products. It also includes sales from 2 of our joint venture mills, with Abitibi, and a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q2, EWP recorded a loss of a little over $3 million compared to a loss of about $4.5 million in Q2 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was breakeven in the quarter compared to a loss of $600,000 in Q2 2010. Volumes for I-Joist were down significantly, 29%, while the combination of LVL and LSL were down slightly compared to same quarter last year. We attribute this decline to lower housing start, as well as an increase in the multi-family versus single-family for which EWP uses more product. Pricing was up 3% and 2%, respectively. These increases were a result of the price adjustments that we made last year to offset higher raw material cost. Year-to-date, the operating loss in EWP improved to a $9 million loss compared to an $11 million loss and adjusted EBITDA was just over $1 million compared to a loss of $4 million in the same period last year.
While there is no Slide for other building products, let me make a few comments. Overall, it was $2.2 million positive in the second quarter compared to about $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.5 million versus $6.5 million in 2010. Sales were up 5% to $50 million in the quarter. And then year-to-date, our other building products and operating income, a little over $5 million compared to just short of $4 million last year. On total, sales, general and administrative costs are $28 million for the quarter, down about $1 million from the same quarter of last year, and the general corporate piece of that, costs were $2 million lower than last year. On a year-to-date basis we're down about $3 million in total SG&A from the same period last year.
Slide 10 of the presentation is balance sheet. Some key balance sheet statistics there. We did have cash and investments of $368 million at the end of June. That was an increase of about $6 million from the end of March. Working capital, about $550 million. In net cash, position of $140 million. This is down, from the end of the year, by $70 million, $55 million of which is an increase in working capital for inventory and receivables that is based on seasonal activity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were at $8 million and book value per earning share was $8.88. A few other comments before I turn it to Rick. In the quarter, we did purchase the remaining 25% interest in our LP Brazil mill, that was a price of about $24 million. The accounting for this minority interest is a bit complex, but basically the difference between the purchase price we paid and the non-controlling interest that we had on our balance sheet already, went through other comprehensive income. Well, this showed up as additional equity for LP Corp. as an investing versus a financing activity on the cash flow statement. So other than the cash flow that went out, there was no impact on LP's financial statements in terms of this working capital. On our auction rate securities, we did have a slight increase in the value of the auction rate security that we recorded at the end of Q2. We do continue to pursue the litigation filed against the principal issuers of these instruments. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did sell all but the collateralized debt obligation portion of our portfolio, and we got net proceeds of that of about $19 million. So in Q3, we will recognize a gain of about $14 million associated with these ARS sales.
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

On top of that, we just completed our Board of Directors meeting here at noon. So Curt was kind enough to get us -- Kirk and his people were kind enough to get us ready for this call for this afternoon. For a bit of a personal indulgence to me, I plan to escape to Maine this evening to spend some vacation time with my family, and so I'm looking forward to that. And instead of waiting until next week, I getaway this evening.
I'm going to begin my prepared remarks with an overview of some thoughts on Q2 and the market. I think that it's no secret, it's been well publicized, that spring did come late across the U.S. and Canada, and because of that, what building activity that did take place in Q2 started late. I think, if I coupled this with the sense that we and our customers begin the year with a little bit more optimism and a little bit more wood, Q2 was not only slow in activity but we found our customers soon trying to conserve their cash and bleed down what inventories they had on hand during Q2. That was not a combination that was terribly conducive to robust sales from our manufacturing facilities. I think we suffered, all quarter, from this combination across all 3 businesses. And then judging from the performance of Random Lengths print, of OSB prices, there appeared to be more wood on the market than there was demand for it. Along with U.S. starts being down 4% Q2-to-Q2, the Canadian starts were also slowed by the late onset of spring, and also, forecast for Canada are projecting that Canada will be off 5% to 10% from last year in starts.
I'll now direct a few comments towards what we did in the businesses. I usually begin with safety, I'll start there. We had an extraordinary quarter operating safely. At LP and year-to-date, our OSHA TIR was down to 0.2 at the end of the second quarter. That is our best performance in LP's 38-year history. And of special note, as of today our OSB business, the entire combination of all the mills has a string of 310 consecutive days without a recordable accident. Our continuous improvement engine of Lean Six Sigma continues to help us improve operations and partially offset raw material increases with a year-to-date return of over 6:1. So even in these market conditions, our folks continue to find significant improvement projects to work on. I usually talk to you about wins. Win, if you remember, is defined as a product placement with a new customer or an additional product placement with an existing customer. We did quite well in Q2, our sales force received 538 new wins during Q2, which is almost 10% more than Q2 of 2010. Almost 20% of these wins were in our LSL product line, but I will admit that these wins are tougher to get and the wins are smaller, as we stay on the bottom of this housing cycle. In our OSB segment, it was a tough Q2 as we watched, I think, any enthusiasm that we had for a spring bounce in building activity fade away, and we experienced random print steadily declining. LP's effective operating rate for Q2 was at 70%, which was only 3% higher than in Q1. And as Curt related, poor pricing and poor demand were pretty much the story there.
Siding, if you're remember, Q2 of last year was our best second quarter during, what I'll call, the down years. And when we compare Q2 of this year to Q2 of 2010, we see about $10 million less in EBIT, I think the difference can be explained most simply by saying it was in 3 major areas. About $4.5 million of that was in the price and volume of the OSB that is sold out of our Hayward siding mill, about $4 million increase in raw materials and we had warned you of that early in the year, around zinc borate and our overlay paper and then the other $2 million was related to the decrease in siding volume quarter-to-quarter. Unit volume sales in SmartSide were off from Q2 of last year, about 8%, but all in all still not a bad quarter for siding. Engineered Wood Products pretty much tread water financially in Q2, with overall sales being down a couple of million from last year, but that was offset by some operating improvements to yield an overall break even in adjusted EBITDA. Year-to-date, we are ahead on LSL sales volumes by about 100,000 cubic meters.
A few comments about South America, Chile continues to be a bright spot for us, as both mills are operating at full capacity. About 87% of the product that we make in Chile is now being consumed in Chile, and we are growing exports also, to Argentina and Colombia. Chile is EBIT positive and a cash generator. Brazil's big news, as Curt mentioned, is that we now own 100% of the Ponta Grossa mill. It's now EBIT positive and cash positive. We're producing at about 16,000 cubic meters per month on one thermal oil line at that facility and we expect that, sometime during the second half of this year, we will have to face the decision of starting up the second thermal oil line. Which may be of interest to you, we are exporting about 35% of the OSB volume made in Brazil, and the lion's share of that is going to China for non-structural uses. We are finding it a slow process to gain code approval to break in to Brazilian housing and we're working, right now, on wall and roof approval. In the meantime, we will be looking to see if there are additional countries that have attractive export situations.
As I look forward, I think back over the last few conferences that I've been to and as many of you have heard me say, we put our operating plan together for 2011 based upon an expectation of 700,000 starts all in. That was based upon the belief that the first half of this year would be slower than the first half of last year, but that the second half of this year would be stronger than the second half of last year. I guess, as I look at that, I'd say we got it half right. The first half of this year was definitely slower than last year but it doesn't look to me like the second half of this year is going to be much stronger. Right now, I think that we'll be fortunate to end the year at about 625,000 starts all in, in the U.S. So that's the guidance that I recently offered our LP folks, in terms of driving how they're going to do their spending, make their inventory decisions and their operating assumptions. As I look forward, most of the forecasted updates that we have, related to 2012, are around that 700,000 number. 
There has been a little good news lately, that the impact from foreclosures may not be quite as bad as the gloom and doom that was being spread there. But I still think it comes back to having more certainty of an economic rebound needed by the general consumer, and then how soon the country can get back to job creation. I feel pretty confident now that our capital expenditures for 2011 will not exceed the $20 million mark, plus the $24.5 million that Curt mentioned in the completion of the Brazil mill purchase. And in terms of what's going on right now. OSB pricing, particularly in the West, is quite low. Since we supply most of that volume from Canada, the CAD $1.05, CAD $1.06 is quite problematic for us. In Siding, Canada has slowed a bit but our U.S. order file has recovered over Q2 levels. And in Engineered Wood, distribution volume has built up in Australia, which is where we are exporting quite a bit of material. And that's going to put us in a bit of a bind on our West Coast LVL volume. South American activity remains quite strong into the winter, and the North American channel feels very, very lean right now.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Curt to run the Q&A."

I know it's been a busy day for many of you. As the moderator said, I'm Curt Stevens, the CFO; and with me today is Rick Frost, our CEO; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, who are primary Investor Relations contacts.
As I usually do, I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the quarter and then I will follow that with some comments of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. Then I'll turn it over to Rick, who will discuss the general market environment in which we operated last quarter, his perspective on our operating results and some thoughts on the outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2012. As we have done in the past, weâ€™ve opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And this can be accessed at our public website, www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion today is a presentation that we sent out with the release, and I will be referencing those pages as I go through my comments. We've also filed an 8-K with supplemental information that will help with the understanding of this material, and we expect to file our Form 10-Q later this afternoon.
And again, before I start, I want to remind you about the forward-looking statement comment that's included on Slide 2 of the presentation, and also, on Slide 3 is a discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information. I'm not going to read either one of those, but I am going to incorporate it by this reference. One final thing before I get to the numbers, I want to put this in context. I want to put it in a context of what housing has done in the second quarter and also in the backdrop of OSB pricing. 
In the first half of 2010, we believe that the government-provided housing incentives did have a positive impact on both the actual and perceived activity in the quarter. As a result, we did see increased product demand in Q2 of last year and enjoyed favorable OSB pricing, particularly in the second quarter. The first half of this year started out with some degree of optimism, in January and February, but this quickly faded with the adverse weather conditions across the country, lackluster housing demand in numbers and slowness in the retail sector. This affected the demand for building products, in both the first quarter and the second quarter, and had an extremely adverse affect on our pricing for OSB. The bottom line, in Q2, housing starts were down 4% year-over-year, and Random Lengths reported that average OSB pricing, based on the benchmark North Central 7/16s, declined by 42% or $123 a thousand. This affected LP's overall sales and operating earnings by $75 million, just due to the change in OSB pricing.
With that as backdrop, let me talk about the earnings. If you go to Slide 4 of the presentation, this is our earnings summary. We are reporting, today, a net loss for the second quarter of $35 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Net sales from continuing operations were $363 million for the quarter. For the same quarter last year, we reported income of $22 million or $0.16 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $448 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $7 million compared to income of $75 million in Q2 of 2010. There was movement in the tax rate on continuing operations between the quarters. The effective tax benefit rate on continuing operations in Q2 2001 was 20%, very similar to Q1. As we discussed last quarter, this is primarily related to the requirement of the valuation allowance against the use of certain of our losses in various jurisdictions above a specific threshold, this is all due to the accounting rules. Compounding this is in the discontinued operations, we were required to use the statutory benefit rate of 38.7% which results in a slightly lower tax benefit rate on continuing operations. 
I'll talk about this in a minute, but that affected -- if you used a more normalized rate, that would have improved or lowered the loss by about $0.04 to $0.05. In Q2 of last year, the tax benefit rate was 35%, which was the statutory rate blended for our various foreign pieces.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discuss of year-to-date results. For the year, we're reporting a net loss, for the first 6 months, of $59 million or $0.45 per share on net sales from continuing operations of about $700 million. For the same period last year, we reported breakeven results on sales from continuing operations of $745 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the 6 months was a positive $3 million compared to a positive $76 million in the first half of last year. And the tax rate, as we've discussed, was a little bit unique.
On Slide 6 of the presentation is a reconciliation of special charges. We did take additional impairment, principally on assets held for sale, of about $2.5 million to adjust those book values to what we expect to receive in these future transactions. In the other operating charges and credits, there were 2 items, a positive adjustment to a civil culture reserve and an increase in an environmental reserve that netted to a favorable $600,000. Without these items, earnings per share would have been a loss of $0.24 a share. If we also used a more normalized tax benefit rate, our EPS would have been a loss of $0.19 a share, relatively close to the $0.16 loss, it is the first call consensus.
Let me turn to the segments, on Slide 7 of the presentation is OSB. We did have an operating loss of $23 million in the quarter compared to $48 million of income in Q2 of 2010. For the quarter, we had a 4% increase in volume, with a lower average sales price of 36%. The decline in the sales price accounted for virtually all of that change in EBITDA of $71 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment was a loss of $13 million compared to a positive $58 million, again that same $71 million that we've talked about, attributable to pricing. Year-to-date, OSB had a loss of $32 million compared to income of $43 million the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was a negative $13 million in 2011 compared to a positive $62 million in 2010. Pricing was down 25% between the 2 years and accounted for almost all of this difference.
Slide 8 of the presentation, our Siding segment. This includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products and also includes commodity OSB produced in our Hayward siding mill. Operating income in this segment, $11.3 million, it was worse than the $22 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in the segment was $15.3 million compared to $27.4 million. For the quarter, sales were down 9%, with the unit volumes down 8% of the SmartSide and down 6% in CanExel compared to the same quarter last year. The change in OSB pricing in this segment affected both sales and earnings by about $4.5 million.
For the quarter, our SmartSide average sales price was up 2% and that was due to a price increase that we put in on April 1. This was put in place to offset rising zinc borate and paper overlay costs. Our CanExel prices has show increase of 22%, but this is largely due to CanExel primarily being sold in Canada and the strengthening Canadian dollar increase to U.S. equivalent of the sales price. Year-to-date, signing and operating income of $24 million through the first 2 quarters compared to $30 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $32 million in 2011 and $41 million during the same period last year, with most of that change being the OSB pricing.
Engineered Wood, in Slide 9 of the presentation. Just as a reminder, this includes our I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber and our LVL products. It also includes sales from 2 of our joint venture mills, with Abitibi, and a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. For Q2, EWP recorded a loss of a little over $3 million compared to a loss of about $4.5 million in Q2 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was breakeven in the quarter compared to a loss of $600,000 in Q2 2010. Volumes for I-Joist were down significantly, 29%, while the combination of LVL and LSL were down slightly compared to same quarter last year. We attribute this decline to lower housing start, as well as an increase in the multi-family versus single-family for which EWP uses more product. Pricing was up 3% and 2%, respectively. These increases were a result of the price adjustments that we made last year to offset higher raw material cost. Year-to-date, the operating loss in EWP improved to a $9 million loss compared to an $11 million loss and adjusted EBITDA was just over $1 million compared to a loss of $4 million in the same period last year.
While there is no Slide for other building products, let me make a few comments. Overall, it was $2.2 million positive in the second quarter compared to about $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.5 million versus $6.5 million in 2010. Sales were up 5% to $50 million in the quarter. And then year-to-date, our other building products and operating income, a little over $5 million compared to just short of $4 million last year. On total, sales, general and administrative costs are $28 million for the quarter, down about $1 million from the same quarter of last year, and the general corporate piece of that, costs were $2 million lower than last year. On a year-to-date basis we're down about $3 million in total SG&A from the same period last year.
Slide 10 of the presentation is balance sheet. Some key balance sheet statistics there. We did have cash and investments of $368 million at the end of June. That was an increase of about $6 million from the end of March. Working capital, about $550 million. In net cash, position of $140 million. This is down, from the end of the year, by $70 million, $55 million of which is an increase in working capital for inventory and receivables that is based on seasonal activity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were at $8 million and book value per earning share was $8.88. A few other comments before I turn it to Rick. In the quarter, we did purchase the remaining 25% interest in our LP Brazil mill, that was a price of about $24 million. The accounting for this minority interest is a bit complex, but basically the difference between the purchase price we paid and the non-controlling interest that we had on our balance sheet already, went through other comprehensive income. Well, this showed up as additional equity for LP Corp. as an investing versus a financing activity on the cash flow statement. So other than the cash flow that went out, there was no impact on LP's financial statements in terms of this working capital. On our auction rate securities, we did have a slight increase in the value of the auction rate security that we recorded at the end of Q2. We do continue to pursue the litigation filed against the principal issuers of these instruments. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did sell all but the collateralized debt obligation portion of our portfolio, and we got net proceeds of that of about $19 million. So in Q3, we will recognize a gain of about $14 million associated with these ARS sales.
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

So Curt",1427,"Good afternoon, everybody, and we do appreciate your interest in our call. I realize there are a lot of competing news releases today, plus a lot of national suspense. On top of that, we just completed our Board of Directors meeting here at noon. So Curt was kind enough to get us -- Kirk and his people were kind enough to get us ready for this call for this afternoon. For a bit of a personal indulgence to me, I plan to escape to Maine this evening to spend some vacation time with my family, and so I'm looking forward to that. And instead of waiting until next week, I getaway this evening.
I'm going to begin my prepared remarks with an overview of some thoughts on Q2 and the market. I think that it's no secret, it's been well publicized, that spring did come late across the U.S. and Canada, and because of that, what building activity that did take place in Q2 started late. I think, if I coupled this with the sense that we and our customers begin the year with a little bit more optimism and a little bit more wood, Q2 was not only slow in activity but we found our customers soon trying to conserve their cash and bleed down what inventories they had on hand during Q2. That was not a combination that was terribly conducive to robust sales from our manufacturing facilities. I think we suffered, all quarter, from this combination across all 3 businesses. And then judging from the performance of Random Lengths print, of OSB prices, there appeared to be more wood on the market than there was demand for it. Along with U.S. starts being down 4% Q2-to-Q2, the Canadian starts were also slowed by the late onset of spring, and also, forecast for Canada are projecting that Canada will be off 5% to 10% from last year in starts.
I'll now direct a few comments towards what we did in the businesses. I usually begin with safety, I'll start there. We had an extraordinary quarter operating safely. At LP and year-to-date, our OSHA TIR was down to 0.2 at the end of the second quarter. That is our best performance in LP's 38-year history. And of special note, as of today our OSB business, the entire combination of all the mills has a string of 310 consecutive days without a recordable accident. Our continuous improvement engine of Lean Six Sigma continues to help us improve operations and partially offset raw material increases with a year-to-date return of over 6:1. So even in these market conditions, our folks continue to find significant improvement projects to work on. I usually talk to you about wins. Win, if you remember, is defined as a product placement with a new customer or an additional product placement with an existing customer. We did quite well in Q2, our sales force received 538 new wins during Q2, which is almost 10% more than Q2 of 2010. Almost 20% of these wins were in our LSL product line, but I will admit that these wins are tougher to get and the wins are smaller, as we stay on the bottom of this housing cycle. In our OSB segment, it was a tough Q2 as we watched, I think, any enthusiasm that we had for a spring bounce in building activity fade away, and we experienced random print steadily declining. LP's effective operating rate for Q2 was at 70%, which was only 3% higher than in Q1. And as Curt related, poor pricing and poor demand were pretty much the story there.
Siding, if you're remember, Q2 of last year was our best second quarter during, what I'll call, the down years. And when we compare Q2 of this year to Q2 of 2010, we see about $10 million less in EBIT, I think the difference can be explained most simply by saying it was in 3 major areas. About $4.5 million of that was in the price and volume of the OSB that is sold out of our Hayward siding mill, about $4 million increase in raw materials and we had warned you of that early in the year, around zinc borate and our overlay paper and then the other $2 million was related to the decrease in siding volume quarter-to-quarter. Unit volume sales in SmartSide were off from Q2 of last year, about 8%, but all in all still not a bad quarter for siding. Engineered Wood Products pretty much tread water financially in Q2, with overall sales being down a couple of million from last year, but that was offset by some operating improvements to yield an overall break even in adjusted EBITDA. Year-to-date, we are ahead on LSL sales volumes by about 100,000 cubic meters.
A few comments about South America, Chile continues to be a bright spot for us, as both mills are operating at full capacity. About 87% of the product that we make in Chile is now being consumed in Chile, and we are growing exports also, to Argentina and Colombia. Chile is EBIT positive and a cash generator. Brazil's big news, as Curt mentioned, is that we now own 100% of the Ponta Grossa mill. It's now EBIT positive and cash positive. We're producing at about 16,000 cubic meters per month on one thermal oil line at that facility and we expect that, sometime during the second half of this year, we will have to face the decision of starting up the second thermal oil line. Which may be of interest to you, we are exporting about 35% of the OSB volume made in Brazil, and the lion's share of that is going to China for non-structural uses. We are finding it a slow process to gain code approval to break in to Brazilian housing and we're working, right now, on wall and roof approval. In the meantime, we will be looking to see if there are additional countries that have attractive export situations.
As I look forward, I think back over the last few conferences that I've been to and as many of you have heard me say, we put our operating plan together for 2011 based upon an expectation of 700,000 starts all in. That was based upon the belief that the first half of this year would be slower than the first half of last year, but that the second half of this year would be stronger than the second half of last year. I guess, as I look at that, I'd say we got it half right. The first half of this year was definitely slower than last year but it doesn't look to me like the second half of this year is going to be much stronger. Right now, I think that we'll be fortunate to end the year at about 625,000 starts all in, in the U.S. So that's the guidance that I recently offered our LP folks, in terms of driving how they're going to do their spending, make their inventory decisions and their operating assumptions. As I look forward, most of the forecasted updates that we have, related to 2012, are around that 700,000 number. 
There has been a little good news lately, that the impact from foreclosures may not be quite as bad as the gloom and doom that was being spread there. But I still think it comes back to having more certainty of an economic rebound needed by the general consumer, and then how soon the country can get back to job creation. I feel pretty confident now that our capital expenditures for 2011 will not exceed the $20 million mark, plus the $24.5 million that Curt mentioned in the completion of the Brazil mill purchase. And in terms of what's going on right now. OSB pricing, particularly in the West, is quite low. Since we supply most of that volume from Canada, the CAD $1.05, CAD $1.06 is quite problematic for us. In Siding, Canada has slowed a bit but our U.S. order file has recovered over Q2 levels. And in Engineered Wood, distribution volume has built up in Australia, which is where we are exporting quite a bit of material. And that's going to put us in a bit of a bind on our West Coast LVL volume. South American activity remains quite strong into the winter, and the North American channel feels very, very lean right now.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Curt to run the Q&A."

In terms of your second question on siding, I don't see any trends, in terms of homebuilders changing that would particularly benefit from us. But what I do see is that our siding products have a very good growth trend, and I talked about the 20% of our wins last quarter in LSL. Even a larger portion of those wins are in one siding product or another. So were still very excited about -- once we get a builder to use our siding products, they use it again because they like it, they like working with it.

With me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, who are our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the third quarter of 2011, followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and a few balance sheet items. Rick will then take over to discuss the general market environment in which we operated in the quarter, his perspective on our most recent results and some thoughts on the remainder of this year and into next year. Rick will then provide a bit more color about the organizational announcement that LP made this morning. Following this, he'll turn it back over to me to answer your questions.
As we've done in the past, this call is open to the public and we are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will reference the slide numbers during my comments. 
We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we will file our Form 10-Q shortly.
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment that's included on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of our use of non-GAAP financial information that is discussed on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to some of the necessary if the associations that have been supplemented by the 8-K filing we made this morning. I'm not going to read these statements but I will incorporate them with this reference.
Before I begin my detailed discussion and results for the quarter, I do want to focus on 3 factors that affected our reported results of this quarter and year to date: Housing activity, OSB pricing and a non-cash impairment. 
For Q3, housing starts as reported by the U.S. Department of the Census were 6% higher than the third quarter of 2010 when activity tailed off due to the expiration of the housing tax credit. For the first 9 months of this year, actual housing starts were 2% below the same period in 2010.
For the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011, our OSB prices were 7% and 19% lower than the same period in 2010. The swing in pricing for Q3 costs in Q3 caused a $9 million reduction in earnings compared to the same quarter last year and had a cumulative negative affect and year-to-date operating results of a little over $95 million between the OSB and Siding segments.
In the quarter, accounting rules did require us to take an impairment against the carrying value of our hold main LSL mill. This non-cash pretax impairment was for $62 million. I want to be very clear that this was an accounting decision, not a business decision. We remain committed to this important product line and expect it to be a strong contributor to earnings when the housing market recovers.
Now let me go to the numbers. Refer to Slide 4 of the representation for a discussion of Q3 results compared to same quarter last year and the prior quarter. We're reporting a net loss for the third quarter of $66 million or $0.49 per diluted share on sales in continuing operations of a little over $350 million. 
For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of $32 million or $0.24 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $323 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations are a loss of $7 million in the quarter compared to a positive $4 million in Q3 of 2010. 
Moving to the tax rate and continuing operations between the quarters, in Q3 we had a tax effective tax rate of 26% compared to 35% in Q3 of 2010. As I've discussed the last several quarters, this difference is primarily related to the requirement for the valuation allowance against our losses in Canada above a specific threshold due to these accounting rules. Compounding this is the impact of discontinued operations which by accounting regulations are required to be benefited at the statutory rate of 38.7. That results in a lower benefit rate on continuing operations.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discussion of year-to-date results compared to the same period last year. The year-to-date we're reporting a net loss of $124 million on sales of $1 billion during this period. The same period last year, we reported net loss of $32 million on sales of $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $4 million compared to income of $81 million in the first 9 months of 2010. The tax rate in continuing operations of the first 9 months was 24% compared to 32% in the prior year.
Slide 6 of the presentation is a discussion of special charges. As I mentioned earlier, we did take a significant impairment on the carrying value of our hold in main LSL mill. In addition to the impairment in we also adjusted the values of some of the assets held for sale to reflect the current reality in the market. This is about a $3 million negative adjustment. As we've said over the last few quarters, we are willing seller but it's hard to get a willing buyer to the table in some of these asset sales.
In the other operating charges credited the bulk of the positive adjustment is related to a take back of around $10.5 million from claims reserves that up of the ABTco hard board transaction. This is based on recent activity.
The impact of adjusting for these items gives an adjusted loss from continuing operations of $26 million or $0.19 per share. 
Not shown in the slide is a charge we took in our discontinued operations to increase the reserves for the decking class action, again this is based on our continuous analysis and review of the data. The increase was about $8 million.
Let me discuss the performance of each segment. On Slide 7 is our OSB segment. We had an operating loss of $16 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $5 million in Q3 of 2009. For the quarter, we had an increase of 5% in volume and an average sales price of 7% lower. As I mentioned earlier, the decrease in the sales price accounts for most of this change, a $9 million reduction in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. This may seem a little bit odd as the ops coated random links 716 central price index was actually slightly higher than Q3 of last year. But if LP is a national footprint, our prices are influenced by the other regions, particularly the West Coast, where pricing was down 17% quarter over quarter.
Additionally, higher material costs, principally resins in energy and a higher Canadian dollar increased our costs. However, we were able to offset these increases whether results of our Lean Six Sigma efforts and improved operations. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in da OSB segment for the quarter was a loss of $7 million compared to a gain in third quarter 2010. Compared to Q2 of 2011, volumes were slightly higher, up 2% while prices were flat. Year-to-date, OSB had an operating loss of $48 million compared to a profit of $38 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods was a loss of $20 million in 2011 and income of $67 million in 2010. Pricing accounted for more than 100% of this decline were $91 million dollars.
Refer to Slide 8 of the presentation for Siding, this includes our SmartSide and Canexel product lines and a smaller amount of commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the third quarter, Siding had operating income of $12 million, which is higher than the $9 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in Siding was $16 million compared to $13 million in Q3 of 2010. For the quarter, sales were up 7% with unit volumes higher by 10% in SmartSide and lower in Canexel by 29% compared to the same quarter last year.
For the quarters, SmartSide average sales prices were up 5% due to a general price increase implemented in the first part of the year to cover increased production cost. Canexel price also showed an increase of, 5% but this is largely due to Canexel being sold in Canada in Canadian dollars and as the Canadian dollar strengthening against the U.S. equivalent.
Year-to-date, Siding had operating income of $36 million compared to income of $40 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $49 million this year versus $54 million in 2010. The OSB pricing on the Hayward volume lowered earnings by about $5 million and accounted for most of the shift.
Slide 9 of the presentation is the Engineered Wood segment. This includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber and Laminated Veneer Product plus other related products. For Q3, reported loss of $3 million compared to a loss of $5 million in Q3 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations EWP segment was just slightly negative in the third quarter compared to a loss of almost $3 million in the second quarter of 2010. Volumes of I-Joist were up 26%, while volumes of our LVL/LSL were up 71% compared to same quarter last year. This looks like a big number, and let me just remind you that in third quarter of 2010, we saw significant reductions in the inventory in the channel and, therefore, the increases shown this quarter are a bit of an anomaly with the exception that we did see an increase in our exports for these products.
Pricing was down 3% in I-Joist, 4% in LVL/LSL primarily due to changes in product mix. Year-to-date EWP had an operating loss of $12 million compared to a loss of $16 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was a loss of about $1 million to this year compared to a $6 million loss in 2010.
While there's no slide for our other building products, let me make a few comments. Overall, we're showing a loss of $1 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to income of $1 million in the third quarter of 2010. For the quarter, sales were about $46 million, up 11% from the $41 million recorded in Q3 of last year primarily driven by our South America operations.
Year-to-date other building products and operating income of $4 million compared to income of $5 million same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $14 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2010. 
We did have a $4 million foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to a very slight loss in the same quarter last year. This loss was driven by the significant temporary increase in the U.S. dollar at the end of September. In early October, the U.S. Dollar again dropped in relation to Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and Chilean peso, so most of this gain we have recovered.
Slide 10 is a summary of the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalent investments or restricted cash were $375 million. This is an increase around $7 million from last June 30. Working capital of $216 million, net cash of $137 million, and we spent about $13 million in capital expenditures. 
One final comment before I turn it to Rick, in October, we did modify and extend our asset-based loan agreement with our banking group to increased availability, lower our cost and reduce the administrative burden. We did file an 8-K on this extension it in a timely manner. Key items including extended maturity from September 10, 2012, to October 14, 2016; decrease the interest rate payable for certain types of loans that permits LP to include its borrowing base certain vendor-managed inventory and an increase our flexibility to incur and prepay certain types of debt.
With that, let me turn to Rick."

Before I get started, I can't resist props go out to my LSU Tigers over the weekend which offset our Titans loss over the weekend. It is beautiful here, although the results aren't that beautiful.",1495,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for listening in. Before I get started, I can't resist props go out to my LSU Tigers over the weekend which offset our Titans loss over the weekend. It is beautiful here, although the results aren't that beautiful. So this morning in my prepared remarks, I'll add some color to LP's performance in Q3 and then follow with a bit of a look into Q4 and how we presently see 2012 evolving. 
As is customary, I want to begin with safety. Through our Q3, our year-to-date total incident rate was 4.2, and we are still on a record-breaking pace of improvement in keeping our peoples more safe every year for the last decade. Our Q3 was nothing to brag about us as we did experience a few more Nixon Hickey's standing in Q3 of last year. But year-to-date, we are still ahead of last year's performance. 
From an environmental perspective, we experienced no notices of violation for the quarter and experienced no environmental fines. 
Our Lean Six Sigma efforts continue to yield good results with our year-to-date returns at 6.7:1, and about 20% of our workforce are participating on improvement teams.
As Curt said, capital spending in Q3 was a little under $5 million and around $13 million year-to-date. I still do expect us to come in around that $20 million number that I have previously a offered for guidance for 2011, exclusive of the capital, of course, that we spent to complete the purchase of the Brazil mill this year. 
As Curt mentioned, our cash and investments are $375 million, and we are net cash of $144 million. 
Early guidance on capital for 2012, I'm going to put out there around $25 million. I'll update you on that in February after I've had a chance to fully review those plans in more detail. 
Raw material costs are performing about as we suggested to you back in January that we thought they would. We expect our raw material price variation to end up a negative of about $25 million at the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2010. The lion's share of that is in residence binders and wax at a little bit over $15 million and negative valuation, and the other $6.5 million is in the zinc borate and the paper overlay which we alerted you to on our Siding business earlier in the year. 
Now let me make a few comments on each one of our major businesses and our other reporting segments that include South America. 
I'll begin with OSB. This business was most of the negative results. Although sales and production volumes were slightly up Q3 to Q3, our sales price was down against Q3 of last year. And as Curt mentioned, we were particularly disadvantaged with very low West Coast pricing where we have a significant presence because of our peace valley and Dawson Creek OSB Mills. About 27% of our volume was sold into the Western markets in Q3. 
Manufacturing costs for OSB were pretty much in line with Q3 of 2010 except resin binder and wax costs, which were up 18%. Our value-added component was up about 12% on volume over our Q3 2010 and made up about 35% of our total mix on a volume basis in the quarter. 
OSB had an effective operating rate of about 70% for the quarter and about 55% of its total capacity, counting the currently indefinitely shut mills of Chambord, Clarke County and now Dawson Creek. During the quarter, we did make the decision to indefinitely shut down the pressing operation at Dawson Creek and to move that volume to peace valley. Dawson has a rated production capacity of about 390 million feet per year. This mil as they open to process textile blanks but will not press aboard until there is a future need for its production sometime in the future.
During Q3, LP OSB sold about 6 million feet to Asia and exported about 2% of its total sales volume. 
Our Siding business makes a better story Q3 to Q3. Net sales were up 7%, and EBITDA was improved 27% Q3 to Q3. SmartSide volume was up 10%, and our Canexel volume was up 29% and as we came off allocation as the Canadian housing market slowdown in the quarter. 
With product mix included, Q3 to Q3 pricing for SmartSide was up 5%; and for Canexel, it was also up 5%. One caution there is a reminder that Q3 of last year for Siding was a very, very low quarter as we came out of the bump that we had in the second quarter as people were taking advantage of that Home Buyer Tax Credit.
Moving onto Engineered Wood, EWP improved in a Q3 to Q3 comparison by about 35% on an EBIT basis, but this also needs to be tampered tempered with the realization that Q3 2010 was a horrible quarter in Engineered Wood Products in the marketplace. Sales volumes of I-Joist, LVL and LSL were all significantly better than Q3 of 2010. The pricing was 3% and 4%, respectively, on I-Joist and the LVL/LSL combination. 
Year-to-date, EBITDA for EWP although negative has improved 79% largely due to growing international sales, primarily LSL to Australia, and the LSL/LVL volume combination year-to-date is up 14%. 
In South America, while we do not get report part of this -- this part of the business separately, both LP Chile and LP Brazil are having their best year so far. Both are EBIT positive and contributing cash to LP. In Chile, both mills continue to run at near capacity and domestic demand remains strong. We are under some rising pressure in Chile from imports. 
In Brazil, we are operating our Ponta Grossa mill at about half of its capacity, and the decision to start up the second thermal oil line there will probably put off onto until Q2 of next year. I just don't know yet, and that will be based upon the business level at that time. About 20% to 25% of the Brazil volume is going to China for interior use. 
In terms of looking at the markets for the rest of this fourth quarter, we expect to see the seasonal falloff in domestic markets across all product lines. My sense right now is that Q1 of 2012 will be relatively slow. The media and housing start forecast for next year is currently a little bit over 650,000 new starts with the gross from -- the growth from this year being primarily in multi-family. And current thinking for multi-family is for it to be up 40,000 to 50,000 units from 2011 into 2012.
In general, I think the housing market remains weak about anyway you slice it. We are still facing high unemployment, slow household formation, declines in home prices and continued foreclosures. But we have seen a few positive indicators of late. Existing home sales have been improving. Home inventories for sale are going down in total, and there is a slowdown in the number of foreclosures. And then there was a nice bump in the September housing start numbers that were recently released. 
As I finish my prepared remarks, I want to comment on the other announcement that we put up this morning, and at is the organizational changes that we're making. Obviously, we are beginning a transition for me to eventually retire from LP. I've recently completed 7 years of service as CEO with this company. So bringing on a very confident Chief Financial Officer was a step in that planning process. And then turning over the direct leadership for operations of the company to Curt as the new Chief Operating Officer is a logical step as well. We plan to allow Sallie Bailey, our new CFO, time to get fully up to speed on LP and for Curt to have a time to put his operating head back on before I firm up my departure with our Board of Directors. When we think that we are ready, we will firm that up and we will announce it, and that's about all I can give you on that right now. 
As I close, I do want to acknowledge that this is the last time that I will be working this call with Curt in Curt's current role as CFO. Sallie will become LP's new CFO in December. And as Curt will be moving to Chief Operating Officer, his in position that's been created temporarily for succession purposes and around my eventual retirement. Curt and I have been doing this calls in all of our trips to New York now for 7 years together and then Curt work with my predecessor for the 7 years before that. Going forward, Curt will be on these calls, but we'll be adding more of the color commentary as the Chief Operating Officer. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Curt to handle questions."

So we look at the night to be quite strong down there. Our next challenge will be then to penetrate the building markets in Brazil, and it's not out of the question for us within a couple of years to be thinking that we will want to build another mill in South America, although we have identified exactly where yet. So are still pretty bullish on that and business advantage being in the country."

In reaction to that, you heard Rick say that we did make the decision to indefinitely curtail the Dawson Creek facility for production of OSB. We reacted to it from the supply side because we understand the demand side."

With me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, who are our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the third quarter of 2011, followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and a few balance sheet items. Rick will then take over to discuss the general market environment in which we operated in the quarter, his perspective on our most recent results and some thoughts on the remainder of this year and into next year. Rick will then provide a bit more color about the organizational announcement that LP made this morning. Following this, he'll turn it back over to me to answer your questions.
As we've done in the past, this call is open to the public and we are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will reference the slide numbers during my comments. 
We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we will file our Form 10-Q shortly.
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment that's included on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of our use of non-GAAP financial information that is discussed on Slide 3 of the presentation, the appendix attached to some of the necessary reconciliations that have been supplemented by the 8-K filing we made this morning. I'm not going to reread these statements but I will incorporate them with this reference.
Before I begin my detailed discussion and results for the quarter, I do want to focus on 3 factors that affected our reported results of this quarter and year to date: Housing activity, OSB pricing and a non-cash impairment. 
For Q3, housing starts as reported by the U.S. Department of the Census were 6% higher than the third quarter of 2010, when activity tailed off due to the expiration of the housing tax credit. For the first 9 months of this year, actual housing starts were 2% below the same period in 2010.
For the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011, our OSB prices were 7% and 19% lower than the same  periods in 2010. The swing in pricing for Q3 caused a $9 million reduction in earnings compared to the same quarter last year and had a cumulative negative effect on year-to-date operating results of a little over $95 million between the OSB and Siding segments.
In the quarter, accounting rules did require us to take an impairment against the carrying value of our Houlton, Maine LSL mill. This non-cash pretax impairment was for $62 million. I want to be very clear that this is an accounting decision, not a business decision. We remain committed to this important product line and expect it to be a strong contributor to earnings when the housing market recovers.
Now let me go to the numbers. Refer to Slide 4 of the representation for a discussion of Q3 results compared to same quarter last year and the prior quarter. We're reporting a net loss for the third quarter of $66 million or $0.49 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of a little over $350 million. 
For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of $32 million or $0.24 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $323 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations had a loss of $7 million in the quarter compared to a positive $4 million in Q3 of 2010. 
Moving on the tax rate and continuing operations between the quarters, in Q3 we had a tax -- effective tax rate of 26% compared to a 35% in Q3 of 2010. As I've discussed the last several quarters, this difference is primarily related to the requirement for the valuation allowance against our losses in Canada above a specific threshold due to these accounting rules. Compounding this is the impact of discontinued operations which by accounting regulations are required to be benefited at the statutory rate of 38.7. That results in a lower benefit rate on continuing operations.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discussion of year-to-date results compared to the same period last year. The year-to-date, we're reporting a net loss of $124 million on sales of $1 billion during this period. The same period last year, we reported net loss of $32 million on sales of $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $4 million compared to income of $81 million in the first 9 months of 2010. The tax rate in continuing operations for the first 9 months was 24% compared to 32% in the prior year.
Slide 6 of the presentation is a discussion of special charges. As I mentioned earlier, we did take a significant impairment on the carrying value of our Houlton, Maine, LSL mill. In addition to the impairment in Houlton, we also adjusted the values of some of the assets held for sale to reflect the current reality in the market. This is about a $3 million negative adjustment. As we've said over the last few quarters, we are willing seller but it's hard to get a willing buyer to the table on some of these asset sales.
In the other operating charges credited the bulk of the positive adjustment is related to a take-back of around $10.5 million from claims reserves that up of the ABTco hardboard-class action. This is based on recent activity.
The impact of adjusting for these items gives an adjusted loss from continuing operations of $26 million or $0.19 per share. 
Not shown in this slide is a charge we took in our discontinued operations to increase the reserves for the decking class action, again this is based on a continuous analysis and review of the data. The increase was about $8 million.
Let me discuss the performance of each segment. On Slide 7 is our OSB segment. We had an operating loss of $16 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $5 million in Q3 of 2009. For the quarter, we had an increase of 5% in volume and an average sales price of 7% lower. As I mentioned earlier, the decrease in the sales price accounts for most of this change, a $9 million reduction in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. This may seem a little bit odd as the ops coated Random Lengths 7/16s North Central price index was actually slightly higher than Q3 of last year. But if LP is a national footprint, our prices are influenced by the other regions, particularly the West Coast, where pricing was down 17% quarter-over-quarter.
Additionally, higher raw material costs, principally rather than energy and a higher Canadian dollar increased our costs. However, we were able to offset these increases with the results of our Lean Six Sigma efforts and improved operations. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was a loss of $7 million compared to a gain in third quarter 2010. Compared to Q2 of 2011, volumes were slightly higher, up 2% while prices were flat. Year-to-date, OSB had an operating loss of $48 million compared to a profit of $38 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods with a loss of $20 million in 2011 and income of $67 million in 2010. Pricing accounted for more than 100% of this decline or $91 million dollars.
Refer to Slide 8 of the presentation for Siding. This includes our SmartSide and Canexel product lines and a small amount of commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the third quarter, Siding had operating income of $12 million, which is higher than the $9 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in Siding was $16 million compared to $13 million in Q3 of 2010. For the quarter, sales were up 7% with unit volumes higher by 10% in SmartSide and lower in Canexel by 29% compared to the same quarter last year.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 5% due to a general price increase implemented in the first part of the year to cover increased production cost. Canexel price has also showed an increase of 5%, but this is largely due to Canexel being sold in Canada in Canadian dollars and as the Canadian dollar strengthening against the U.S. equivalent.
Year-to-date, Siding had operating income of $36 million compared to income of $40 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period is $49 million this year versus $54 million in 2010. The OSB pricing on the Hayward volume lowered earnings by about $5 million and accounted for most of the shift.
Slide 9 of the presentation is the Engineered Wood segment. This includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber and Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. For Q3, reported loss of $3 million compared to a loss of $5 million in Q3 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in EWP segment was just slightly negative in the third quarter compared to a loss of almost $3 million in the second quarter of 2010. Volumes of I-Joist were up 26%, while volumes of our LVL/LSL were up 71% compared to same quarter last year. This looks like a big number. Let me just remind you that in third quarter of 2010, we saw significant reductions in the inventory in the channel and, therefore, the increases shown this quarter are a bit of an anomaly with the exception that we did see an increase in our exports for these product line.
Pricing was down 3% in I-Joist, 4% in LVL/LSL, primarily due to changes in product mix. Year-to-date, EWP had an operating loss of $12 million compared to a loss of $16 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period with a loss of about $1 million this year compared with $6 million loss in 2010.
While there's no slide for our other building products, let me make a few comments. Overall, we're showing a loss of $1 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to income of $1 million in the third quarter of 2010. For the quarter, sales were $46 million, up 11% from the $41 million recorded in Q3 of last year, primarily driven by our South America operations.
Year-to-date, other building products and operating income of $4 million compared to income of $5 million same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $14 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2010. 
We did have a $4 million foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to a very slight loss in the same quarter last year. This loss was driven by the significant temporary increase in the U.S. dollar at the end of September. In early October, the U.S. dollar again dropped in relation to Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and Chilean peso, so most of this gain we have recovered.
Slide 10 is a summary of the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalent investments or restricted cash were $375 million. This is an increase around $7 million from last June 30. Working capital of $216 million, net cash of $137 million, and we spent about $13 million in capital expenditures. 
One final comment before I turn it to Rick, in October, we did modify and extend our asset-based loan agreement with our banking group to increase availability, lower our cost and reduce the administrative burden. We did file an 8-K on this extension of a timely manner. Key items including extended maturity from September 10, 2012, to October 14, 2016; decrease the interest rate payable for certain types of loans that permits LP to include in its borrowing base certain vendor-managed inventory and then increase our flexibility to incur and prepay certain types of debt.
With that, let me turn over to Rick."

Before I get started, I can't -- resist props go out to my LSU Tigers over the weekend, which offset our Titans loss over the weekend. It is beautiful here, although the results aren't that beautiful. So this morning in my prepared remarks, I'll add some color to LP's performance in Q3 and then follow with a bit of a look into Q4 and how we presently see 2012 evolving.
As is customary, I want to begin with safety. Through our Q3, our year-to-date total incident rate was 4.2, and we are still on a record-breaking pace of improvement in keeping our peoples more safe every year for the last decade. Our Q3 was nothing to brag about us as we did experience a few more nicks and [indiscernible] standing in Q3 of last year. But year-to-date, we are still ahead of last year's performance. 
From an environmental perspective, we experienced no notices of violation for the quarter and experienced no environmental fines. 
Our Lean Six Sigma efforts continue to yield good results with our year-to-date returns at 6.7:1, and about 20% of our workforce are participating on improvement teams.
As Curt said, capital spending in Q3 was a little under $5 million and around $13 million year-to-date. I still do expect us to come in around that $20 million number that I have previously offered for guidance for 2011, exclusive of the capital, of course, that we spent to complete the purchase of the Brazil mill this year. 
As Curt mentioned, our cash and investments are $375 million, and we are net cash of $144 million. 
Early guidance on capital for 2012, I'm going to put out there around $25 million. I'll update you on that in February after I've had a chance to fully review those plans in more detail. 
Raw material costs are performing about as we suggested to you back in January that we thought they would. We expect our raw material price variation to end up a negative of about $25 million at the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2010. The lion's share of that is in resins binders and wax at a little bit over $15 million and negative valuation, and the other $6.5 million is in the zinc borate and the paper overlay which we alerted you to on our Siding business earlier in the year. 
Now let me make a few comments on each one of our major businesses and our other reporting segments that include South America. 
I'll begin with OSB. This business was most of the negative result. Although sales and production volumes were slightly up Q3 to Q3, our sales price was down against Q3 of last year. And as Curt mentioned, we were particularly disadvantaged with very low West Coast pricing, where we have a significant presence because of our Peace Valley and Dawson Creek OSB mills. About 27% of our volume was sold into the Western markets in Q3.
Manufacturing costs for OSB were pretty much in line with Q3 of 2010 except the resin binder and wax costs, which were up 18%. Our value-added component was up about 12% in volume over our Q3 2010 and made up about 35% of our total mix on a volume basis in the quarter. 
OSB ran at an effective operating rate of about 70% for the quarter and about 55% of its total capacity, counting the currently indefinitely shut mills of Chambord and Clarke County and now Dawson Creek. During the quarter, we did make the decision to indefinitely shut down the pressing operation at Dawson Creek and to move that volume to Peace Valley. Dawson has a rated production capacity of about 390 million feet per year. This mill will stay open to process TechShield blanks but will not press Board until there is a future need for its production sometime in the future.
During Q3, LP OSB sold about 6 million feet to Asia and exported about 2% of its total sales volume. 
Our Siding business makes a better story Q3 to Q3. Net sales were up 7% and EBIT was improved 27% Q3 to Q3. SmartSide volume was up 10% and our Canexel volume was up 29%. And as we came off allocation, as the Canadian housing market slowed down on the quarter.
With product mix included, Q3 to Q3 pricing for SmartSide was up 5%; and for Canexel, it was also up 5%. One caution there is a reminder that Q3 of last year for Siding was a very, very low quarter as we came out of the bump that we had in the second quarter as people were taking advantage of that Home Buyer Tax Credit.
Moving onto Engineered Wood, EWP improved in a Q3 to Q3 comparison by about 35% on an EBIT basis, but this also needs to be tampered with the realization that Q3 2010 was a horrible quarter in Engineered Wood Products in the marketplace. Sales volumes of I-Joist, LVL and LSL were all significantly better than Q3 of 2010. The pricing was 3% and 4%, worse respectively on I-Joist and then the LVL/LSL combination. 
Year-to-date, EBITDA for EWP although still negative has improved 79%, largely due to growing international sales, primarily LSL to Australia. And the LSL/LVL volume combination year-to-date is up 14%. 
In South America, while we do not yet report part of this -- this part of the business separately, both LP Chile and LP Brazil are having their best year so far. Both are EBIT positive and contributing cash to LP. In Chile, both mills continue to run at near capacity and domestic demand remains strong. We are under some pricing pressure in Chile from imports. 
In Brazil, we are operating our Ponta Grossa mill at about half of its capacity, and the decision to start up the second thermal oil line there will probably put off, be put off until Q2 of next year. I just don't know yet, and that will be based upon the business level at that time. About 20% to 25% of the Brazil volume is going to China for interior use. 
In terms of looking at the markets for the rest of this fourth quarter, we expect to see the seasonal falloff in domestic markets across all product lines. My sense right now is that Q1 of 2012 will be relatively slow. The media and housing start forecast for next year is currently a little bit over 650,000 new starts with the gross from -- the growth from this year being primarily in multi-family. And current thinking for multi-family is for it to be up 40,000 to 50,000 units from 2011 into 2012.
In general, I think the housing market remains weak about anyway you slice it. We are still facing high unemployment, slow household formation, declines in home prices and continued foreclosures. But we have seen a few positive indicators of late. Existing home sales have been improving. Home inventories for sale are going down in total, and there is a slowdown in the number of foreclosures. And then there was a nice bump in the September housing start numbers that were recently released.
As I finish my prepared remarks, I want to comment on the other announcement that we've put out this morning, and that is the organizational changes that we're making. Obviously, we are beginning a transition for me to eventually from retire from LP. I've recently completed 7 years of service as CEO with this company. So bringing on a very confident Chief Financial Officer was a step in that planning process. And then turning over the direct leadership for operations of the company to Curt as the new Chief Operating Officer, is a logical step as well. We plan to allow Sallie Bailey, our new CFO, time to get fully up to speed on LP and for Curt to have a time to put his operating head back on before I firm up my departure with our Board of Directors. When we think that we are ready, we will firm that up and we will announce it, and that's about all I can give you on that right now. 
As I close, I do want to acknowledge that this is the last time that I will be working this call with Curt in Curt's current role as CFO. Sallie will become LP's new CFO in December. And as Curt will be moving to Chief Operating Officer, is a position that's been created temporarily for succession purposes and around my eventual retirement. Curt and I have been doing these calls and all of our trips to New York now for 7 years together, and then Curt worked them with my predecessor for the 7 years before that. Going forward, Curt will be on these calls but we'll be adding more of the color commentary as the Chief Operating Officer. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Curt to handle questions."

So we look at the demand to be quite strong down there. Our next challenge will be then to penetrate the building markets in Brazil, and it's not out of the question for us within a couple of years to be thinking that we will want to build another mill in South America, although we haven't identified exactly where yet.

So we're currently working now on getting approval to construct SIPs, which is a structurally insulated panel, which is like the Styrofoam or the foam in the middle and you put a piece of OSB on either side of it, you make a sandwich, and that is being heavily used in the Chilean market right now for construction.

With me today are Rick Frost, LP's CEO; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, who are our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the third quarter of 2011, followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and a few balance sheet items. Rick will then take over to discuss the general market environment in which we operated in the quarter, his perspective on our most recent results and some thoughts on the remainder of this year and into next year. Rick will then provide a bit more color about the organizational announcement that LP made this morning. Following this, he'll turn it back over to me to answer your questions.
As we've done in the past, this call is opened up to the public and we are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will reference the slide numbers during my comments. 
We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we will file our Form 10-Q shortly.
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment that's included on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of our use of non-GAAP financial information that is discussed on Slide 3 of the presentation, the appendix attached to some of the necessary reconciliations that have been supplemented by the 8-K filing we made this morning. I'm not going to re-read these statements but I will incorporate them with this reference.
Before I begin my detailed discussion and results for the quarter, I do want to focus on 3 factors that affected our reported results this quarter and year to date: housing activity, OSB pricing and a non-cash impairment. 
For Q3, housing starts as reported by the U.S. Department of the Census were 6% higher than the third quarter of 2010, when activity tailed off due to the expiration of the housing tax credit. For the first 9 months of this year, actual housing starts were 2% below the same period in 2010.
For the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011, our OSB prices were 7% and 19% lower than the same  periods in 2010. The swing in pricing for Q3 caused a $9 million reduction in earnings compared to the same quarter last year and had a cumulative negative effect on year-to-date operating results of a little over $95 million between the OSB and Siding segments.
In the quarter, accounting rules did require us to take an impairment against the carrying value of our Houlton, Maine LSL mill. This non-cash pre-tax impairment was for $62 million. I want to be very clear that this is an accounting decision, not a business decision. We remain committed to this important product line and expect it to be a strong contributor to earnings when the housing market recovers.
Now let me go to the numbers. Refer to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of Q3 results compared to same quarter last year and the prior quarter. We're reporting a net loss for the third quarter of $66 million or $0.49 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of a little over $350 million. 
For the same period last year, we reported a net loss of $32 million or $0.24 per diluted share on sales from continuing operations of $323 million. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations had a loss of $7 million in the quarter compared to a positive $4 million in Q3 of 2010. 
Moving in to the tax rate and continuing operations between the quarters, in Q3 we had a tax -- effective tax rate of 26%, compared to a 35% in Q3 of 2010. As I've discussed the last several quarters, this difference is primarily related to the requirement to put a valuation allowance against our losses in Canada above a specific threshold due to these accounting rules. Compounding this is the impact of discontinued operations which by accounting regulations are required to be benefited at the statutory rate of 38.7%. That results in a lower benefit rate on continuing operations.
Slide 5 of the presentation is a discussion of year-to-date results compared to the same period last year. The year-to-date, we're reporting a net loss of $124 million on sales of $1 billion during this period. The same period last year, we reported net loss of $32 million on sales of $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $4 million compared to income of $81 million in the first 9 months of 2010. The tax rate in continuing operations from the first 9 months was 24% compared to 32% in the prior year.
Slide 6 of the presentation is a discussion of special charges. As I mentioned earlier, we did take a significant impairment on the carrying value of our Houlton, Maine, LSL mill. In addition to the impairment at Houlton, we also adjusted the values of some of the assets held for sale to reflect the current reality in the market. This is about a $3 million negative adjustment. As we've said over the last few quarters, we are willing seller but it's hard to get a willing buyer to the table on some of these asset sales.
In the other operating charges credited the bulk of the positive adjustment is related to a take-back of around $10.5 million from claims reserves set up for the ABTco hardboard-class action. This is based on recent activity.
The impact of adjusting for these items gives an adjusted loss from continuing operations of $26 million or $0.19 per share. 
Not shown in this slide is a charge we took in our discontinued operations to increase the reserves for the decking class action, again this is based on a continuous analysis and review of the data. The increase was about $8 million.
Let me discuss the performance of each segment. On Slide 7 is our OSB segment. We had an operating loss of $16 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $5 million in Q3 of 2009. For the quarter, we had an increase of 5% in volume and an average sales price of 7% lower. As I mentioned earlier, the decrease in the sales price accounts for most of this change, a $9 million reduction in earnings and adjusted EBITDA. This may seem a little bit odd as the ops coated Random Lengths 7/16s North Central price index was actually slightly higher than Q3 of last year. But if LP is a national footprint, our prices are influenced by the other regions, particularly the West Coast, where pricing was down 17% quarter-over-quarter.
Additionally, higher raw material costs, principally reserve [ph] in energy and a higher Canadian dollar increased our costs. However, we were able to offset these increases with the results of our Lean Six Sigma efforts and improved operations. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the OSB segment for the quarter was a loss of $7 million compared to a gain in third quarter 2010. Compared to Q2 of 2011, volumes were slightly higher, up 2% while prices were flat. Year-to-date, OSB had an operating loss of $48 million compared to a profit of $38 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable periods with a loss of $20 million in 2011 and income of $67 million in 2010. Pricing accounted for more than 100% of this decline or $91 million dollars.
Refer to Slide 8 of the presentation for Siding. This includes our SmartSide and Canexel product lines and a small amount of commodity OSB produced in our Hayward mill. For the third quarter, Siding had operating income of $12 million, which is higher than the $9 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations in Siding was $16 million compared to $13 million in Q3 of 2010. For the quarter, sales were up 7% with unit volumes higher by 10% in SmartSide and lower in Canexel by 29% compared to the same quarter last year.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 5% due to a general price increase implemented in the first part of the year to cover increased production cost. Canexel prices also showed an increase of 5%, but this is largely due to Canexel being sold in Canada in Canadian dollars and as the Canadian dollar strengthening against the U.S. equivalent.
Year-to-date, Siding had operating income of $36 million compared to income of $40 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $49 million this year versus $54 million in 2010. The OSB pricing on the Hayward volume lowered earnings by about $5 million and accounted for most of the shift.
Slide 9 of the presentation is the Engineered Wood segment. This includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber and Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. For Q3, reported loss of $3 million compared to a loss of $5 million in Q3 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in EWP segment was just slightly negative in the third quarter compared to a loss of almost $3 million in the second quarter of 2010. Volumes of I-Joist were up 26%, while volumes of our LVL/LSL were up 71% compared to same quarter last year. This looks like a big number. Let me just remind you that in third quarter of 2010, we saw significant reductions in the inventory in the channel and, therefore, the increases shown this quarter are a bit of an anomaly, with the exception that we did see an increase in our exports for these product line.
Pricing was down 3% in I-Joist, 4% in LVL/LSL, primarily due to changes in product mix. Year-to-date, EWP had an operating loss of $12 million compared to a loss of $16 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was a loss of about $1 million this year compared to a $6 million loss in 2010.
While there's no slide for our other building products, let me make a few comments. Overall, we're showing a loss of $1 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to income of $1 million in the third quarter of 2010. For the quarter, sales were $46 million, up 11% from the $41 million recorded in Q3 of last year, primarily driven by our South America operations.
Year-to-date, other building products and operating income of $4 million compared to income of $5 million same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the comparable period was $14 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2010. 
We did have a $4 million foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to a very slight loss in the same quarter last year. This loss was driven by the significant temporary increase in the U.S. dollar at the end of September. In early October, the U.S. dollar again dropped in relation to Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and Chilean peso, so most of this gain we have recovered.
Slide 10 is a summary of the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalent investments or restricted cash were $375 million. This is an increase around $7 million from last June 30. Working capital of $216 million, net cash of $137 million, and we spent about $13 million in capital expenditures. 
One final comment before I turn it to Rick, in October, we did modify and extend our asset-based loan agreement with our banking group to increase availability, lower our cost and reduce the administrative burden. We did file an 8-K on this extension of a timely manner. Key items including extended maturity from September 10, 2012, to October 14, 2016; decrease the interest rate payable for certain types of loans that permits LP to include in its borrowing base certain vendor-managed inventory and then increased our flexibility to incur and prepay certain types of debt.
With that, let me turn over to Rick."

Before I get started, I can't -- resist props go out to my LSU Tigers over the weekend, which offset our Titans loss over the weekend. It is beautiful here, although the results aren't that beautiful. So this morning in my prepared remarks, I'll add some color to LP's performance in Q3 and then follow with a bit of a look into Q4 and how we presently see 2012 evolving.
As is customary, I want to begin with safety. Through our Q3, our year-to-date total incident rate was .42, and we are still on a record-breaking pace of improvement in keeping our peoples more safe every year for the last decade. Our Q3 was nothing to brag about us as we did experience a few more nicks and hickies than in Q3 of last year. But year-to-date, we are still ahead of last year's performance. 
From an environmental perspective, we experienced no notices of violation for the quarter and experienced no environmental fines. 
Our Lean Six Sigma efforts continue to yield good results with our year-to-date returns at 6.7:1, and about 20% of our workforce are participating on improvement teams.
As Curt said, capital spending in Q3 was a little under $5 million and around $13 million year-to-date. I still do expect us to come in around that $20 million number that I have previously offered for guidance for 2011, exclusive of the capital, of course, that we spent to complete the purchase of the Brazil mill this year. 
As Curt mentioned, our cash and investments are $375 million, and we are net cash of $144 million. 
Early guidance on capital for 2012, I'm going to put out there around $25 million. I'll update you on that in February after I've had a chance to fully review those plans in more detail. 
Raw material costs are performing about as we suggested to you back in January that we thought they would. We expect our raw material price variation to end up a negative of about $25 million at the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2010. The lion's share of that is in resins binders and wax at a little bit over $15 million and negative variation, and the other $6.5 million is in the zinc borate and the paper overlay which we alerted you to on our Siding business earlier in the year. 
Now let me make a few comments on each one of our major businesses and our other reporting segments that include South America. 
I'll begin with OSB. This business was most of the negative result. Although sales and production volumes were slightly up Q3 to Q3, our sales price was down against Q3 of last year. And as Curt mentioned, we were particularly disadvantaged with very low West Coast pricing, where we have a significant presence because of our Peace Valley and Dawson Creek OSB mills. About 27% of our volume was sold into the Western markets in Q3.
Manufacturing costs for OSB were pretty much in line with Q3 of 2010 except the resin binder and wax costs, which were up 18%. Our value-added component was up about 12% in volume over our Q3 2010 and made up about 35% of our total mix on a volume basis in the quarter. 
OSB ran at an effective operating rate of about 70% for the quarter and at about 55% of its total capacity, counting the currently indefinitely shut mills of Chambord, Clarke County, and now Dawson Creek. During the quarter, we did make the decision to indefinitely shut down the pressing operation at Dawson Creek and to move that volume to Peace Valley. Dawson has a rated production capacity of about 390 million feet per year. This mill will stay open to process TechShield blanks but will not press Board until there is a future need for its production sometime in the future.
During Q3, LP OSB sold about 6 million feet to Asia and exported about 2% of its total sales volume. 
Our Siding business makes a better story Q3 to Q3. Net sales were up 7% and EBIT was improved 27% Q3 to Q3. SmartSide volume was up 10% and our Canexel volume was off 29%. And as we came off allocation, as the Canadian housing market slowed down on the quarter.
With product mix included, Q3 to Q3 pricing for SmartSide was up 5%; and for Canexel, it was also up 5%. One caution there is a reminder that Q3 of last year for Siding was a very, very low quarter as we came out of the bump that we had in the second quarter as people were taking advantage of that Home Buyer Tax Credit.
Moving onto Engineered Wood, EWP improved in a Q3 to Q3 comparison by about 35% on an EBIT basis, but this also needs to be tempered with the realization that Q3 2010 was a horrible quarter in Engineered Wood Products in the marketplace. Sales volumes of I-Joist, LVL and LSL were all significantly better than Q3 of 2010. The pricing was 3% and 4%, worse respectively on I-Joist and then the LVL/LSL combination. 
Year-to-date, EBITDA for EWP although still negative has improved 79%, largely due to growing international sales, primarily LSL to Australia. And the LSL/LVL volume combination year-to-date is up 14%. 
In South America, while we do not yet report part of this -- this part of the business separately, both LP Chile and LP Brazil are having their best year so far. Both are EBIT positive and contributing cash to LP. In Chile, both mills continue to run at near capacity and domestic demand remains strong. We are under some pricing pressure in Chile from imports. 
In Brazil, we are operating our Ponta Grossa mill at about half of its capacity, and the decision to start up the second thermal oil line there will probably put off -- be put off until Q2 of next year. I just don't know yet, and that will be based upon the business level at that time. About 20% to 25% of the Brazil volume is going to China for interior use. 
In terms of looking at the markets for the rest of this fourth quarter, we expect to see the seasonal falloff in domestic markets across all product lines. My sense right now is that Q1 of 2012 will be relatively slow. The median housing start forecast for next year is currently a little bit over 650,000 new starts with the gross from -- the growth from this year being primarily in multi-family. And current thinking for multi-family is for it to be up 40,000 to 50,000 units from 2011 into 2012.
In general, I think the housing market remains weak about anyway you slice it. We are still facing high unemployment, slow household formation, declines in home prices and continued foreclosures. But we have seen a few positive indicators of late. Existing home sales have been improving. Home inventories for sale are going down in total, and there is a slowdown in the number of foreclosures. And then there was a nice bump in the September housing start numbers that were recently released.
As I finish my prepared remarks, I want to comment on the other announcement that we've put out this morning, and that is the organizational changes that we're making. Obviously, we are beginning a transition for me to eventually retire from LP. I've recently completed 7 years of service as CEO with this company. So bringing on a very confident Chief Financial Officer was a step in that planning process. And then turning over the direct leadership for operations of the company to Curt as the new Chief Operating Officer, is a logical step as well. We plan to allow Sallie Bailey, our new CFO, time to get fully up to speed on LP and for Curt to have a time to put his operating hat back on before I firm up my departure with our Board of Directors. When we think that we are ready, we will firm that up and we will announce it, and that's about all I can give you on that right now. 
As I close, I do want to acknowledge that this is the last time that I will be working this call with Curt in Curt's current role as CFO. Sallie will become LP's new CFO in December. And as Curt will be moving to Chief Operating Officer, is a position that's been created temporarily for succession purposes and around my eventual retirement. Curt and I have been doing these calls and all of our trips to New York now for 7 years together, and then Curt worked them with my predecessor for the 7 years before that. Going forward, Curt will be on these calls but we'll be adding more of the color commentary as the Chief Operating Officer. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Curt to handle questions."

If you can remember, we started out at about 2%, and then we were pretty happy when we got to about 23% or 24%, but the earthquake last year proved that the ability for wood frame housing to sustain seismic activity completed that conversion for us. So we look at the demand to be quite strong down there. Our next challenge will be then to penetrate the building markets in Brazil, and it's not out of the question for us within a couple of years to be thinking that we will want to build another mill in South America, although we haven't identified exactly where yet. So are still pretty bullish on that and it is an advantage being in country."
