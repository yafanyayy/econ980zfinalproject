I'm pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 30% in the fiscal fourth quarter to $1.12 and approximately 33% in the fiscal year to $3.07. We are pleased that in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength, our performance continues to be a strong one.
During the fourth quarter, we opened six Bed Bath & Beyond stores, five buybuy BABY stores and one Harmon Face Values store as well as relocating one Bed Bath & Beyond store. Consolidated store space at February 26, 2011, was approximately 35.1 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over the last year's fourth quarter. 
Since the beginning of the fiscal first quarter of 2011, we've opened two and relocated two additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Including these stores we currently operate 1,141 stores, including 984 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico and Canada as well as 66 Christmas Tree Shops, 45 buybuy BABY stores and 46 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are partnering a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More. 
During fiscal 2011 including the two stores we've opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be approximately 45 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011 mix of store openings will be relatively comparable to fiscal 2010. As always, as the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be revised as we gain greater visibility.
We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites as well as to continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions.
As we have previously said, we believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to create in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast-to-coast. Additionally we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings.
We continue to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise guys offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We're confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

We are pleased that our fourth quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talent of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. As Warren said, we also are pleased that in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength, our performance continues to be a strong one. While a number of economic challenges persist, including higher commodity prices, relatively high unemployment, sluggish housing market and fragile consumer confidence, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at every day low prices, with superior customer service.
As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers overall shopping experience and we remain committed to being our customers first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well-positioned to grow profitably, compete for an increase our market share and over the long-term, continued to grow our shareholder value.

Turning to our fiscal 2010 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter were $1.12, an increase of approximately 30% when compared to the $0.86 per share that we earned in last year's fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, net earnings per diluted share were $3.07 compared with $2.30 last year, an increase of approximately 33%. Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $2.5 billion, approximately 11.6% higher than in the prior year. Fourth quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 8.5% compared with an increase of 11.5% last year. 
For the full year of fiscal 2010, net sales were approximately $8.8 billion, about 11.9% higher than last year. Comp store sales for the fiscal full year increased by approximately 7.8% compared with an increase of approximately 4.4% last year. Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 43% of net sales compared to approximately 42.6% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from a decrease in coupon expense and a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. Gross profit for the full year was approximately 41.4% of net sales compared to approximately 41% of net sales for fiscal 2009. This increase in the gross profit margins for the year was primarily due to a decrease in coupon expense as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general, administrative expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately 24.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.1% of net sales in last year's fourth quarter, a decrease of approximately 150 basis points. This decrease can be primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, which benefited from the approximately 8.5% increase in comp store sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the full year were approximately 26.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.5% of net sales in fiscal 2009, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points.
This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower payroll and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, as well as a relative decrease in advertising expenses, resulting from a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7.8% increase in annual comp store sales.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 190 basis points. All of fiscal 2010, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 220 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our provision income taxes was approximately 38.7% compared to approximately 39.1% for the comparable quarter last year. For the full year, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.8% compared to approximately 39.1% for fiscal 2009.
Our capital spending for all of fiscal 2010 was approximately $183 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvement, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
In addition, we anticipate completing our current share repurchase program in early fiscal 2011. And thereafter, beginning our $2 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in December 2010, in which we plan to complete approximately two years after it commences. 
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Warren and Steve's, our results exceeded our planet and we are earned $1.12 per diluted share in our fiscal fourth quarter and $3.07 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2010. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal fourth quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the coming year. The following are our major planning assumptions for fiscal 2011. One, including the two stores opened so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be approximately 45 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011's  mix of store openings will be relatively comparable to fiscal 2010. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be revised as we gain greater visibility.
We will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in selected stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise.
Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. 
Three, we're remodeling a two to four percentage increase in comparable store sales for the first quarter and full fiscal year.
Four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2011.
Five, assuming these sales levels, and modeling advertising events that are generally consistent with fiscal 2010, in addition to planning, the continuation of this shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling a relatively consistent operating profit margin for both the fiscal first quarter and the full year.
Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2010. Seven, the first quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated in the mid-to high 30s percentage range with expected variability as taxable events occur.
Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements, including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, are now planned to be approximately $250 million, which of course, remains subject to the timing of projects.
Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is estimated to be approximately $190 million.
10, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources.
11, we anticipate completing our current share repurchase program in early fiscal 2011, which has a approximately $136.9 million remaining and thereafter, beginning our $2 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in December 2010 and which we plan to complete approximately two years after it commences. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors including business and marketing conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $0.58 to $0.61 for the fiscal first quarter of 2011. For all of fiscal 2011, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by approximately 10% to 15%. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt-free. We ended fiscal 2010 with cash and cash equivalents and investments securities of approximately $1.9 million. This includes approximately $112.9 million of investment related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.2 million to reflect their current maximum liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is being temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. 
During the fourth quarter, we had approximately $8.4 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. Subsequent to the fourth quarter, we had approximately $5.8 million of auction rate securities redemptions at par, leaving a balance of approximately $107.1 million of these securities. As we have said in the past, and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of February 26, 2011, inventories were approximately $2 billion or $56.17 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher than in the prior year primarily due to increased inventory levels required to support recent increases in comp store sales and timing of receipts.
Consolidated shareholders equity at the very 26, 2011, was approximately $3.9 million, which is net of all share repurchases including the approximately $199 million representing approximately 4.1 million shares repurchased during fiscal fourth quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the first quarter ending on May 28, 2011, will be on Wednesday, June 22, 2011. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be on our offices this evening, April 6, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

Turning to our fiscal 2010 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter were $1.12, an increase of approximately 30% when compared to the $0.86 per share that we earned in last year's fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, net earnings per diluted share were $3.07 compared with $2.30 last year, an increase of approximately 33%. Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $2.5 billion, approximately 11.6% higher than in the prior year. Fourth quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 8.5% compared with an increase of 11.5% last year. 
For the full year of fiscal 2010, net sales were approximately $8.8 billion, about 11.9% higher than last year. Comp store sales for the fiscal full year increased by approximately 7.8% compared with an increase of approximately 4.4% last year. Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 43% of net sales compared to approximately 42.6% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from a decrease in coupon expense and a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. Gross profit for the full year was approximately 41.4% of net sales compared to approximately 41% of net sales for fiscal 2009. This increase in the gross profit margin for the year was primarily due to a decrease in coupon expense as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately 24.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.1% of net sales in last year's fourth quarter, a decrease of approximately 150 basis points. This decrease can be primarily be attributed to lower payroll and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, which benefited from the approximately 8.5% increase in comp store sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the full year were approximately 26.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.5% of net sales in fiscal 2009, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points.
This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower payroll and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, as well as a relative decrease in advertising expenses, resulting from a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7.8% increase in annual comp store sales.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 190 basis points. All of fiscal 2010, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 220 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.7% compared to approximately 39.1% for the comparable quarter last year. For the full year, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.8% compared to approximately 39.1% for fiscal 2009.

In addition, we anticipate completing our current share repurchase program in early fiscal 2011. And thereafter, beginning our $2 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in December 2010, and which we plan to complete approximately two years after it commences. 
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

As you heard from Warren and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $1.12 per diluted share in our fiscal fourth quarter and $3.07 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2010. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal fourth quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the coming year. The following are our major planning assumptions for fiscal 2011. One. Including the two stores opened so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be approximately 45 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011's  mix of store openings will be relatively comparable to fiscal 2010. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be revised as we gain greater visibility.
We will continue to place Harmon Face Values' health and beauty care offerings in selected stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise.
Two. We expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. 
Three. We're remodeling a two- to four-percentage increase in comparable store sales for the first quarter and full fiscal year.
Four. Based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2011.
Five. Assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are generally consistent with fiscal 2010, and addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling a relatively consistent operating profit margin for both the fiscal first quarter and the full year.
Six. Interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2010. 
Seven. The first quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated in the mid to high 30s percentage range with expected variability as taxable events occur.
Eight. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements, including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, are now planned to be approximately $250 million, which of course, remains subject to the timing of projects.
Nine. Depreciation for fiscal 2011 is estimated to be approximately $190 million.
10. We expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources.
11. We anticipate completing our current share repurchase program in early fiscal 2011, which has approximately $136.9 million remaining, and thereafter, beginning our $2 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in December 2010, and which we plan to complete approximately two years after it commences. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $0.58 to $0.61 for the fiscal first quarter of 2011. For all of fiscal 2011, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by approximately 10% to 15%. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt-free. We ended fiscal 2010 with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes approximately $112.9 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.2 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. 
During the fourth quarter, we had approximately $8.4 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. Subsequent to the fourth quarter, we had approximately $5.8 million of auction rate securities redemptions at par, leaving a balance of approximately $107.1 million of these securities. As we have said in the past, and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of February 26, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2 billion or $56.17 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher than in the prior year primarily due to increased inventory levels required to support recent increases in comp store sales and timing of receipts.
Consolidated shareholders equity at February 26, 2011, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of all share repurchases, including the approximately $199 million representing approximately 4.1 million shares repurchased during fiscal fourth quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the first quarter ending on May 28, 2011, will be on Wednesday, June 22, 2011. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, April 6, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

I'm pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 30% in the fiscal fourth quarter to $1.12 and approximately 33% in the fiscal year to $3.07. We are pleased that in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength, our performance continues to be a strong one.
During the fourth quarter, we opened six Bed Bath & Beyond stores, five buybuy BABY stores and one Harmon Face Values store, as well as relocating one Bed Bath & Beyond store. Consolidated store space at February 26, 2011 was approximately 35.1 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's fourth quarter. 
Since the beginning of the fiscal first quarter of 2011, we've opened two and relocated two additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,141 stores, including 984 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 66 Christmas Tree Shops, 45 buybuy BABY stores and 46 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More. 
During fiscal 2011, including the two stores we've opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be approximately 45 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011's mix of store openings will be relatively comparable to fiscal 2010. As always, as the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be revised as we gain greater visibility.
We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as to continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions.
As we have previously said, we believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to create in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and selectively place health and beauty care offerings in all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings.
We continue to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We're confident that we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

We are pleased that our fourth quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talent of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. As Warren said, we also are pleased that in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength, our performance continues to be a strong one. While a number of economic challenges persist, including higher commodity prices, relatively high unemployment, a sluggish housing market and fragile consumer confidence, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service.
As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share and over the long term, continue to grow shareholder value. As always, we remain focused on building a business that stands the test of time. And taking this long-term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts, and through the ongoing effort to cross merchandise and leverage our best practices across all our concepts, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.  
Turning to our fiscal 2010 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter were $1.12, an increase of approximately 30% when compared to the $0.86 per share that we earned in last year's fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2010, net earnings per diluted share were $3.07 compared with $2.30 last year, an increase of approximately 33%. Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $2.5 billion, approximately 11.6% higher than in the prior year. Fourth quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 8.5%, compared with an increase of 11.5% last year. 
For the full year of fiscal 2010, net sales were approximately $8.8 billion, about 11.9% higher than last year. Comp store sales for the fiscal full year increased by approximately 7.8%, compared with an increase of approximately 4.4% last year. Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 43% of net sales, compared to approximately 42.6% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from a decrease in coupon expense and a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. Gross profit for the full year was approximately 41.4% of net sales, compared to approximately 41% of net sales for fiscal 2009. This increase in the gross profit margin for the year was primarily due to a decrease in coupon expense as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately 24.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.1% of net sales in last year's fourth quarter, a decrease of approximately 150 basis points. This decrease can be primarily be attributed to lower payroll and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, which benefited from the approximately 8.5% increase in comp store sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the full year were approximately 26.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.5% of net sales in fiscal 2009, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points. This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower payroll and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, as well as a relative decrease in advertising expenses, resulting from a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7.8% increase in annual comp store sales.
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 190 basis points. For all of fiscal 2010, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 220 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.7%, compared to approximately 39.1% for the comparable quarter last year. For the full year, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38.8%, compared to approximately 39.1% for fiscal 2009.
Our capital spending for all of fiscal 2010 was approximately $183 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
In addition, we anticipate completing our current share repurchase program in early fiscal 2011. And thereafter, beginning our $2 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in December 2010, and which we plan to complete approximately two years after it commences. 
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

Nine. Depreciation for fiscal 2011 is estimated to be approximately $190 million.
10. We expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources.
11.

Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $0.58 to $0.61 for the fiscal first quarter of 2011. For all of fiscal 2011, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by approximately 10% to 15%. Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. We ended fiscal 2010 with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes approximately $112.9 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.2 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. 
During the fourth quarter, we had approximately $8.4 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. Subsequent to the fourth quarter, we had approximately $5.8 million of auction rate securities redemptions at par, leaving a balance of approximately $107.1 million of these securities. As we have said in the past, and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of February 26, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2 billion or $56.17 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher than in the prior year, primarily due to increased inventory levels required to support recent increases in comp store sales and timing of receipts.
Consolidated shareholders equity at February 26, 2011, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of all share repurchases, including the approximately $199 million representing approximately 4.1 million shares repurchased during fiscal fourth quarter of 2010.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the first quarter ending on May 28, 2011 will be on Wednesday, June 22, 2011.

I'm pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 38% in the fiscal first quarter to $0.72. We are pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance, in terms of earning growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength as we continue to work to build a business that will stand the test of time.
During the first quarter, we opened 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 2 buybuy BABY stores, as well as closed 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store and 1 Harmon store. Additionally, we continue to relocate and renovate Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at May 28, 2011, was approximately 35.2 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's first quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2011, we have opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store, 5 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Christmas Tree Shop store. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,149 stores, including 985 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 67 Christmas Tree Shops, 52 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2011, including the 12 stores we have opened today, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be approximately 40 to 45 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011 store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010 with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores. As always, as the year progresses and we gain greater visibility, the total number of stores that we will open may be updated.
We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or right-size our stores in response to changing market conditions. We continue to believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast-to-coast. 
Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in stores across all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings.
We continue to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We continue to believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

We are pleased that our first quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talent of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
As Len said, we are also pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cost generation and overall strength as we continue to work to build a business that will stand the test of time. While a number of economic challenges persist, including higher commodity prices, relatively high unemployment, a sluggish housing market and fragile consumer confidence, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices, with superior customer service.  As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively, and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well-positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share, and over the long term, continue to grow shareholder value.
In taking this long term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts, and through the ongoing effort to cross merchandise and leverage our best practices across all our concepts, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal first quarter 2011 performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.72, an increase of approximately 38% when compared to the $0.52 per share that we earned in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $2.1 billion, approximately 9.7% higher than in the prior year.  First quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7%, compared with an increase of 8.4% last year.
Gross profit for the fiscal first quarter was approximately 40.6% of net sales, compared to approximately 40.3% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This increase in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower-margin categories. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter were approximately 26.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.6% of net sales in last year's fiscal first quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower payroll and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, as well as a relative decrease in advertising expenses as a result of a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces.  Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7% increase in comparable store sales. 
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal first quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 200 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal first quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37.6% compared to approximately 39.1% for the comparable quarter last year. This provision included a net after-tax benefit of approximately $3.8 million due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarter.
Our capital spending during the fiscal first quarter 2011 was approximately $33 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investment in our company to help position us for our long term success.
Also in the first quarter of 2011, we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, and thereafter began our $2 billion program authorized in December 2010, which we continue to model to be completed in approximately 2 years.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.
I'll now turn the call back the Gene. Gene?"

As you heard from a Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions, and we are $0.72 per diluted share in our fiscal first quarter.

As you heard from a Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions, and we are $0.72 per diluted share in our fiscal first quarter. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal first quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of our fiscal year. 
The following are our major planning assumptions or the remainder of fiscal 2011: 1, including the 12 stores open so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be approximately 40 to 45 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011 store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010, with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores. As the year progresses and we gain greater visibility, the total number of stores that we will open may be updated. We will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise; 2, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011; 3. We are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the second quarter and full fiscal year; 4, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 5% to 7% in the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2011;  5, assuming these sales levels, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit to be in the range of flat to slightly leveraged for the fiscal second quarter, and to be slightly leveraged for the full year; 6, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2010; 7, the second quarter and full year tax provision are estimated in the mid to high 30s  percent range with expected variability as taxable events occur; 8, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements, including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, continue to be planned at approximately $250 million, which of course, remains subject to the timing of projects; 9, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is estimated to be approximately $190 million;  10, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources; 11, in the first quarter, we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program and thereafter, began our $2 billion program authorized in December 2010, which we continue to model to be completed in approximately 2 years. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $0.77 to $0.82 for the fiscal second quarter of 2011. For all of fiscal 2011, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by approximately 15% to 20%. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal first quarter:  Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $2 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. This includes approximately $105.8 million of investments related to Auction Rate Securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.  During the first quarter, we had approximately $7.1 million of redemptions of Auction Rate Securities at par. Subsequent to the first quarter, we had approximately $4 million of Auction Rate Security redemptions at par, leaving a balance of approximately $101.8 million of these securities. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of May 28, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2.1 billion or $59.22 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher in the prior year, primarily to support increases in comp store sales and due to timing of receipts.
Consolidated shareholders equity at May 28, 2011 was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of all share repurchases, including the approximately $245 million representing approximately 4.8 million shares repurchased during the fiscal first quarter of 2011.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the second quarter ending on August 27, 2011 will be on Wednesday, September 21, 2011. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, June 22, to take your calls.

During the first quarter, we opened 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 2 buybuy BABY stores, as well as closed 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store and 1 Harmon store. Additionally, we continue to relocate and renovate Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at May 28, 2011, was approximately 35.2 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's first quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2011, we have opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store, 5 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Christmas Tree Shop store.

Turning to our fiscal first quarter 2011 performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.72, an increase of approximately 38% when compared to the $0.52 per share that we earned in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $2.1 billion, approximately 9.7% higher than in the prior year.

The following are our major planning assumptions or the remainder of fiscal 2011: One, including the 12 stores open so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be approximately 40 to 45 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011 store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010, with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores.

Three, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 5% to 7% in the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2011. Five, assuming these sales levels, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit to be in the range of flat to slightly leveraged for the fiscal second quarter and to be slightly leveraged for the full year. Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2010. Seven, the second quarter and full year tax provision are estimated in the mid- to high-30s  percent range with expected variability as taxable events occur. Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements, including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, continue to be planned at approximately $250 million, which of course, remains subject to the timing of projects. Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is estimated to be approximately $190 million. Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Eleven, in the first quarter, we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program and thereafter, began our $2 billion program authorized in December 2010, which we continue to model to be completed in approximately 2 years. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and the other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $0.77 to $0.82 for the fiscal second quarter of 2011. For all of fiscal 2011, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by approximately 15% to 20%. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal first quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $2 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. This includes approximately $105.8 million of investments related to Auction Rate Securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.  
During the first quarter, we had approximately $7.1 million of redemptions of Auction Rate Securities at par. Subsequent to the first quarter, we had approximately $4 million of Auction Rate Security redemptions at par, leaving a balance of approximately $101.8 million of these securities. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.

Inventory per square foot was higher in the prior year, primarily to support increases in comp store sales and due to timing of receipts.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at May 28, 2011 was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of all share repurchases, including the approximately $245 million representing approximately 4.8 million shares repurchased during the fiscal first quarter of 2011.

I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 38% in the fiscal first quarter to $0.72. We are pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earning growth,",617,"Good afternoon. I am pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 38% in the fiscal first quarter to $0.72. We are pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earning growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength as we continue to work to build a business that will stand the test of time.
During the first quarter, we opened 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 2 buybuy BABY stores, as well as closed 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store and 1 Harmon store. Additionally, we continue to relocate and renovate Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at May 28, 2011, was approximately 35.2 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's first quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2011, we have opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store, 5 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Christmas Tree Shop store. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,149 stores, including 985 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, as well as 67 Christmas Tree Shops, 52 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2011, including the 12 stores we have opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be approximately 40 to 45 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011 store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010 with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores. As always, as the year progresses and we gain greater visibility, the total number of stores that we will open may be updated.
We continue to apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or right-size our stores in response to changing market conditions. We continue to believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast-to-coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in stores across all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings.
We continue to increase the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We continue to believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

We are pleased that our first quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talent of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
As Len said, we are also pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall strength as we continue to work to build a business that will stand the test of time. While a number of economic challenges persist, including higher commodity prices, relatively high unemployment, a sluggish housing market and fragile consumer confidence, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer, domestically, interactively and, over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well-positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share and, over the long term, continue to grow shareholder value.
In taking this long term approach to building our Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY and Harmon Face Values concepts and through the ongoing efforts to cross merchandise and leverage our best practices across all our concepts, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal first quarter 2011 performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.72, an increase of approximately 38% when compared to the $0.52 per share that we earned in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $2.1 billion, approximately 9.7% higher than in the prior year. First quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 7%, compared with an increase of 8.4% last year.
Gross profit for the fiscal first quarter was approximately 40.6% of net sales, compared to approximately 40.3% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This increase in the gross profit margin resulted primarily from a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter were approximately 26.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.6% of net sales in last year's fiscal first quarter, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. This decrease can be primarily attributed to lower payroll and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, as well as a relative decrease in advertising expenses as a result of a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. Payroll and occupancy expenses benefited from the approximate 7% increase in comparable store sales. 
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal first quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 200 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal first quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37.6% compared to approximately 39.1% for the comparable quarter last year. This provision included a net after-tax benefit of approximately $3.8 million due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarter.
Our capital spending during the fiscal first quarter 2011 was approximately $33 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investment in our company to help position us for our long term success.
Also in the first quarter of 2011, we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program and, thereafter, began our $2 billion program authorized in December 2010, which we continue to model to be completed in approximately 2 years.
Our company's board of directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and, by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

As you heard from Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions, and we earned $0.72 per diluted share in our fiscal first quarter.

As you heard from Len and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions, and we earned $0.72 per diluted share in our fiscal first quarter. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal first quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of our fiscal year. 
The following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011. One, including the 12 stores open so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be approximately 40 to 45 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011 store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010 with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores. As the year progresses and we gain greater visibility, the total number of stores that we will open may be updated. We will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. Three, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 5% to 7% in the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2011. Five, assuming these sales levels, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit to be in the range of flat to slightly leveraged for the fiscal second quarter and to be slightly leveraged for the full year. Six, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2010. Seven, the second quarter and full year tax provision are estimated in the mid- to high-30s percent range with expected variability as taxable events occur. Eight, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements, including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, continue to be planned at approximately $250 million, which of course, remains subject to the timing of projects. Nine, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is estimated to be approximately $190 million. Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Eleven, in the first quarter, we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program and, thereafter, began our $2 billion program authorized in December 2010, which we continue to model to be completed in approximately 2 years. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and the other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $0.77 to $0.82 for the fiscal second quarter of 2011. For all of fiscal 2011, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by approximately 15% to 20%. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal first quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $2 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. This includes approximately $105.8 million of investments related to Auction Rate Securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.  
During the first quarter, we had approximately $7.1 million of redemptions of Auction Rate Securities at par. Subsequent to the first quarter, we had approximately $4 million of Auction Rate Security redemptions at par, leaving a balance of approximately $101.8 million of these securities. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of May 28, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2.1 billion or $59.22 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher in the prior year, primarily to support increases in comp store sales and due to timing of receipts.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at May 28, 2011 was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of all share repurchases, including the approximately $245 million representing approximately 4.8 million shares repurchased during the fiscal first quarter of 2011.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the second quarter ending on August 27, 2011 will be on Wednesday, September 21, 2011. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, June 22, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

Turning to our fiscal second quarter 2011 performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.93, an increase of approximately 33% when compared to the $0.70 per diluted share that we earned in last year's second quarter. For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.65 compared with $1.22 last year, an increase of approximately 35%. 
Net sales for the fiscal second quarter were approximately $2.3 billion, approximately 8.3% higher than in the prior year. For the fiscal first half, net sales were approximately $4.4 billion, about 9% higher than last year.
Second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 5.6% compared with an increase of 7.4% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2011 was due to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions. For the fiscal first half, comp store sales increased by approximately 6.3% compared with an increase of 7.9% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal first half of 2011 was primarily attributed to an increase in the number of transactions. 
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 41.1% of net sales, compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Gross profit for the first half was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 40.6% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2010.  These increases in the gross profit margin were primarily due to a reduction in markdowns and coupons as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter were approximately 25% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.1% of net sales in last year's fiscal second quarter, a decrease of approximately 210 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first half were approximately 25.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.8% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2010, which is a decrease of approximately 190 basis points. These decreases can be primarily attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the strong
Comp for both the second quarter and fiscal first half.  In addition, advertising as a percentage of net sales for both the second quarter and fiscal first half benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. 
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal second quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 220 basis points. For the fiscal first half, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 200 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal second quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38% compared to approximately 38.9% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 90 basis points. For the fiscal first half, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37.8% compared to approximately 39% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 120 basis points. These provisions for the current quarter and first half of 2011 included a net after-tax benefit of $1.2 million and $5 million respectively due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods.
Our capital expenditures during the fiscal first half of 2011 are approximately $89.6 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to prove to you and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.

Before I begin, I would like to note that we are deeply saddened by the loss of life and property to those who are affected by recent severe weather along the East Coast of the United States. As a result of these events, we experienced a short-term disruption in the operations of a number of our stores during the last few days of our fiscal second quarter and the early part of our fiscal third quarter. However, only 1 Christmas Tree Shop store will be closed for an extended period of time. 
Our actual results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011 consider the impact of these events on our operations.
As you heard from Warren and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.93 per diluted share in our fiscal second quarter and $1.65 per diluted share for the first 6 months of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal second quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2011. 
The following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011: one, including the 24 stores opened so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will now be approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011's store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010, with a slight shift the 7 more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores. As the year progresses, and we gain greater visibility, the total number of stores that we will open may be updated.  We will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise; two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011; three, we are modeling a 2% to 4% percentage increase in comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011; four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 5% to 7% in the third quarter and by 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter; five, assuming these sales levels, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift and the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit margin to slightly leverage for the fiscal third and fourth quarters; six, the third and fourth quarter tax provisions are estimated in the mid-to high 30s percentage range, with expected variability as taxable events occur; seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements, including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, continue to be planned at approximately $250 million, but may reach as high as $300 million, depending on the composition and ultimate timing of projects; eight, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is now estimated to be in the range of approximately $180 million to $190 million; nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources; 10, we expect to continue our share repurchase program, which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions and continued to model completion of the current authorization to early fiscal 2013.
Based on these and the other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $0.82 to $0.87 for the fiscal third quarter of 2011. For all of fiscal 2011, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase in the range of approximately 22% to 25%, up from the previous model of approximately 15% to 20%. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal second quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remains strong. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes approximately $97.3 million of investments related to Auction Rate Securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $1.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the second quarter, we had approximately $8.5 million of redemptions of Auction Rate Securities at par. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of August 27, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2.1 billion or $59.51 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher than in the prior year, primarily to support increases in comp store sales and due to timing of receipts.
Consolidated shareholders equity at August 27, 2011, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including approximately $287 million, representing approximately 5.2 million shares repurchased during the fiscal second quarter of 2011.  As of August 27, 2011, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $1.6 billion.
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, December 21, 2011. During this call, we will review operating results for the third quarter and 9 months ending November 26, 2011, and will provide our initial planning assumptions for fiscal 2012, which will include the company's plans to relocate its offices from Farmingdale in Garden City on New York to Union, New Jersey. This transition is being made to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all of our concepts, activities and platforms, and to better leverage internal and external resources to support our continuing growth of our company. We expect this transition to occur during the second half of 2012.
If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, September 21, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

I'm pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 33% in the fiscal second quarter to $0.93. We are pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength as we continue to challenge ourselves to improve in every aspect of our operation.
During the second quarter, we opened 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 7 buybuy BABY stores and 4 Christmas Tree Shops, as well as closed 1 Bed & Bath Beyond store. Additionally, we continue to relocate and renovate Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Consolidated store space at August 27, 2011, was approximately 35.6 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's second quarter.  
Since the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2011, we've opened 3 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 2 buybuy BABY stores. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,160 stores, including 989 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; as well as 70 Christmas Tree Shops; 56 buybuy BABY stores; and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2011, including the 24 stores we've opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will now be approximately 40 stores across all our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011 store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010, with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores. As always, as the year progresses and we gain greater visibility, the total number of stores that we will open may be updated.
As always, we apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and to -- or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions. We continue to believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in stores across all our concepts. 
We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings.  We remain focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. 
Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms, has exported us additional opportunities to attract new customers.
The continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates; has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and the changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis.  
We continue to believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals. And now, I will turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

We are pleased that our second quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and our constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time, creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. As Warren said, we are also pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength. 
While consumer confidence and spending is impacted by the continuing economic challenges, including relatively high unemployment and commodity prices and a sluggish housing market, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices, with superior customer service.  As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandising categories we offer domestically, interactively, and over the longer term, internationally. 
We are confident that our company is well-positioned to grow properly, compete for and increase our market share and over the long-term, continue to grow shareholder value. In taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal second quarter 2011 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.93, an increase of approximately 33% when compared to the $0.70 per diluted share that we earned in last year's second quarter. For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.65 compared with $1.22 last year, an increase of approximately 35%. 
Net sales for the fiscal second quarter were approximately $2.3 billion, approximately 8.3% higher than in the prior year. For the fiscal first half, net sales were approximately $4.4 billion, about 9% higher than last year.
Second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 5.6% compared with an increase of 7.4% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2011 was due to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions. For the fiscal first half, comp store sales increased by approximately 6.3% compared with an increase of 7.9% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal first half of 2011 was primarily attributed to an increase in the number of transactions. 
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 41.1% of net sales, compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Gross profit for the first half was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 40.6% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2010. These increases in the gross profit margin were primarily due to a reduction in markdowns and coupons as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter were approximately 25% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.1% of net sales in last year's fiscal second quarter, a decrease of approximately 210 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first half were approximately 25.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.8% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2010, which is a decrease of approximately 190 basis points. These decreases can be primarily attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the strong
Comp for both the second quarter and fiscal first half.  
In addition, advertising as a percentage of net sales for both the second quarter and fiscal first half benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal second quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 220 basis points. 
For the fiscal first half, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 200 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal second quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38% compared to approximately 38.9% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 90 basis points. 
For the fiscal first half, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37.8% compared to approximately 39% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 120 basis points. These provisions for the current quarter and first half of 2011 include a net after-tax benefit of $1.2 million and $5 million respectively, due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods.
Our capital expenditures during the fiscal first half of 2011 are approximately $89.6 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to prove you and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

Before I begin, I would like to note that we are deeply saddened by the loss of life and property for those who are affected by recent severe weather along the East Coast of the United States. As a result of these events, we experienced a short-term disruption in the operations of a number of our stores during the last few days of our fiscal second quarter and the early part of our fiscal third quarter. However, only 1 Christmas Tree Shop store will be closed for an extended period of time.  Our actual results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011 consider the impact of these events on our operations.
As you heard from Warren and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.93 per diluted share in our fiscal second quarter and $1.65 per diluted share for the first 6 months of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal second quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2011. 
The following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011: one, including the 24 stores opened so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will now be approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe our fiscal 2011's store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010, with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores.

We are pleased that our second quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and our constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient Company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. As Warren said, we are also pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength. 
While consumer confidence and spending is impacted by the continuing economic challenges, including relatively high unemployment and commodity prices and a sluggish housing market, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices, with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandising categories we offer domestically, interactively, and over the longer term, internationally. 
We are confident that our Company is well-positioned to grow properly, compete for and increase our market share and over the long-term, continue to grow shareholder value. In taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal second quarter 2011 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.93, an increase of approximately 33% when compared to the $0.70 per diluted share that we earned in last year's second quarter. For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.65, compared with $1.22 last year, an increase of approximately 35%. 
Net sales for the fiscal second quarter were approximately $2.3 billion, approximately 8.3% higher than in the prior year. For the fiscal first half, net sales were approximately $4.4 billion, about 9% higher than last year.
Second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 5.6%, compared with an increase of 7.4% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2011 was due to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions. For the fiscal first half, comp store sales increased by approximately 6.3%, compared with an increase of 7.9% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal first half of 2011 was primarily attributed to an increase in the number of transactions. 
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 41.1% of net sales, compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Gross profit for the first half was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 40.6% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2010. These increases in the gross profit margin were primarily due to a reduction in markdowns and coupons as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter were approximately 25% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.1% of net sales in last year's fiscal second quarter, a decrease of approximately 210 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first half were approximately 25.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.8% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2010, which is a decrease of approximately 190 basis points. These decreases can be primarily attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the strong comp for both the second quarter and fiscal first half.  
In addition, advertising, as a percentage of net sales for both the second quarter and fiscal first half, benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal second quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 220 basis points. 
For the fiscal first half, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 200 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal second quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38% compared to approximately 38.9% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 90 basis points. 
For the fiscal first half, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37.8% compared to approximately 39% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 120 basis points. These provisions for the current quarter and first half of 2011 include a net after-tax benefit of $1.2 million and $5 million respectively, due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods.
Our capital expenditures during the fiscal first half of 2011 are approximately $89.6 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to prove you and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our Company to help position us for our long-term success.
Our Company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer. I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

Before I begin, I would like to note that we are deeply saddened by the loss of life and property for those who are affected by recent severe weather along the East Coast of the United States. As a result of these events, we experienced a short-term disruption in the operations of a number of our stores during the last few days of our fiscal second quarter and the early part of our fiscal third quarter. However, only 1 Christmas Tree Shop store will be closed for an extended period of time.  Our actual results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011 consider the impact of these events on our operations.
As you heard from Warren and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.93 per diluted share in our fiscal second quarter and $1.65 per diluted share for the first 6 months of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal second quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2011. 
The following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011: one, including the 24 stores opened so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will now be approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe our fiscal 2011's store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010, with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores. 
As the year progresses and we gain greater visibility, the total number of stores that we will open may be updated. We will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise; two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011; three, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011; four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 5% to 7% in the third quarter and by 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter; five, assuming these sales levels, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift and the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit margin to slightly leverage for the fiscal third and fourth quarters; six, the third and fourth quarter tax provisions are estimated in the mid-to high 30s percent range -- percentage range, with expected variability as taxable events occur; seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements, including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, continue to be planned at approximately $250 million, but may reach as high as $300 million, depending on the composition and ultimate timing of projects; eight, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is now estimated to be in the range of approximately $180 million to $190 million; nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally-generated sources; 10, we expect to continue our share repurchase program, which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions and continue to model completion of the current authorization to early fiscal 2013.
Based on these and the other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $0.82 to $0.87 for the fiscal third quarter of 2011. For all of fiscal 2011, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase in the range of approximately 22% to 25%, up from the previous model of approximately 15% to 20%. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal second quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes approximately $97.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $1.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the Company's earnings.
During the second quarter, we had approximately $8.5 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of August 27, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2.1 billion or $59.51 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher than in the prior year, primarily to support increases in comp store sales and due to timing of receipts.
Consolidated shareholders’ equity at August 27, 2011, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $287 million, representing approximately 5.2 million shares repurchased during the fiscal second quarter of 2011. As of August 27, 2011, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $1.6 billion.
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, December 21, 2011. During this call, we will review operating results for the third quarter and 9 months ending November 26, 2011, and will provide our initial planning assumptions for fiscal 2012, which will include the Company's plans to relocate its offices from Farmingdale in Garden City New York to Union, New Jersey. This transition is being made to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all of our concepts, activities, and platforms and to better leverage internal and external resources to support our continuing growth of our Company. We expect this transition to occur during the second half of 2012.
If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, September 21, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

As of August 27, 2011, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $1.6 billion.
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, December 21, 2011. During this call, we will review operating results for the third quarter and 9 months ending November 26, 2011, and will provide our initial planning assumptions for fiscal 2012, which will include the company's plans to relocate its offices from Farmingdale in Garden City New York to Union, New Jersey. This transition is being made to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all of our concepts, activities, and platforms and to better leverage internal and external resources to support our continuing growth of our company. We expect this transition to occur during the second half of 2012.
If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, September 21, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

I'm pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 33% in the fiscal second quarter to $0.93. We are pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength as we continue to challenge ourselves to improve in every aspect of our operation.
During the second quarter, we opened 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 7 buybuy BABY stores and 4 Christmas Tree Shops, as well as closed 1 Bed & Bath Beyond store. Additionally, we continue to relocate and renovate Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Consolidated store space at August 27, 2011, was approximately 35.6 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's second quarter.  
Since the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2011, we've opened 3 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 2 buybuy BABY stores. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,160 stores, including 989 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; as well as 70 Christmas Tree Shops; 56 buybuy BABY stores; and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2011, including the 24 stores we've opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will now be approximately 40 stores across all our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011 store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010, with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores. As always, as the year progresses and we gain greater visibility, the total number of stores that we will open may be updated.
As always, we apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and to -- or rightsize our stores in response to the changing market conditions. We continue to believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in stores across all our concepts. 
We remain committed to, and are excited about, the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings. We remain focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer’s shopping experience. 
Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms, has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers.
The continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates; has always been the foundation of our long-term performance; and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and the changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. 
We continue to believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals. 
And now, I will turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

We are pleased that our second quarter results exceeded our internal planning assumptions. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and our constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. As Warren said, we are also pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength. 
While consumer confidence and spending is impacted by the continuing economic challenges, including relatively high unemployment and commodity prices and a sluggish housing market, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices, with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to work to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandising categories we offer domestically, interactively and, over the longer term, internationally. 
We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share and, over the long-term, continue to grow shareholder value. In taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal second quarter 2011 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.93, an increase of approximately 33% when compared to the $0.70 per diluted share that we earned in last year's second quarter. For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.65 compared with $1.22 last year, an increase of approximately 35%. 
Net sales for the fiscal second quarter were approximately $2.3 billion, approximately 8.3% higher than in the prior year. For the fiscal first half, net sales were approximately $4.4 billion, about 9% higher than last year.
Second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 5.6% compared with an increase of 7.4% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2011 was due to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions. For the fiscal first half, comp store sales increased by approximately 6.3% compared with an increase of 7.9% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal first half of 2011 was primarily attributed to an increase in the number of transactions. 
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 41.1% of net sales compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Gross profit for the first half was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 40.6% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2010. These increases in the gross profit margin were primarily due to a reduction in markdowns and coupons as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter were approximately 25% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.1% of net sales in last year's fiscal second quarter, a decrease of approximately 210 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first half were approximately 25.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.8% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2010, which is a decrease of approximately 190 basis points. These decreases can be primarily attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the strong comp for both the second quarter and fiscal first half.  
In addition, advertising, as a percentage of net sales for both the second quarter and fiscal first half, benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal second quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 220 basis points. 
For the fiscal first half, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 200 basis points. Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. 
For the fiscal second quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 38% compared to approximately 38.9% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 90 basis points. For the fiscal first half, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37.8% compared to approximately 39% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 120 basis points. These provisions for the current quarter and first half of 2011 include a net after-tax benefit of $1.2 million and $5 million respectively, due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods.
Our capital expenditures during the fiscal first half of 2011 are approximately $89.6 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer. 
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

Before I begin, I would like to note that we are deeply saddened by the loss of life and property for those who are affected by recent severe weather along the East Coast of the United States. As a result of these events, we experienced a short-term disruption in the operations of a number of our stores during the last few days of our fiscal second quarter and the early part of our fiscal third quarter. However, only 1 Christmas Tree Shop store will be closed for an extended period of time. Our actual results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011 consider the impact of these events on our operations.
As you heard from Warren and Steve, our results exceeded our planning assumptions and we earned $0.93 per diluted share in our fiscal second quarter and $1.65 per diluted share for the first 6 months of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal second quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2011. 
The following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011: one, including the 24 stores opened so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will now be approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2011's store openings by concept will be substantially similar to fiscal 2010, with a slight shift to several more buybuy BABY stores and slightly fewer Bed Bath & Beyond stores. 
As the year progresses and we gain greater visibility, the total number of stores that we will open may be updated. We will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. Three, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011. Four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 5% to 7% in the third quarter and by 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter. Five, assuming these sales levels, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift and the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit margin to slightly leverage for the fiscal third and fourth quarters. Six, the third and fourth quarter tax provisions are estimated in the mid- to high-30s percent range -- percentage range, with expected variability as taxable events occur. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements, including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, continue to be planned at approximately $250 million, but may reach as high as $300 million, depending on the composition and ultimate timing of projects. Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is now estimated to be in the range of approximately $180 million to $190 million. Nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. 10, we expect to continue our share repurchase program, which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions and continue to model completion of the current authorization in early fiscal 2013.
Based on these and the other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $0.82 to $0.87 for the fiscal third quarter of 2011. For all of fiscal 2011, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase in the range of approximately 22% to 25%, up from the previous model of approximately 15% to 20%. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal second quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes approximately $97.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $1.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings.
During the second quarter, we had approximately $8.5 million of redemptions of auction rate securities at par. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities.
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of August 27, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2.1 billion or $59.51 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher than in the prior year, primarily to support increases in comp store sales and due to timing of receipts.
Consolidated shareholders’ equity at August 27, 2011, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $287 million, representing approximately 5.2 million shares repurchased during the fiscal second quarter of 2011. As of August 27, 2011, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $1.6 billion.
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, December 21, 2011. During this call, we will review operating results for the third quarter and 9 months ending November 26, 2011, and will provide our initial planning assumptions for fiscal 2012, which will include the company's plans to relocate its offices from Farmingdale in Garden City New York to Union, New Jersey. This transition is being made to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all of our concepts, activities and platforms and to better leverage internal and external resources to support our continuing growth of our company. We expect this transition to occur during the second half of 2012.

Turning to our fiscal third quarter of 2011 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.95, an increase of approximately 28% when compared to the $0.74 per diluted share that we earned in last year's third quarter.

For the fiscal 9 months, net sales were approximately $6.8 billion and 8.2% higher than last year. Third quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 4.1% compared with an increase of 7% last year. For the fiscal 9 months, comp store sales increased by approximately 5.5% compared with an increase of 7.6% last year. 
Increases in comp store sales for the fiscal third quarter and 9 months of 2011 were attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount. 
Gross profit for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales, the same as the comparable period a year ago. The gross profit margin included a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales, offset by the increase in inventory acquisition costs, a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
Gross profit for the fiscal 9 months was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 40.7% of net sales in the fiscal 9 months of 2010. The increase in the gross profit margin for the fiscal 9 months was primarily due to a reduction in markdowns and coupons as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 25.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 27% of net sales in last year's fiscal third quarter, a decrease of approximately 130 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal 9 months were approximately 25.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.5% of net sales in the fiscal 9 months of 2010, a decrease of approximately 160 basis points. These decreases can be primarily attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the positive comp for both the fiscal third quarter and 9 months. 
In addition, advertising as a percentage of net sales for both the fiscal third quarter and 9 months, benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 130 basis points. For the fiscal 9 months, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 180 basis points. 
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal third quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 35.9% compared to approximately 38.6% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 270 basis points. For the fiscal 9 months, the provision for income taxes was approximately 37.1% compared to approximately 38.8% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. 
These provisions for the current fiscal quarter and 9 months of 2011 included a net after-tax benefit of $9.1 million and $14.1 million respectively, due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods. 
Our capital expenditures during the fiscal 9 months of 2011 were approximately $159.2 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success. 
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

We were encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiousl",954,"Thanks, Steve. As you heard from Steve, we earned $0.95 per diluted share in our fiscal third quarter and $2.60 per diluted share for the 9 months of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2011. 
The following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011: One, including the 36 stores opened so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be 39 stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. Three, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase comparable store sales for the fourth quarter and approximately 5% for all of fiscal 2011. Four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are moderating consolidated net sales to increase by 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter and between 7% and 8% for the full year. Five, assuming these sales levels, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit margin to leverage for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year. 
Six, the fourth quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated in the mid- to high-30s percentage change with expected variability as distinct tax events occur. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 are planned at approximately $275 million, which of course depends on the composition and ultimate timing of projects. Our capital expenditures are principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements, including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, which include expenditures for an additional 800,000 square foot e-commerce fulfillment center scheduled to become operational in mid-fiscal 2012. 
Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations in timely from internally generated sources. Ten, we expect to continue our share repurchase program, which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.28 to $1.33 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 and approximately $3.86 to $3.92 for all of fiscal 2011. This would represent an increase of approximately 26% to 28% over fiscal 2010, up from our previous model of approximately 22% to 25%. 
For fiscal 2012, we are in the process of preparing our budget. Our preliminary planning assumptions for next year, which will be 53 weeks, include the following: One, we anticipate opening approximately the same number of stores as the current year. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012. Three, our stores will continue to be entirely or our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources. 
Four, we expect to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by early fiscal 2013. Five, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. Six, in the second half of the fiscal year, we expect to substantially complete the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey. 
We plan to provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2012 on our next quarterly conference call on April 4, 2012. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $97.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $1.9 million to reflect our current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested with these securities. 
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of November 26, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2.4 billion or $65.43 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher than in the prior period, primarily to support increases in comp store sales. 
Consolidated shareholders equity at November 26, 2011, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $328 million representing approximately 5.6 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2011. As of November 26, 2011, the remaining balance of this current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $1.3 billion. 
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, April 4, 2012. During this call, we will review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending February 25, 2012, and we'll further discuss fiscal 2012 planning assumptions. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, December 21, to take your calls. 
As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond, and we wish you a happy holiday season and a happy new year."

We're pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength as we continue to challenge ourselves to improve in every aspect of our operation. 
Our unique decentralized corporate culture continues to produce positive results, and we remain confident that our business will continue to grow successfully in the years ahead. Our entire organization is dedicated to providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience. 
During the third quarter, we opened 7 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 7 buybuy BABY stores, one Christmas Tree Shop store and one Harmon Face Values store. Additionally, we continue to relocate and renovate Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space as of November 26, 2011, was approximately 36 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's third quarter. 
Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011, we have opened an additional buybuy BABY store and closed one Harmon store. Including this activity, we currently operate 1,171 stores, consisting of: 993 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 71 Christmas Tree Shops stores; 62 buybuy BABY stores; and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. 
In addition, we have a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More. 
During fiscal 2011, including the 36 stores we've opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be 39 stores across all our concepts. As always, we apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions. 
We continue to believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Face Value stores and place health and beauty care offerings in stores across all our concepts. 
We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings. We remain focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customers' shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers. 
The continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We continue to believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
While consumer confidence and spending is impacted by the continuing economic challenges, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise in everyday low prices and superior customer service. As always, we will continue to invest in all aspects of our company and work to enhance our customer's overall experience in-store, online and through social media and mobile devices. 
We remain committed to being our customer's first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share and over the long term, continue to grow shareholder value. 
In taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers. 
As we announced in our last conference call in September, we will be relocating our offices in Farmingdale and Garden City, New York to a corporate headquarters here in Union, New Jersey. This transition is being made to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all our concepts, activities and platforms and to better leverage the internal and external resources to support the continuing growth of our company. We expect this transition to be substantially completed during the second half of fiscal 2012. 
Turning to our fiscal third quarter of 2011 performance.

I'm pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 28% in the fiscal third quarter to $0.95. We're pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength as we continue to challenge ourselves to improve in every aspect of our operation. 
Our unique decentralized corporate culture continues to produce positive results, and we remain confident that our business will continue to grow successfully in the years ahead. Our entire organization is dedicated to providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience. 
During the third quarter, we opened 7 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 7 buybuy BABY stores, one Christmas Tree Shop store and one Harmon Face Values store. Additionally, we continue to relocate and renovate Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space as of November 26, 2011 was approximately 36 million square feet, an increase of approximately 4% over last year's third quarter. 
Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011, we have opened an additional buybuy BABY store and closed 1 Harmon store. Including this activity, we currently operate 1,171 stores, consisting of: 993 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 71 Christmas Tree Shops stores; 62 buybuy BABY stores; and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. 
In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More. 
During fiscal 2011, including the 36 stores we've opened to date, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be 39 stores across all our concepts. As always, we apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions. 
We continue to believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Face Value stores and place health and beauty care offerings in stores across all our concepts. 
We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise offerings. We remain focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customers' shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers. 
The continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We continue to believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in this conference call. As Warren said, we are pleased that have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
While consumer confidence and spending is impacted by the continuing economic challenges, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to invest in all aspects of our company and work to enhance our customer's overall experience in-store, online and through social media and mobile devices.
 
We remain committed to being our customer's first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share and over the long term, continue to grow shareholder value. 
In taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers. 
As we announced in our last conference call in September, we will be relocating our offices in Farmingdale and Garden City, New York to our corporate headquarters here in Union, New Jersey. This transition is being made to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all our concepts, activities and platforms and to better leverage the internal and external resources to support the continuing growth of our company. We expect this transition to be substantially completed during the second half of fiscal 2012. 
Turning to our fiscal third quarter of 2011 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.95, an increase of approximately 28% when compared to the $0.74 per diluted share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal 9 months, net earnings per diluted share were $2.60 compared with $1.95 earned last year, an increase of approximately 33%. 
Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.3 billion, approximately 6.8% higher than in the prior year. For the fiscal 9 months, net sales were approximately $6.8 billion, 8.2% higher than last year. Third quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 4.1% compared with an increase of 7% last year. For the fiscal 9 months, comp store sales increased by approximately 5.5% compared with an increase of 7.6% last year. Increases in comp store sales for the fiscal third quarter and 9 months of 2011 were attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount. 
Gross profit for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 40.9% of net sales, the same as the comparable period a year ago. The gross profit margin included a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales, offset by the increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
Gross profit for the fiscal 9 months was approximately 40.9% of net sales compared to approximately 40.7% of net sales in the fiscal 9 months of 2010. The increase in the gross profit margin for the fiscal 9 months was primarily due to a reduction in markdowns and coupons as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal third quarter were approximately 25.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 27% of net sales in last year's fiscal third quarter, a decrease of approximately 130 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal 9 months were approximately 25.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 27.5% of net sales in the fiscal 9 months of 2010, a decrease of approximately 160 basis points. These decreases can be primarily attributed to lower payroll, occupancy and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the positive comp for both the fiscal third quarter and 9 months. 
In addition, advertising as a percentage of net sales for both the fiscal third quarter and 9 months benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 130 basis points. For the fiscal 9 months, the operating profit margin increased by approximately 180 basis points. 
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal third quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 35.9% compared to approximately 38.6% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 270 basis points. For the fiscal 9 months, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37.1% compared to approximately 38.8% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 170 basis points. These provisions for the current fiscal quarter and 9 months of 2011 included a net after-tax benefit of $9.1 million and $14.1 million, respectively, due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods. 
Our capital expenditures during the fiscal 9 months of 2011 were approximately $159.2 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success. 
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Steve, we earned $0.95 per diluted share in our fiscal third quarter and $2.60 per diluted share for the 9 months of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2011. 
The following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011: one, including the 36 stores opened so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be 39 stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. Three, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the fourth quarter and approximately 5% for all of fiscal 2011. Four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter and between 7% and 8% for the full year. Five, assuming these sales levels, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit margin to leverage for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year. 
Six, the fourth quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated in the mid- to high-30s percentage range, with expected variability as distinct tax events occur. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 are planned at approximately $275 million which, of course, depends on the composition and ultimate timing of projects. Our capital expenditures are principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, which include expenditures for an additional 800,000 square foot e-commerce fulfillment center scheduled to become operational in mid-fiscal 2012. 
Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Ten, we expect to continue our share repurchase program which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.28 to $1.33 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 and approximately $3.86 to $3.92 for all of fiscal 2011. This would represent an increase of approximately 26% to 28% over fiscal 2010, up from our previous model of approximately 22% to 25%. 
For fiscal 2012, we are in the process of preparing our budget. Our preliminary planning assumptions for next year, which will be 53 weeks, include the following: one, we anticipate opening approximately the same number of stores as the current year. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012. Three, our stores will continue to be entirely -- or our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources. 
Four, we expect to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by early fiscal 2013. Five, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. Six, in the second half of the fiscal year, we expect to substantially complete the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey. 
We plan to provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2012 on our next quarterly conference call on April 4, 2012. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $97.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. 
These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $1.9 million to reflect our current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities. 
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of November 26, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2.4 billion or $65.43 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher than in the prior period, primarily to support increases in comp store sales. 
Consolidated shareholders equity at November 26, 2011 was approximately $3.9 billion which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $328 million, representing approximately 5.6 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2011. As of November 26, 2011, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $1.3 billion. 
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, April 4, 2012. During this call, we will review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending February 25, 2012, and we'll further discuss fiscal 2012 planning assumptions. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, December 21, to take your calls. 
As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond, and we wish you a happy holiday season and a happy new year."

While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success. 
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer. 
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

As you heard from Steve, we earned $0.95 per diluted share in our fiscal third quarter and $2.60 per diluted share for the 9 months of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2011. 
The following are our major planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2011: one, including the 36 stores opened so far this year, we anticipate that the total number of new store openings will be 39 stores across all of our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
Two, we expect to continue our program of expanding, renovating and/or relocating a number of our stores in fiscal 2011. Three, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the fourth quarter and approximately 5% for all of fiscal 2011. Four, based on these comparable store sales assumptions, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter and between 7% and 8% for the full year. Five, assuming these sales levels, in addition to planning the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, we are modeling our operating profit margin to leverage for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year. 
Six, the fourth quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated in the mid- to high-30s percentage range, with expected variability as distinct tax events occur. Seven, capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 are planned at approximately $275 million which, of course, depends on the composition and ultimate timing of projects. Our capital expenditures are principally for new stores, existing store refurbishment, information technology enhancements including increased spending on our interactive platforms and other projects, which include expenditures for an additional 800,000 square foot e-commerce fulfillment center scheduled to become operational in mid-fiscal 2012. 
Eight, depreciation for fiscal 2011 is estimated to be approximately $180 million. Nine, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2011 and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Ten, we expect to continue our share repurchase program which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.28 to $1.33 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 and approximately $3.86 to $3.92 for all of fiscal 2011. This would represent an increase of approximately 26% to 28% over fiscal 2010, up from our previous model of approximately 22% to 25%. 
For fiscal 2012, we are in the process of preparing our budget. Our preliminary planning assumptions for next year, which will be 53 weeks, include the following: one, we anticipate opening approximately the same number of stores as the current year. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012. Three, our stores will continue to be entirely -- or our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources. 
Four, we expect to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by early fiscal 2013. Five, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. Six, in the second half of the fiscal year, we expect to substantially complete the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey. 
We plan to provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2012 on our next quarterly conference call on April 4, 2012. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $97.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. 
These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $1.9 million to reflect our current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities. 
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of November 26, 2011, inventories at cost were approximately $2.4 billion or $65.43 per square foot. Inventory per square foot was higher than in the prior period, primarily to support increases in comp store sales. 
Consolidated shareholders equity at November 26, 2011 was approximately $3.9 billion which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $328 million, representing approximately 5.6 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2011. As of November 26, 2011, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $1.3 billion. 
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, April 4, 2012. During this call, we will review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending February 25, 2012, and we'll further discuss fiscal 2012 planning assumptions. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, December 21, to take your calls. 
As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond, and we wish you a happy holiday season and a happy new year."
