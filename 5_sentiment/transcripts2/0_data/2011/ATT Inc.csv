Before Rick covers our results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and offer my view of the business and what you should expect from us in 2011. And as you've seen in our release, we had a very productive 2010. Our revenues grew. We grew earnings. Cash flow was strong. We closed the year well, and we expect another solid year in 2011 with continued revenue growth, margin expansion and growth in EPS and free cash flow.
As we look ahead, our confidence in the industry and our business in particular continues to be very high. We've invested heavily over the past few years, and those investments are beginning to scale. And it's driving revenue growth and margin improvements, and you know what these areas are. U-verse has driven growth in our consumer revenues now each of the last two quarters. And based on the results so far this year, we're adding more pay-TV subscribers than any other U.S. provider. Our VPN capabilities have proven to be a really strong platform for our strategic business services, and these services are growing at a consistent mid-teens cliff. And on top of these, mobile broadband is obviously our big driver. We just posted the best Wireless net add year in our history. In the fourth quarter, our mobile data revenues grew better than 27%, and we've grown postpaid ARPU now for eight straight quarters. As mobile broadband phenomenon just continues to exceed all of our expectations, our industry has, frankly, never experienced anything quite like it. And we haven't even talked about 4G yet. And as you know, we've completed our nationwide HSPA+ deployment, and where we combine that with advanced backhaul, we're getting 4G speeds today up to six mag. And we have plan to launch around 20 4G devices this year, two in the first quarter. 
And then on top of this, we've accelerated our LTE deployment. And when you combine HSPA+ with LTE, it's going to result in a much more consistent 4G experience for our customers. And then on the business side, when you take these mobile broadband capabilities and then layer on cloud and applications-based services, it really begins to let customers mobilize everything they do. So these are all large opportunities. They're scalable opportunities. And they're all early in their growth cycles. And as you can see from our results in sales of tablet and connected devices and our strong growth rates and strategic business services, we're way out front in each of these areas.
Now while the future Mobility will be driven by broadband, mobile voice quality is, obviously, important. And over the last 45 days with our vendors finally clearing their backlogs, we brought online a significant amount of new capacity. And our call retainability across the country is up 20 basis points at about 99%. And we see even greater improvements in Manhattan and San Francisco, and you should expect voice quality improvement throughout this year. So that's just a real quick overview. Again, 2010 was a very productive year. We're executing well. I expect another strong year in 2011 in our key platforms: mobile broadband, business solutions and U-verse. We think they're going to provide a nice platform for growth in the years ahead. 
So, Rick, I'll turn it over to you."

Revenues for th",1793,"Thank you, Randall. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 5. When you look at 2010, I think our financial results speak for themselves. They were strong across the board. Revenues for the year were up 1.4% and 2.1% in the fourth quarter. Consolidated margins improved even with strong sales of integrated devices. And as a result, we grew adjusted earnings by 10.6% for the year.
In the fourth quarter, we had reported earnings per share of $0.18, and that includes $0.26 of pressure from the year-end mark-to-market change in our benefit plan accounting, which we announced a couple of weeks ago; $0.09 of pressure due to severance charges; and $0.02 of pressure from asset impairments. Excluding these onetime items, earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.55, and that's up 10% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. And cash flow continues to be strong. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion in the quarter and $14.7 billion for the year.
Now I'd like to take a look at revenue growth and revenue mix on Slide 6. Our fourth quarter consolidated revenue totaled $31.4 billion, and that's up $653 million or 2.1%. The drivers continue to be strong Wireless growth and U-verse, which is improving our Wireline Consumer results and continued strength in strategic business services. These trends continue to transform our revenue mix.
In the fourth quarter, 73% of revenues came from Wireless, from Wireline data and from Managed Services, and that's up from 65% two years ago. Combined revenues from these sources were up 9% in the fourth quarter. And in fact, the fourth quarter marks the first time where our Wireless revenues have surpassed Wireline. We're confident that this mix shift will continue as mobile broadband continues to be a huge growth driver.
You see the impact of mobile broadband in our Wireless results, starting on Slide 7. It was another terrific Wireless growth quarter. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or 9.9%, and Wireless service revenues grew 9.6%, up more than $1.2 billion versus fourth quarter a year ago. This was driven by continued subscriber gains and strong data adoption. Data drove our eighth consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched by our peers, up by 2.2%, and we continue to have the highest postpaid ARPU in the industry.
Churn, both total and postpaid, continues to reach or match best-ever levels. We also had our best net add quarter ever, adding 2.8 million subscribers in the fourth quarter. In fact, we had our best ever year with 8.9 million subscribers added to the network in 2010, and that doesn't include those added through the Alltel property acquisition. Net adds in the fourth quarter were led by an increase of 1.5 million connected devices, the highest quarter ever. These devices bring lower ARPUs but attracted churn and margin characteristics.
Postpaid net adds for the quarter were 400,000. Prepaid net adds totaled more than 300,000, with strong iPad- and Android-based tablet activations. In fact, during the quarter, we added 442,000 tablets to the network, and we also had a solid reseller quarter with nearly 600,000 new subscribers. 
Our data revenues continue their exceptional growth. The details are on Slide 8. We grew Wireless data revenues by more than 27%, up more than $1 billion year-over-year. Integrated device sales. Those are handsets with QWERTY or virtual keyboards in addition to voice functionality are a key driver of this growth, and we had another incredible integrated device quarter, our second highest sales quarter ever. Signing up more than 7.4 million subscribers, both upgrades and new customers, these sales netted 3.4 million new 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, and were up more than $13 million in the past 12 months.
Our results also reflect another strong quarter for iPhone activations, with more than $4 million activated during the quarter, resulting in 90% of our iPhone base being under contract. And in addition, our other smartphone sales increased significantly over the previous quarter. ARPU for integrated devices continues to be strong, 1.7x our other devices, and these subscribers tend to be very sticky for us, with more than 80% of the integrated device subscribers on family- or business-related plans with churn levels well below average. And the good news is we continue to have room to grow. About 60% of our postpaid base use these devices today, but our sales rate continues to increase and is now more than 80%.
Obviously, integrated device sales, along with high upgrade levels, have an impact on margins. The details are on Slide 9. Within integrated devices, we're also seeing a shift to a higher mix of high-end smartphones, devices that use an advanced operating system such as RIM, Apple OS or Windows 7. These devices tend to have higher subsidies than quick messaging devices, but they also bring higher ARPUs due to more robust data capability. And our customers continue to upgrade to higher-end smart phones in record numbers. In the fourth quarter, we had about 2 million more smartphone sales than we did in fourth quarter of 2009. And over 9% of our base upgraded their device in the quarter, signing a new two-year contract in the process, and I think that says a lot about the confidence and the loyalty they have in AT&T.
Smartphone sales and upgrade levels did impact fourth quarter Wireless margins. In the quarter, Wireless EBITDA service margin was 37.6%. That's flat sequentially and down from fourth quarter a year ago. And for the year, our EBITDA service margin was 40.7%. The offset to higher device subsidies is the long-term value these customers bring, including higher ARPUs, lower churn and strong data growth. And you see that in our Wireless operating income, which was up more than 10% for the year to reach $15.3 billion.
I'd like to turn now and cover our Wireline results, starting with consumer trends on Slide 10. This was another strong quarter for U-verse, and it drove our second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in Consumer Wireline. We had 246,000 U-verse video net adds in the quarter, and we hit an important customer milestone earlier this month when we reached 3 million subscribers. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers had a triple- or quad-play bundle, and the ARPU for these customers continues to grow, up 14% year-over-year. As a result, our U-verse economics are attractive and growing. It is now a $5 billion annualized revenue stream, and U-verse exited the year with positive impact on margins.
We also had another strong quarter in total broadband adds, up 210,000 year-over-year. Our Wireline Consumer IP data revenues, that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 30% for the year, and these products now represent 45% of total Consumer Wireline revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points over the past year. We expect continued U-verse growth and scale to drive further improvements in our overall Wireline financials.
Now let's take a look at business Wireline on Slide 11. Here, we're seeing the same consistent trends impacting the business that we have all year. As the lack of growth and business formations and employment continue to put some pressure on the Wireline business, you see that in our fourth quarter service revenue results, which were down 4.3% year-over-year on a reported basis and 3.5% after adjusting for the third quarter sales of the company's Japan assets. We are, however, seeing some bright spots. In our federal networks contracts and in our Wholesale business, and we had our strongest quarter in the year in strategic business products. Revenues from these products including Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks and application services were up over 17%. And overall business IT revenues were up 9% in the fourth quarter and contributed to positive business data growth.
Plus we continue to do well, selling Wireless into the business space. We're seeing a fundamental shift with more enterprises asking us to help them deploy full mobile solutions, solutions that bring together mobile broadband, cloud computing, seamless access to applications and even social media. We're well positioned to lead in this transition, and we're excited about this future opportunity.
Now I'd like to take a look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 12. We said at the beginning of last year that we expected stable to improve consolidated margins when compared to 2009, and we delivered on that. For the year, our adjusted consolidated operating income margin was 18.5%. That's up from 17.7% in 2009. This reflects improving revenue trends in both Wireless and Wireline Consumer and solid execution of cost initiatives across the company. Our wireline operating margin remains stable from 2009, and that was driven by improving revenue trends and good cost management. 
Across the business, total force was down by more than 16,000, and we're making great strides with one AT&T. As we consolidate and integrate Wireline and Wireless operations under one AT&T, we continue to drive down costs. These initiatives strengthen our ability to sustain solid margins and put us in a unique position among our competitors to serve customers seamlessly with the best-in-class operation. These initiatives have achieved expense savings of more than $1 billion a year. And recently, we launched our next phase of one AT&T designed to simplify our product offerings, and we anticipate significant value from these new initiatives on top of our normal cost management efforts.
Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash summary is on Slide 13. In 2010, cash from operations totaled $35 billion. Capital expenditures were $20.3 billion, with a more than 50% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital. Our free cash flow was $14.7 million. I do need to point out that as we go forward and prepare to launch our LTE network in 2011, we will no longer capitalize interest for the radio spectrum we purchased to use for LTE. This will increase interest expense and reduce 2011 earnings per share by $0.07, as well as reduce capital expenditures.
Dividend payments in 2010 totaled $9.9 billion. And over the last six quarters, we generated almost $9 billion of free cash flow after dividends. In terms of uses of that cash, our debt level is down almost $6 billion over the past 12 months, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 37% and an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.56. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business while returning substantial value to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Randall Stephenson for closing comments. Randall?"

Before we go to the Q&A, I just want to make a couple of additional comments. Just looking back at the last three years, we've executed with a lot of discipline through this downturn, and we've marketed well. We've won customers. I think we've done a very good job on the cost side. When you look at the metrics Rick just walked you through, think it's pretty clear that AT&T is coming out of the downturn stronger, both operationally and financially, that we were going in. 
We have a better balance sheet, better revenue trends, better margins and a more growth-oriented business. And all of this reflects solid execution by the people across this company. And as you look ahead, most important thing we've done over the past few years is that we've built and we've scaled some very nice growth platforms for the future. Mobile broadband, U-verse, VPN, cloud-based services, and we've invested very aggressively in all these areas. We've kept CapEx strong. We've acquired high-quality spectrum. While we've done all of that, we've maintained a financial strength to return substantial value to the owners. We've increased the dividend now for the 27th straight year, and we authorized a stock repurchase. 
So as we look forward to 2011 and I've laid this out for you on Slide 15, we have a solid plan to continue growing revenues, earnings and cash flow, and so here are the variables. We do expect healthy contract subscriber growth in 2011 even with the introduction of another carrier for the iPhone. Obviously, this is going to make things a little bit harder to predict early on in the year. But with the introduction of new Android and other devices, we think the smartphone market will continue to be very strong for us. And this is consistent with what you saw in the fourth quarter, which is our second highest smartphone quarter in our history. 
We also had a strong fourth quarter in tablets and connected devices. We expect that momentum to continue through 2011 and beyond. We expect to expand our Wireless and our Wireline operating margins. And excluding the capitalized interest impacts, we expect 2011 EPS growth in the mid-single digits or better. And as the market settles beyond 2011, we have an opportunity to accelerate our EPS growth even further. We're targeting capital this year in the low to mid-$19 billion range, and we expect free cash flow will be up from 2010. 
So this is an outlook that reflects the quality of the growth platforms. It also reflects our proven ability to execute on the cost side. And I'd add that it does not include any kind of significant lift from the economy. And I'm hopeful we're going to see more from the economy this year. We're beginning to see a few encouraging signs, but we do not have any kind of economic turn built into our expectations. And that just reflects our approach. As most of you know, we tend to be very conservative in these areas. We had a very productive 2010. We are confident 2011 is going to be strong as well, and what has me most excited is this industry's potential over the next few years and how AT&T is positioned here in the long term. So, Brooks, with that, I think we're ready for questions."

Obviously, a lot more smartphones but you expect that and a lot of confidence about the group being able to grow the postpaid base, which I think you don't hear a lot. But do you expect to have to spend more or advertise or increase subsidies or how do you expect to -- is that really the difference there that margins might not expand as much as the lower iPhone shipments would probably suggest?"

When you look at the guidance, there a couple of things that are underlying it, and I just spoke to them but just very briefly. Obviously, the economy. We are not expecting any kind of dramatic lift in economic growth. And this is -- we think it's fairly conservative. I think it's prudent that we set our cost structure around a slower economic growth scenario. But we're beginning to see some encouraging signs. Businesses are investing again, and we're seeing early indications of that. We are starting to see some hiring. But the reason we moderate this is business starts to continue to be negative across the country, and that's probably one of the best early indicators for us when this thing begins to turn, so we're hopeful as we kind of work through this first quarter, second quarter, we begin to see the business starts to turn and with any luck, we get some upside from the economy there. The second area though is this idea of an iPhone going onto second network. This is going to create some volatility in the first part of the year, and it's going to be kind of hard to predict the first part of the year as Verizon launches an iPhone. But as I mentioned in the comments, I feel fairly confident we're going to be able to grow over the course of the year through the disruption, and then there's a couple of reasons for this. And one of them is if you just look at the fourth quarter, it was no secret that the iPhone was going to be available in a competitor's network, and the competitive environment was reflecting that. And in spite of that, we had our second-best integrated sales quarter ever, and iPhone sales continue to be very strong in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was among the best quarters we've ever done as well. We sold 4 million iPhones, and that just kind of gives us some confidence in terms of customer loyalty to the network and so again, it'll probably maybe rocky in the beginning of the year, kind of volatile, hard to predict, but we think as we work, the market stabilizes, we'll be able to grow through it. The other thing is the sales mix will change this year. We have not been very aggressive in the Android portfolio, and we're bringing Android into the mix very aggressively this year. You've seen some of the devices that we'll be bringing in. And so we're going to be a heavy participant in the Android markets at this year, and so you're going to see a significant shift in mix. And then you add Windows 7 and RIM products are actually starting to do very well and getting a lot of traction in the market and then our sales channels. We think were actually going to have a nice mix shift and do quite well in those areas. And then last, we're really starting to feel good about the network situation. We're making a lot of progress here. And as I commented in the opening comments, we had a significant clearing of backlog from our vendors in December. We were having some serious capacity constraints in key markets, and we really saw the backlogs clear, and we spent the last 45 days literally just bringing capacity online in a rather dramatic fashion. And we're seeing those numbers move, and so we put all this together, we actually feel like, again, with the little volatility in the first part of the year, we can grow contract subscribers through the course of this year."

But there is, obviously, there's an interplay in the modeling, in the guidance in the expectations between in the Wireless side between volumes and mix of volumes and device sales and what kind of margins and earnings growth you expect. And as Randall said, as we look at the trends and we look at the trends particularly in the last quarter or two, what we're seeing is continued strong iPhone sales despite the anticipation of the iPhone being nonexclusive. We did over 9 million iPhones in just the last two quarters. That's a pretty phenomenal number when you think about it. That plus the high upgrade rates we've seen and the growth we're seeing in sales of other smartphones, smartphones with a RIM operating system, a Windows operating system, the Android models we've got coming on into the device lineup in 2011 I think are very exciting. So our guidance is based on a presumption that we're going to continue to see strong sales of smartphones, and we're going to continue to grow the business. We're going to grow within customers, in ARPU and obviously, in revenues. In terms of how you compete in this environment, again, we feel we're in a good position. We're going to have a tremendous device portfolio for customers to choose from. We've got a network evolution path, I think, that will be the most elegant from a customer standpoint by having both HSPA+ across our entire footprint as we roll out LTE. And then finally, as Randall said, we are seeing and expect to see continued significant improvements on the voice side. So that's essentially the position that we'll compete from as we go into '11."

And again, as you look at the fourth quarter activity, the level of upgrades we had, which is really the second highest level of upgrades and customers signing to your contracts that we've ever had only surpassed by the third quarter of last year combined with the sales of smartphones, I think both of those bode well for the business in an environment where the iPhone is not exclusive. In terms of the cost side, and we touched on this a bit in the presentation, but we see continued opportunities, both in the Wireless and Wireline sides of the business, and it's driven by a couple of things. First, the one AT&T initiatives, which is really, it's been a series of initiatives over the last few years. And as we mentioned, we just, at the end of last year, kicked off a new set of one AT&T initiatives targeted at simplifying some of our product offerings. But these initiatives if you step back from over the last several years have consistently been providing cost reduction on a year-over-year basis in excess of $1 billion a year. And we see the same kind of opportunity going forward as we look into 2011 and 2012. But secondly, and this is kind of a broader piece of it and it gets to a comment Randall made in the presentation about the opportunity to begin to accelerate some of the trends in the business as we get even past 2011, is we talked about the change in the mix of our business. And what you're seeing is that some of the growth platforms, and U-verse is a perfect example, those growth platforms are beginning to scale. And just a natural part of our business as those products and platforms scale, the margins improve. So we're seeing steady, consistent margin improvement there. And as we go forward and particularly as we get out past 2011, you start to see some of the drag on the business from legacy products like Wireline voice start to decline, and it's the combination of those two things that I think gives the business opportunity to begin to accelerate both in terms of revenues and margins as we go forward even past 2011."

In terms of ARPU, what's driving ARPU for the industry is moving these postpaid basis onto integrated-type devices, and we have been hitting this really hard for the last three and a half years. In fact, we're, by a sizable margin, way out front of the industry on this. We have more than 60% of our customer base, postpaid customer base now on integrated-type devices. And if you look at just the sales channel, the sales funnel, about over 80% of the sales into our postpaid base are on integrated devices. And so and by the way, that number just keeps creeping up quarter in and quarter out, so I don't think 80% is going to prove to be the cap on what percentage of these bases have integrated devices. So we've got quite a bit of room to run just in our traditional postpaid base on ARPUs, and those ARPU improvements are significant when they move onto integrated devices. So we'll continue, as an industry, to push that, and we'll continue to move that along. I think 80% is going to prove to be a floor and not a ceiling. So plenty of room there. When you think about WiFi, we're selling type capability today. If you think about what those wi-fi products are serving, largely they tend to be serving tablets. As you know, we have the 3G capability built into the tablets predominantly that we sell. And when you look at what we sold in the fourth quarter, we sold 442,000 tablets that are running on the network, and so I kind of compare the two. Those are equivalent. And so we're having very, very strong results in terms of selling tablets, and I'd tell you to keep in mind we're really early on in tablets. I mean, this thing is still in its infancy, and we think this has a lot of room to run. And by and large, the tablet market is being dominated by the Apple products, the new stuff is just now coming online. And so you're going to see a lot of Android-type tablets, line, and that'll push that long as well. So we think we have a lot of opportunity in terms of tablets. And I would also tell you not to disregard the connected devices. This is a huge growth area for us. And so if you think about ARPU being the first place we're obviously going as an industry. Smartphones and integrated devices, tablets are going to be a significant driver to revenue growth as we move forward. Connected devices are proving to be very powerful. I mean, we added 1.5 million of these in the quarter, and kind of setting the pace for the industry, and I believe the connected devices products are going to accelerate as we move into 4G capabilities. So if we put all those together, it gives us a lot of confidence. We're going to continue to grow this Wireless business for the next few years."

We grew customers in postpaid. We grew customers in prepaid. We grew in reseller and as Randall said, had a record quarter in connected devices. There is some comparability issues because, as you know, a large majority of the tablets that we've talked about, those sales were of the iPad and to the extent they're going to consumer customers, they tend to be under a prepaid rate plan. But it's a plan where we're seeing good consistent usage in ARPUs from. But we put it in the prepaid category. So I think as you're comparing our results and as you're looking at growth, it's helpful to understand that or to put the two categories, the prepaid and postpaid, together from a comparative standpoint."

Our plan is to continue to grow the margins there, to grow it on a consistent basis, and obviously, respond and compete in the marketplace. But there is an opportunity here, and it's important I think to take advantage of that opportunity to migrate your base up into higher-end data capable devices. And the upgrade policy is a part of that. But we'll continue to watch and see what's happening in the marketplace and make decisions that we feel are right for the company at the time in terms of striking the right balance in increasing smartphone penetration, as well as managing upgrade cost. And that's purely what it is. It's balance."

I think a broader device lineup, and you see us even broadening the device lineup as we go into 2011 just naturally creates a more competitive environment among device manufacturers and gives you opportunities to mitigate and manage subsidy costs, which are important. A couple of areas, in addition. As we've pointed out, some of the incremental areas, the tablet sales, which come on generally at low to no subsidy levels, in many cases, offer good margin opportunities. The connected devices provide incremental margin opportunity. And on the cost side, the one AT&T initiatives that we're pursuing really allow us to reduce costs because we're combining organizations and processes that support both Wireless and Wireline businesses. So those benefits accrue both to the Wireline and to the Wireless portions of the business. So those are the things that give you the opportunities to continue to expand the margins there. But we see a lot of upside in Wireless margins as we go forward over the next few years."

Obviously, we saw 2.2% postpaid ARPU growth in the fourth quarter. But if we look at the first half to the second half of the year, it's more like 1% growth, and if we look from second quarter to fourth quarter, it's actually less than 0.5% growth. And we've seen some of the strongest ever quarters that you guys have ever reported in terms of upselling customers and upselling into integrated devices and smartphones. And so what the incremental competition we've got coming in 2011, what gives you guys the comfort that just doing more of what you've been doing is actually going to continue to create year-over-year ARPU growth? Because the trends seem to be really sliding towards little or no growth even now at this stage before the real competition has come. And the second question is on the other side, Rick, I think you said U-verse actually contributed positively to margin. Can you elaborate a little bit is it positive margins or is it greater margins than the average of the Wireline base helping the overall total?"

But I think we're talking the same thing. If you look at our results, our postpaid ARPU growth in the first half",478,"First of all, on the ARPU trends, I think I understand that the numbers you were using, I'm going to use a bit different set of numbers there. But I think we're talking the same thing. If you look at our results, our postpaid ARPU growth in the first half of the year, we were in the kind of 3% plus range year-over-year and in the second half, on a year-over-year basis, it scaled down to kind of a low 2% range. There were two items that had some impact there. The biggest, the largest was the impact of regulatory fees and recovery charges that are embedded in the service revenue and the ARPU, and those fees and charges are just cost pass-throughs. And they do go up and down over time based on the costs incurred. And in the second half of the year as we reset those costs, the costs had gone down and so the regulatory recovery charge went down. And so that contributed to really the reduction of going from a 3% plus kind of year-over-year ARPU trend to a low 2% ARPU trend. So when you kind of strip that aside, what you're seeing is data revenues and the impact on ARPU has been continue to be very good and very consistent through the year. So that gives us comfort going forward. And then on top of that, I think as you continue to see Wireless data traffic growth and you start to think about the opportunities in a 4G environment and the applications there, as that usage grows, you will continue then to see growth opportunities in data ARPU as well there. So that's kind of the ARPU trend. On U-verse margins, let me give you two data points. U-verse has crossed and looking at the business in total, including not just the recurring margins but the acquisition costs associated with customers, the margins are positive from an EBITDA standpoint. They are below the average Wireline margins, but they are positive, and they're growing every single quarter. And that's just a function -- that's just the normal course that happens when you have a base and the base is relatively small in the beginning, and you're adding a lot of customers, the acquisition costs overwhelms the recurring margins from that base. But we're definitely seeing that trend improve, and it's turned positive. But secondly, if you look at -- put the acquisition, customer acquisition cost aside for a minute and to give you some idea of the capability in U-verse from a margin standpoint, the recurring margins of our U-verse customers are well into the 40s, which is, obviously, on an EBITDA basis significantly above our Wireline EBITDA margins. So again, that's what gives us I think comfort about the projected improvements and the opportunity we've got with U-verse as it scales."

We can get some economic left on the Enterprise business side. I hope we get some upside surprise there. But we're just assuming a fairly low economic growth rate during the 2011 time frame and that we can get the Enterprise business side kind of moving towards that growth profile by year end.

You've got to have both the radio infrastructure, as well as the backhaul in place in order to maximize the data speeds in these networks. In terms of upgrades, what we did in 2010, as you know, in the second half of the year is we did accelerate some upgrades by allowing customers that would have been eligible through the end of the year to begin upgrading earlier in the third quarter. And as I mentioned before, we continually look at our upgrade policies relative to the economics of these customers, what the subsidy levels are, what their usage ARPU and overall relationship with us is.

I think we did see some continued declines on the business side, and that's a reflection I think of two things. It's a reflection of, again, business customers moving to IP-based services. But it's also just some continued weakness, particularly in the market where we've not had strong growth or positive growth in new business formations. And when you look at kind of our small business base in particular actually, we're seeing churn rates and outward activity go down and are very positive. But with negative new business formations, we're not seeing the level of inward activity that we'd like to see going forward, and hopefully, that will improve as we go through 2011."

I like what we're seeing in terms of the customer behavior and the customer usage. And I really like how it positions us as a move forward into 4G networks and then the ability as usage accelerate from these devices make sure we have some capability to monetize the usage as we move forward. In terms of Android, we're probably going to be doing a number of things. Android is going to become a very broad-based OS for our portfolio, and there will be some proprietary label products. But Android is going to be so broad-based, it's going to be hard to put it into one single category. And so you're seeing a number of things we're doing in terms of tablet devices coming out on an Android platform. This new Motorola, which is a really exciting device. The tricks that will not be a proprietary brand, but it will be exclusive to us. And so there's going to be a lot of activity around Android because it is such a broad-based platform that can be utilized in a number of different areas and it's going to be a high priority for us as we move into 2011, and you're going to see a lot of that activity from us in Android.

Before Rick covers our results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and offer my view of the business and what you should expect from us in 2011.

Before Rick covers our results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and offer my view of the business and what you should expect from us in 2011. And as you've seen in our release, we had a very productive 2010. Our revenues grew. We grew earnings. Cash flow was strong. We closed the year well, and we expect another solid year in 2011 with continued revenue growth, margin expansion and growth in EPS and free cash flow.
As we look ahead, our confidence in the industry and our business in particular continues to be very high. We've invested heavily over the past few years, and those investments are beginning to scale. And it's driving revenue growth and margin improvements, and you know what these areas are. U-verse has driven growth in our consumer revenues now each of the last two quarters. And based on the results so far this year, we're adding more pay-TV subscribers than any other U.S. provider. Our VPN capabilities have proven to be a really strong platform for our strategic business services, and these services are going at a consistent mid-teens clip. And on top of these, mobile broadband is obviously our big driver. We just posted the best Wireless net add year in our history. In the fourth quarter, our mobile data revenues grew better than 27%, and we've grown postpaid ARPU now for eight straight quarters. As mobile broadband phenomenon just continues to exceed all of our expectations, our industry has, frankly, never experienced anything quite like it, and we haven't even talked about 4G yet. 
And as you know, we've completed our nationwide HSPA+ deployment, and where we combine that with advanced backhaul, we're getting 4G speeds today up to six meg. And we have plan to launch around 20 4G devices this year, two in the first quarter. 
And then on top of this, we've accelerated our LTE deployment. And when you combine HSPA+ with LTE, it's going to result in a much more consistent 4G experience for our customers. And then on the business side, when you take these mobile broadband capabilities and then layer on cloud and applications-based services, it really begins to let customers mobilize everything they do. So these are all large opportunities. They're scalable opportunities. And they're all early in their growth cycles. And as you can see from our results in sales of tablet and connected devices and our strong growth rates and strategic business services, we're way out front in each of these areas.
Now while the future Mobility will be driven by broadband, mobile voice quality is, obviously, important. And over the last 45 days with our vendors finally clearing their backlogs, we brought online a significant amount of new capacity. And our call retainability across the country is up 20 basis points at about 99%. And we see even greater improvements in Manhattan and San Francisco, and you should expect voice quality improvement throughout this year. So that's just a real quick overview. Again, 2010 was a very productive year. We're executing well. I expect another strong year in 2011 in our key platforms: Mobile Broadband, Business Solutions and U-verse. We think they're going to provide a nice platform for growth in the years ahead. 
So, Rick, I'll turn it over to you."
100231,117541380,96048,"AT&T, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randall. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 5. When you look at 2010, I think our financial results speak for themselves. They were strong across the board. Revenues for th",1793,"Thank you, Randall. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 5. When you look at 2010, I think our financial results speak for themselves. They were strong across the board. Revenues for the year were up 1.4% and 2.1% in the fourth quarter. Consolidated margins improved even with strong sales of integrated devices. And as a result, we grew adjusted earnings by 10.6% for the year.
In the fourth quarter, we had reported earnings per share of $0.18, and that includes: $0.26 of pressure from the year-end mark-to-market change in our benefit plan accounting, which we announced a couple of weeks ago; $0.09 of pressure due to severance charges; and $0.02 of pressure from asset impairments. Excluding these one-time items, earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.55, and that's up 10% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. And cash flow continues to be strong. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion in the quarter and $14.7 billion for the year.
Now I'd like to take a look at revenue growth and revenue mix on Slide 6. Our fourth quarter consolidated revenue totaled $31.4 billion, and that's up $653 million or 2.1%. The drivers continue to be strong Wireless growth and U-verse, which is improving our Wireline Consumer results and continued strength in strategic business services. These trends continue to transform our revenue mix.
In the fourth quarter, 73% of revenues came from Wireless, from Wireline data and from Managed Services, and that's up from 65% two years ago. Combined revenues from these sources were up 9% in the fourth quarter. And in fact, the fourth quarter marks the first time where our Wireless revenues have surpassed Wireline. We're confident that this mix shift will continue as mobile broadband continues to be a huge growth driver.
You'll see the impact of mobile broadband in our Wireless results, starting on Slide 7. It was another terrific Wireless growth quarter. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or 9.9%, and Wireless service revenues grew 9.6%, up more than $1.2 billion versus fourth quarter a year ago. This was driven by continued subscriber gains and strong data adoption. Data drove our eighth consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched by our peers, up by 2.2%, and we continue to have the highest postpaid ARPU in the industry.
Churn, both total and postpaid, continues to reach or match best-ever levels. We also had our best net add quarter ever, adding 2.8 million subscribers in the fourth quarter. In fact, we had our best ever year with 8.9 million subscribers added to the network in 2010, and that doesn't include those added through the Alltel property acquisition. Net adds in the fourth quarter were led by an increase of 1.5 million connected devices, the highest quarter ever. These devices bring lower ARPUs but attractive churn and margin characteristics.
Postpaid net adds for the quarter were 400,000. Prepaid net adds totaled more than 300,000, with strong iPad- and Android-based tablet activations. In fact, during the quarter, we added 442,000 tablets to the network, and we also had a solid reseller quarter with nearly 600,000 new subscribers. 
Our Data revenues continued their exceptional growth. The details are on Slide 8. We grew Wireless data revenues by more than 27%, up more than $1 billion year-over-year. Integrated device sales. Those are handsets with QWERTY or virtual keyboards in addition to voice functionality are a key driver of this growth, and we had another incredible integrated device quarter, our second highest sales quarter ever. Signing up more than 7.4 million subscribers, both upgrades and new customers, these sales netted 3.4 million new 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, and were up more than $13 million in the past 12 months.
Our results also reflect another strong quarter for iPhone activations, with more than 4 million activated during the quarter, resulting in 90% of our iPhone base being under contract. And in addition, our other smartphone sales increased significantly over the previous quarter. ARPU for integrated devices continues to be strong, 1.7x our other devices, and these subscribers tend to be very sticky for us, with more than 80% of the integrated device subscribers on family- or business-related plans with churn levels well below average. And the good news is we continue to have room to grow. About 60% of our postpaid base use these devices today, but our sales rate continues to increase and is now more than 80%.
Obviously, integrated device sales, along with high upgrade levels, have an impact on margins. The details are on Slide 9. Within integrated devices, we're also seeing a shift to a higher mix of high-end smartphones, devices that use an advanced operating system such as RIM, Apple OS or Windows 7. These devices tend to have higher subsidies than quick messaging devices, but they also bring higher ARPUs due to more robust data capability. And our customers continued to upgrade to higher-end smart phones in record numbers. In the fourth quarter, we had about 2 million more smartphone sales than we did in fourth quarter of 2009. And over 9% of our base upgraded their device in the quarter, signing a new two-year contract in the process, and I think that says a lot about the confidence and the loyalty they have in AT&T.
Smartphone sales and upgrade levels did impact fourth quarter Wireless margins. In the quarter, Wireless EBITDA service margin was 37.6%. That's flat sequentially and down from fourth quarter a year ago. And for the year, our EBITDA service margin was 40.7%. The offset to higher device subsidies is the long-term value these customers bring, including higher ARPUs, lower churn and strong data growth. And you see that in our Wireless operating income which was up more than 10% for the year to reach $15.3 billion.
I'd like to turn now and cover our Wireline results, starting with consumer trends on Slide 10. This was another strong quarter for U-verse, and it drove our second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in Consumer Wireline. We had 246,000 U-verse video net adds in the quarter, and we hit an important customer milestone earlier this month when we reached 3 million subscribers. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remained very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers had a triple- or quad-play bundle, and the ARPU for these customers continues to grow, up 14% year-over-year. As a result, our U-verse economics are attractive and growing. It is now a $5 billion annualized revenue stream, and U-verse exited the year with positive impact on margins.
We also had another strong quarter in total broadband adds, up 210,000 year-over-year. Our Wireline Consumer IP data revenues, that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 30% for the year, and these products now represent 45% of total Consumer Wireline revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points over the past year. We expect continued U-verse growth and scale to drive further improvements in our overall Wireline financials.
Now let's take a look at business Wireline on Slide 11. Here, we're seeing the same consistent trends impacting the business that we have all year. As the lack of growth and business formations and employment continue to put some pressure on the Wireline business, you see that in our fourth quarter service revenue results, which were down 4.3% year-over-year on a reported basis and 3.5% after adjusting for the third quarter sales of the company's Japan assets. We are, however, seeing some bright spots in our federal networks contracts and in our Wholesale business, and we had our strongest quarter of the year in strategic business products. Revenues from these products including Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks and application services were up over 17%. And overall business IP revenues were up 9% in the fourth quarter and contributed to positive business data growth.
Plus we continue to do well, selling Wireless into the business space. We're seeing a fundamental shift with more enterprises asking us to help them deploy full mobile solutions, solutions that bring together mobile broadband, cloud computing, seamless access to applications and even social media. We're well positioned to lead in this transition, and we're excited about this future opportunity.
Now I'd like to take a look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 12. We said at the beginning of last year that we expected stable to improved consolidated margins when compared to 2009, and we delivered on that. For the year, our adjusted consolidated operating income margin was 18.5%, that's up from 17.7% in 2009. This reflects improving revenue trends in both Wireless and Wireline Consumer and solid execution of cost initiatives across the company. Our wireline operating margin remains stable from 2009, and that was driven by improving revenue trends and good cost management. 
Across the business, total force was down by more than 16,000, and we're making great strides with One AT&T. As we consolidate and integrate Wireline and Wireless operations under one AT&T, we continue to drive down costs. These initiatives strengthen our ability to sustain solid margins and put us in a unique position among our competitors to serve customers seamlessly with a best-in-class operation. These initiatives have achieved expense savings of more than $1 billion a year. And recently, we launched our next phase of One AT&T designed to simplify our product offerings, and we anticipate significant value from these new initiatives on top of our normal cost management efforts.
Along with solid margins, we also continued to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash summary is on Slide 13. In 2010, cash from operations totaled $35 billion, capital expenditures were $20.3 billion, with a more than 50% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital. Our free cash flow was $14.7 billion. I do need to point out that as we go forward and prepare to launch our LTE network in 2011, we will no longer capitalize interest for the radio spectrum we purchased to use for LTE. This will increase interest expense and reduce 2011 earnings per share by $0.07, as well as reduce capital expenditures.
Dividend payments in 2010 totaled $9.9 billion, and over the last six quarters, we've generated almost $9 billion of free cash flow after dividends. In terms of uses of that cash, our debt level is down almost $6 billion over the past 12 months, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 37% and an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.56. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business while returning substantial value to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Randall Stephenson for closing comments. Randall?"
100231,117541380,96048,"AT&T, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Rick. Before we go in to the Q&A, I just want to make a couple of additional comments. Just looking back at the last three years, we've executed with a lot of discipline through this downturn, and we've marketed well. We've won customers. I",566,"Okay. Thanks, Rick. Before we go in to the Q&A, I just want to make a couple of additional comments. Just looking back at the last three years, we've executed with a lot of discipline through this downturn, and we've marketed well. We've won customers. I think we've done a very good job on the cost side. When you look at the metrics Rick just walked you through, I think it's pretty clear that AT&T is coming out of the downturn stronger, both operationally and financially, than we were going in. 
We have a better balance sheet, better revenue trends, better margins and a more growth-oriented business, and then all of this reflects solid execution by the people across this company. And as you look ahead, most important thing we've done over the past few years is that we've built and we've scaled some very nice growth platforms for the future. Mobile broadband, U-verse, VPN, cloud-based services, and we've invested very aggressively in all these areas. We've kept CapEx strong. We've acquired high-quality spectrum. While we've done all of that, we've maintained the financial strength to return substantial value to the owners. We've increased the dividend now for the 27th straight year, and we authorized a stock repurchase. 
So as we look forward to 2011 and I've laid this out for you on Slide 15, we have a solid plan to continue growing revenues, earnings and cash flow. And so here are the variables: We do expect healthy contract subscriber growth in 2011 even with the introduction of another carrier for the iPhone. Obviously, this is going to make things a little bit harder to predict early on in the year, but with the introduction of new Android and other devices, we think the smartphone market will continue to be very strong for us. And this is consistent with what you saw on the fourth quarter, which was our second highest smartphone quarter in our history; we also had a strong fourth quarter in tablets and connected devices. We expect that momentum to continue through 2011 and beyond; we expect to expand our Wireless and our Wireline operating margins; and excluding the capitalized interest impacts, we expect 2011 EPS growth in the mid-single digits or better. And as the market settles beyond 2011, we have an opportunity to accelerate our EPS growth even further; we're targeting capital this year in the low to mid-$19 billion range, and we expect free cash flow will be up from 2010. 
So this is an outlook that reflects the quality of the growth platforms. It also reflects our proven ability to execute on the cost side. And I'd add that it does not include any kind of significant lift from the economy. And I'm hopeful we're going to see more from the economy this year. We're beginning to see a few encouraging signs, but we do not have any kind of economic turn built into our expectations, and that just reflects our approach. As most of you know, we tend to be very conservative in these areas. So we had a very productive 2010. We are confident 2011 is going to be strong as well, and what has me most excited is this industry's potential over the next few years and how AT&T is positioned here in the long term. 
So, Brooks, with that, I think we're ready for questions."

Obviously, a lot more smartphones, but do you expect that to -- and I know a lot of confidence about the group being able to grow the postpaid base, which I think is you don't hear a lot of, but do you expect to have to spend more or advertise or increase subsidies or how do you expect to -- is that really the difference there that margins might not expand as much as the lower iPhone shipments would probably suggest?"

When you look at the guidance, there a couple of things that are underlying it, and I just spoke to them but just very briefly. Obviously, the economy -- we are not expecting any kind of dramatic lift in economic growth. And this is -- we think it's fairly conservative. I think it's prudent that we set our cost structure around a slower economic growth scenario. But we're beginning to see some encouraging signs. Businesses are investing again, and we're seeing early indications of that. We are starting to see some hiring. But the reason we moderate this is business starts to continue to be negative across the country, and that's probably one of the best early indicators for us when this thing begins to turn. So we're hopeful as we kind of work through this first quarter and second quarter, we begin to see the business starts turn and with any luck, we'd get some upside from the economy there. The second area though is this idea of an iPhone going on to a second network. This is going to create some volatility in the first part of the year, and it's going to be kind of hard to predict the first part of the year as Verizon launches an iPhone. But as I mentioned in the comments, I feel fairly confident we're going to be able to grow over the course of the year through the disruption, and then there's a couple of reasons for this. And one of them is if you just look at the fourth quarter, it was no secret that the iPhone was going to be available in a competitor's network, and the competitive environment was reflecting that. And in spite of that, we had our second-best integrated sales quarter ever, and iPhone sales continued to be very strong in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was among the best quarters we've ever done as well. We sold 4 million iPhones, and that just kind of gives us some confidence in terms of customer loyalty to the network. And so again, it'll probably, maybe rocky in the beginning of the year, kind of volatile, hard to predict, but we think as we work, the market stabilizes, we'll be able to grow through it. The other thing is the sales mix will change this year. We have not been very aggressive in the Android portfolio, and we're bringing Android into the mix very aggressively this year. You've seen some of the devices that we'll be bringing in. And so we're going to be a heavy participant in the Android markets at this year, and so you're going to see a significant shift in mix. And then you add Windows 7 and RIM products are actually starting to do very well and getting a lot of traction in the market and then our sales channels. We think were actually going to have a nice mix shift and do quite well in those areas. And then last, we're really starting to feel good about the network situation. We're making a lot of progress here. And as I commented in the opening comments, we had a significant clearing of backlog from our vendors in December. We were having some serious capacity constraints in key markets, and we really saw the backlogs clear and we spent the last 45 days literally just bringing capacity online in a rather dramatic fashion and we're seeing those numbers move. And so you put all this together, we actually feel like, again, with a little volatility in the first part of the year, we can grow contract subscribers through the course of this year."

But there is, obviously, there's an interplay in the modeling, in the guidance, in the expectations between in the Wireless side between volumes and mix of volumes and device sales and what kind of margins and earnings growth you expect. And as Randall said, as we look at the trends and we look at the trends particularly in the last quarter or two, what we're seeing is continued strong iPhone sales despite the anticipation of the iPhone being nonexclusive. We did over 9 million iPhones in just the last two quarters. That's a pretty phenomenal number when you think about it. That, plus the high upgrade rates we've seen and the growth we're seeing in sales of other smartphones -- smartphones with a RIM operating system and a Windows operating system, the Android models we've got coming on into the device lineup in 2011, I think are very exciting. So our guidance is based on a presumption that we're going to continue to see strong sales of smartphones, and we're going to continue to grow the business. We're going to grow it in customers, in ARPU and obviously, in revenues. In terms of how you compete in this environment, again, we feel we're in a good position. We're going to have a tremendous device portfolio for customers to choose from. We've got a network evolution path, I think, that will be the most elegant from a customer standpoint by having both HSPA+ across our entire footprint as we roll out LTE. And then finally, as Randall said, we are seeing and expect to see continued significant improvements on the voice side. So that's essentially the position that we'll compete from as we go into '11."

You always have kind of a bit of a lull as you get past the holiday season. But again, we're seeing, I think, continued good sales activity. I think the iPhone 3G model at a $49 price point will be an attractive model for our customer base. And again, as you look at the fourth quarter activity, the level of upgrades we had, which is really the second highest level of upgrades and customers signing two-year contracts that we've ever had only surpassed by the third quarter of last year combined with the sales of smartphones, I think both of those bode well for the business in an environment where the iPhone is not exclusive. In terms of the cost side, and we touched on this a bit in the presentation, but we see continued opportunities, both in the Wireless and Wireline sides of the business, and it's driven by a couple of things. First, the One AT&T initiatives, which is really, it's been a series of initiatives over the last few years. And as we mentioned, we just, at the end of last year, kicked off a new set of one AT&T initiatives targeted at simplifying some of our product offerings. But these initiatives if you step back from over the last several years have consistently been providing cost reduction on a year-over-year basis in excess of $1 billion a year. And we see the same kind of opportunity going forward as we look into 2011 and 2012. But secondly, and this is kind of a broader piece of it and it gets to a comment Randall made in the presentation about the opportunity to begin to accelerate some of the trends in the business as we get even past 2011, is we talked about the change in the mix of our business. And what you're seeing is that some of the growth platforms, and U-verse is a perfect example, those growth platforms are beginning to scale. And just a natural part of our business as those products and platforms scale, the margins improve. So we're seeing steady, consistent margin improvement there. And as we go forward and particularly as we get out past 2011, you start to see some of the drag on the business from legacy products like Wireline voice start to decline, and it's the combination of those two things that I think gives the business opportunity to begin to accelerate both in terms of revenues and margins as we go forward even past 2011."

And if you look at just the sales channel, the sales funnel, about over 80% of the sales into our postpaid base are on integrated devices. And then by the way, that number just keeps creeping up quarter in and quarter out, and so I don't think 80% is going to prove to be the cap on what percentage of these bases have integrated devices. So we've got quite a bit of room to run just in our traditional postpaid base on ARPUs, and those ARPU improvements are significant when they move onto integrated devices. So we'll continue, as an industry, to push that, and we'll continue to move that along. I think 80% is going to prove to be a floor and not a ceiling. So plenty of room there. When you think about MiFi, we're selling MiFi-type capability today. If you think about what those mi-fi products are serving, largely they tend to be serving tablets. As you know, we have the 3G capability built into the tablets, predominantly, that we sell. And when you look at what we sold in the fourth quarter, we sold 442,000 tablets that are running on the network, and so I kind of compare the two. Those are equivalent. And so we're having very, very strong results in terms of selling tablets, and I'd tell you to keep in mind we're really early on in tablets. I mean, this thing is still in its infancy, and we think this has a lot of room to run. And by and large, the tablet market is being dominated by the Apple products, the new stuff is just now coming online. And so you're going to see a lot of Android-type tablets come online, and that'll push that along as well. So we think we have a lot of opportunity in terms of tablets. And I would also tell you not to disregard the connected devices. This is a huge growth area for us. And so if you think about ARPU being the first place we're obviously going as an industry. Smartphones and integrated devices, tablets are going to be a significant driver to revenue growth as we move forward. Connected devices are proving to be very powerful, and we added 1.5 million of these in the quarter and kind of setting the pace for the industry. And I believe the connected devices products are going to accelerate as we move into 4G capabilities. So you put all those together, and it gives us a lot of confidence, we're going to continue to grow this Wireless business for the next few years."

We grew customers in postpaid. We grew customers in prepaid. We grew in reseller and as Randall said, had a record quarter in connected devices. There is some comparability issues because, as you know, a large majority of the tablets that we've talked about, those sales were of the iPad and to the extent they're going to consumer customers, they tend to be under a prepaid rate plan. But it's a plan where we're seeing good consistent usage in ARPUs from. But we put it in the prepaid category. So I think as you're comparing our results and as you're looking at growth, it's helpful to understand that or to put the two categories, the prepaid and postpaid, together from a comparative standpoint."

Our plan is to continue to grow the margins there, to grow it on a consistent basis, and obviously, respond and compete in the marketplace. But there is an opportunity here, and it's important I think to take advantage of that opportunity to migrate your base up into higher-end data capable devices, and the upgrade policy is a part of that. But we'll continue to watch and see what's happening in the marketplace and make decisions that we feel are right for the company at the time in terms of striking the right balance in increasing smartphone penetration, as well as managing upgrade cost.

Like all of our businesses, as you continue to grow and scale, you have the opportunities to increase margins. I think a broader device lineup, and you see us even broadening the device lineup as we go into 2011, just naturally creates a more competitive environment among device manufacturers and gives you opportunities to mitigate and manage subsidy costs, which are important. A couple of areas, in addition, as we've pointed out, some of the incremental areas, the tablet sales, which come on generally at low to no subsidy levels, in many cases, offer good margin opportunities. The connected devices provide incremental margin opportunity. And on the cost side, the One AT&T initiatives that we're pursuing really allow us to reduce costs because we're combining organizations and processes that support both Wireless and Wireline businesses. So those benefits accrue both to the Wireline and to the Wireless portions of the business. So those are the things that give you the opportunities to continue to expand the margins there. But we see a lot of upside in Wireless margins as we go forward over the next few years."

Obviously, we saw a 2.2% postpaid ARPU growth in the fourth quarter. But if we look at the first half to the second half of the year, it's more like 1% growth. And if we look from second quarter to fourth quarter, it's actually less than 0.5% growth. And we've seen some of the strongest ever quarters that you guys have ever reported in terms of upselling customers and upselling into integrated devices and smartphones. And so with the incremental competition we've got coming in 2011, what gives you guys the comfort that just doing more of what you've been doing is actually going to continue to create year-over-year ARPU growth? Because the trends seem to be really sliding towards little or no growth even now at this stage before the real competition has come. And the second question is, on the other side, Rick, I think you said U-verse is actually contributing positively to margin now. Can you elaborate a little bit, is it positive margins or is it greater margins than the average of the Wireline base helping the overall total?"

If you looked at our results, our postpaid ARPU growth in the first half of the year, we were in the kind of 3%-plus range year-over-year and in the second half on a year-over-year basis, it scaled down to kind of a low 2% range. There were two items that had some impact there. The biggest, the largest was the impact of regulatory fees and recovery charges that are embedded in the service revenue and the ARPU. And those fees and charges are just cost pass-throughs, and they do go up and down over time based on the costs incurred. And in the second half of the year as we reset those costs, the costs had gone down and so the regulatory recovery charge went down. And so that contributed to really the reduction of going from a 3%-plus kind of year-over-year ARPU trend to a low 2% ARPU trend. So when you kind of strip that aside, what you're seeing is Data revenues and the impact on ARPU has been -- continued to be very good and very consistent through the year. So that gives us comfort going forward. And then on top of that, I think as you continue to see Wireless data traffic growth and you start to think about the opportunities in a 4G environment and the applications there, as that usage grows, you will continue then to see growth opportunities in Data ARPU as well there. So that's kind of the ARPU trend. On U-verse margins, let me give you two data points. U-verse has crossed and looking at the business in total, including not just the recurring margins but the acquisition costs associated with customers, the margins are positive from an EBITDA standpoint. They are below the average Wireline margins, but they are positive, and they're growing every single quarter. And that's just a function -- that's just the normal course that happens when you have a base and the base is relatively small in the beginning, and you're adding a lot of customers, the acquisition costs overwhelms the recurring margins from that base. But we're definitely seeing that trend improve, and it's turned positive. But secondly, if you look at -- put the acquisition, customer acquisition cost aside for a minute, and to give you some idea of the capability in U-verse from a margin standpoint, the recurring margins of our U-verse customers are well into the 40s, which is, obviously, on an EBITDA basis, significantly above our Wireline EBITDA margins. So again, that's what gives us, I think, comfort about the projected improvements and the opportunity we've got with U-verse as it scales."

You've got to have both the radio infrastructure, as well as the backhaul in place in order to maximize the data speeds in these networks. In terms of upgrades, what we did in 2010, as you know, in the second half of the year, is we did accelerate some upgrades by allowing customers that would have been eligible through the end of the year to begin upgrading earlier in the third quarter. And as I mentioned before, we continually look at our upgrade policies relative to the economics of these customers, what the subsidy levels are, what their usage ARPU and overall relationship with us is.

But it's also just some continued weakness, particularly in the market where we've not had strong growth or positive growth in new business formations. And when you look at kind of our small business base in particular, actually we're seeing churn rates and outward activity go down and are very positive. But with negative new business formations, we're not seeing the level of inward activity that we'd like to see going forward, and hopefully, that will improve as we go through 2011."

But Android is going to be so broad-based, it's going to be hard to put it into one single category. And so you're seeing a number of things we're doing in terms of tablet devices coming out on an Android platform, this new Motorola, which is a really exciting device, the Atrix. That will not be a proprietary brand, but it will be an exclusive to us.

Before Rick covers our results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and offer my view of the business and what you should expect from us in 2011.

Before Rick covers our results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and offer my view of the business and what you should expect from us in 2011. And as you've seen in our release, we had a very productive 2010. Our revenues grew. We grew earnings. Cash flow was strong. We closed the year well, and we expect another solid year in 2011 with continued revenue growth, margin expansion and growth in EPS and free cash flow.
As we look ahead, our confidence in the industry and our business in particular continues to be very high. We've invested heavily over the past few years, and those investments are beginning to scale. And it's driving revenue growth and margin improvements, and you know what these areas are. U-verse has driven growth in our consumer revenues now each of the last two quarters. And based on the results so far this year, we're adding more pay-TV subscribers than any other U.S. provider. Our VPN capabilities have proven to be a really strong platform for our strategic business services, and these services are going at a consistent mid-teens clip. And on top of these, mobile broadband is obviously our big driver. We just posted the best Wireless net add year in our history. In the fourth quarter, our mobile data revenues grew better than 27%, and we've grown postpaid ARPU now for eight straight quarters. As mobile broadband phenomenon just continues to exceed all of our expectations, our industry has, frankly, never experienced anything quite like it, and we haven't even talked about 4G yet. 
And as you know, we've completed our nationwide HSPA+ deployment, and where we combine that with advanced backhaul, we're getting 4G speeds today up to six meg. And we have planned to launch around 20 4G devices this year, two in the first quarter. 
And then on top of this, we've accelerated our LTE deployment. And when you combine HSPA+ with LTE, it's going to result in a much more consistent 4G experience for our customers. And then on the business side, when you take these mobile broadband capabilities and then layer on cloud and applications-based services, it really begins to let customers mobilize everything they do. So these are all large opportunities. They're scalable opportunities. And they're all early in their growth cycles. And as you can see from our results in sales of tablet and connected devices and our strong growth rates and strategic business services, we're way out front in each of these areas.
Now, while the future Mobility will be driven by broadband, mobile voice quality is, obviously, important. And over the last 45 days with our vendors finally clearing their backlogs, we brought online a significant amount of new capacity. And our call retainability across the country is up 20 basis points at about 99%. And we see even greater improvements in Manhattan and San Francisco, and you should expect voice quality improvement throughout this year. So that's just a real quick overview. Again, 2010 was a very productive year. We're executing well. I expect another strong year in 2011 in our key platforms: Mobile Broadband, Business Solutions and U-verse. We think they're going to provide a nice platform for growth in the years ahead. 
So, Rick, I'll turn it over to you."
100231,117541380,96272,"AT&T, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randall. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 5. When you look at 2010, I think our financial results speak for themselves. They were strong across the board. Revenues for th",1790,"Thank you, Randall. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 5. When you look at 2010, I think our financial results speak for themselves. They were strong across the board. Revenues for the year were up 1.4% and 2.1% in the fourth quarter. Consolidated margins improved even with strong sales of integrated devices. And as a result, we grew adjusted earnings by 10.6% for the year.
In the fourth quarter, we had reported earnings per share of $0.18, and that includes: $0.26 of pressure from the year-end mark-to-market change in our benefit plan accounting, which we announced a couple of weeks ago; $0.09 of pressure due to severance charges; and $0.02 of pressure from asset impairments. Excluding these one-time items, earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.55, and that's up 10% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. And cash flow continues to be strong. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion in the quarter and $14.7 billion for the year.
Now I'd like to take a look at revenue growth and revenue mix on Slide 6. Our fourth quarter consolidated revenue totaled $31.4 billion, and that's up $653 million or 2.1%. The drivers continue to be strong Wireless growth and U-verse, which is improving our Wireline Consumer results and continued strength in strategic business services. These trends continue to transform our revenue mix.
In the fourth quarter, 73% of revenues came from Wireless, from Wireline data and from Managed Services, and that's up from 65% two years ago. Combined revenues from these sources were up 9% in the fourth quarter. And in fact, the fourth quarter marks the first time where our Wireless revenues have surpassed Wireline. We're confident that this mix shift will continue as mobile broadband continues to be a huge growth driver.
You'll see the impact of mobile broadband in our Wireless results, starting on Slide 7. It was another terrific Wireless growth quarter. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or 9.9%, and Wireless service revenues grew 9.6%, up more than $1.2 billion versus fourth quarter a year ago. This was driven by continued subscriber gains and strong data adoption. Data drove our eighth consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched by our peers, up by 2.2%, and we continue to have the highest postpaid ARPU in the industry.
Churn, both total and postpaid, continues to reach or match best-ever levels. We also had our best net add quarter ever, adding 2.8 million subscribers in the fourth quarter. In fact, we had our best ever year with 8.9 million subscribers added to the network in 2010, and that doesn't include those added through the Alltel property acquisition. Net adds in the fourth quarter were led by an increase of 1.5 million connected devices, the highest quarter ever. These devices bring lower ARPUs but attractive churn and margin characteristics.
Postpaid net adds for the quarter were 400,000. Prepaid net adds totaled more than 300,000, with strong iPad- and Android-based tablet activations. In fact, during the quarter, we added 442,000 tablets to the network, and we also had a solid reseller quarter with nearly 600,000 new subscribers. 
Our Data revenues continued their exceptional growth. The details are on Slide 8. We grew Wireless data revenues by more than 27%, up more than $1 billion year-over-year. Integrated device sales, those are handsets with QWERTY or virtual keyboards in addition to voice functionality, are a key driver of this growth, and we had another incredible integrated device quarter, our second highest sales quarter ever. Signing up more than 7.4 million subscribers, both upgrades and new customers, these sales netted 3.4 million new 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, and were up more than $13 million in the past 12 months.
Our results also reflect another strong quarter for iPhone activations, with more than 4 million activated during the quarter, resulting in 90% of our iPhone base being under contract. And in addition, our other smartphone sales increased significantly over the previous quarter. ARPU for integrated devices continues to be strong, 1.7x our other devices, and these subscribers tend to be very sticky for us, with more than 80% of the integrated device subscribers on family- or business-related plans with churn levels well below average. And the good news is we continue to have room to grow. About 60% of our postpaid base use these devices today, but our sales rate continues to increase and is now more than 80%.
Obviously, integrated device sales, along with high upgrade levels, have an impact on margins. The details are on Slide 9. Within integrated devices, we're also seeing a shift to a higher mix of high-end smartphones, devices that use an advanced operating system such as RIM, Apple OS or Windows 7. These devices tend to have higher subsidies than quick messaging devices, but they also bring higher ARPUs due to more robust data capability. And our customers continued to upgrade to higher-end smartphones in record numbers. In the fourth quarter, we had about 2 million more smartphone sales than we did in fourth quarter of 2009. And over 9% of our base upgraded their device in the quarter, signing a new two-year contract in the process, and I think that says a lot about the confidence and the loyalty they have in AT&T.
Smartphone sales and upgrade levels did impact fourth quarter Wireless margins. In the quarter, Wireless OIBIDA service margin was 37.6%. That's flat sequentially and down from fourth quarter a year ago. And for the year, our OIBIDA service margin was 40.7%. The offset to higher device subsidies is the long-term value these customers bring, including higher ARPUs, lower churn and strong data growth. And you see that in our Wireless operating income which was up more than 10% for the year to reach $15.3 billion.
I'd like to turn now and cover our Wireline results, starting with consumer trends on Slide 10. This was another strong quarter for U-verse, and it drove our second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in Consumer Wireline. We had 246,000 U-verse video net adds in the quarter, and we hit an important customer milestone earlier this month when we reached 3 million subscribers. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remained very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers had a triple- or quad-play bundle, and the ARPU for these customers continues to grow, up 14% year-over-year. As a result, our U-verse economics are attractive and growing. It is now a $5 billion annualized revenue stream, and U-verse exited the year with positive impact on margins.
We also had another strong quarter in total broadband adds, up 210,000 year-over-year. Our Wireline Consumer IP data revenues, that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 30% for the year, and these products now represent 45% of total Consumer Wireline revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points over the past year. We expect continued U-verse growth and scale to drive further improvements in our overall Wireline financials.
Now let's take a look at business Wireline on Slide 11. Here, we're seeing the same consistent trends impacting the business that we have all year. As the lack of growth and business formations and employment continue to put some pressure on the Wireline business, you see that in our fourth quarter service revenue results, which were down 4.3% year-over-year on a reported basis and 3.5% after adjusting for the third quarter sales of the company's Japan assets. We are, however, seeing some bright spots in our federal networks contracts and in our Wholesale business, and we had our strongest quarter of the year in strategic business products. Revenues from these products including Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks and application services were up over 17%. And overall business IP revenues were up 9% in the fourth quarter and contributed to positive business data growth.
Plus, we continue to do well, selling Wireless into the business space. We're seeing a fundamental shift with more enterprises asking us to help them deploy full mobile solutions, solutions that bring together mobile broadband, cloud computing, seamless access to applications and even social media. We're well positioned to lead in this transition, and we're excited about this future opportunity.
Now I'd like to take a look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 12. We said at the beginning of last year that we expected stable to improved consolidated margins when compared to 2009, and we delivered on that. For the year, our adjusted consolidated operating income margin was 18.5%, that's up from 17.7% in 2009. This reflects improving revenue trends in both Wireless and Wireline Consumer and solid execution of cost initiatives across the company. Our Wireline operating margin remains stable from 2009, and that was driven by improving revenue trends and good cost management. 
Across the business, total force was down by more than 16,000, and we're making great strides with One AT&T. As we consolidate and integrate Wireline and Wireless operations under One AT&T, we continue to drive down costs. These initiatives strengthen our ability to sustain solid margins and put us in a unique position among our competitors to serve customers seamlessly with a best-in-class operation. These initiatives have achieved expense savings of more than $1 billion a year. And recently, we launched our next phase of One AT&T designed to simplify our product offerings, and we anticipate significant value from these new initiatives on top of our normal cost management efforts.
Along with solid margins, we also continued to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash summary is on Slide 13. In 2010, cash from operations totaled $35 billion, capital expenditures were $20.3 billion, with a more than 50% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital. Our free cash flow was $14.7 billion. I do need to point out that as we go forward and prepare to launch our LTE network in 2011, we will no longer capitalize interest for the radio spectrum we purchased to use for LTE. This will increase interest expense and reduce 2011 earnings per share by $0.07, as well as reduce capital expenditures.
Dividend payments in 2010 totaled $9.9 billion, and over the last six quarters, we've generated almost $9 billion of free cash flow after dividends. In terms of uses of that cash, our debt level is down almost $6 billion over the past 12 months, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 37% and an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.56. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business while returning substantial value to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Randall Stephenson for closing comments. Randall?"
100231,117541380,96272,"AT&T, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Rick. Before we go in to the Q&A, I just want to make a couple of additional comments. Just looking back at the last three years, we've executed with a lot of discipline through this downturn, and we've marketed well. We've won customers. I",568,"Okay. Thanks, Rick. Before we go in to the Q&A, I just want to make a couple of additional comments. Just looking back at the last three years, we've executed with a lot of discipline through this downturn, and we've marketed well. We've won customers. I think we've done a very good job on the cost side. When you look at the metrics Rick just walked you through, I think it's pretty clear that AT&T is coming out of the downturn stronger, both operationally and financially, than we were going in. 
We have a better balance sheet, better revenue trends, better margins and a more growth-oriented business, and then all of this reflects solid execution by the people across this company. And as you look ahead, most important thing we've done over the past few years is that we've built and we've scaled some very nice growth platforms for the future. Mobile broadband, U-verse, VPN and cloud-based services, and we've invested very aggressively in all these areas. We've kept CapEx strong. We've acquired high-quality spectrum. And while we've done all of that, we've maintained the financial strength to return substantial value to the owners. We've increased the dividend now for the 27th straight year, and we authorized a stock repurchase. 
So as we look forward to 2011 and I've laid this out for you on Slide 15, we have a solid plan to continue growing revenues, earnings and cash flow. And so here are the variables: We do expect healthy contract subscriber growth in 2011 even with the introduction of another carrier for the iPhone. Obviously, this is going to make things a little bit harder to predict early on in the year, but with the introduction of new Android and other devices, we think the smartphone market will continue to be very strong for us. And this is consistent with what you saw on the fourth quarter, which was our second highest smartphone quarter in our history; we also had a strong fourth quarter in tablets and connected devices, we expect that momentum to continue through 2011 and beyond; we expect to expand our Wireless and our Wireline operating margins; and excluding the capitalized interest impacts, we expect 2011 EPS growth in the mid-single digits or better. And as the market settles beyond 2011, we have an opportunity to accelerate our EPS growth even further; we're targeting capital this year in the low to mid-$19 billion range, and we expect free cash flow will be up from 2010. 
So this is an outlook that reflects the quality of the growth platforms. It also reflects our proven ability to execute on the cost side. And I'd add that it does not include any kind of significant lift from the economy. And I'm hopeful we're going to see more from the economy this year. We're beginning to see a few encouraging signs. But we do not have any kind of economic turn built into our expectations and that just reflects our approach. As most of you know, we tend to be very conservative in these areas. So we had a very productive 2010. We are confident 2011 is going to be strong as well, and what has me most excited is this industry's potential over the next few years and how AT&T is positioned here in the long term. 
So, Brooks, with that, I think we're ready for questions."

Obviously, a lot more smartphones, but do you expect that to -- and I know a lot of confidence about the group being able to grow the postpaid base, which I think is you don't hear a lot of, but do you expect to have to spend more or advertise or increase subsidies or how do you expect to -- is that really the difference there that margins might not expand as much as the lower iPhone shipments would probably suggest?"

But when you look at the guidance, there a couple of things that are underlying it and I just spoke to them. But just very briefly, obviously, the economy, we are not expecting any kind of dramatic lift in economic growth. And this is -- we think it's fairly conservative. I think it's prudent that we set our cost structure around a slower economic growth scenario. But we're beginning to see some encouraging signs. Businesses are investing again, and we're seeing early indications of that. We are starting to see some hiring. But the reason we moderate this is business starts to continue to be negative across the country, and that's probably one of the best early indicators for us when this thing begins to turn. So we're hopeful as we kind of work through this first quarter and second quarter, we begin to see the business starts turn and with any luck, we'd get some upside from the economy there. The second area, though, is this idea of an iPhone going on to a second network. This is going to create some volatility in the first part of the year, and it's going to be kind of hard to predict the first part of the year as Verizon launches an iPhone. But as I mentioned in the comments, I feel fairly confident we're going to be able to grow over the course of the year through the disruption, and there's a couple of reasons for this. And one of them is if you just look at the fourth quarter, it was no secret that the iPhone was going to be available on a competitor's network, and the competitive environment was reflecting that. And in spite of that, we had our second-best integrated sales quarter ever, and iPhone sales continued to be very strong in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was among the best quarters we've ever done as well. We sold 4 million iPhones, and that just kind of gives us some confidence in terms of customer loyalty to the network. And so again, it'll probably-- it may be rocky in the beginning of the year, kind of volatile, hard to predict, but we think as we work, the market stabilizes, we'll be able to grow through it. The other thing is the sales mix will change this year. We have not been very aggressive in the Android portfolio, and we're bringing Android into the mix very aggressively this year. You've seen some of the devices that we'll be bringing in. And so we're going to be a heavy participant in the Android market this year, and so you're going to see a significant shift in mix. And then you add Windows 7 and RIMs products are actually starting to do very well and getting a lot of traction in the market and then our sales channels. We think were actually going to have a nice mix shift and do quite well in those areas. And then last, we're really starting to feel good about the network situation. We're making a lot of progress here. And as I commented in the opening comments, we had a significant clearing of backlog from our vendors in December. We were having some serious capacity constraints in key markets, and we really saw the backlogs clear. And we spent the last 45 days literally just bringing capacity online in a rather dramatic fashion, and we're seeing those numbers move. And so you put all this together, we actually feel like, again, with a little volatility in the first part of the year, we can grow contract subscribers through the course of this year."

But there is, obviously, there's an interplay in the modeling, in the guidance, in the expectations between -- in the Wireless side between volumes and mix of volumes and device sales and what kind of margins and earnings growth you expect. And as Randall said, as we look at the trends and we look at the trends particularly in the last quarter or two, what we're seeing is continued strong iPhone sales despite the anticipation of the iPhone being nonexclusive. We did over 9 million iPhones in just the last two quarters. That's a pretty phenomenal number when you think about it. That, plus the high upgrade rates we've seen and the growth we're seeing in sales of other smartphones -- smartphones with a RIM operating system and a Windows operating system, the Android models we've got coming on into the device lineup in 2011, I think are very exciting. So our guidance is based on a presumption that we're going to continue to see strong sales of smartphones, and we're going to continue to grow the business. We're going to grow it in customers, in ARPU and obviously, in revenues. In terms of how you compete in this environment, again, we feel we're in a good position. We're going to have a tremendous device portfolio for customers to choose from. We've got a network evolution path, I think, that is -- will be the most elegant from a customer standpoint by having both HSPA+ across our entire footprint as we roll out LTE. And then finally, as Randall said, we are seeing and expect to see continued significant improvements on the Voice side. So that's essentially the position that we'll compete from as we go into '11."

You always have kind of a bit of a lull as you get past the holiday season. But again, we're seeing, I think, continued good sales activity. I think the iPhone 3G model at a $49 price point will be an attractive model for our customer base. And again, as you look at the fourth quarter activity, the level of upgrades we had, which is really the second highest level of upgrades and customers signing two-year contracts that we've ever had only surpassed by the third quarter of last year combined with the sales of smartphones, I think both of those bode well for the business in an environment where the iPhone is not exclusive. In terms of the cost side, and we touched on this a bit in the presentation, but we see continued opportunities, both in the Wireless and Wireline sides of the business, and it's driven by a couple of things. First, the One AT&T initiatives, which is really, it's been a series of initiatives over the last few years. And as we mentioned, we just, at the end of last year, kicked off a new set of One AT&T initiatives targeted at simplifying some of our product offerings. But these initiatives, if you step back from it over the last several years, have consistently been providing cost reduction on a year-over-year basis in excess of $1 billion a year. And we see the same kind of opportunity going forward as we look into 2011 and 2012. But secondly, and this is kind of a broader piece of it and it gets to a comment Randall made in the presentation about the opportunity to begin to accelerate some of the trends in the business as we get even past 2011, is we talked about the change in the mix of our business. And what you're seeing is that some of the growth platforms, and U-verse is a perfect example, those growth platforms are beginning to scale. And just a natural part of our business, as those products and platforms scale, the margins improve. So we're seeing steady, consistent margin improvement there. And as we go forward and particularly as we get out past 2011, you start to see some of the drag on the business from legacy products like Wireline voice start to decline, and it's the combination of those two things that I think gives the business opportunity to begin to accelerate both in terms of revenues and margins as we go forward even past 2011."

In terms of ARPU, what's driving ARPU for the industry is moving these postpaid bases onto integrated-type devices, and we have been hitting this really hard for the last three and a half years. In fact, we're, by a sizable margin, way out front of the industry on this. We have more than 60% of our customer base, postpaid customer base now on integrated-type devices. And if you look at just the sales channel, the sales funnel, about over 80% of the sales into our postpaid base are on integrated devices. And then by the way, that number just keeps creeping up quarter in and quarter out, and so I don't think 80% is going to prove to be the cap on what percentage of these bases have integrated devices. So we've got quite a bit of room to run just in our traditional postpaid base on ARPUs, and then those ARPU improvements are significant when they move onto integrated devices. So we'll continue, as an industry, to push that, and we'll continue to move that along. I think 80% is going to prove to be a floor and not a ceiling. So plenty of room there. When you think about MiFi, we're selling MiFi-type capability today. If you think about what those MiFi products are serving, largely they tend to be serving tablets. As you know, we have the 3G capability built into the tablets, predominantly, that we sell. And when you look at what we sold in the fourth quarter, we sold 442,000 tablets that are running on the network, and so I kind of compare the two. Those are equivalent. And so we're having very, very strong results in terms of selling tablets, and I'd tell you to keep in mind we're really early on in tablets. I mean, this thing is still in its infancy, and we think this has a lot of room to run. And by and large, the tablet market is being dominated by the Apple products, the new stuff is just now coming online. And so you're going to see a lot of Android-type tablets come online, and that'll push that along as well. So we think we have a lot of opportunity in terms of tablets. And I would also tell you not to disregard the connected devices. This is a huge growth area for us. And so if you think about ARPU being the first place we're obviously going as an industry. Smartphones and integrated devices, tablets are going to be a significant driver to revenue growth as we move forward. Connected devices are proving to be very powerful, and we added 1.5 million of these in the quarter and kind of setting the pace for the industry. And I believe the connected devices products are going to accelerate as we move into 4G capabilities. So you put all those together, and it gives us a lot of confidence, we're going to continue to grow this Wireless business for the next few years."

We grew customers in postpaid. We grew customers in prepaid. We grew it in reseller and as Randall said, had a record quarter in connected devices. There is some comparability issues because, as you know, a large majority of the tablets that we've talked about, those sales were of the iPad and to the extent they're going to consumer customers, they tend to be under a prepaid rate plan. But it's a plan where we're seeing good consistent usage and ARPUs from. But we put it in the prepaid category. So I think as you're comparing our results and as you're looking at growth, it's helpful to understand that or to put the two categories, the prepaid and postpaid, together from a comparative standpoint."

Like all of our businesses, as you continue to grow and scale, you have the opportunities to increase margins. I think a broader device lineup, and you see us even broadening the device lineup as we go into 2011, just naturally creates a more competitive environment among device manufacturers and gives you opportunities to mitigate and manage subsidy costs, which are important. A couple of areas, in addition, as we've pointed out, some of the incremental areas, the tablet sales, which come on generally at low to no subsidy levels, in many cases, offer good margin opportunities. The connected devices provide incremental margin opportunity. And on the cost side, the One AT&T initiatives that we're pursuing really allow us to reduce costs because we're combining organizations and processes that support both Wireless and Wireline businesses. So those benefits accrue both to the Wireline and to the Wireless portions of the business. So those are the things that give you the opportunities to continue to expand the margins there.

Obviously, we saw a 2.2% postpaid ARPU growth in the fourth quarter. But if we look at the first half to the second half of the year, it's more like 1% growth. And if we look from second quarter to fourth quarter, it's actually less than 0.5% growth. And we've seen some of the strongest ever quarters that you guys have ever reported in terms of upselling customers and upselling into integrated devices and smartphones. And so with the incremental competition we've got coming in 2011, what gives you guys the comfort that just doing more of what you've been doing is actually going to continue to create year-over-year ARPU growth? Because the trends seem to be really sliding towards little or no growth even now at this stage before the real competition has come. And the second question is, on the other side, Rick, I think you said U-verse is actually contributing positively to margin now. Could you elaborate a little bit, is it positive margins or is it greater margins than the average of the Wireline base helping the overall total?"

First of all, on the ARPU trends, I think I understand that the numbers you were using -- I'm going to use a bit different set of numbers there, but I think we're talking the same thing. If you looked at our results, our postpaid ARPU growth in the first half of the year, we were in the kind of 3%-plus range year-over-year and in the second half on a year-over-year basis, it scaled down to kind of a low 2% range. There were two items that had some impact there. The biggest, the largest was the impact of regulatory fees and recovery charges that are embedded in the service revenue and the ARPU. And those fees and charges are just cost pass-throughs, and they do go up and down over time based on the costs incurred. And in the second half of the year as we reset those costs, the costs had gone down, and so the regulatory recovery charge went down. And so that contributed to really the reduction of going from a 3%-plus kind of year-over-year ARPU trend to a low 2% ARPU trend. So when you kind of strip that aside, what you're seeing is Data revenues and the impact on ARPU has been -- continued to be very good and very consistent through the year. So that gives us comfort going forward. And then on top of that, I think as you continue to see Wireless data traffic growth and you start to think about the opportunities in a 4G environment and the applications there, as that usage grows, you will continue then to see growth opportunities in Data ARPU as well there. So that's kind of the ARPU trend. On U-verse margins, let me give you two data points. U-verse has crossed and looking at the business in total, including not just the recurring margins but the acquisition costs associated with customers, the margins are positive from an EBITDA standpoint. They are below the average Wireline margins but they are positive and they're growing every single quarter. And that's just a function -- that's just the normal course that happens when you have a base and the base is relatively small in the beginning, and you're adding a lot of customers, the acquisition costs overwhelms the recurring margins from that base. But we're definitely seeing that trend improve, and it's turned positive. But secondly, if you look at -- put the acquisition, customer acquisition cost aside for a minute, and to give you some idea of the capability in U-verse from a margin standpoint, the recurring margins of our U-verse customers are well into the 40s, which is, obviously, on an EBITDA basis, significantly above our Wireline EBITDA margins. So again, that's what gives us, I think, comfort about the projected improvements and the opportunity we've got with U-verse as it scales."

But Android is going to be so broad-based, it's going to be hard to put it into one single category.

Before Rick covers our results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and offer my view of the business and what you should expect from us in 2011. And as you've seen in our release, we had a very productive 2010. Our revenues grew. We grew earnings. Cash flow was strong. We closed the year well, and we expect another solid year in 2011 with continued revenue growth, margin expansion and growth in EPS and free cash flow.
As we look ahead, our confidence in the industry and our business in particular continues to be very high. We've invested heavily over the past few years, and those investments are beginning to scale. And it's driving revenue growth and margin improvements, and you know what these areas are. U-verse has driven growth in our consumer revenues now each of the last two quarters. And based on the results so far this year, we're adding more pay-TV subscribers than any other U.S. provider. Our VPN capabilities have proven to be a really strong platform for our strategic business services, and these services are going at a consistent mid-teens clip. And on top of these, mobile broadband is obviously our big driver. We just posted the best Wireless net add year in our history. In the fourth quarter, our mobile data revenues grew better than 27%, and we've grown postpaid ARPU now for eight straight quarters. As mobile broadband phenomenon just continues to exceed all of our expectations, our industry has, frankly, never experienced anything quite like it, and we haven't even talked about 4G yet. 
And as you know, we've completed our nationwide HSPA+ deployment, and where we combine that with advanced backhaul, we're getting 4G speeds today up to six meg. And we have planned to launch around 20 4G devices this year, two in the first quarter. 
And then on top of this, we've accelerated our LTE deployment. And when you combine HSPA+ with LTE, it's going to result in a much more consistent 4G experience for our customers. And then on the business side, when you take these mobile broadband capabilities and then layer on cloud and applications-based services, it really begins to let customers mobilize everything they do. So these are all large opportunities. They're scalable opportunities. And they're all early in their growth cycles. And as you can see from our results in sales of tablet and connected devices and our strong growth rates and strategic business services, we're way out front in each of these areas.
Now, while the future Mobility will be driven by broadband, mobile voice quality is, obviously, important. And over the last 45 days with our vendors finally clearing their backlogs, we brought online a significant amount of new capacity. And our call retainability across the country is up 20 basis points at about 99%. And we see even greater improvements in Manhattan and San Francisco, and you should expect voice quality improvement throughout this year. So that's just a real quick overview. Again, 2010 was a very productive year. We're executing well. I expect another strong year in 2011 in our key platforms: Mobile Broadband, Business Solutions and U-verse. We think they're going to provide a nice platform for growth in the years ahead. 
So, Rick, I'll turn it over to you."
100231,117541380,96469,"AT&T, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randall. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 5. When you look at 2010, I think our financial results speak for themselves. They were strong across the board. Revenues for th",1790,"Thank you, Randall. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 5. When you look at 2010, I think our financial results speak for themselves. They were strong across the board. Revenues for the year were up 1.4% and 2.1% in the fourth quarter. Consolidated margins improved even with strong sales of integrated devices. And as a result, we grew adjusted earnings by 10.6% for the year.
In the fourth quarter, we had reported earnings per share of $0.18, and that includes: $0.26 of pressure from the year-end mark-to-market change in our benefit plan accounting, which we announced a couple of weeks ago; $0.09 of pressure due to severance charges; and $0.02 of pressure from asset impairments. Excluding these one-time items, earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.55, and that's up 10% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. And cash flow continues to be strong. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion in the quarter and $14.7 billion for the year.
Now I'd like to take a look at revenue growth and revenue mix on Slide 6. Our fourth quarter consolidated revenue totaled $31.4 billion, and that's up $653 million or 2.1%. The drivers continue to be strong Wireless growth and U-verse, which is improving our Wireline Consumer results and continued strength in strategic business services. These trends continue to transform our revenue mix.
In the fourth quarter, 73% of revenues came from Wireless, from Wireline data and from Managed Services, and that's up from 65% two years ago. Combined revenues from these sources were up 9% in the fourth quarter. And in fact, the fourth quarter marks the first time where our Wireless revenues have surpassed Wireline. We're confident that this mix shift will continue as mobile broadband continues to be a huge growth driver.
You'll see the impact of mobile broadband in our Wireless results, starting on Slide 7. It was another terrific Wireless growth quarter. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or 9.9%, and Wireless service revenues grew 9.6%, up more than $1.2 billion versus fourth quarter a year ago. This was driven by continued subscriber gains and strong data adoption. Data drove our eighth consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched by our peers, up by 2.2%, and we continue to have the highest postpaid ARPU in the industry.
Churn, both total and postpaid, continues to reach or match best-ever levels. We also had our best net add quarter ever, adding 2.8 million subscribers in the fourth quarter. In fact, we had our best ever year with 8.9 million subscribers added to the network in 2010, and that doesn't include those added through the Alltel property acquisition. Net adds in the fourth quarter were led by an increase of 1.5 million connected devices, the highest quarter ever. These devices bring lower ARPUs but attractive churn and margin characteristics.
Postpaid net adds for the quarter were 400,000. Prepaid net adds totaled more than 300,000, with strong iPad and Android-based tablet activations. In fact, during the quarter, we added 442,000 tablets to the network, and we also had a solid reseller quarter with nearly 600,000 new subscribers. 
Our Data revenues continued their exceptional growth. The details are on Slide 8. We grew Wireless data revenues by more than 27%, up more than $1 billion year-over-year. Integrated device sales, those are handsets with QWERTY or virtual keyboards in addition to voice functionality, are a key driver of this growth, and we had another incredible integrated device quarter, our second highest sales quarter ever. Signing up more than 7.4 million subscribers, both upgrades and new customers, these sales netted 3.4 million new 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, and were up more than $13 million in the past 12 months.
Our results also reflect another strong quarter for iPhone activations, with more than 4 million activated during the quarter, resulting in 90% of our iPhone base being under contract. And in addition, our other smartphone sales increased significantly over the previous quarter. ARPU for integrated devices continues to be strong, 1.7x our other devices, and these subscribers tend to be very sticky for us, with more than 80% of the integrated device subscribers on family- or business-related plans with churn levels well below average. And the good news is we continue to have room to grow. About 60% of our postpaid base use these devices today, but our sales rate continues to increase and is now more than 80%.
Obviously, integrated device sales, along with high upgrade levels, have an impact on margins. The details are on Slide 9. Within integrated devices, we're also seeing a shift to a higher mix of high-end smartphones, devices that use an advanced operating system such as RIM, Apple OS or Windows 7. These devices tend to have higher subsidies than quick messaging devices, but they also bring higher ARPUs due to more robust data capability. And our customers continued to upgrade to higher-end smartphones in record numbers. In the fourth quarter, we had about 2 million more smartphone sales than we did in fourth quarter of 2009. And over 9% of our base upgraded their device in the quarter, signing a new two-year contract in the process, and I think that says a lot about the confidence and the loyalty they have in AT&T.
Smartphone sales and upgrade levels did impact fourth quarter Wireless margins. In the quarter, Wireless OIBIDA service margin was 37.6%. That's flat sequentially and down from fourth quarter a year ago. And for the year, our OIBIDA service margin was 40.7%. The offset to higher device subsidies is the long-term value these customers bring, including higher ARPUs, lower churn and strong data growth. And you see that in our Wireless operating income which was up more than 10% for the year to reach $15.3 billion.
I'd like to turn now and cover our Wireline results, starting with consumer trends on Slide 10. This was another strong quarter for U-verse, and it drove our second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in Consumer Wireline. We had 246,000 U-verse video net adds in the quarter, and we hit an important customer milestone earlier this month when we reached 3 million subscribers. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remained very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers had a triple- or quad-play bundle, and the ARPU for these customers continues to grow, up 14% year-over-year. As a result, our U-verse economics are attractive and growing. It is now a $5 billion annualized revenue stream, and U-verse exited the year with positive impact on margins.
We also had another strong quarter in total broadband adds, up 210,000 year-over-year. Our Wireline Consumer IP data revenues, that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 30% for the year, and these products now represent 45% of total Consumer Wireline revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points over the past year. We expect continued U-verse growth and scale to drive further improvements in our overall Wireline financials.
Now let's take a look at business Wireline on Slide 11. Here, we're seeing the same consistent trends impacting the business that we have all year. As the lack of growth and business formations and employment continue to put some pressure on the Wireline business, you see that in our fourth quarter service revenue results, which were down 4.3% year-over-year on a reported basis and 3.5% after adjusting for the third quarter sales of the company's Japan assets. We are, however, seeing some bright spots in our federal networks contracts and in our Wholesale business, and we had our strongest quarter of the year in strategic business products. Revenues from these products including Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks and application services were up over 17%. And overall business IP revenues were up 9% in the fourth quarter and contributed to positive business data growth.
Plus, we continue to do well, selling Wireless into the business space. We're seeing a fundamental shift with more enterprises asking us to help them deploy full mobile solutions, solutions that bring together mobile broadband, cloud computing, seamless access to applications and even social media. We're well positioned to lead in this transition, and we're excited about this future opportunity.
Now I'd like to take a look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 12. We said at the beginning of last year that we expected stable to improved consolidated margins when compared to 2009, and we delivered on that. For the year, our adjusted consolidated operating income margin was 18.5%, that's up from 17.7% in 2009. This reflects improving revenue trends in both Wireless and Wireline Consumer and solid execution of cost initiatives across the company. Our Wireline operating margin remains stable from 2009, and that was driven by improving revenue trends and good cost management. 
Across the business, total force was down by more than 16,000, and we're making great strides with One AT&T. As we consolidate and integrate Wireline and Wireless operations under One AT&T, we continue to drive down costs. These initiatives strengthen our ability to sustain solid margins and put us in a unique position among our competitors to serve customers seamlessly with a best-in-class operation. These initiatives have achieved expense savings of more than $1 billion a year. And recently, we launched our next phase of One AT&T designed to simplify our product offerings, and we anticipate significant value from these new initiatives on top of our normal cost management efforts.
Along with solid margins, we also continued to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash summary is on Slide 13. In 2010, cash from operations totaled $35 billion, capital expenditures were $20.3 billion, with a more than 50% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital. Our free cash flow was $14.7 billion. I do need to point out that as we go forward and prepare to launch our LTE network in 2011, we will no longer capitalize interest for the radio spectrum we purchased to use for LTE. This will increase interest expense and reduce 2011 earnings per share by $0.07, as well as reduce capital expenditures.
Dividend payments in 2010 totaled $9.9 billion, and over the last six quarters, we've generated almost $9 billion of free cash flow after dividends. In terms of uses of that cash, our debt level is down almost $6 billion over the past 12 months, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 37% and an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.56. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business while returning substantial value to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Randall Stephenson for closing comments. Randall?"
100231,117541380,96469,"AT&T, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Rick. Before we go in to the Q&A, I just want to make a couple of additional comments. Just looking back at the last three years, we've executed with a lot of discipline through this downturn, and we've marketed well. We've won customers. I",568,"Okay. Thanks, Rick. Before we go in to the Q&A, I just want to make a couple of additional comments. Just looking back at the last three years, we've executed with a lot of discipline through this downturn, and we've marketed well. We've won customers. I think we've done a very good job on the cost side. When you look at the metrics Rick just walked you through, I think it's pretty clear that AT&T is coming out of the downturn stronger, both operationally and financially, than we were going in. 
We have a better balance sheet, better revenue trends, better margins and a more growth-oriented business, and then all of this reflects solid execution by the people across this company. And as you look ahead, most important thing we've done over the past few years is that we've built and we've scaled some very nice growth platforms for the future. Mobile broadband, U-verse, VPN and cloud-based services, and we've invested very aggressively in all these areas. We've kept CapEx strong. We've acquired high-quality spectrum. And while we've done all of that, we've maintained the financial strength to return substantial value to the owners. We've increased the dividend now for the 27th straight year, and we authorized a stock repurchase. 
So as we look forward to 2011 and I've laid this out for you on Slide 15, we have a solid plan to continue growing revenues, earnings and cash flow. And so here are the variables: We do expect healthy contract subscriber growth in 2011 even with the introduction of another carrier for the iPhone. Obviously, this is going to make things a little bit harder to predict early on in the year, but with the introduction of new Android and other devices, we think the smartphone market will continue to be very strong for us. And this is consistent with what you saw on the fourth quarter, which was our second highest smartphone quarter in our history; we also had a strong fourth quarter in tablets and connected devices, we expect that momentum to continue through 2011 and beyond; we expect to expand our Wireless and our Wireline operating margins; and excluding the capitalized interest impacts, we expect 2011 EPS growth in the mid-single digits or better. And as the market settles beyond 2011, we have an opportunity to accelerate our EPS growth even further; we're targeting capital this year in the low to mid-$19 billion range, and we expect free cash flow will be up from 2010. 
So this is an outlook that reflects the quality of the growth platforms. It also reflects our proven ability to execute on the cost side. And I'd add that it does not include any kind of significant lift from the economy. And I'm hopeful we're going to see more from the economy this year. We're beginning to see a few encouraging signs. But we do not have any kind of economic turn built into our expectations and that just reflects our approach. As most of you know, we tend to be very conservative in these areas. So we had a very productive 2010. We are confident 2011 is going to be strong as well, and what has me most excited is this industry's potential over the next few years and how AT&T is positioned here in the long term. 
So, Brooks, with that, I think we're ready for questions."

Maybe, Randall or Rick, could you talk a little bit about your strategy going into 2011? Obviously, a lot more smartphones, but do you expect that to -- and I know a lot of confidence about the group being able to grow the postpaid base, which I think is you don't hear a lot of, but do you expect to have to spend more or advertise or increase subsidies or how do you expect to -- is that really the difference there that margins might not expand as much as the lower iPhone shipments would probably suggest?"

But when you look at the guidance, there a couple of things that are underlying it and I just spoke to them. But just very briefly, obviously, the economy, we are not expecting any kind of dramatic lift in economic growth. And this is -- we think it's fairly conservative. I think it's prudent that we set our cost structure around a slower economic growth scenario. But we're beginning to see some encouraging signs. Businesses are investing again, and we're seeing early indications of that. We are starting to see some hiring. But the reason we moderate this is business starts to continue to be negative across the country, and that's probably one of the best early indicators for us when this thing begins to turn. So we're hopeful as we kind of work through this first quarter and second quarter, we begin to see the business starts turn and with any luck, we'd get some upside from the economy there. The second area, though, is this idea of an iPhone going on to a second network. This is going to create some volatility in the first part of the year, and it's going to be kind of hard to predict the first part of the year as Verizon launches an iPhone. But as I mentioned in the comments, I feel fairly confident we're going to be able to grow over the course of the year through the disruption, and there's a couple of reasons for this. And one of them is if you just look at the fourth quarter, it was no secret that the iPhone was going to be available on a competitor's network, and the competitive environment was reflecting that. And in spite of that, we had our second-best integrated sales quarter ever, and iPhone sales continued to be very strong in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was among the best quarters we've ever done as well. We sold 4 million iPhones, and that just kind of gives us some confidence in terms of customer loyalty to the network. And so again, it'll probably-- it may be rocky in the beginning of the year, kind of volatile, hard to predict, but we think as we work, the market stabilizes, we'll be able to grow through it. The other thing is the sales mix will change this year. We have not been very aggressive in the Android portfolio, and we're bringing Android into the mix very aggressively this year. You've seen some of the devices that we'll be bringing in. And so we're going to be a heavy participant in the Android market this year, and so you're going to see a significant shift in mix. And then you add Windows 7 and RIMs products are actually starting to do very well and getting a lot of traction in the market and then our sales channels. We think were actually going to have a nice mix shift and do quite well in those areas. And then last, we're really starting to feel good about the network situation. We're making a lot of progress here. And as I commented in the opening comments, we had a significant clearing of backlog from our vendors in December. We were having some serious capacity constraints in key markets, and we really saw the backlogs clear. And we spent the last 45 days literally just bringing capacity online in a rather dramatic fashion, and we're seeing those numbers move. And so you put all this together, we actually feel like, again, with a little volatility in the first part of the year, we can grow contract subscribers through the course of this year."
100231,117541380,96469,"AT&T, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","John, the only thing I'd add to that in terms of any color is obviously, as Randall said, there is probably a little more volatility and it's a little more difficult to project this year in 2011 and certainly the first half of this year.

But there is, obviously, there's an interplay in the modeling, in the guidance, in the expectations between -- in the Wireless side between volumes and mix of volumes and device sales and what kind of margins and earnings growth you expect. And as Randall said, as we look at the trends and we look at the trends particularly in the last quarter or two, what we're seeing is continued strong iPhone sales despite the anticipation of the iPhone being nonexclusive. We did over 9 million iPhones in just the last two quarters. That's a pretty phenomenal number when you think about it. That, plus the high upgrade rates we've seen and the growth we're seeing in sales of other smartphones -- smartphones with a RIM operating system and a Windows operating system, the Android models we've got coming on into the device lineup in 2011, I think are very exciting. So our guidance is based on a presumption that we're going to continue to see strong sales of smartphones, and we're going to continue to grow the business. We're going to grow it in customers, in ARPU and obviously, in revenues. In terms of how you compete in this environment, again, we feel we're in a good position. We're going to have a tremendous device portfolio for customers to choose from. We've got a network evolution path, I think, that is -- will be the most elegant from a customer standpoint by having both HSPA+ across our entire footprint as we roll out LTE. And then finally, as Randall said, we are seeing and expect to see continued significant improvements on the Voice side. So that's essentially the position that we'll compete from as we go into '11."

You always have kind of a bit of a lull as you get past the holiday season. But again, we're seeing, I think, continued good sales activity. I think the iPhone 3G model at a $49 price point will be an attractive model for our customer base. And again, as you look at the fourth quarter activity, the level of upgrades we had, which is really the second highest level of upgrades and customers signing two-year contracts that we've ever had only surpassed by the third quarter of last year combined with the sales of smartphones, I think both of those bode well for the business in an environment where the iPhone is not exclusive. In terms of the cost side, and we touched on this a bit in the presentation, but we see continued opportunities, both in the Wireless and Wireline sides of the business, and it's driven by a couple of things. First, the One AT&T initiatives, which is really, it's been a series of initiatives over the last few years. And as we mentioned, we just, at the end of last year, kicked off a new set of One AT&T initiatives targeted at simplifying some of our product offerings. But these initiatives, if you step back from it over the last several years, have consistently been providing cost reduction on a year-over-year basis in excess of $1 billion a year. And we see the same kind of opportunity going forward as we look into 2011 and 2012. But secondly, and this is kind of a broader piece of it and it gets to a comment Randall made in the presentation about the opportunity to begin to accelerate some of the trends in the business as we get even past 2011, is we talked about the change in the mix of our business. And what you're seeing is that some of the growth platforms, and U-verse is a perfect example, those growth platforms are beginning to scale. And just a natural part of our business, as those products and platforms scale, the margins improve. So we're seeing steady, consistent margin improvement there. And as we go forward and particularly as we get out past 2011, you start to see some of the drag on the business from legacy products like Wireline voice start to decline, and it's the combination of those two things that I think gives the business opportunity to begin to accelerate both in terms of revenues and margins as we go forward even past 2011."

In terms of ARPU, what's driving ARPU for the industry is moving these postpaid bases onto integrated-type devices, and we have been hitting this really hard for the last three and a half years. In fact, we're, by a sizable margin, way out front of the industry on this. We have more than 60% of our customer base, postpaid customer base now on integrated-type devices. And if you look at just the sales channel, the sales funnel, about over 80% of the sales into our postpaid base are on integrated devices. And then by the way, that number just keeps creeping up quarter in and quarter out, and so I don't think 80% is going to prove to be the cap on what percentage of these bases have integrated devices. So we've got quite a bit of room to run just in our traditional postpaid base on ARPUs, and then those ARPU improvements are significant when they move onto integrated devices. So we'll continue, as an industry, to push that, and we'll continue to move that along. I think 80% is going to prove to be a floor and not a ceiling. So plenty of room there. When you think about MiFi, we're selling MiFi-type capability today. If you think about what those MiFi products are serving, largely they tend to be serving tablets. As you know, we have the 3G capability built into the tablets, predominantly, that we sell. And when you look at what we sold in the fourth quarter, we sold 442,000 tablets that are running on the network, and so I kind of compare the two. Those are equivalent. And so we're having very, very strong results in terms of selling tablets, and I'd tell you to keep in mind we're really early on in tablets. I mean, this thing is still in its infancy, and we think this has a lot of room to run. And by and large, the tablet market is being dominated by the Apple products, the new stuff is just now coming online. And so you're going to see a lot of Android-type tablets come online, and that'll push that along as well. So we think we have a lot of opportunity in terms of tablets. And I would also tell you not to disregard the connected devices. This is a huge growth area for us. And so if you think about ARPU being the first place we're obviously going as an industry. Smartphones and integrated devices, tablets are going to be a significant driver to revenue growth as we move forward. Connected devices are proving to be very powerful, and we added 1.5 million of these in the quarter and kind of setting the pace for the industry. And I believe the connected devices products are going to accelerate as we move into 4G capabilities. So you put all those together, and it gives us a lot of confidence, we're going to continue to grow this Wireless business for the next few years."

We grew customers in postpaid. We grew customers in prepaid. We grew it in reseller and as Randall said, had a record quarter in connected devices. There is some comparability issues because, as you know, a large majority of the tablets that we've talked about, those sales were of the iPad and to the extent they're going to consumer customers, they tend to be under a prepaid rate plan. But it's a plan where we're seeing good consistent usage and ARPUs from. But we put it in the prepaid category. So I think as you're comparing our results and as you're looking at growth, it's helpful to understand that or to put the two categories, the prepaid and postpaid, together from a comparative standpoint."

Like all of our businesses, as you continue to grow and scale, you have the opportunities to increase margins. I think a broader device lineup, and you see us even broadening the device lineup as we go into 2011, just naturally creates a more competitive environment among device manufacturers and gives you opportunities to mitigate and manage subsidy costs, which are important. A couple of areas, in addition, as we've pointed out, some of the incremental areas, the tablet sales, which come on generally at low to no subsidy levels, in many cases, offer good margin opportunities. The connected devices provide incremental margin opportunity. And on the cost side, the One AT&T initiatives that we're pursuing really allow us to reduce costs because we're combining organizations and processes that support both Wireless and Wireline businesses. So those benefits accrue both to the Wireline and to the Wireless portions of the business. So those are the things that give you the opportunities to continue to expand the margins there.

And if we look from second quarter to fourth quarter, it's actually less than 0.5% growth.

And so with the incremental competition we've got coming in 2011, what gives you guys the comfort that just doing more of what you've been doing is actually going to continue to create year-over-year ARPU growth? Because the trends seem to be really sliding towards little or no growth even now at this stage before the real competition has come.

First of all, on the ARPU trends, I think I understand that the numbers you were using -- I'm going to use a bit different set of numbers there, but I think we're talking the same thing. If you looked at our results, our postpaid ARPU growth in the first half of the year, we were in the kind of 3%-plus range year-over-year and in the second half on a year-over-year basis, it scaled down to kind of a low 2% range. There were two items that had some impact there. The biggest, the largest was the impact of regulatory fees and recovery charges that are embedded in the service revenue and the ARPU. And those fees and charges are just cost pass-throughs, and they do go up and down over time based on the costs incurred. And in the second half of the year as we reset those costs, the costs had gone down, and so the regulatory recovery charge went down. And so that contributed to really the reduction of going from a 3%-plus kind of year-over-year ARPU trend to a low 2% ARPU trend. So when you kind of strip that aside, what you're seeing is Data revenues and the impact on ARPU has been -- continued to be very good and very consistent through the year. So that gives us comfort going forward. And then on top of that, I think as you continue to see Wireless data traffic growth and you start to think about the opportunities in a 4G environment and the applications there, as that usage grows, you will continue then to see growth opportunities in Data ARPU as well there. So that's kind of the ARPU trend. On U-verse margins, let me give you two data points. U-verse has crossed and looking at the business in total, including not just the recurring margins but the acquisition costs associated with customers, the margins are positive from an EBITDA standpoint. They are below the average Wireline margins but they are positive and they're growing every single quarter. And that's just a function -- that's just the normal course that happens when you have a base and the base is relatively small in the beginning, and you're adding a lot of customers, the acquisition costs overwhelms the recurring margins from that base. But we're definitely seeing that trend improve, and it's turned positive. But secondly, if you look at -- put the acquisition, customer acquisition cost aside for a minute, and to give you some idea of the capability in U-verse from a margin standpoint, the recurring margins of our U-verse customers are well into the 40s, which is, obviously, on an EBITDA basis, significantly above our Wireline EBITDA margins. So again, that's what gives us, I think, comfort about the projected improvements and the opportunity we've got with U-verse as it scales."

Before I turn the call over to Rick, i would like to call your attention to Slide 4, which provides the financial summary. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.57, which is roughly in line with adjusted EPS from first quarter a year ago and it's clearly up from our reported EPS of $0.41 this time last year. Our results this quarter also include approximately $0.02 of pressure from Alltel integration costs. As we mentioned to you earlier this year, this merger-related cost will also impact margins, wireless churn and subscriber numbers, which Ralph will cover in a few minutes. We will also see some impacts continuing into the second quarter as we complete customer migrations but overall, the integration process is going well and is in line with our overall expectations. Consolidated revenues were up 2.3% year-over-year, thanks to continued strength in mobile broadband, U-verse services and strategic business offerings. Consolidated operating income margin remained stable even with strong sales to smart bands and cash flow continues to be strong, with cash from operating activities totaling $7.7 billion and free cash flow of $3.6 billion. With that, I will now turn the call over one last time to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?"

The highlights are on Slide 5. First off, we had a terrific start to the year. We saw a continuation of the positive revenue trends we've seen in the past few quarters. We had a very strong wireless quarter, with double-digit revenue growth. Stable trends in wireline revenues, driven by U-verse expansion and growth in strategic business services. Going into the quarter, we knew that with another carrier offering the iPhone for the first time, there was a possibility of some natural volatility and our mobile broadband strategy would be tested as never before.
I'm very pleased to tell you that the results show our strategy is working. Our wireless business is performing at a high level, and customers, both new and existing ones, continue to choose AT&T. Smartphone sales continue to be strong. Postpaid ARPU continues to grow at a good clip. Churn remains relatively stable, both year-over-year and sequentially. Plus, we continued to expand into new wireless growth areas of connected devices and tablets. Ralph will provide more details in a moment but mobile broadband is driving unprecedented growth in our industry, and we're pleased with the results we're seeing.
We also continue to be pleased about the transformation of our wireline business, U-verse continues to scale, helping drive consumer revenue per household up more than 6% and strategic business revenues had its best quarter in more than two years. So on a number of  fronts, it was a positive quarter and a good start to the year.
With that as background, let's look at detailed results starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 6. First quarter consolidated revenue totaled $31.2 billion, up $717 million or 2.3% versus a year ago. That increase was due to double-digit wireless growth, continued U-verse growth of more than 65% year-over-year and stable trends from our Business segment. You see these trends transforming our revenue mix. In the first quarter, 74% of revenues came from wireless, from Wireline Data and Managed Services. That's up from 70% a year ago and 65% two years ago. Revenues from these growth areas were up more than 9% in the first quarter. We are well-positioned here, and we expect these trends to continue to drive top line growth for the company as we go forward in this year.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ralph de la Vega. Ralph, as you know, runs our wireless and wireline consumer businesses for an update on those areas. Ralph?"

As Rick mentioned, we faced a lot of questions with another iPhone competitor entering the market. That made it a little harder to predict what was going to happen in the first quarter but at the same time, we had confidence in our mobile broadband strategy, our network and our ability to compete.
Going into the quarter, we told you we had good plans in place. We told you about the stickiness of our customer base, and we told you we were prepared. I'm very pleased to say that not only did we deliver another solid quarter but in many ways, we had our strongest first quarter ever. Take a look at some of our accomplishments on Slide 7: double-digit revenue growth; best-ever first quarter net adds, with gains in every category; best-ever first quarter smartphone sales, almost equaling our seasonally strong fourth quarter numbers; best-ever first quarter connected device net adds, continuing our strong performance in this area; and we continued to add branded computing subscribers, mobile devices such as tablets, air cards, MiFi and other data devices to our network at a strong pace. 
We also posted year-over-year postpaid ARPU growth for the ninth consecutive quarter as more subscribers added data services, a record that none of our competitors can match. And in a quarter that we know could be volatile, we had postpaid subscriber growth. Even with these strong sales, wireless service margins were more than 40% when you exclude the Alltel and Centennial merger cost. All in all, an outstanding quarter especially when you consider the impact of the mergers. Without a doubt, it was a quarter that validated our strategy and our ability to compete. This quarter's performance helps you understand why we're so excited about mobile broadband opportunities. We're just at the beginning of something really incredible. Mobile broadband had become the critical technology, driving growth and innovation. When you think about the additional capabilities to reach that the T-Mobile acquisition provides, you understand why we're so excited about this opportunity.
With that, let me cover wireless revenue on Slide 8. Our focus on mobile broadband continues to drive strong growth. Total wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or up 10.2% and wireless service revenues increased 8.6%, up more than $1 billion versus the first quarter a year ago. This includes growth in both data and voice revenues. Postpaid ARPU grew 2.4%, which includes pressure from the impact of the Alltel merger. Without this pressure, the increase in ARPU will be pushing 3% for the quarter. There's no better place to see the success of our wireless strategy this quarter than our net adds and churn, and this is covered on Slide 9. Even in a quarter which we knew will be challenging, we added nearly 2 million subscribers. This includes growth in every product category. Connected devices led the way. We added 1.3 million during the quarter. We also had positive postpaid net adds for the quarter, adding more than 60,000. Excluding the negative impact of the merger integration, postpaid net adds were around 165,000 in the first quarter. Prepaid net adds for the quarter were 85,000, and we had another solid reseller quarter, with more than 560,000 new subscribers. Even though iPhone exclusivity ended in the first quarter, the churn impact was minimal. Total churn was relatively stable with last year's level and excluding merger impacts, postpaid churn was stable sequentially and up only seven basis points from the first quarter last year.
If you dive a little bit deeper, iPhone churn by itself was the same year-over-year. And iPhone sales increased, which means we continue to grow our iPhone base this quarter. Keeping churn levels low is critical to wireless growth and profitability, and that is why we have a strong upgrade program. We also built a sizable part of our postpaid base on family and business plans, about 80% overall, and these customers are more loyal with lower churn rates. These results speak volumes about our wireless business. New customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with AT&T in record numbers.
Another part of the strategy that paid dividends was our focus on smartphones, the details on Slide 10. Smartphone sales helped driver wireless data revenue growth of 34%, up nearly $1 billion year-over-year. We had our largest first quarter smartphone sales ever, signing up 5.5 million customers, both upgrades and new subscribers. The numbers of smartphones on our network increased by about 2.4 million in the quarter, up 9 million in the last 12 months. These results reflect another strong quarter for iPhone activations, with more than 3.6 million activated during the quarter. That's almost 1 million more than last year, with 23% of these subscribers new to AT&T. We also had a strong quarter with other smartphones, selling more than 2 million other smartphones this quarter. That's twice as many as we added in the first quarter of 2010. This was driven by BlackBerries, Windows Phone 7 devices and significant growth in new Android models. In fact, during the last six months, our monthly sales of Android devices have more than doubled. We still see a lot of upside here. About 46% of our postpaid base uses smartphones today but our smartphone sales rate is approximately 55%. This quarter, we also began breaking out the number of branded computing subscribers added to our network. These are devices, such as tablets, air cards and netbooks. We added more than 420,000 this quarter to reach 3.4 million. That's about twice as many as we had 12 months ago. Most of these were tablets, with more than 350,000 added. These customers continue to choose AT&T for a reason. Network capabilities matter to them, a faster nationwide mobile broadband network, using voice and data simultaneously in their devices and international roaming to 224 countries, thanks to our GSM network. All of these capabilities make a difference to our customers and they're a big reason why we had such a strong wireless quarter.
As you might expect, strong smartphone sales and higher grade levels had an impact on margins and the details are on Slide 11. Smartphones tend to have higher subsidies and quick messaging devices than feature phones but they also have a very attractive customer profile as well, with lower churn, higher ARPUs, which are about 1.8x our other devices, and strong data growth. That's why we implemented and aggressive smartphone promotion strategy in the first quarter, slightly increasing our advertising and marketing spend. You can see the results in our smartphone sales. In the first quarter, we had about 2 million more smartphone sales than we did in the first quarter of 2010. About 9% of our postpaid base upgraded their device in the quarter, signing a new two-year contract with the company. Without the merger upgrades, about 8% of our base upgraded during the quarter. Again, that speaks volumes about the customers' confidence in AT&T, especially this quarter.
These sales did impact wireless margins in the first quarter. Our wireless EBITDA service margin was 39%, down from the year-earlier quarter but up sequentially. Factoring in customer migration costs from the Alltel and Centennial mergers, service margin would have been 40.5%. Wireless operating income was up more than 30% sequentially to almost $4 billion. 
Now let me take a moment to discuss our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. We had another strong quarter with our U-verse services. We've done an outstanding job scaling this business within the last few years, with solid net adds, strong revenue growth, growing penetration, strong voice and broadband attach rates, with growing triple-play ARPU and improving profitability. This helped drive our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in consumer Wireline. We added 218,000 U-verse TV subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 3.2 million, up about 900,000 over the past year. Broadband and U-verse voice over IP rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple or quadruple bundle with us. And ARPU for these customers continues to grow significantly, up 15% year-over-year to reach almost $170. U-verse now is on an annualized revenue stream of approximately $6 billion. We also continued our recent trend of total wireline broadband net adds, up 175,000. Together, IP products now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue stream and nearly half of total consumer Wireline revenues, growing at over 26% year-over-year. That covers wireless and consumer. I'd now like to turn  it over to John Stephens to discuss wireline business and consolidated results. John?"

What we are seeing so far in 2011 is consistent with the fundamental trends we saw last year. Revenue trends, while still down, have been stable the last three quarters, particularly when you adjust for the third quarter 2010 sale of our local Japan assets.
But there are some encouraging signs. Strategic business services, revenues from products such as ethernet, VPN and application services, were up almost 19%, our strongest quarter in more than two years. This drove business IP revenues up more than 8%, once again, led by the growth in VPNs. These results continued trends we have seen throughout this downturn. Consistent investment in strategic business solutions and IP data, services that help drive productivity and efficiency. Business transformed our business wireline revenue mix. Data and other growth areas such as Managed Services now comprise 61% of our revenues, up 200 basis points in the past year. We expect the shift to continue as more and more businesses move to the cloud and IP-based solutions, areas where we are well-positioned. We also continue to execute well. Operating expenses are improving, helping drive margin expansion. So there are some encouraging signs. Any economic improvement would be beneficial as we have not built an economic turnaround into our expectations this year.
Now, let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 14. For the first quarter, margins were up sequentially but down from a year ago at 18.6%. On the wireless side, this reflects a couple of things. Merger integration and related costs that Ralph mentioned and significantly higher smartphone sales. Our Wireline operating income margin was 11.5% in the first quarter, down slightly from the first quarter last year. We remain focused on cost initiatives throughout the company as evidenced by the total force reductions of almost 6,000 this quarter. This helped offset margin pressure from declines in voice revenues and storm-related expenses that occurred in the last -- in the first quarter.
Our commitment to operate as One At&T continues to deliver financial benefits as we consolidate and integrate wireless and wireline operations. And as we talked about operational efficiencies and simplify product offerings, we have continuing opportunities for cost savings. These initiatives are going well and help us sustain solid margins while also serving customers with a best-in-class operation.
Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver a strong free cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 15. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled $7.7 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $4.2 billion, with more than 50% year-over-year increase in our wireless capital to reach $1.9 billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $3.6 billion, and we made a dividend payment this quarter for $2.5 billion. In terms of other uses of our cash, we reduced debt by more than $1 billion in the first quarter and debt is down almost $4.5 billion over the past 12 months. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is now 1.53.
Our strong balance sheet and cash flow continues to give us the flexibility to invest in the business through both capitol improvements and strategic acquisitions, while also returning substantial value to shareholders. With that, I will now turn it back to Rick for closing comments."

First, we're off to a good start for the year, with solid revenue growth in both wireless and consumer Wireline and stability in our business markets. Second, we had another very strong wireless quarter, a performance that was particularly satisfying when you consider the challenges we faced. We told you last quarter that we expected positive contract subscriber growth for the year, even with the introduction of another carrier for the iPhone. And we delivered on that outlook in the very first quarter. When you add in record first quarter net adds, strong sales of branded computing subscribers and higher postpaid ARPU, you can understand our confidence in the mobile broadband strategy and mobile broadband opportunity. We're also very pleased with the continued transformation of our Wireline business. In fact, fast-growing data and video services now exceed voice revenues in Wireline, thanks to U-verse and continued strong growth in strategic business services. And our financial strength and cash flow remain strong, allowing us to return value to shareholders as we continue to invest in our business.
So we're off to a good start to the year, with solid first quarter operating results and a positive long-term outlook for the business. That concludes our prepared remarks. I think we're ready to take some questions."

Is this the kind of increase in turn, churn was the increase was much less than we thought. Is that kind of level that you think that we should expect to see going forward here, maybe in the second quarter or do you think that the expiration of some of the contracts that you guys signed two years ago accelerates that a bit? And then secondly, on wireless, the prepaid numbers, net adds 85,000, a bit less than we thought. Verizon is testing some new prepaid plans. Is that an area where you think you might be more aggressive?"

In terms of churn, frankly, we expected a slight uptick in churn when another carrier launched the iP",470,"John, I'll give you a perspective on churn and the impact there in the contract customers, and then I'll let Ralph address the prepaid wireless question. In terms of churn, frankly, we expected a slight uptick in churn when another carrier launched the iPhone. Our expectations, I think were generally less more modest in terms of churn increase than external expectations. We believed in our broadband strategy, our wireless strategy. We felt we were prepared for changes in exclusivity. And actually, the results came in better than we expected. And as you heard from Ralph, there's very, very modest change in overall churn and in postpaid churn levels. And I think, one of the most surprising areas perhaps is the fact that iPhone churn basically stayed flat. It did not increase. And I think, as you know, as you think about what drove that and what caused those results, frankly I think it had less to do with customers being under contract. Of course, we always work hard with our upgrade policy to keep customers under contract, and we do believe that it helps overall churn levels. But the fact is that, it was well known for months and quarters in advance that another carrier would launch the iPhone. And yet, we continued to see customers upgrade their devices, enter into new contracts in the third and fourth quarters last year and in record numbers. And that continued into the first quarter this year when the phone was available on another carrier. And the reality is, even if customers were under contract, they have the ability to break that contract, pay a termination charge and most likely, take that device that they have and sell it and recover most, if not all, of that contract termination. So I don't think having customers under contract had that large of an impact. What I do believe has an impact is what Ralph touched on earlier, and that is the device, and you have to remember the iPhone is a device that carries a lot of data usage and a lot of data traffic. For heavy data users, being on our network, having a faster data experience, having simultaneous voice and data, having the ability for high-end users who do any amount of international travel to be able to use that device, not just in the U.S. but around the world, all of those things were important to the iPhone customer base. And so I think that speaks as much as anything to what we saw in the first quarter and the churn levels. And as we go forward, based on what we've seen certainly, to date, we're not expecting significant changes in those churn rates or in the iPhone churn rates as we go forward in the balance of this year.

One of the interesting things in the quarter to what Rick has said is that our momentum for sales actually increased throughout the quarter. What we saw happen early in January when the iPhone was announced to go to another carrier, is customers took notice, waited to see what was going to happen and once they compared, and they understood that the iPhone works faster, that it has simultaneous voice and data, that it works in over 220 countries, I think they made their choice, and we saw that increase in the February and March timeframe. So we're very pleased with the momentum I think the customers understand the trade-offs and they're making their choices, and I'm very, very pleased that our marketing message got through, and that we maintain and actually grew momentum throughout the quarter. In terms of prepaid, we continue to look at a number of things in prepaid. You probably saw that we just announced our first smartphone or prepaid with LG. It's a low end smartphone on the prepaid market. We think that there is the same level of interest in that market for data in a prepaid product. So we've launched it, and we think we have high hopes that it will stimulate the prepaid demand but we continue to look at all the other kinds of aspects of the prepaid business to grow it, but to grow it profitably."

And is this the turning point where maybe in the next few quarters, we could start to see some sequential growth take shape? And on the other side of the Global business, wholesale looked like it took a step down in the quarter. If could you talk a little more about what happened on that part of the Global business revenue?"

After taking into account the sale of our class of business, we did see the stabilization trend. I think for us, it's the movement towards the IP in the strategic services, which is helping us trend that. We have not planned for an economic turnaround, but as that occurs, we will see those trends improve throughout this year and into next year and I guess our viewpoint would be that we would hope for positive revenue in that area in 2012. On a longer-term basis, we believe it to be a GDP or GDP-plus type business. On the small business side, the opportunities there are really in the data side in our IP DSLAM strategy, where we've got about 50% of our central office covered with the IP DSLAM capabilities, which is allowing us to provide some really competitive products in that area. When you combine that with our unique position to provide mobile services, we believe we are seeing some traction in the small business area. But that has been tempered by the fact that business formation in that space are just really challenged right now. That's an economic matter that I think any participant in the market is dealing with. Lastly, on the wholesale side, we just continue to see challenges on all aspects of that business as our customers continue to trim their networks and look for efficiency. And that's an area that we'll continue to focus on as we go forward."

I think there's a couple of points I'd add, on the wholesale side and the wholesale numbers you're looking at, I think as we kind of disclose the breakdown of our business segments, we include, we group wholesale along with federal and government, education medical segments of the business. And so if you just look at our pure wholesale version of the business, we've seen some improvement there. And in fact, we've seen some nice results driven to a large degree by providing Ethernet transport to cell sites for other carriers. But we are seeing some weakness in the government areas of the business. On the federal side, federal revenues are still growing year-over-year. But the growth rate in this quarter declined and I think at least to some degree, that has to do with budget issues in Washington that are causing different agencies to tighten their belts a little bit. And that, of course, in the state area, the budget pressures there are having an impact. But wholesale by itself is moving along pretty well. When you put it all together, our expectation as we go forward to this year, will be to see improvement in the revenue trends on a year-over-year basis, and we expect to see that as we move into the second, third and fourth quarters. I think the extent of that improvement and certainly, the point in time when we get back to positive revenue growth in business is heavily dependent on the strength of the economy as we go forward in the balance of this year."

What we're seeing in the business is two factors that are impacting margins. One is higher upgrade levels. So those overall volumes in upgrades are higher, and then we're seeing a significant mix shift out of lower end devices, some lower end feature phones and even versus what we've seen the last couple of years, a lower mix in lower and quick messaging devices toward smartphones. Now obviously, there's some upfront cost to that. We believe there's significant advantages to that. Advantages in terms of customer satisfaction and churn advantages, significant advantages in ARPU, even when you go from a quick messaging device to a smartphone, there's a significant ARPU benefit there. But the actual cost by device depend on the individual smartphones that you're selling, because those devices as well vary by device in terms of subsidy. But let me just leave it with the majority of that cost increase had to do with additional subsidies related to smartphones, along with, obviously we're putting a lot of investment into the network to handle the volumes and the traffic that we're seeing. And when you put that additional investment in, it increases our costs associated with cell sites and cell site leases, equipment maintenance. There's a lot of trailing expenses, all the backhaul associated with it. And so those are the two areas where we're seeing some cost increases, and the cost increases in the network side associated, is really associated with volumes and revenues. And it's not having as significant an impact on the overall margin percentage. But the smartphone penetration, the upgrade volumes and so forth is having more of an impact there. And that's something Ralph and his team are working very hard on in terms of as we go forward, managing those levels and managing cost to drive margin improvement as we go forward in this year."

And what happened with momentum, it was holistically wasn't just to one specific device. What we really liked is that we had good momentum from the iPhone portfolio but we also had some terrific momentum from the new Android portfolio. The sales of Android devices with the Motorola Atrix and the HTC Inspire, our brand new Android devices are off to a very good start. So we saw a great impact on momentum from our iPhone portfolio but also the Android portfolio was very strong as were other devices. And so holistically, it was a very strong quarter. Once customers got over the load of what to expect, they saw what the competitor had, they made their choices. So I feel very, very strong about that. When it comes to ARPU, actually even better because we had just begun to roll out the 4G Android devices, and we know we have LTE coming in the middle of the year and in the second half of the year, Jason. So my expectation is once customers get to see the mobile broadband strategy that AT&T has, what they're going to get a great LTE experience with a devices but then you're going to fall back to our HSPA+ capabilities. So that the transition from high-speed of LTE to high-speed of HSPA+ is almost seamless is something they're going to love. That to us means higher ARPU, more data usage, and we feel very strongly that we're on the right path, promoting the right products. And with the network capabilities we're going to have by the end of the year, I feel it puts us in an even better position than we are in this quarter."

In terms of wireless margins, and would expect going forward, we do expect wireless margins to improve going forward in the year. One of the pressures as we talked about we had this quarter was with the migration, primarily the Alltel and to some degree, the Centennial customer base on to our network and our systems. And in order to make that migration because they're coming largely from another technology, we had to replace handsets, and there's a cost and subsidy associated with that. The first this quarter was from a margin standpoint the peak of that impact. We will see some impact going into the second quarter, but it will be less than what we saw this first quarter. And that migration for all practical purposes, will be complete by the end of the second quarter. And so we'll see a natural increase in margins as we go forward due to that change. In addition to that, as I mentioned earlier, there's a number of initiatives we are working to drive margin expansion and better margins in the wireless business. You saw us across the company reduce force pretty significantly this quarter, nearly 6,000. And some of that benefit will flow into the wireless business. And certainly, it will benefit overall margins. But going forward, the individual quarter results can be impacted by specific product launches in those quarters. And obviously, the volume of smartphone sales and the volume of upgrades will impact individual quarters. But to your point, we do expect wireless margins to improve, and our expectations and our planning still move wireless margins into the mid-40s that we talked with you about on a longer-term basis. With that, folks if I can. Let me offer just a couple of closing comments. First off, we entered this quarter and this year with some questions and some uncertainty, primarily related to the change in iPhone the exclusivity and the impacts that would have in our business. And as Ralph said in his remarks, hopefully, we've answered those questions. Was there an impact from another carrier launching the iPhone? Well, the answer to that is yes, there was. We saw a very small increase in postpaid churn and we saw a slight decline in overall flow share. But the impacts were significantly less than many in the financial community and the media expected. And frankly, the impacts were less than we expected. And we continue to grow our postpaid base. We continue our iPhone base. We continue to grow postpaid ARPU and had significant growth in wireless data base. And I think that speaks to several things. I think it speaks first of all to the strength of our postpaid customer base and those specific customer relationships. I think it speaks to the ability of our Ralph de la Vega's team to execute a plan and to compete in the marketplace. And I think it also speaks to the strength of our wireless data network and our franchise overall. This quarter's results give us a base to build from and momentum for growth as we move into the second quarter and into the balance of this year. And beyond 2011, we look forward to closing our acquisition of T-Mobile and to delivering all the benefits and all of the promise of a strong, nationwide wireless broadband network to our customers, to the nation and to our shareholders. One last thing before we end the call, as all of you kindly mentioned in your questions, I have announced my retirement, and this is my last earnings call with you. I would be remiss if I didn't tell you what a pleasure it's been working with all the talented analysts and owners who have followed our company over the years.

And joining me on the call this morning are Rick Lindner, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer; Ralph de la Vega, AT&T's President and CEO for Mobility and Consumer Markets; and John Stephens, AT&T's Controller and CFO-designate.
We'll cover results, then we'll follow with Qs&As. Let me remind you that our release, investor briefing, supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, and, as a reminder, that's www.att.com/investor.relations.  
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3, and that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this presentation based on new information or otherwise. 
This presentation may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are also available on our website at www.att.com/investor.relations. 
Before I turn the call over to Rick, I would like to call your attention to Slide 4, which provides the financial summary. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.57, which is roughly in line with adjusted EPS from first quarter a year ago, and it's clearly up from our reported EPS of $0.41 this time last year. Our results this quarter also include approximately $0.02 of pressure from Alltel integration costs. As we have mentioned to you earlier this year, this merger-related cost will also impact margins, wireless churn and subscriber numbers, which Ralph will cover in a few minutes. 
We will also see some impacts continuing into the second quarter as we complete customer migrations, but, overall, the integration process is going well and is in line with our overall expectations. Consolidated revenues were up 2.3% year-over-year, thanks to continued strength in mobile broadband, U-verse services and strategic business offerings. Consolidated operating income margin remained stable even with strong sales of smartphones, and cash flow continues to be strong, with cash from operating activities totaling $7.7 billion and free cash flow of $3.6 billion. With that, I will now turn the call over, one last time, to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?"

Let me start with a couple of comments on the quarter overall. The highlights are on Slide 5. First off, we had a terrific start to the year.

The highlights are on Slide 5. First off, we had a terrific start to the year. We saw a continuation of the positive revenue trends we've seen in the past few quarters. We had a very strong wireless quarter, with double-digit revenue growth. Stable trends in Wireline revenues driven by U-verse expansion and growth in strategic business services. Going into the quarter, we knew that with another carrier offering the iPhone for the first time, there was a possibility of some natural volatility, and our mobile broadband strategy would be tested as never before.
I'm very pleased to tell you that the results show our strategy is working. Our wireless business is performing at a high level, and customers, both new and existing ones, continue to choose AT&T. Smartphone sales continue to be strong. Postpaid ARPU continues to grow at a good clip. Churn remains relatively stable, both year-over-year and sequentially. Plus, we continued to expand into new wireless growth areas of connected devices and tablets. Ralph will provide you more details in a moment. But mobile broadband is driving unprecedented growth in our industry, and we're pleased with the results we're seeing.
We also continue to be pleased about the transformation of our Wireline business. U-verse continues to scale, helping drive consumer revenue per household up more than 6%, and strategic business revenues had its best quarter in more than two years. So on a number of fronts, it was a positive quarter and a good start to the year.
With that as background, let's look at detailed results starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 6. First quarter consolidated revenue totaled $31.2 billion, up $717 million or 2.3% versus a year ago. That increase was due to double-digit wireless growth, continued U-verse growth of more than 65% year-over-year and stable trends from our Business segment. You see these trends transforming our revenue mix. In the first quarter, 74% of revenues came from wireless, from Wireline Data and Managed Services. That's up from 70% a year ago and 65% two years ago. Revenues from these growth areas were up more than 9% in the first quarter. We are well-positioned here, and we expect these trends to continue to drive top line growth for the company as we go forward in this year.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ralph de la Vega. Ralph, as you know, runs our Wireless and Wireline Consumer businesses for an update on those areas. Ralph?"

As Rick mentioned, we faced a lot of questions with another iPhone competitor entering the market. That made it a little harder to predict what was going to happen in the first quarter, but, at the same time, we had confidence in our mobile broadband strategy, our network and our ability to compete.
Going into the quarter, we told you we had good plans in place. We told you about the stickiness of our customer base, and we told you we were prepared. I'm very pleased to say that not only did we deliver another solid quarter but, in many ways, we had our strongest first quarter ever. Take a look at some of our accomplishments on Slide 7: double-digit revenue growth, the best-ever first quarter net adds with gains in every category; best-ever first quarter smartphone sales, almost equaling our seasonally strong fourth quarter numbers; best-ever first quarter connected device net adds, continuing our strong performance in this area; and we continued to add branded computing subscribers, mobile devices such as tablets, air cards, MiFi and other data devices to our network at a strong pace. 
We also posted year-over-year postpaid ARPU growth for the ninth consecutive quarter as more subscribers added data services at record that none of our competitors can match. And in a quarter that we know could be volatile, we had postpaid subscriber growth. Even with these strong sales, wireless service margins were more than 40% when you exclude the Alltel and Centennial merger cost. All in all, an outstanding quarter especially when you consider the impact of the mergers. Without a doubt, it was a quarter that validated our strategy and our ability to compete. This quarter's performance helps you understand why we're so excited about mobile broadband opportunities. We're just at the beginning of something really incredible. Mobile broadband has become the critical technology, driving growth and innovation. When you think about the additional capabilities to reach that the T-Mobile acquisition provides, you'll understand why we're so excited about this opportunity.
With that, let me cover wireless revenue on Slide 8. Our focus on mobile broadband continues to drive strong growth. Total wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or up 10.2%, and wireless service revenues increased 8.6%, up more than $1 billion versus the first quarter a year ago. This includes growth in both data and voice revenues. Postpaid ARPU grew 2.4%, which includes pressure from the impact of the Alltel merger. Without this pressure, the increase in ARPU will be pushing 3% for the quarter. There's no better place to see the success of our wireless strategy this quarter than our net adds and churn, and this is covered on Slide 9. 
Even in a quarter which we knew would be challenging, we added nearly  2 million subscribers. This includes growth in every product category. Connected devices led the way. We added 1.3 million during the quarter. We also had positive postpaid net adds for the quarter, adding more than 60,000. Excluding the negative impact of the merger integrations, postpaid net adds were around 165,000 in the first quarter. Prepaid net adds for the quarter were 85,000, and we had another solid reseller quarter with more than 560,000 new subscribers. Even though iPhone exclusivity ended in the first quarter, the churn impact was minimal. Total churn was relatively stable with last year's level, and, excluding merger impacts, postpaid churn was stable sequentially and up only seven basis points from the first quarter last year.
If you dive a little bit deeper, iPhone churn by itself was the same year-over-year. And iPhone sales increased, which means we continue to grow our iPhone base this quarter. Keeping churn levels low is critical to wireless growth and profitability, and that is why we have a strong upgrade program. We also built a sizable part of our postpaid base on family and business plans, about 80% overall, and these customers are more loyal with lower churn rates. These results speak volumes about our wireless business. New customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with AT&T in record numbers.
Another part of the strategy that paid dividends was our focus on smartphones. The details are on Slide 10. Smartphone sales helped drive wireless data revenue growth of 24%, up nearly $1 billion year-over-year. We had our largest first quarter smartphone sales ever, signing up 5.5 million customers, both upgrades and new subscribers. The numbers of smartphones on our network increased by about 2.4 million in the quarter, up nine million in the last 12 months. These results reflect another strong quarter for iPhone activations, with more than 3.6 million activated during the quarter. That's almost 1 million more than last year, with 23% of these subscribers new to AT&T. 
We also had a strong quarter with other smartphones, selling more than 2 million other smartphones this quarter. That's twice as many as we added in the first quarter of 2010. This was driven by BlackBerries, Windows Phone 7 devices and significant growth in new Android models. In fact, during the last six months, our monthly sales of Android devices have more than doubled. We still see a lot of upside here. About 46% of our postpaid base uses smartphones today, but our smartphone sales rate is approximately 55%. 
This quarter, we also began breaking up the number of branded computing subscribers added to our network. These are devices such as tablets, air cards and netbooks. We added more than 420,000 this quarter to reach 3.4 million. That's about twice as many as we had 12 months ago. Most of these were tablets with more than 320,000 added. 
These customers continue to choose AT&T for a reason. Network capabilities matter to them, a faster nationwide mobile broadband network, using voice and data simultaneously on their devices and international roaming to 224 countries, thanks to our GSM network. All of these capabilities make a difference to our customers and they're a big reason we had such a strong wireless quarter.
As you might expect, our strong smartphone sales and high upgrade levels had an impact on margins, and the details are on Slide 11. Smartphones tend to have higher subsidies and quick messaging devices than feature phones, but they also have a very attractive customer profile as well, with lower churn, higher ARPUs, which are about 1.8x our other devices, and strong data growth. That's why we implemented an aggressive smartphone promotion strategy in the first quarter, slightly increasing our advertising and marketing spend. You can see the results in our smartphone sales. In the first quarter, we had about 2 million more smartphone sales than we did in the first quarter of 2010. About 9% of our postpaid base upgraded their device in the quarter, signing a new two-year contract with the company. Without the merger upgrades, about 8% of our base upgraded during the quarter. Again, that speaks volumes about the customers' confidence in AT&T, especially this quarter.
These sales did impact wireless margins in the first quarter. Our wireless EBITDA service margin was 39%, down from the year-earlier quarter but up sequentially. Factoring in customer migration costs from the Alltel and Centennial mergers, service margin would have been 40.5%. Wireless operating income was up more than 30% sequentially to almost $4 billion. 
Now let me take a moment to discuss our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. We had another strong quarter with our U-verse services. We've done an outstanding job scaling this business within the last few years with solid net adds, strong revenue growth, growing penetration, strong voice and broadband attach rates, with growing triple-play ARPU and improving profitability. This helped drive our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in consumer Wireline. We added 218,000 U-verse TV subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 3.2 million, up about 900,000 over the past year. Broadband and U-verse voice over IP rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple or quad play bundle with us, and ARPU for these customers continues to grow significantly, up 15% year-over-year to reach almost $170. U-verse now is on an annualized revenue stream of approximately $6 billion. We also continued our recent trend of total wireline broadband net adds, up 175,000. Together, IP products now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue stream and nearly half of total consumer Wireline revenues, growing at over 26% year-over-year. That covers wireless and consumer. I'd now like to turn  it over to John Stephens to discuss wireline business and consolidated results. John?"

What we are seeing so far in 2011 is consistent with the fundamental trends we saw last year. Revenue trends, while still down, have been stable the last three quarters, particularly when you adjust for the third quarter 2010 sale of our local Japan assets.
But there are some encouraging signs. Strategic business services, revenues from products such as ethernet, VPN and application services were up almost 19%, our strongest quarter in more than two years. This drove business IP revenues up more than 8%, once again, led by the growth in VPNs. These results continued trends we have seen throughout this downturn. Consistent investment in strategic business solutions and IP data, services that help drive productivity and efficiency. This has transformed our business wireline revenue mix. Data and other growth areas such as Managed Services now comprise 61% of our revenues, up 200 basis points in the past year. We expect the shift to continue as more and more businesses move to the cloud and IP-based solutions, areas where we are well-positioned. We also continue to execute well. Operating expenses are improving, helping drive margin expansion. So there are some encouraging signs. Any economic improvement would be beneficial as we have not built an economic turnaround into our expectations this year.
Now, let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 14. For the first quarter, margins were up sequentially but down from a year ago at 18.6%. On the wireless side, this reflects a couple of things. Merger integration and related costs that Ralph mentioned and significantly higher smartphone sales. Our Wireline operating income margin was 11.5% in the first quarter, down slightly from the first quarter last year. We remain focused on cost initiatives throughout the company as evidenced by the total force reductions of almost 6,000 this quarter. This helped offset margin pressure from declines in voice revenues and storm-related expenses that occurred in the last -- in the first quarter.
Our commitment to operate as One At&T continues to deliver financial benefits as we consolidate and integrate wireless and wireline operations. And as we talked about operational efficiencies and simplify product offerings, we have continuing opportunities for cost savings. These initiatives are going well and help us sustain solid margins while also serving customers with a best-in-class operation.
Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver a strong free cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 15. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled $7.7 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $4.2 billion, with more than 50% year-over-year increase in our wireless capital to reach $1.9 billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $3.6 billion, and we made a dividend payment this quarter for $2.5 billion. In terms of other uses of our cash, we reduced debt by more than $1 billion in the first quarter and debt is down almost $4.5 billion over the past 12 months. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is now at 1.53.
Our strong balance sheet and cash flow continue to give us the flexibility to invest in the business through both capital improvements and strategic acquisitions, while also returning substantial value to shareholders. With that, I will now turn it back to Rick for closing comments."

First, we're off to a good start for the year, with solid revenue growth in both wireless and consumer wireline and stability in our business markets. Second, we had another very strong wireless quarter, a performance that was particularly satisfying when you consider the challenges we faced. We told you last quarter that we expected positive contract subscriber growth for the year, even with the introduction of another carrier for the iPhone. And we delivered on that outlook in the very first quarter. When you add in record first quarter net adds, strong sales of branded computing subscribers and higher postpaid ARPU, you can understand our confidence in the mobile broadband strategy and mobile broadband opportunity. We're also very pleased with the continued transformation of our Wireline business. In fact, fast-growing data and video services now exceed voice revenues in Wireline, thanks to U-verse and continued strong growth in strategic business services. And our financial strength and cash flow remain strong, allowing us to return value to shareholders as we continue to invest in our business.
So we're off to a good start to the year, with solid first quarter operating results and a positive long-term outlook for the business. Brooks that concludes our prepared remarks. I think we're ready to take some questions."

Is this the kind of increase in churn? Churn was -- the increase is, certainly, much less than we thought. Is the kind of level that you think we should expect to see going forward here, maybe in the second quarter? Or do you think that the expiration of some of the contracts that you guys signed two years ago accelerates that a bit? And then, secondly, on wireless, the prepaid numbers, you have a net add to 85,000, a bit less than we thought. Verizon is testing some new prepaid plans.

In terms of churn, frankly, we expected a slight uptick in churn when another carrier launched the iPhone. Our expectations, I think we're generally less more modest in terms of churn increase than external expectations. We believed in our broadband strategy, our wireless strategy. We felt we were prepared for changes in exclusivity. And, actually, the results came in better than we expected. And as you heard from Ralph, there's very, very modest change in overall churn and in postpaid churn levels. And I think, one of the most surprising areas perhaps is the fact that iPhone churn basically stayed flat. It did not increase. And I think, as you know, as you think about what drove that and what caused those results, frankly, I think it had less to do with customers being under contract. Of course, we always work hard with our upgrade policy to keep customers under contract, and we do believe that it helps overall churn levels. But the fact is that, it was well known for months and quarters in advance that another carrier would launch the iPhone. And yet, we continued to see customers upgrade their devices, enter into new contracts in the third and fourth quarters last year and in record numbers. And that continued into the first quarter this year when the phone was available on another carrier. And the reality is, even if customers were under contract, they have the ability to break that contract, pay a termination charge and most likely, take that device that they have and sell it and recover most, if not all, of that contract termination. So I don't think having customers under contract had that large of an impact. What I do believe has an impact is what Ralph touched on earlier, and that is the device. And you have to remember the iPhone is a device that carries a lot of data usage and a lot of data traffic. For heavy data users, being on our network, having a faster data experience, having simultaneous voice and data, having the ability for high-end users who do any amount of international travel to be able to use that device, not just in the U.S. but around the world, all of those things were important to the iPhone customer base. And so I think that speaks as much as anything to what we saw in the first quarter and to churn levels. And as we go forward, based on what we've seen, certainly, to date, we're not expecting significant changes in those churn rates or in the iPhone churn rates as we go forward in the balance of this year.

One of the interesting things in the quarter to what Rick has said is that our momentum for sales actually increased throughout the quarter. What we saw happen early in January, when the iPhone was announced to go to another carrier, is customers took notice, waited to see what was going to happen and once they compared, and they understood that the iPhone works faster, that it has simultaneous voice and data, and it works in over 220 countries, I think they made their choice, and we saw that increase in the February and March timeframe. So we're very pleased with the momentum. I think the customers understand the trade-offs, and they're making their choices. And I'm very, very pleased that our marketing message got through, and that we maintain and actually grew momentum throughout the quarter. In terms of prepaid, we continue to look at a number of things in prepaid. You probably saw that we just announced our first smartphone on prepaid with LG. It's a low-end smartphone on the prepaid market. We think that there is the same level of interest in that market for data in a prepaid product. So we've launched it, and we think we have high hopes that, that will stimulate prepaid demand. But we continue to look at all or other kinds of aspects of the prepaid business to grow it, but to grow it profitably."

And I guess our viewpoint would be that we would hope for positive revenue in that area in 2012. On a longer-term basis, we believe it to be a GDP or GDP-plus type business. On the small business side, the opportunities there are really in the data side in our IP DSLAM strategy, where we've got about 50% of our central office covered with the IP DSLAM capabilities, which is allowing us to provide some really competitive products in that area. When you combine that with our unique position to provide mobile services, we believe we are seeing some traction in the small business area. But that has been tempered by the fact that business formations in that space are just really challenged right now. That's an economic matter that, I think, any participant in the market is dealing with. Lastly, on the wholesale side, we just continue to see challenges on all aspects of that business as our customers continue to trim their networks and look for efficiency. And that's an area that we'll continue to focus on as we go forward."

I think just a couple of points I'd add, on the wholesale side and the wholesale numbers you're looking at, I think as we kind of disclose the breakdown of our business segments, we include, we group wholesale along with federal and government, education and medical segments of the business. And so if you just look at our pure wholesale portion of the business, we've seen some improvement there. And, in fact, we've seen some nice results driven to a large degree by providing Ethernet transport to cell sites for other carriers, but we are seeing some weakness in the government areas of the business. On the federal side, federal revenues are still growing year-over-year. But the growth rate in this quarter declined, and I think, at least to some degree, that has to do with budget issues in Washington that are causing different agencies to tighten their belts a little bit. And that, of course, in the state area, the budget pressures there are having an impact. But wholesale by itself is moving along pretty well. When you put it all together, our expectation as we go forward in this year, will be to see improvement in the revenue trends on a year-over-year basis, and we expect to see that as we move into the second, third and fourth quarters. I think the extent of that improvement and, certainly, the point in time when we get back to positive revenue growth in business is heavily dependent on the strength of the economy as we go forward in the balance of this year."

I mean, this was the first time in, I think, maybe 10 quarters that we actually saw the total value expenses go up rather than down. And then I guess the second question maybe, Ralph, just on the ARPU side, could you talk a little bit about at this stage of the game, what's driving ARPU? Is it getting the feature phone subs into that $15 price tier? Was it really about selling these $50 iPhones and upselling guys who are already in the integrated device tier up to the smartphone level?

What we're seeing in the business is two factors that are impacting margins. One is higher upgrade levels. So those overall volumes in upgrades are higher, and then we're seeing a significant mix shift out of lower-end devices, some lower-end feature phones and even versus what we've seen the last couple of years, a lower mix in lower-end quick messaging devices toward smartphones. Now, obviously, there's some upfront costs to that. We believe there's significant advantages to that. Advantages in terms of customer satisfaction and churn advantages, significant advantages in ARPU, even when you go from a quick messaging device to a smartphone, there's a significant ARPU benefit there. But the actual cost by device depend on the individual smartphones that you're selling, because those devices, as well, vary by device in terms of subsidy. But let me just leave it with the majority of that cost increase had to do with additional subsidies related to smartphones, along with -- obviously, we're putting a lot of investment into the network to handle the volumes and the traffic that we're seeing. And when you put that additional investment in, it increases our costs associated with cell sites and cell site leases, equipment maintenance. There's a lot of trailing expenses, all the backhaul associated with it, and so those are the two areas where we're seeing some cost increases, and the cost increases in the network side associated, is really associated with volumes and revenues. And it's not having as significant an impact on the overall margin percentage. But the smartphone penetration, the upgrade volumes and so forth, is having more of an impact there. And that's something Ralph and his team are working very hard on in terms of as we go forward, managing those levels and managing cost to drive margin improvement as we go forward in this year."

And, yes, what happened with momentum, it was, holistically, wasn't just to one specific device. What we really liked is that we had good momentum from the iPhone portfolio but we also had some terrific momentum from the new Android portfolio. The sales of Android devices with the Motorola Atrix and the HTC Inspire, our brand new Android devices are off to a very good start. So we saw great impact on momentum from our iPhone portfolio but, also, the Android portfolio was very strong as were other devices. And so, holistically, it was a very strong quarter. Once of the customers got over the load of what to expect, they saw what the competitor had, and they made their choices. So I feel very, very strong about that. When it comes to ARPU, I feel even better because we have just begun to roll out the 4G Android devices, and we know we have LTE coming in the middle of the year and in the second half of the year, Jason. So my expectation is once customers get to see the mobile broadband strategy that AT&T has, where you're going to get a great LTE experience with these new devices, but then you're going to fall back to our HSPA+ capabilities so that the transition from high-speed of LTE to high-speed of HSPA+ is almost seamless, is something they're going to love. That to us means higher ARPU, more data usage, and we feel very strongly that we're on the right path, promoting the right products. And with the network capabilities we're going to have by the end of the year, I feel it puts us in an even better position that we are in this quarter."

In terms of wireless margins, and what we expect going forward, we do expect wireless margins to improve going forward in the year. One of the pressures as we talked about we had this quarter was with the migration, primarily the Alltel and to some degree, the Centennial customer bases on to our network and our systems. And in order to make that migration because they're coming largely from another technology, we had to replace handsets, and there's a cost and subsidy associated with that. The first this quarter was from a margin standpoint the peak of that impact. We will see some impact going into the second quarter, but it will be less than what we saw this first quarter. And that migration, for all practical purposes, will be complete by the end of the second quarter. And so we'll see a natural increase in margins as we go forward due to that change. In addition to that, as I mentioned earlier, there's a number of initiatives we are working to drive margin expansion and better margins in the wireless business. You saw us across the company reduce force pretty significantly this quarter, nearly 6,000. And some of that benefit will flow into the wireless business. And, certainly, it will benefit overall margins. But going forward, the individual quarter results can be impacted by specific product launches in those quarters. And obviously, the volume of smartphone sales and the volume of upgrades will impact individual quarters. But to your point, we do expect wireless margins to improve, and our expectations and our planning still move wireless margins into the mid-40s that we talked with you about on a longer-term basis. With that, folks, if I can, let me offer just a couple of closing comments. First off, we entered this quarter and this year with some questions and some uncertainty, primarily related to the change in iPhone exclusivity and the impacts that it would have on our business. And as Ralph said in his remarks, hopefully, we've answered those questions. Was there an impact from another carrier launching the iPhone? Well, the answer to that is yes, there was. We saw a very small increase in postpaid churn, and we saw a slight decline in overall flow share. But the impacts were significantly less than many in the financial community and the media expected. And frankly, the impacts were less than we expected. And we continue to grow our postpaid base. We continue to grow our iPhone base. We continue to grow postpaid ARPU and had significant growth in wireless data revenues. And I think that speaks to several things. I think it speaks, first of all, to the strength of our postpaid customer base and those specific customer relationships. I think it speaks to the ability of Ralph de la Vega's team to execute a plan and to compete in the marketplace. And I think it also speaks to the strength of our wireless data network and our franchise overall. This quarter's results give us a base to build from and momentum for growth as we move into the second quarter and into the balance of this year. And beyond 2011, we look forward to closing our acquisition of T-Mobile and to delivering all of the benefits and all of the promise of a strong, nationwide wireless broadband network to our customers, to the nation and to our shareholders. One last thing before we end the call, as all of you kindly mentioned in your questions, I have announced my retirement, and this is my last earnings call with you. I would be remiss if I didn't tell you what a pleasure it's been working with all the talented analysts and owners who have followed our company over the years.

Before I turn the call over to Rick, I would like to call your attention to Slide 4, which provides the financial summary. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.57, which is roughly in line with adjusted EPS from first quarter a year ago, and it's clearly up from our reported EPS of $0.41 this time last year. Our results this quarter also include approximately $0.02 of pressure from Alltel integration costs. As we have mentioned to you earlier this year, this merger-related cost will also impact margins, wireless churn and subscriber numbers, which Ralph will cover in a few minutes. 
We will also see some impacts continuing into the second quarter as we complete customer migrations, but, overall, the integration process is going well and is in line with our overall expectations. Consolidated revenues were up 2.3% year-over-year, thanks to continued strength in mobile broadband, U-verse services and strategic business offerings. Consolidated operating income margin remained stable even with strong sales of smartphones, and cash flow continues to be strong, with cash from operating activities totaling $7.7 billion and free cash flow of $3.6 billion. With that, I will now turn the call over, one last time, to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?"

Let me start with a couple of comments on the quarter overall. The highlights are on Slide 5. First off, we had a terrific start to the year.

The highlights are on Slide 5. First off, we had a terrific start to the year. We saw a continuation of the positive revenue trends we've seen in the past few quarters. We had a very strong wireless quarter, with double-digit revenue growth. Stable trends in Wireline revenues driven by U-verse expansion and growth in strategic business services. Going into the quarter, we knew that with another carrier offering the iPhone for the first time, there was a possibility of some natural volatility, and our mobile broadband strategy would be tested as never before.
I'm very pleased to tell you that the results show our strategy is working. Our wireless business is performing at a high level, and customers, both new and existing ones, continue to choose AT&T. Smartphone sales continue to be strong. Postpaid ARPU continues to grow at a good clip. Churn remains relatively stable, both year-over-year and sequentially. Plus, we continued to expand into new wireless growth areas of connected devices and tablets. Ralph will provide you more details in a moment. But mobile broadband is driving unprecedented growth in our industry, and we're pleased with the results we're seeing.
We also continue to be pleased about the transformation of our Wireline business. U-verse continues to scale, helping drive consumer revenue per household up more than 6%, and strategic business revenues had its best quarter in more than two years. So on a number of fronts, it was a positive quarter and a good start to the year.
With that as background, let's look at detailed results starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 6. First quarter consolidated revenue totaled $31.2 billion, up $717 million or 2.3% versus a year ago. That increase was due to double-digit wireless growth, continued U-verse growth of more than 65% year-over-year and stable trends from our Business segment. You see these trends transforming our revenue mix. In the first quarter, 74% of revenues came from wireless, from Wireline Data and Managed Services. That's up from 70% a year ago and 65% two years ago. Revenues from these growth areas were up more than 9% in the first quarter. We are well-positioned here, and we expect these trends to continue to drive top line growth for the company as we go forward in this year.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ralph de la Vega. Ralph, as you know, runs our Wireless and Wireline Consumer businesses for an update on those areas. Ralph?"

It's great to be with you today. As Rick mentioned, we faced a lot of questions with another iPhone competitor entering the market. That made it a little harder to predict what was going to happen in the first",1442,"Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you today. As Rick mentioned, we faced a lot of questions with another iPhone competitor entering the market. That made it a little harder to predict what was going to happen in the first quarter, but, at the same time, we had confidence in our mobile broadband strategy, our network and our ability to compete.
Going into the quarter, we told you we had good plans in place. We told you about the stickiness of our customer base, and we told you we were prepared. I'm very pleased to say that not only did we deliver another solid quarter but, in many ways, we had our strongest first quarter ever. Take a look at some of our accomplishments on Slide 7: double-digit revenue growth, the best-ever first quarter net adds with gains in every category; best-ever first quarter smartphone sales, almost equaling our seasonally strong fourth quarter numbers; best-ever first quarter connected device net adds, continuing our strong performance in this area; and we continued to add branded computing subscribers, mobile devices such as tablets, air cards, MiFi and other data devices to our network at a strong pace. 
We also posted year-over-year postpaid ARPU growth for the ninth consecutive quarter as more subscribers added data services at record that none of our competitors can match. And in a quarter that we know could be volatile, we had postpaid subscriber growth. Even with these strong sales, wireless service margins were more than 40% when you exclude the Alltel and Centennial merger cost. All in all, an outstanding quarter especially when you consider the impact of the mergers. Without a doubt, it was a quarter that validated our strategy and our ability to compete. This quarter's performance helps you understand why we're so excited about mobile broadband opportunities. We're just at the beginning of something really incredible. Mobile broadband has become the critical technology, driving growth and innovation. When you think about the additional capabilities to reach that the T-Mobile acquisition provides, you'll understand why we're so excited about this opportunity.
With that, let me cover wireless revenue on Slide 8. Our focus on mobile broadband continues to drive strong growth. Total wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or up 10.2%, and wireless service revenues increased 8.6%, up more than $1 billion versus the first quarter a year ago. This includes growth in both data and voice revenues. Postpaid ARPU grew 2.4%, which includes pressure from the impact of the Alltel merger. Without this pressure, the increase in ARPU will be pushing 3% for the quarter. There's no better place to see the success of our wireless strategy this quarter than our net adds and churn, and this is covered on Slide 9. 
Even in a quarter which we knew would be challenging, we added nearly  2 million subscribers. This includes growth in every product category. Connected devices led the way. We added 1.3 million during the quarter. We also had positive postpaid net adds for the quarter, adding more than 60,000. Excluding the negative impact of the merger integrations, postpaid net adds were around 165,000 in the first quarter. Prepaid net adds for the quarter were 85,000, and we had another solid reseller quarter with more than 560,000 new subscribers. Even though iPhone exclusivity ended in the first quarter, the churn impact was minimal. Total churn was relatively stable with last year's level, and, excluding merger impacts, postpaid churn was stable sequentially and up only seven basis points from the first quarter last year.
If you dive a little bit deeper, iPhone churn by itself was the same year-over-year. And iPhone sales increased, which means we continue to grow our iPhone base this quarter. Keeping churn levels low is critical to wireless growth and profitability, and that is why we have a strong upgrade program. We also built a sizable part of our postpaid base on family and business plans, about 80% overall, and these customers are more loyal with lower churn rates. These results speak volumes about our wireless business. New customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with AT&T in record numbers.
Another part of the strategy that paid dividends was our focus on smartphones. The details are on Slide 10. Smartphone sales helped drive wireless data revenue growth of 24%, up nearly $1 billion year-over-year. We had our largest first quarter smartphone sales ever, signing up 5.5 million customers, both upgrades and new subscribers. The numbers of smartphones on our network increased by about 2.4 million in the quarter, up nine million in the last 12 months. These results reflect another strong quarter for iPhone activations, with more than 3.6 million activated during the quarter. That's almost 1 million more than last year, with 23% of these subscribers new to AT&T. 
We also had a strong quarter with other smartphones, selling more than 2 million other smartphones this quarter. That's twice as many as we added in the first quarter of 2010. This was driven by BlackBerries, Windows Phone 7 devices and significant growth in new Android models. In fact, during the last six months, our monthly sales of Android devices have more than doubled. We still see a lot of upside here. About 46% of our postpaid base uses smartphones today, but our smartphone sales rate is approximately 55%. 
This quarter, we also began breaking up the number of branded computing subscribers added to our network. These are devices such as tablets, air cards and netbooks. We added more than 420,000 this quarter to reach 3.4 million. That's about twice as many as we had 12 months ago. Most of these were tablets with more than 320,000 added. 
These customers continue to choose AT&T for a reason. Network capabilities matter to them, a faster nationwide mobile broadband network, using voice and data simultaneously on their devices and international roaming to 224 countries, thanks to our GSM network. All of these capabilities make a difference to our customers and they're a big reason we had such a strong wireless quarter.
As you might expect, our strong smartphone sales and high upgrade levels had an impact on margins, and the details are on Slide 11. Smartphones tend to have higher subsidies and quick messaging devices than feature phones, but they also have a very attractive customer profile as well, with lower churn, higher ARPUs, which are about 1.8x our other devices, and strong data growth. That's why we implemented an aggressive smartphone promotion strategy in the first quarter, slightly increasing our advertising and marketing spend. You can see the results in our smartphone sales. In the first quarter, we had about 2 million more smartphone sales than we did in the first quarter of 2010. About 9% of our postpaid base upgraded their device in the quarter, signing a new two-year contract with the company. Without the merger upgrades, about 8% of our base upgraded during the quarter. Again, that speaks volumes about the customers' confidence in AT&T, especially this quarter.
These sales did impact wireless margins in the first quarter. Our wireless EBITDA service margin was 39%, down from the year-earlier quarter but up sequentially. Factoring in customer migration costs from the Alltel and Centennial mergers, service margin would have been 40.5%. Wireless operating income was up more than 30% sequentially to almost $4 billion. 
Now let me take a moment to discuss our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. We had another strong quarter with our U-verse services. We've done an outstanding job scaling this business within the last few years with solid net adds, strong revenue growth, growing penetration, strong voice and broadband attach rates, with growing triple-play ARPU and improving profitability. This helped drive our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in consumer Wireline. We added 218,000 U-verse TV subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 3.2 million, up about 900,000 over the past year. Broadband and U-verse voice over IP rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple or quad play bundle with us, and ARPU for these customers continues to grow significantly, up 15% year-over-year to reach almost $170. U-verse now is on an annualized revenue stream of approximately $6 billion. We also continued our recent trend of total wireline broadband net adds, up 175,000. Together, IP products now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue stream and nearly half of total consumer Wireline revenues, growing at over 26% year-over-year. That covers wireless and consumer. I'd now like to turn  it over to John Stephens to discuss wireline business and consolidated results. John?"

What we are seeing so far in 2011 is consistent with the fundamental trends we saw last year. Revenue trends, while still down, have been stable the last three quarters, particularly when you adjust for the third quarter 2010 sale of our local Japan assets.
But there are some encouraging signs. Strategic business services, revenues from products such as ethernet, VPNs and application services were up almost 19%, our strongest quarter in more than two years. This drove business IP revenues up more than 8%, once again, led by the growth in VPNs. These results continued trends we have seen throughout this downturn. Consistent investment in strategic business solutions and IP data, services that help drive productivity and efficiency. This has transformed our business wireline revenue mix. Data and other growth areas such as Managed Services now comprise 61% of our revenues, up 200 basis points in the past year. We expect the shift to continue as more and more businesses move to the cloud and IP-based solutions, areas where we are well-positioned. We also continue to execute well. Operating expenses are improving, helping drive margin expansion. So there are some encouraging signs. Any economic improvement would be beneficial as we have not built an economic turnaround into our expectations this year.
Now, let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 14. For the first quarter, margins were up sequentially but down from a year ago at 18.6%. On the wireless side, this reflects a couple of things. Merger integration and related costs that Ralph mentioned and significantly higher smartphone sales. Our Wireline operating income margin was 11.5% in the first quarter, down slightly from the first quarter last year. We remain focused on cost initiatives throughout the company as evidenced by the total force reductions of almost 6,000 this quarter. This helped offset margin pressure from declines in voice revenues and storm-related expenses that occurred in the last -- in the first quarter.
Our commitment to operate as One At&T continues to deliver financial benefits as we consolidate and integrate wireless and wireline operations. And as we talked about operational efficiencies and simplify product offerings, we have continuing opportunities for cost savings. These initiatives are going well and help us sustain solid margins while also serving customers with a best-in-class operation.
Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver a strong free cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 15. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled $7.7 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $4.2 billion, with more than 50% year-over-year increase in our wireless capital to reach $1.9 billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $3.6 billion, and we made a dividend payment this quarter for $2.5 billion. In terms of other uses of our cash, we reduced debt by more than $1 billion in the first quarter and debt is down almost $4.5 billion over the past 12 months. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is now at 1.53.
Our strong balance sheet and cash flow continue to give us the flexibility to invest in the business through both capital improvements and strategic acquisitions, while also returning substantial value to shareholders. With that, I will now turn it back to Rick for closing comments."

First, we're off to a good start for the year, with solid revenue growth in both wireless and consumer wireline and stability in our business markets. Second, we had another very strong wireless quarter, a performance that was particularly satisfying when you consider the challenges we faced. We told you last quarter that we expected positive contract subscriber growth for the year, even with the introduction of another carrier for the iPhone. And we delivered on that outlook in the very first quarter. When you add in record first quarter net adds, strong sales of branded computing subscribers and higher postpaid ARPU, you can understand our confidence in the mobile broadband strategy and mobile broadband opportunity. We're also very pleased with the continued transformation of our Wireline business. In fact, fast-growing data and video services now exceed voice revenues in Wireline, thanks to U-verse and continued strong growth in strategic business services. And our financial strength and cash flow remain strong, allowing us to return value to shareholders as we continue to invest in our business.
So we're off to a good start to the year, with solid first quarter operating results and a positive long-term outlook for the business. Brooks that concludes our prepared remarks. I think we're ready to take some questions."

Is this the kind of increase in churn? Churn was -- the increase is, certainly, much less than we thought. Is the kind of level that you think we should expect to see going forward here, maybe in the second quarter? Or do you think that the expiration of some of the contracts that you guys signed two years ago accelerates that a bit? And then, secondly, on wireless, the prepaid numbers, you have a net add to 85,000, a bit less than we thought. Verizon is testing some new prepaid plans.

In terms of churn, frankly, we expected a slight uptick in churn when another carrier launched the iPhone. Our expectations, I think we're generally less more modest in terms of churn increase than external expectations. We believed in our broadband strategy, our wireless strategy. We felt we were prepared for changes in exclusivity. And, actually, the results came in better than we expected. And as you heard from Ralph, there's very, very modest change in overall churn and in postpaid churn levels. And I think, one of the most surprising areas perhaps is the fact that iPhone churn basically stayed flat. It did not increase. And I think, as you know, as you think about what drove that and what caused those results, frankly, I think it had less to do with customers being under contract. Of course, we always work hard with our upgrade policy to keep customers under contract, and we do believe that it helps overall churn levels. But the fact is that, it was well known for months and quarters in advance that another carrier would launch the iPhone. And yet, we continued to see customers upgrade their devices, enter into new contracts in the third and fourth quarters last year and in record numbers. And that continued into the first quarter this year when the phone was available on another carrier. And the reality is, even if customers were under contract, they have the ability to break that contract, pay a termination charge and most likely, take that device that they had and sell it and recover most, if not all, of that contract termination. So I don't think having customers under contract had that large of an impact. What I do believe has an impact is what Ralph touched on earlier, and that is the device. And you have to remember the iPhone is a device that carries a lot of data usage and a lot of data traffic. For heavy data users, being on our network, having a faster data experience, having simultaneous voice and data, having the ability for high-end users who do any amount of international travel to be able to use that device, not just in the U.S. but around the world, all of those things were important to the iPhone customer base. And so I think that speaks as much as anything to what we saw in the first quarter and to churn levels. And as we go forward, based on what we've seen, certainly, to date, we're not expecting significant changes in those churn rates or in the iPhone churn rates as we go forward in the balance of this year.

One of the interesting things in the quarter to add to what Rick has said is that our momentum for sales actually increased throughout the quarter. What we saw happen early in January, when the iPhone was announced to go to another carrier, is customers took notice, waited to see what was going to happen and once they compared, and they understood that on our network the iPhone works faster, that it has simultaneous voice and data, and it works in over 220 countries, I think they made their choice, and we saw that increase in the February and March timeframe. So we're very pleased with the momentum. I think the customers understand the trade-offs, and they're making their choices. And I'm very, very pleased that our marketing message got through, and that we maintain and actually grew momentum throughout the quarter. In terms of prepaid, we continue to look at a number of things in prepaid. You probably saw that we just announced our first smartphone on prepaid with LG. It's a low-end smartphone on the prepaid market. We think that there is the same level of interest in that market for data in a prepaid product. So we've launched it, and we think we have high hopes that, that will stimulate prepaid demand. But we continue to look at all or other kinds of aspects of the prepaid business to grow it, but to grow it profitably."

I think for us, it's the movement towards the IP and the strategic services which is helping us trend that. We have not planned for an economic turnaround, but, as that occurs, we will see those trends improve throughout this year and into next year. And I guess our viewpoint would be that we would hope for positive revenue in that area in 2012. On a longer-term basis, we believe it to be a GDP or GDP-plus type business. On the small business side, the opportunities there are really in the data side in our IP DSLAM strategy, where we've got about 50% of our central office covered with the IP DSLAM capabilities, which is allowing us to provide some really competitive products in the data area. When you combine that with our unique position to provide mobile services, we believe we are seeing some traction in the small business area. But that has been tempered by the fact that business formations in that space are just really challenged right now. That's an economic matter that, I think, any participant in the market is dealing with. Lastly, on the wholesale side, we just continue to see challenges on all aspects of that business as our customers continue to trim their networks and look for efficiency.

And, in fact, we've seen some nice results driven to a large degree by providing Ethernet transport to cell sites for other carriers, but we are seeing some weakness in the government areas of the business. On the federal side, federal revenues are still growing year-over-year. But the growth rate in this quarter declined, and I think, at least to some degree, that has to do with budget issues in Washington that are causing different agencies to tighten their belts a little bit. And that, of course, in the state area, the budget pressures there are having an impact. But wholesale by itself is moving along pretty well. When you put it all together, our expectation as we go forward in this year, will be to see improvement in the revenue trends on a year-over-year basis, and we expect to see that as we move into the second, third and fourth quarters. I think the extent of that improvement and, certainly, the point in time when we get back to positive revenue growth in business is heavily dependent on the strength of the economy as we go forward in the balance of this year."

I mean, this was the first time in, I think, maybe 10 quarters that we actually saw the total value expenses go up rather than down. And then I guess the second question maybe, Ralph, just on the ARPU side, could you talk a little bit about at this stage of the game, what's driving ARPU? Is it getting the feature phone subs into that $15 price tier? Was it really about selling these $50 iPhones and upselling guys who are already in the integrated device tier up to the smartphone level?

What we're seeing in the businesses is two factors that are impacting margins. One is higher upgrade levels. So those overall volumes in upgrades are higher, and then we're seeing a significant mix shift out of lower-end devices, some lower-end feature phones and even versus what we've seen the last couple of years, a lower mix in lower-end quick messaging devices toward smartphones. Now, obviously, there's some upfront costs to that. We believe there's significant advantages to that. Advantages in terms of customer satisfaction and churn advantages, significant advantages in ARPU, even when you go from a quick messaging device to a smartphone, there's a significant ARPU benefit there. But the actual cost by device depend on the individual smartphones that you're selling, because those devices, as well, vary by device in terms of subsidy. But let me just leave it with the majority of that cost increase had to do with additional subsidies related to smartphones, along with -- obviously, we're putting a lot of investment into the network to handle the volumes and the traffic that we're seeing. And when you put that additional investment in, it increases our costs associated with cell sites and cell site leases, equipment maintenance. There's a lot of trailing expenses, all the backhaul associated with it, and so those are the two areas where we're seeing some cost increases, and the cost increases in the network side associated, is really associated with volumes and revenues. And it's not having as significant an impact on the overall margin percentage. But the smartphone penetration, the upgrade volumes and so forth, is having more of an impact there. And that's something Ralph and his team are working very hard on in terms of as we go forward, managing those levels and managing cost to drive margin improvement as we go forward in this year."

And, yes, what happened with momentum, it was, holistically, wasn't just to one specific device. What we really liked is that we had good momentum from the iPhone portfolio but we also had some terrific momentum from the new Android portfolio. The sales of Android devices with the Motorola Atrix and the HTC Inspire, our brand new Android devices are off to a very good start. So we saw great impact on momentum from our iPhone portfolio but, also, the Android portfolio was very strong as were other devices. And so, holistically, it was a very strong quarter. Once the customers got over the load of what to expect, they saw what the competitor had, and they made their choices. So I feel very, very strong about that. When it comes to ARPU, I feel even better because we have just begun to roll out the 4G Android devices, and we know we have LTE coming in the middle of the year and in the second half of the year, Jason. So my expectation is once customers get to see the mobile broadband strategy that AT&T has, where you're going to get a great LTE experience with these new devices, but then you're going to fall back to our HSPA+ capabilities so that the transition from high-speed of LTE to high-speed of HSPA+ is almost seamless, is something they're going to love. That to us means higher ARPU, more data usage, and we feel very strongly that we're on the right path, promoting the right products. And with the network capabilities we're going to have by the end of the year, I feel it puts us in an even better position that we are in this quarter."

In terms of wireless margins, and what we expect going forward, we do expect wireless margins to improve going forward in the year. One of the pressures as we talked about we had this quarter was with the migration, primarily the Alltel and to some degree, the Centennial customer bases on to our network and our systems. And in order to make that migration because they're coming largely from another technology, we had to replace handsets, and there's a cost and subsidy associated with that. The first this quarter was from a margin standpoint the peak of that impact. We will see some impact going into the second quarter, but it will be less than what we saw this first quarter. And that migration, for all practical purposes, will be complete by the end of the second quarter. And so we'll see a natural increase in margins as we go forward due to that change. In addition to that, as I mentioned earlier, there's a number of initiatives we are working to drive margin expansion and better margins in the wireless business. You saw us across the company reduce force pretty significantly this quarter, nearly 6,000. And some of that benefit will flow into the wireless business. And, certainly, it will benefit overall margins. But going forward, the individual quarter results can be impacted by specific product launches in those quarters. And obviously, the volume of smartphone sales and the volume of upgrades will impact individual quarters. But to your point, we do expect wireless margins to improve, and our expectations and our planning still move wireless margins into the mid-40s that we talked with you about on a longer-term basis. With that, folks, if I can, let me offer just a couple of closing comments. First off, we entered this quarter and this year with some questions and some uncertainty, primarily related to the change in iPhone exclusivity and the impacts that it would have on our business. And as Ralph said in his remarks, hopefully, we've answered those questions. Was there an impact from another carrier launching the iPhone? Well, the answer to that is yes, there was. We saw a very small increase in postpaid churn, and we saw a slight decline in overall flow share. But the impacts were significantly less than many in the financial community and the media expected. And frankly, the impacts were less than we expected. And we continue to grow our postpaid base. We continue to grow our iPhone base. We continue to grow postpaid ARPU and had significant growth in wireless data revenues. And I think that speaks to several things. I think it speaks, first of all, to the strength of our postpaid customer base and those specific customer relationships. I think it speaks to the ability of Ralph de la Vega's team to execute a plan and to compete in the marketplace. And I think it also speaks to the strength of our wireless data network and our franchise overall. This quarter's results give us a base to build from and momentum for growth as we move into the second quarter and into the balance of this year. And beyond 2011, we look forward to closing our acquisition of T-Mobile and to delivering all of the benefits and all of the promise of a strong, nationwide wireless broadband network to our customers, to the nation and to our shareholders. One last thing before we end the call, as all of you kindly mentioned in your questions, I have announced my retirement, and this is my last earnings call with you. I would be remiss if I didn't tell you what a pleasure it's been working with all the talented analysts and owners who have followed our company over the years.

Let me remind you that our release, investor briefing, supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That's www.att.com/investor.relations.
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3.

Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 4. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60, consistent with last year's EPS before one-time gain and up more than 5% sequentially. Our reported EPS this quarter includes $0.02 of pressure from Alltel integration costs and storm cost in the Southeast and Missouri. As we mentioned earlier this year, Alltel integration costs impact margins, Wireless churn and subscriber numbers. After this quarter, these impacts will be largely behind us. The fundamental trends in our business continue to be quite solid. 
Consolidated revenue continues to grow for the sixth quarter in a row, up 2.2% year-over-year thanks to strength in mobile broadband, U-verse and advanced business offerings. Even with another quarter of record smartphone sales, our consolidated operating margin remains relatively stable with the prior year and was up sequentially. Cash flow continues to be strong with cash from operating activities for the quarter totaling $9 billion and free cash flow of $3.7 billion. 
With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?"

But while that has been going on, we have done an excellent job in executing on our strategies and growing the business. 
Let me share a few highlights that's on Slide 5. Consolidated revenues were up year-over-year and sequentially, led by strong Wireless growth and increasing stability in our Wireline revenues. Earnings were solid even when including Alltel integration and storm-related costs. Margins expanded sequentially across the board. Wireless, Wireline and total and were generally stable from a year ago. Free cash flow was strong, and we continue to expect growth for the year.
Driving these financial results was another incredible quarter in mobile broadband. Smartphone sales set another quarterly record. Postpaid ARPU grew for the 10th consecutive quarter, a record unmatched in the industry. Mobile data growth remains strong and is now an annualized $22 billion revenue stream. We also had solid net adds with growth in every subscriber category, including having our best quarter yet in branded computing devices. And our Wireline business is showing signs that it soon will be growing again. U-verse continues to be strong, adding subscribers, increasing triple-play ARPU and is now a $6.5 billion annualized revenue stream. In fact, fast-growing consumer IP data now represents about half of our total consumer revenues. That's right. Our Consumer Wireline business now has over half of its revenues from IP data. 
And strategic business services had almost 20% revenue growth. It's best performance in 6 quarters, driving sequentially stable business Wireline revenues even without significant economic recovery.
With that quick overview, let's take a look at detailed results starting on Slide 6. Consolidated revenues totaled $31.5 billion, up $687 million versus the second quarter a year ago, due to continued strong mobile broadband growth, U-verse revenue growth of more than 50% and increasing stability in Wireline business revenues with strategic business service revenues growing almost 20%. As you know, these growth areas are driving our revenue mix to Wireless and Wireline Data and managed services. In the second quarter, 76% of our revenues came from these next-generation services. That's up from 71% a year ago and 66% just 2 years ago. Revenues from these areas were up more than 8% or $1.8 billion in the second quarter. We expect this mix shift to continue, giving us even stronger confidence in the long-term view of our business.
Now let's look at Wireless, and starting on Slide 7. Our focus on mobile broadband continues to drive impressive revenue growth. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or 9.5%, and Wireless service revenues increased 7.4%, up nearly $1 billion versus the second quarter a year ago. This was driven by subscriber gains and strong adoption of data plans. Data continued to drive our postpaid ARPU gain. We now have an industry-leading 10 straight quarters of growth, up 2%, and we continue to bring more subscribers onto our network with tiered data plans. In just 1 year, we've added more than 15 million subscribers on tiered plans. 
As I mentioned, we had subscriber gains across the board in every customer category with 1.1 million net adds. The stats are on Slide 8. We had solid postpaid numbers, adding 331,000 during the quarter. And when you exclude the impact of the Alltel integration, our postpaid net adds were more than 500,000. In prepaid, we had 137,000 net adds, but that number grows to 186,000 when excluding the integration impact from Alltel with continued strength in tablet activations. And we also had another solid reseller and connected device quarter, adding 248,000 and 379,000 subscribers, respectively. Helping drive subscriber growth was our ability to keep churn in check. Excluding Alltel migration impacts, postpaid churn was relatively stable with year-ago numbers and improved from the first quarter of the year. Additionally, iPhone churn by itself improved sequentially, and iPhone sales increased year-over-year. That means high-quality customers, both new and existing ones, continue to choose AT&T. They know our network advantages, the ability to use voice and data simultaneously, the nation's fastest mobile broadband network and international roaming to 224 countries, thanks to our GSM network. All of this makes a big difference to our customers, and you see that in this quarter's results.
You can see the benefits of smartphone and branded computing device sales in our Wireless data results, which are on Slide 9. We grew data revenues more than 23%. That's up more than $1 billion year-over-year. We had another record quarter with smartphone sales, 5.6 million units, both upgrades and new subscribers, our best second quarter ever. Smartphone subscribers now make up half of our postpaid subscriber base, up from just 36% a year ago. And we expect that percentage to continue to grow as nearly 70% of postpaid sales during this past quarter were smartphone sales. 
Breaking that down a little further, we had 3.6 million iPhone activations during the quarter, up about 11% from the second quarter a year ago when the iPhone 4 was first introduced near the end of June. An impressive performance in this first quarter where exclusivity no longer exists. But our strongest growth was with other smartphones BlackBerries, Androids and other devices where we sold nearly 2.3 million devices during the second quarter. That's more than twice as many as we added in the second quarter of 2010. 
ARPU for smartphones continues to be strong, 1.8x our other devices with more than 85% on family or business plans, and these customers tend to be sticky with churn below our average. We also had our best quarter ever with branded computing devices adding 545,000 this quarter to reach 4 million. As you might expect, strong smartphone sales are having an impact on margins. While these devices tend to have a higher subsidies, the customers they attract have higher ARPUs and lower churn. The details are on Slide 10. So far this year, we've exceeded our expectations and already had back-to-back record quarters in smartphone sales. But even with our strong smartphone sales, we were able to expand Wireless service margins sequentially. 
In the second quarter, we had 1.7 million more smartphone sales then we did in the year-ago quarter and up slightly sequentially yet our Wireless EBITDA service margins expanded from the first quarter. And when you exclude Alltel integration costs, service margins were 42%. You see that on our Wireless operating income, which was up more than 6% sequentially to reach $4.2 billion. Looking ahead, we expect smartphone sales to continue to be strong through the rest of the year especially when you consider the new products and services that'll be out, our LTE launch and holiday sales. 
That concludes our Wireless results. Now before we get to our Wireline results, I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's General Counsel, Wayne Watts, to give us a brief update on the AT&T, T-Mobile merger approval process. Wayne?"

I appreciate the opportunity to be with you, and I'll be brief. Let's take a look at Slide 11. We remain comfortable with the process so far and the pace at which we're moving. The staff at the Department of Ju",519,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to be with you, and I'll be brief. Let's take a look at Slide 11. We remain comfortable with the process so far and the pace at which we're moving. The staff at the Department of Justice and the SEC, the 2 federal agencies that must approve the transaction, are working extremely hard. They're asking all the right questions. We, of course, take each issue and question identified very seriously and respond quickly and thoroughly as we see this process through. 
In fact, in response to questions, we have developed a very detailed engineering and economic analysis valuing the enormous efficiencies that will result from the combination of the AT&T and T-Mobile networks. We've revealed to the agencies the results of the analysis and the magnitude of the efficiencies. The SEC has now indicated it wants time to fully evaluate and validate these results and has stopped their 180-day clock to allow them to do so. In light of the significance of these efficiencies, it is important to us that the SEC validates this information as they continue their review, and we look forward to working with them to do so. 
We said when we announced this transaction that our confidence in our ability to obtain approval is based on the facts. And while we still have work to do, we remain very confident that we can satisfy the DOJ and FCC that this transaction should be and ultimately will be approved. Those facts, including the enormous efficiencies we can realize from this merger, demonstrate that this is the surest and fastest way to address the unique network capacity constraints and spectrum shortages faced by AT&T. The facts also demonstrate that the consumer and public interest benefits are enormous. These include better service in the form of fewer dropped calls, faster speeds and a better overall customer experience, more mobile broadband access for more Americans by expanding our 4G LTE deployment to more than 97% of the U.S. population. Some 55 million more people will receive LTE coverage in America than would have occurred without this merger. And billions of dollars of increased investments in the U.S. economy, which drives more jobs and economic growth. 
These benefits are widely recognized and have led to the broad diverse groups voicing support for the approval of the merger. Those backing this transaction include governors in 26 states, representing 150 million Americans, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, numerous elected officials at the state and local level, labor unions representing more than 20 million workers, groups representing rural and diverse constituents. And perhaps most telling is the support from the high-tech community. They understand the importance of this transaction and what it means for the continued innovation, growth and prosperity of both of our industries. 
Looking ahead, we'll continue to be responsive to those reviewing the merger. Based on the facts and the law, we remain confident we will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner. 
John, that concludes my update, and I'll turn it back to you."
100231,134534185,143821,"AT&T, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wayne. Now let's talk about our Wireline business. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing several positive trends here. Let me start with our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. The first positive, thanks to the strength of our U-verse busi",1061,"Thanks, Wayne. Now let's talk about our Wireline business. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing several positive trends here. Let me start with our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. The first positive, thanks to the strength of our U-verse business, IP data now makes up half of our consumer revenue. U-verse has transformed our Consumer business. We've done an outstanding job of scaling this business from scratch just a few years ago to an annualized $6.5 billion business today. And it's growing at a 57% clip year-over-year. This has helped stabilize Wireline Consumer revenues, which grew for the fourth consecutive quarter. And as we scale U-verse, margins will continue to improve, contributing to profitability. 
During this quarter we had a 202,000 U-verse subscribers to reach 3.4 customers and service. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates also remained solid. More than 3/4 of our U-verse video subscribers have a triple- or quad-play bundle with us. ARPU for these customers now reaches $170, up more than 8% year-over-year. Penetration rates continue to grow in areas marketed to for more than 36 months, we've reached 25% penetration. And we now past 29 million living units and are on track to complete our U-verse build by the end of the year. 
We are also U-verse high-speed data have a positive impact in the small-business space. Our U-verse broadband net adds were more than twice our TV additions, with much of the difference being new U-verse small business subscribers. Faster broadband speeds and mobility is a combination small-business customers are looking for, and AT&T's strength in both areas is a competitive advantage for us. 
We are also seeing improving trends with our Wireline business customers, which you can see on Slide 13. Pressures from the lack of business formation and weak economic and employment growth continue. With that said, the revenue trends are showing some positive signs. As you can see in our results, we were essentially flat sequentially, and we remain optimistic that we will soon see growth.
Business service revenues were down 3.9% year-over-year on a reported basis. But when you adjust for last year's sales of assets in Japan, revenues were down just 3.2%. That's the best performance in over 4 quarters. And while businesses continue to work their way through the economic downturn, they are still investing in services that help drive productivity and efficiency. We see this in strong IP data growth. We also see it in continued strong growth of our strategic business services, which is now a $5 billion annual revenue stream, growing at close to 20% year-over-year. So we are seeing some encouraging signs. 
In our global Enterprise operation, there are strong growth in IP data, outsourcing and integration services. Ethernet is driving sequential growth at wholesale, and Wireless bundles and improving trends in broadband are helping in the small-business segment. These results combined with continued solid execution on the cost side have helped drive improvements in margins. 
Now let's look at margins and cash flow on Slide 14. For the second quarter, consolidated margins were up sequentially and stable from a year ago at 19.6%. These results were achieved with pressure from a couple of areas: the completion of the Alltel integration, the storm-related costs and a record second quarter smartphone sales. In Wireline, our operating income margin was 13.1% in the second quarter, essentially flat from the second quarter last year, but up 160 basis points sequentially. 
Improving revenue trends and our focus on cost initiatives throughout the company help to offset pressure from declines in voice revenues. Our One AT&T initiatives continue to do well. We continue to target cost efficiencies and simplify product offerings to deliver best-in-class services while also achieving cost savings. We still see a lot of opportunity here as we move forward.
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 15. In the first half of the year, cash from operations and working capital initiatives totaled $16.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $9.5 billion with a 29% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital to reach $4.4 billion. Wireless capital includes work with our LTE build, which is on track to be launched later this summer. And as noted in our earnings release, we're slightly increasing our guidance for full year capital investments. We now anticipate capital expenditures in the $20 billion range as we continue to invest in our Wireless network. Even with this increasing capital spending, we still expect free cash flow growth year-over-year, and we're not changing that guidance. 
For the first 6 months of the year, free cash flow before dividends was $7.3 billion, and dividend payments totaled $5.1 billion. In terms of uses of cash, debt is down almost $3.4 billion over the past 12 months and our debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.48. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet give us the flexibility to retire debt as it comes due to invest in the business, including funding the T-Mobile acquisition and to continue to return substantial value to shareholders through dividends.
Let me close on Slide 16 with a quick recap and a look ahead to the second half of the year. First, revenue trends are moving in the right direction. Continued strong Wireless growth, IP data driving stability in Wireline results, both of these helping expand margins sequentially in both businesses. Second, Wireless continues to exceed expectations. Record smartphone growth and strong branded computing device sales drove our net adds, stable churn and increasing postpaid ARPU right in our outlook for our full year. Our plans to launch 4G LTE service this summer remain on track providing more opportunity for us. And as Wayne mentioned, the T-Mobile review process continues to move forward. And third, the transformation of our Wireline business is driving positive revenue trends with year-over-year consumer growth and relatively flat sequential business revenues. These results add to our financial strength and our sound balance sheet. 
In summary, we had a solid quarter, which adds to our confidence as we head into the second half. We expect continued solid results as we focus on executing on our strategy and growing our business. And we are excited about the industry's potential and about our position for long-term growth. 
Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're ready for the Q&A."

And certainly, that's how our team is looking at it. And as you point out appropriately, we've had some great sales. And depending upon the volumes exceed where we've at today, that will pressure margins. But quite frankly, we've had great sales already, and we're at the 42% level that you referenced. So that I think is a good starting point. I think, Mike, we'll pass and give the details on any of that information. And I'll leave it to Brooks' team to distribute that information as appropriate."

It is providing some benefit for us in our decisions to invest in capital. While we've got great demands on our Mobility network and great customer adds, it is an appropriate time to make those investments because of the bonus depreciation. Also we're trying to take all things into account making those decisions. I view it this way. Yes, depreciation is something and depreciation rules are something that even out over time. But we continue to focus on cash strategies at the company. And if you look at my 12/31/10 financial statements, my annual report, you'll see that even though we had significant bonus depreciation over the last 3 years, our deferred tax liabilities actually went down fairly significantly. So we managed that tax liability from all aspects of our business, but you're right. The bonus depreciation does level out over time, and we see that in, quite frankly, in the '13 and years after viewpoint."

I view it as our business units sold a lot more phones and was real successful in the business, and the volumes of use by our customers is greater than we expected. So we're making the investments today so that we can provide them the best quality of service. Traditionally, I will tell you that because of the current environment, the bonus depreciation rules, it makes it economically from a cash flow perspective better to do it today than maybe wait till next year. So we're just trying to be prudent with our shareholders' money and have that opportunity that was provided by the economic recovery legislation and utilizing it. That's really how we view it and really focus on the customer, making sure they get the best service. With regard to text messaging, it's just a really different set of facts for us. First of all, we have bundled plans that tie text messaging into our voice and Data Services. We have unlimited texting plans that are very attractive. We just have a much different economic situation that doesn't easily invite anybody to come in and try to interrupt that revenue flow that's coming to us. Particularly, we have a postpaid contract environment where we provide subsidies on the phones, and customers come to us because we do, do that. And while it does generate some issues with regard to our margins, it also provides us a tie into the customers that allows us to manage through some of those issues that you're referring to. So we monitor it real closely. We keep our eye on that revenue stream because it is important to us, but I do believe we're much different than many of the stores that are coming out of the European markets for the texting issue."

Additionally, because we're in this unique position of owners economics on a business is that touches not only Wireless, but Wireline Consumer and Wireline Enterprise, we feel like we're pretty uniquely positioned to utilize those data devices with our Enterprise customers providing their employees mobility opportunities. So we're excited about it. We look forward to it, and we have seen some growth in this quarter better than we've had in the past. With regard to broadband, the critical issue for me is while we did perform better in this second quarter than we did last year, we did have about 12,000, 14,000 loss of customers. But the reality of it is we had over 400,000 customers convert from DSL to higher-speed U-verse-type broadband. That includes some small-business customers.

With regard to the ARPU issue, remember much of the increase in the penetration is from existing customers. So generally speaking, when they go from a non-smartphone to a smartphone, their ARPUs whether they're above the average or below the average are going up. And so they're going to that maybe only incrementally, but they are going up and so they're going to be positive towards that postpaid ARPU average growth because they're coming out of a quick messaging devices or whatever moving up the chain.

I want to take a moment just again to tell you thank you very much for taking part of the call, and let me close by highlighting a few key points. First, we delivered another strong Wireless quarter in a very competitive environment led by our mobile broadband strategy. We had record mobile broadband sales, smartphones and data-only devices and solid revenue growth and our 10th consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU growth. And as you heard from Wayne, we are comfortable with the progress of the T-Mobile merger transaction, and we remain confident of its approval. Second, we continue to see encouraging signs in our Wireline business as we transform it from voice to next-generation IP Data business. Revenue trends continue to improve, and U-verse is leading continued consumer year-over-year growth. Strategic business services are driving improvements in business trends. And third, we had solid financial results and strong cash flows, which allow us to continue to invest in our growth platforms and to return significant value to our shareholders. This gives us good momentum going into the back half of the year and makes us optimistic about our future. Once again, my sincere thanks for being on the call today, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good day."

And joining me on the call today are John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer; and Wayne Watts, AT&T's General Counsel. John will cover our results, and Wayne will give us an update on the AT&T, T-Mobile merger process, then we'll follow with Qs and As.
Let me remind you that our release, investor briefing, supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, that's www.att.com/investor.relations.
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3. And that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of the factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this presentation based on new information or otherwise.
This presentation may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are also available on our website. And again, that's at www.att.com/investor.relations.
Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 4. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60, consistent with last year's EPS before a onetime gain, and up more than 5% sequentially. Our reported EPS this quarter includes $0.02 of pressure from Alltel integration costs and storm costs in the Southeast and Missouri. As we mentioned earlier this year, Alltel integration costs impact margins, Wireless churn and subscriber numbers. After this quarter, these impacts will be largely behind us. 
The fundamental trends in our business continue to be quite solid. Consolidated revenue continues to grow for the sixth quarter in a row, up 2.2% year-over-year thanks to strength in mobile broadband, U-verse and advanced business offerings. Even with another quarter of record smartphone sales, our consolidated operating margin remained relatively stable with the prior year and was up sequentially. Cash flow continues to be strong, with cash from operating activities for the quarter totaling $9 billion and free cash flow of $3.7 billion. 
With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?"

It's great to have you with us today. Much of the public discussion of late has centered on our planned acquisition of T-Mobile USA, and AT&T's General Counsel, Wayne Watts, will be along in just a minute to provide an update on the approval process. But while that has been going on, we have done an excellent job in executing on our strategies and growing the business. 
Let me share a few highlights that are on Slide 5. Consolidated revenues were up year-over-year and sequentially, led by strong Wireless growth and increasing stability in our Wireline revenues. Earnings were solid even when including Alltel integration and storm-related costs. Margins expanded sequentially across the board, Wireless, Wireline and total, and were generally stable from a year ago. Free cash flow was strong, and we continue to expect growth for the year.
Driving these financial results was another incredible quarter in mobile broadband. Smartphone sales set another quarterly record. Postpaid ARPU grew for the 10th consecutive quarter, a record unmatched in the industry. Mobile data growth remains strong and is now an annualized $22 billion revenue stream. We also had solid net adds, with growth in every subscriber category, including having our best quarter yet in branded computing devices. And our Wireline business is showing signs that it soon will be growing again. 
U-verse continues to be strong, adding subscribers, increasing triple-play ARPU and is now a $6.5 billion annualized revenue stream. In fact, fast-growing consumer IP data now represents about half of our total consumer revenues. That's right. Our Consumer Wireline business now has over half of its revenues from IP data. 
And strategic business services had almost 20% revenue growth. It's best performance in 6 quarters, driving sequentially stable business Wireline revenues even without significant economic recovery.
With that quick overview, let's take a look at detailed results starting on Slide 6. Consolidated revenues totaled $31.5 billion, up $687 million versus the second quarter a year ago due to continued strong mobile broadband growth, U-verse revenue growth of more than 50% and increasing stability in Wireline business revenues with strategic business service revenues growing almost 20%. 
As you know, these growth areas are driving our revenue mix to Wireless and Wireline Data and managed services. In the second quarter, 76% of our revenues came from these next-generation services. That's up from 71% a year ago and 66% just 2 years ago. Revenues from these areas were up more than 8% or $1.8 billion in the second quarter. We expect this mix shift to continue, giving us even stronger confidence in the long-term view of our business.
Now let's look at Wireless, starting on Slide 7. Our focus on mobile broadband continues to drive impressive revenue growth. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or 9.5%, and Wireless service revenues increased 7.4%, up nearly $1 billion versus the second quarter a year ago. This was driven by subscriber gains and strong adoption of data plans. 
Data continued to drive our postpaid ARPU gain. We now have an industry-leading 10 straight quarters of growth, up 2%, and we continue to bring more subscribers onto our network with tiered data plans. In just 1 year, we've added more than 15 million subscribers on tiered plans. 
As I mentioned, we had subscriber gains across the board in every customer category with 1.1 million net adds. The stats are on Slide 8. We had solid postpaid numbers, adding 331,000 during the quarter. And when you exclude the impact of the Alltel integration, our postpaid net adds were more than 500,000. In prepaid, we had 137,000 net adds, but that number grows to 186,000 when excluding the integration impact from Alltel, with continued strength in tablet activations. And we also had another solid reseller and connected device quarter, adding 248,000 and 379,000 subscribers, respectively. 
Helping drive subscriber growth was our ability to keep churn in check. Excluding Alltel migration impacts, postpaid churn was relatively stable with year-ago numbers and improved from the first quarter of the year. Additionally, iPhone churn by itself improved sequentially and iPhone sales increased year-over-year. That means high-quality customers, both new and existing ones, continue to choose AT&T. They know our network advantages, the ability to use voice and data simultaneously, the nation's fastest mobile broadband network and international roaming to 224 countries, thanks to our GSM network. All of this makes a big difference to our customers, and you see that in this quarter's results.
You can see the benefit of smartphone and branded computing device sales in our Wireless data results, which are on Slide 9. We grew data revenues more than 23%. That's up more than $1 billion year-over-year. We had another record quarter with smartphone sales, 5.6 million units, both upgrades and new subscribers, our best second quarter ever. Smartphone subscribers now make up half of our postpaid subscriber base, up from just 36% a year ago. And we expect that percentage to continue to grow as nearly 70% of postpaid sales during this past quarter were smartphone sales. 
Breaking that down a little further, we had 3.6 million iPhone activations during the quarter, up about 11% from the second quarter a year ago when the iPhone 4 was first introduced near the end of June. An impressive performance in this first quarter where exclusivity no longer exists. But our strongest growth was with other smartphones, BlackBerries, Androids and other devices, where we sold nearly 2.3 million devices during the second quarter. That's more than twice as many as we added in the second quarter of 2010. 
ARPU for smartphones continues to be strong, 1.8x our other devices, with more than 85% on family or business plans. And these customers tend to be sticky, with churn below our average. We also had our best quarter ever with branded computing devices, adding 545,000 this quarter to reach 4 million. 
As you might expect, strong smartphone sales are having an impact on margins. While these devices tend to have a higher subsidies, the customers they attract have higher ARPUs and lower churn. The details are on Slide 10. So far this year, we've exceeded our expectations and already had back-to-back record quarters in smartphone sales. 
But even with our strong smartphone sales, we were able to expand Wireless service margins sequentially. In the second quarter, we had 1.7 million more smartphone sales then we did in the year-ago quarter and up slightly sequentially, yet our Wireless EBITDA service margins expanded from the first quarter. And when you exclude Alltel integration cost, service margins were 42%. You see that on our Wireless operating income, which was up more than 6% sequentially to reach $4.2 billion. Looking ahead, we expect smartphone sales to continue to be strong through the rest of the year, especially when you consider the new products and services that will be out, our LTE launch and holiday sales. 
That concludes our Wireless results. Now before we get to our Wireline results, I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's General Counsel, Wayne Watts, to give us a brief update on the AT&T, T-Mobile merger approval process. Wayne?"

We remain comfortable with the process so far and the pace at which we're moving. The staffs at the Department of Justice and the FCC, the 2 federal agencies that must approve the transaction, are working extremely hard. 
They're asking all the right questions. We, of course, take each issue and question identified very seriously and respond quickly and thoroughly as we see this process through. In fact, in response to questions, we have developed a very detailed engineering and economic analysis valuing the enormous efficiencies that will result from the combination of the AT&T and T-Mobile networks. We have revealed to the agencies the results of the analysis and the magnitude of the efficiencies. 
The FCC has now indicated it wants time to fully evaluate and validate these results and has stopped their 180-day clock to allow them to do so. In light of the significance of these efficiencies, it is important to us that the FCC validates this information as they continue their review, and we look forward to working with them to do so. 
We said when we announced this transaction that our confidence in our ability to obtain approval is based on the facts. And while we still have work to do, we remain very confident that we can satisfy the DOJ and FCC, that this transaction should be and ultimately will be approved. Those facts, including the enormous efficiencies we can realize from this merger, demonstrate that this is the surest and fastest way to address the unique network capacity constraints and spectrum shortages faced by AT&T. 
The facts also demonstrate that the consumer and public interest benefits are enormous. These include better service in the form of fewer dropped calls, faster speeds and a better overall customer experience, more mobile broadband access for more Americans. By expanding our 4G LTE deployment to more than 97% of the U.S. population, some 55 million more people will receive LTE coverage in America than would have occurred without this merger. And billions of dollars of increased investments in the U.S. economy, which drives more jobs and economic growth. 
These benefits are widely recognized and have led to the broad, diverse groups voicing support for the approval of the merger. Those backing this transaction include governors in 26 states, representing 150 million Americans, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, numerous elected officials at the state and local level, labor unions representing more than 20 million workers, groups representing rural and diverse constituents. And perhaps most telling is the support from the high-tech community. They understand the importance of this transaction and what it means for the continued innovation, growth and prosperity of both of our industries. 
Looking ahead, we'll continue to be responsive to those reviewing the merger. Based on the facts and the law, we remain confident we will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner. 
John, that concludes my update, and I'm turn it back to you."

As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing several positive trends here. Let me start with our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. The first positive, thanks to the strength of our U-verse busi",1067,"Thanks, Wayne. Now let's talk about our Wireline business. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing several positive trends here. Let me start with our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. The first positive, thanks to the strength of our U-verse business, IP data now makes up half of our consumer revenue. U-verse has transformed our Consumer business. We have done an outstanding job of scaling this business from scratch just a few years ago to an annualized $6.5 billion business today. And it's growing at a 57% clip year-over-year. This has helped stabilize Wireline Consumer revenues, which grew for the fourth consecutive quarter. And as we scale U-verse, margins will continue to improve, contributing to profitability. 
During this quarter, we added 202,000 U-verse subscribers to reach 3.4 million customers in service. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rate also remains solid. More than 3/4 of our U-verse video subscribers have a triple- or quad-play bundle with us. ARPU for these customers now reaches $170, up more than 8% year-over-year. 
Penetration rates continue to grow. In areas marketed to for more than 36 months, we've reached 25% penetration. And we now passed 29 million living units and are on track to complete our U-verse build by the end of the year. 
We are also beginning to see U-verse high-speed data have a positive impact in the small business space. Our U-verse broadband net adds were more than twice our TV additions, with much of the difference being new U-verse small business subscribers. Faster broadband speeds and mobility is a combination small business customers are looking for, and AT&T's strength in both areas is a competitive advantage for us.
We're also seeing improving trends with our Wireline business customers, which you can see on Slide 13. Pressures from the lack of business formation and weak economic and employment growth continue. With that said, the revenue trends are showing some positive signs. As you can see in our results, we were essentially flat sequentially, and we remain optimistic that we will soon see growth.
Business service revenues were down 3.9% year-over-year on a reported basis. But when you adjust for last year's sales of assets in Japan, revenues were down just 3.2%. That's the best performance in over 4 quarters. And while businesses continue to work their way through the economic downturn, they are still investing in services that help drive productivity and efficiency. We see this in strong IP data growth. We also see it in continued strong growth of our strategic business services, which is now a $5 billion annual revenue stream, growing at close to 20% year-over-year. So we are seeing some encouraging signs. 
In our global enterprise operation, there is strong growth in IP data, outsourcing and integration services. Ethernet is driving sequential growth at wholesale, and wireless bundles and improving trends in broadband are helping in the small business segment. These results, combined with continued solid execution on the cost side, have helped drive improvements in margins. 
Now let's look at margins and cash flow on Slide 14. For the second quarter, consolidated margins were up sequentially and stable from a year ago at 19.6%. These results were achieved with pressure from a couple of areas: the completion of the Alltel integration, the storm-related costs and a record second quarter smartphone sales. In Wireline, our operating income margin was 13.1% in the second quarter, essentially flat from the second quarter last year, but up 160 basis points sequentially. 
Improving revenue trends and our focus on cost initiatives throughout the company helped offset pressure from declines in voice revenues. Our One AT&T initiatives continue to do well. We continue to target cost efficiencies and simplify product offerings to deliver best-in-class services while also achieving cost savings. We still see a lot of opportunity here as we move forward.
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 15. In the first half of the year, cash from operations and working capital initiatives totaled $16.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $9.5 billion, with a 29% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital to reach $4.4 billion. Wireless capital includes work with our LTE build, which is on track to be launched later this summer. And as noted in our earnings release, we're slightly increasing our guidance for full year capital investments. We now anticipate capital expenditures in the $20 billion range as we continue to invest in our wireless network. 
Even with this increase in capital spending, we still expect free cash flow growth year-over-year, and we're not changing that guidance. For the first 6 months of the year, free cash flow before dividends was $7.3 billion, and dividend payments totaled $5.1 billion. In terms of uses of cash, debt is down almost $3.4 billion over the past 12 months, and our debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.48. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet give us the flexibility to retire debt as it comes due, to invest in the business, including funding the T-Mobile acquisition, and to continue to return substantial value to shareholders through dividends.
Let me close on Slide 16 with a quick recap and a look ahead to the second half of the year. First, revenue trends are moving in the right direction. Continued strong Wireless growth, IP data driving stability in Wireline results, both of these helping expand margins sequentially in both businesses. 
Second, Wireless continues to exceed expectations. Record smartphone growth and strong branded computing device sales drove our net adds. Stable churn and increasing postpaid ARPU brighten our outlook for our full year. Our plans to launch 4G LTE service this summer remain on track, providing even more opportunity for us. And as Wayne mentioned, the T-Mobile review process continues to move forward. 
And third, the transformation of our Wireline business is driving positive revenue trends with year-over-year consumer growth and relatively flat sequential business revenues. These results add to our financial strength and our sound balance sheet. 
In summary, we had a solid quarter which adds to our confidence as we head into the second half. We expect continued solid results as we focus on executing on our strategy and growing our business. And we are excited about the industry's potential and about our position for long-term growth. 
Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're ready for the Q&A."

Are we getting close to the point where if you look at the totality of the activity, the dollars that you spend on replacement start to peak out, and so that then becomes maybe a source of future margin expansion at some time down the road? Or is this something that just as the activity of your subscribers continues to pick up, that we just have to build into the business case for the Wireless segment?"

While we've got great demands on our mobility network and great customer adds, it is an appropriate time to make those investments because of the bonus depreciation rules, so we're trying to take all things into account in making those decisions. I view it this way. Yes, depreciation is something, and these bonus depreciation rules are something that even out over time. But we continue to focus on cash strategies at the company. And if you look at my 12/31/10 financial statements, my annual report, you'll see that even though we had significant bonus depreciation over the last 3 years, our deferred tax liabilities actually went down fairly significantly.

I view it as our business unit's sold a lot more phones and was real successful in the business and the volumes of use by our customers is greater than we expected. So we're making the investments today so that we can provide them the best quality service. Additionally, I will tell you that because of the current environment, the bonus depreciation rules, it makes it economically, from a cash flow perspective, better to do it today than maybe wait till next year. So we're just trying to be prudent with the shareholders' money and have that opportunity that was provided by the economic recovery legislation and utilizing it. That's really how we view it. And really focused on the customer, making sure they get the best service. With regard to text messaging, it's just a really different set of facts for us. First of all, we have bundled plans that tie text messaging into our voice and data services. We have unlimited texting plans that are very attractive. We just have a much different economic situation that doesn't easily invite anybody to come in and try to interrupt that revenue flow that's coming to us. Particularly, we have a postpaid contract environment where we provide subsidies on the phones, and customers come to us because we do, do that. And while it does generate some issues with regard to our margins, it also provides us a tie into the customers that allows us to manage through some of those issues that you're referring to. So we monitor it real closely. We keep our eye on that revenue stream because it is important to us, but I do believe we're much different than many of the stories that are coming out of the European market for the texting issue."

I think we're going to wrap it up here. I want to take a moment just again to tell you thank you very much for taking part of the call. 
And let me close by highlighting a few key points. First, we delivered another strong Wireless quarter in a very competitive environment, led by our mobile broadband strategy. We had record mobile broadband sales, smartphones and data-only devices, had solid revenue growth and our 10th consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU growth. And as you heard from Wayne, we are comfortable with the progress of the T-Mobile merger transaction, and we remain confident of its approval. 
Second, we continue to see encouraging signs in our Wireline business as we transform it from voice to next-generation IP data business. Revenue trends continue to improve, and U-verse is leading continued consumer year-over-year growth. Strategic business services are driving improvements in business trends. 
And third, we had solid financial results and strong cash flows which allow us to continue to invest in our growth platforms and to return significant value to our shareholders. This gives us good momentum going into the back half of the year and makes us optimistic about our future. 
Once again, my sincere thanks for being on the call today. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good day."

Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 4. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60, consistent with last year's EPS before a onetime gain, and up more than 5% sequentially. Our reported EPS this quarter includes $0.02 of pressure from Alltel integration costs and storm costs in the Southeast and Missouri. As we mentioned earlier this year, Alltel integration costs impact margins, Wireless churn and subscriber numbers. After this quarter, these impacts will be largely behind us. 
The fundamental trends in our business continue to be quite solid. Consolidated revenue continues to grow for the sixth quarter in a row, up 2.2% year-over-year thanks to strength in mobile broadband, U-verse and advanced business offerings. Even with another quarter of record smartphone sales, our consolidated operating margin remained relatively stable with the prior year and was up sequentially. Cash flow continues to be strong, with cash from operating activities for the quarter totaling $9 billion and free cash flow of $3.7 billion. 
With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?"

It's great to have you with us today. Much of the public discussion of late has centered on our planned acquisition of T-Mobile USA, and AT&T's General Counsel, Wayne Watts, will be along in just a minute to provide an update on the approval process. But while that has been going on, we have done an excellent job in executing on our strategies and growing the business. 
Let me share a few highlights that are on Slide 5. Consolidated revenues were up year-over-year and sequentially, led by strong Wireless growth and increasing stability in our Wireline revenues. Earnings were solid even when including Alltel integration and storm-related costs. Margins expanded sequentially across the board, Wireless, Wireline and total, and were generally stable from a year ago. Free cash flow was strong, and we continue to expect growth for the year.
Driving these financial results was another incredible quarter in mobile broadband. Smartphone sales set another quarterly record. Postpaid ARPU grew for the 10th consecutive quarter, a record unmatched in the industry. Mobile data growth remained strong and is now an annualized $22 billion revenue stream. We also had solid net adds, with growth in every subscriber category, including having our best quarter yet in branded computing devices. And our Wireline business is showing signs that it soon will be growing again. 
U-verse continues to be strong, adding subscribers, increasing triple-play ARPU and is now a $6.5 billion annualized revenue stream. In fact, fast-growing consumer IP data now represents about half of our total consumer revenues. That's right. Our Consumer Wireline business now has over half of its revenues from IP data. 
And strategic business services had almost 20% revenue growth, its best performance in 6 quarters, driving sequentially stable business Wireline revenues even without significant economic recovery.
With that quick overview, let's take a look at detailed results starting on Slide 6. Consolidated revenues totaled $31.5 billion, up $687 million versus the second quarter a year ago due to continued strong mobile broadband growth, U-verse revenue growth of more than 50% and increasing stability in Wireline business revenues with strategic business service revenues growing almost 20%. 
As you know, these growth areas are driving our revenue mix to Wireless and Wireline Data and managed services. In the second quarter, 76% of our revenues came from these next-generation services [ph]. That's up from 71% a year ago and 66% just 2 years ago. Revenues from these areas were up more than 8% or $1.8 billion in the second quarter. We expect this mix shift to continue, giving us even stronger confidence in the long-term view of our business.
Now let's look at Wireless, starting on Slide 7. Our focus on mobile broadband continues to drive impressive revenue growth. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.4 billion or 9.5%, and Wireless service revenues increased 7.4%, up nearly $1 billion versus the second quarter a year ago. This was driven by subscriber gains and strong adoption of data plans. 
Data continued to drive our postpaid ARPU gain. We now have an industry-leading 10 straight quarters of growth, up 2%, and we continue to bring more subscribers onto our network with tiered data plans. In just 1 year, we've added more than 15 million subscribers on tiered plans. 
As I mentioned, we had subscriber gains across the board in every customer category, with 1.1 million net adds. The stats are on Slide 8. We had solid postpaid numbers, adding 331,000 during the quarter. And when you exclude the impact of the Alltel integration, our postpaid net adds were more than 500,000. In prepaid, we had 137,000 net adds, but that number grows to 186,000 when excluding the integration impact from Alltel, with continued strength in tablet activations. And we also had another solid reseller and connected device quarter, adding 248,000 and 379,000 subscribers, respectively. 
Helping drive subscriber growth was our ability to keep churn in check. Excluding Alltel migration impacts, postpaid churn was relatively stable with year-ago numbers and improved from the first quarter of the year. Additionally, iPhone churn by itself improved sequentially, and iPhone sales increased year-over-year. That means high-quality customers, both new and existing ones, continue to choose AT&T. They know our network advantages, the ability to use voice and data simultaneously, the nation's fastest mobile broadband network and international roaming to 224 countries, thanks to our GSM network. All this makes a big difference to our customers, and you see that in this quarter's results.
You can see the benefit of smartphone and branded computing device sales in our Wireless data results, which are on Slide 9. We grew data revenues more than 23%. That's up more than $1 billion year-over-year. We had another record quarter with smartphone sales, 5.6 million units, both upgrades and new subscribers, our best second quarter ever. The smartphone subscribers now make up half of our postpaid subscriber base, up from just 36% a year ago. And we expect that percentage to continue to grow as nearly 70% of postpaid sales during this past quarter were smartphone sales. 
Breaking that down a little further, we had 3.6 million iPhone activations during the quarter, up about 11% from the second quarter a year ago when the iPhone 4 was first introduced near the end of June. An impressive performance in this first quarter where exclusivity no longer exists. But our strongest growth was with other smartphones, BlackBerries, Androids and other devices, where we sold nearly 2.3 million devices during the second quarter. That's more than twice as many as we added in the second quarter of 2010. 
ARPU for smartphones continues to be strong, 1.8x our other devices, with more than 85% on family or business plans. And these customers tend to be sticky, with churn below our average. We also had our best quarter ever with branded computing devices, adding 545,000 this quarter to reach 4 million. 
As you might expect, strong smartphone sales are having an impact on margins. While these devices tend to have a higher subsidies, the customers they attract have higher ARPUs and lower churn. The details are on Slide 10. So far this year, we've exceeded our expectations and already had back-to-back record quarters in smartphone sales. 
But even with our strong smartphone sales, we were able to expand Wireless service margins sequentially. In the second quarter, we had 1.7 million more smartphone sales than we did in the year-ago quarter and up slightly sequentially, yet our Wireless EBITDA service margins expanded from the first quarter. And when you exclude Alltel integration costs, service margins were 42%. You see that on our Wireless operating income, which was up more than 6% sequentially to reach $4.2 billion. Looking ahead, we expect smartphone sales to continue to be strong through the rest of the year, especially when you consider the new products and services that'll be out, our LTE launch and holiday sales. 
That concludes our Wireless results. Now before we get to our Wireline results, I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's General Counsel, Wayne Watts, to give us a brief update on the AT&T, T-Mobile merger approval process. Wayne?"

We remain comfortable with the process so far and the pace at which we're moving. The staffs at the Department of Justice and the FCC, the 2 federal agencies that must approve the transaction, are working extremely hard. 
They're asking all the right questions. We, of course, take each issue and question identified very seriously and respond quickly and thoroughly as we see this process through. In fact, in response to questions, we have developed a very detailed engineering and economic analysis valuing the enormous efficiencies that will result from the combination of the AT&T and T-Mobile networks. We have revealed to the agencies the results of the analysis and the magnitude of the efficiencies. 
The FCC has now indicated it wants time to fully evaluate and validate these results and has stopped their 180-day clock to allow them to do so. In light of the significance of these efficiencies, it is important to us that the FCC validates this information as they continue their review, and we look forward to working with them to do so. 
We said when we announced this transaction that our confidence in our ability to obtain approval is based on the facts. And while we still have work to do, we remain very confident that we can satisfy the DOJ and FCC that this transaction should be and ultimately will be approved. Those facts, including the enormous efficiencies we can realize from this merger, demonstrate that this is the surest and fastest way to address the unique network capacity constraints and spectrum shortages faced by AT&T. 
The facts also demonstrate that the consumer and public interest benefits are enormous. These include better service in the form of fewer dropped calls, faster speeds and a better overall customer experience, more mobile broadband access for more Americans. By expanding our 4G LTE deployment to more than 97% of the U.S. population, some 55 million more people will receive LTE coverage in America than would have occurred without this merger. And billions of dollars of increased investments in the U.S. economy, which drives more jobs and economic growth. 
These benefits are widely recognized and have led to the broad, diverse groups voicing support for the approval of the merger. Those backing this transaction include governors in 26 states, representing 150 million Americans, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, numerous elected officials at the state and local level, labor unions representing more than 20 million workers, groups representing rural and diverse constituents. And perhaps most telling is the support from the high-tech community. They understand the importance of this transaction and what it means for the continued innovation, growth and prosperity of both of our industries. 
Looking ahead, we'll continue to be responsive to those reviewing the merger. Based on the facts and the law, we remain confident we will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner. 
John, that concludes my update, and I'm -- turn it back to you."
100231,134534185,144119,"AT&T, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wayne. Now let's talk about our Wireline business. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing several positive trends here. Let me start with our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. The first positive, thanks to the strength of our U-verse busi",1067,"Thanks, Wayne. Now let's talk about our Wireline business. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing several positive trends here. Let me start with our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. The first positive, thanks to the strength of our U-verse business, IP data now makes up half of our consumer revenue. U-verse has transformed our Consumer business. We have done an outstanding job of scaling this business from scratch just a few years ago to an annualized $6.5 billion business today. And it's growing at a 57% clip year-over-year. This has helped stabilize Wireline Consumer revenues, which grew for the fourth consecutive quarter. And as we scale U-verse, margins will continue to improve, contributing to profitability. 
During this quarter, we added 202,000 U-verse subscribers to reach 3.4 million customers in service. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates also remain solid. More than 3/4 of our U-verse video subscribers have a triple- or quad-play bundle with us. ARPU for these customers now reaches $170, up more than 8% year-over-year. 
Penetration rates continue to grow. In areas marketed to for more than 36 months, we've reached 25% penetration. And we now passed 29 million living units and are on track to complete our U-verse build by the end of the year. 
We are also beginning to see U-verse high-speed data have a positive impact in the small business space. Our U-verse broadband net adds were more than twice our TV additions, with much of the difference being new U-verse small business subscribers. Faster broadband speeds and mobility is a combination small business customers are looking for, and AT&T's strength in both areas is a competitive advantage for us.
We're also seeing improving trends with our Wireline business customers, which you can see on Slide 13. Pressures from a lack of business formation and weak economic and employment growth continue. With that said, the revenue trends are showing some positive signs. As you can see in our results, we were essentially flat sequentially, and we remain optimistic that we will soon see growth.
Business service revenues were down 3.9% year-over-year on a reported basis. But when you adjust for last year's sales of assets in Japan, revenues were down just 3.2%. That's the best performance in over 4 quarters. And while businesses continue to work their way through the economic downturn, they are still investing in services that help drive productivity and efficiency. We see this in strong IP data growth. We also see it in continued strong growth of our strategic business services, which is now a $5 billion annual revenue stream, growing at close to 20% year-over-year. So we are seeing some encouraging signs. 
In our global enterprise operation, there is strong growth in IP data, outsourcing and integration services. Ethernet is driving sequential growth at wholesale, and wireless bundles and improving trends in broadband are helping in the small business segment. These results, combined with continued solid execution on the cost side, have helped drive improvements in margins. 
Now let's look at margins and cash flow on Slide 14. For the second quarter, consolidated margins were up sequentially and stable from a year ago at 19.6%. These results were achieved with pressure from a couple of areas: the completion of the Alltel integration, the storm-related costs and a record second quarter smartphone sales. In Wireline, our operating income margin was 13.1% in the second quarter, essentially flat from the second quarter of last year, but up 160 basis points sequentially. 
Improving revenue trends and our focus on cost initiatives throughout the company helped offset pressure from declines in voice revenues. Our One AT&T initiatives continue to do well. We continue to target cost efficiencies and simplify product offerings to deliver best-in-class services while also achieving cost savings. We still see a lot of opportunity here as we move forward.
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 15. In the first half of the year, cash from operations and working capital initiatives totaled $16.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $9.5 billion, with a 29% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital to reach $4.4 billion. Wireless capital includes work with our LT [ph] build, which is on track to be launched later this summer. And as noted in our earnings release, we're slightly increasing our guidance for full year capital investments. We now anticipate capital expenditures in the $20 billion range as we continue to invest in our wireless network. 
Even with this increase in capital spending, we still expect free cash flow growth year-over-year, and we're not changing that guidance. For the first 6 months of the year, free cash flow before dividends was $7.3 billion, and dividend payments totaled $5.1 billion. In terms of uses of cash, debt is down almost $3.4 billion over the past 12 months, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.48. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet give us the flexibility to retire debt as it comes due, to invest in the business, including funding the T-Mobile acquisition, and to continue to return substantial value to shareholders through dividends.
Let me close on Slide 16 with a quick recap and a look ahead to the second half of the year. First, revenue trends are moving in the right direction. Continued strong Wireless growth, IP data driving stability in Wireline results, both of these helping expand margins sequentially in both businesses. 
Second, Wireless continues to exceed expectations. Record smartphone growth and strong branded computing device sales drove our net adds. Stable churn and increasing postpaid ARPU brighten our outlook for the full year. Our plans to launch 4G LTE service this summer remain on track, providing even more opportunity for us. And as Wayne mentioned, the T-Mobile review process continues to move forward. 
And third, the transformation of our Wireline business is driving positive revenue trends with year-over-year consumer growth and relatively flat sequential business revenues. These results add to our financial strength and our sound balance sheet. 
In summary, we had a solid quarter, which adds to our confidence as we head into the second half. We expect continued solid results as we focus on executing on our strategy and growing our business. And we are excited about the industry's potential and about our position for long-term growth.

And if you look at my 12/31/10 financial statements, my annual report, you'll see that even though we had significant bonus depreciation over the last 3 years, our deferred tax liabilities actually went down fairly significantly.

I view it as our business unit sold a lot more phones and was real successful in the business and the volumes of use by our customers is greater than we expected. So we're making the investments today so that we can provide them the best-quality service. Additionally, I will tell you that because of the current environment, the bonus depreciation rules, it makes it economically, from a cash flow perspective, better to do it today than maybe wait till next year. So we're just trying to be prudent with the shareholders' money and have that opportunity that was provided by the economic recovery legislation and utilizing it. That's really how we view it. And really focused on the customer, making sure they get the best service. With regard to text messaging, it's just a really different set of facts for us. First of all, we have bundled plans that tie text messaging into our voice and data services. We have unlimited texting plans that are very attractive. We just have a much different economic situation that doesn't easily invite anybody to come in and try to interrupt that revenue flow that's coming to us. Particularly, we have a postpaid contract environment where we provide subsidies on the phones, and customers come to us because we do, do that. And while it does generate some issues with regard to our margins, it also provides us a tie into the customers that allows us to manage through some of those issues that you're referring to. So we monitor it real closely.

Secondly, I would tell you that I think one of the ones -- opportunities we're most excited about is incorporating this, connecting it with our enterprise customers and working with the CIOs on all the different aspects of security and availability and so forth. And we're working -- we'll work hard to do that. That's an opportunity we're real excited about. But I will tell you, in this quarter, we did make progress. So I don't want that to be lost. I think it is important. I understand your commentary on, comments on long term, much greater opportunities. I don't disagree with all those at all. But we are making progress, and we are looking at how we -- and working very, very actively on a number of different approaches with regard to that. LTE will certainly help. That's for sure."

I'm wondering if you can give us some context for how much of the increase in spending is sort of front-loading capacity buildouts to take advantage of depreciation, that beneficial tax regime, versus just dealing with the massive amounts of data growth that you're seeing on the network right now. What I'm really trying to get a context for is what happens to Wireless CapEx in 2012 and beyond. And then quickly on ARPU, as you sort of take that, the penetration of smartphones from 50% to 70%, can you maintain that ratio of smartphone ARPU to non-smartphone ARPU? Or does the sort of the next slug of smartphone ARPU have to come in at a lower base so that we continue to see sort of overall postpaid ARPU continue to decelerate?"

And we feel really -- quite frankly, it's -- we feel good about having the demand. The customers are demanding the subs. That's a good thing. With regard to the ARPU issue, remember, much of the increase in the -- or the increase in its penetration is from existing customers. So generally speaking, when they go from a non-smartphone to a smartphone, their ARPUs, whether they're above the average or below the average, are going up. And so they're going to that, maybe only incrementally, but they are going up. And so they're going to be positive towards that postpaid ARPU average growth because they're coming out of the quick messaging devices or whatever and moving up the chain. What is going to be challenging to us is more of the tablets and the other devices that are going on the postpaid that may have lower ARPUs than are average today. But we are still optimistic about the revenue situation in total and quite frankly, the postpaid situation."

I think we're going to wrap it up here. I want to take a moment just again to tell you thank you very much for taking part in the call. 
And let me close by highlighting a few key points. First, we delivered another strong Wireless quarter in a very competitive environment, led by our mobile broadband strategy. We had record mobile broadband sales, smartphones and data-only devices. We had solid revenue growth and our 10th consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU growth. And as you heard from Wayne, we are comfortable with the progress of the T-Mobile merger transaction, and we remain confident of its approval. 
Second, we continue to see encouraging signs in our Wireline business as we transform it from voice to next-generation IP data business. Revenue trends continue to improve, and U-verse is leading continued consumer year-over-year growth. Strategic business services are driving improvements in business trends. 
And third, we had solid financial results and strong cash flows, which allow us to continue to invest in our growth platforms and to return significant value to our shareholders. This gives us good momentum going into the back half of the year and makes us optimistic about our future. 
Once again, my sincere thanks for being on the call today. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good day."

Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.61, a 13% increase over last year's earnings per share, excluding onetime gains and up 3.5% year-to-date. This includes pressure from Storm and T-Mobile transaction-related expenses in the third quarter. Our consolidated revenue was stable and consolidated operating margin was up 260 basis points year-over-year and stable sequentially, thanks to our best wireless service margins in 6 quarters and continued strength in Wireline business. Cash flow was superb. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $10.4 billion and free cash flow was $5.1 billion, which brings us to $12.4 billion through the year. That's even with the increased investment in capital expenditures that we told you about last quarter. With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?"

The benefits of the combination are both significant and unchanged and our expectation continues to be that we will reach a successful conclusion. 
Now, let me turn to results and comment on the quarter overall, the highlights are on Slide 5. We are very pleased with what we've accomplished in the third quarter and year-to-date and we continue to see impressive strength in all our growth engines. Mobile broadband leads the way. Ralph will give you more details in a moment but we had a great quarter. Sales were strong across the board, with gains in every subscriber category. Smartphone sales were robust, even in a quarter where you might expect sales to slow. Branded computing devices were also strong and we turned in impressive service margin results with our best performance in 6 quarters. There also was good news for our Wireline business, where for the first time in 3 years, we posted sequential growth in total and business revenues. IP data continues to be the driver for business and in Wireline consumer, where we continue to see positive results. The thing I'm most encouraged by is that in addition to solid earnings, we delivered excellent free cash flow. In fact, we had our strongest free cash flow in 2 years. That comes even with making significant CapEx investments. So you're seeing solid execution in every area of the business, which puts us in a great position heading into the fourth quarter. 
With that as background, let's take a look at detailed results, starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 6. Third quarter consolidated revenues were stable sequentially and year-over-year, but when you look at our results year-to-date, we've seen revenues increase. Our growth drivers continue to be strong. Excellent mobile broadband growth, solid U-verse gains and improved business trends. This was partially offset in the third quarter by declines in voice and directory. We also had an iPhone launch last year, which provided a lift to 2010 third quarter equipment revenues. Of course, we didn't see this in third quarter revenues this year. So when you factor out equipment revenue, consolidated service revenues actually grew 0.4% versus a year ago. Our overall revenue mix has continued its transformation. Year-to-date, 75% of our revenues come from wireless and Wireline data and managed services. That's up from 72% a year ago and 66% just 2 years ago. Revenues from these areas were up 7% year-to-date, so they're growing at a very good clip. We expect this mix shift to continue and it's one of the reasons we have such a positive view of our business. With that, let me turn it over to Ralph de la Vega, who will provide an update on wireless results. Ralph?"

As John mentioned, we are excited about the incredible growth that we're seeing in our mobile broadband business. As you can see on Slide 7, the third quarter continued the strong sales momentum that we have seen throughout the year. Smartphone sales have been strong, 4.8 million this quarter and 16 million sold so far this year, exceeding even our most optimistic forecasts coming into the year. We're also seeing strong sales of data-only branded computing devices coming close to our best quarter ever. But you know what? We believe the best is yet to come in the third quarter with those steps to make the AT&T network experience even better. 
First, we surpassed our end-of-year enhanced backhaul target and we see this as a major tipping point for speeds in our network. Our enhanced backhaul now carries more than 2/3 of our data traffic. When you combine this with the advanced technology of HSPA+ devices, such as the iPhone 4s, we are seeing some incredible speeds across our 4G network. We also launched our first LTE service in the third quarter. By the end of the year, we expect to have LTE service in at least 15 cities covering 17 million POPs and we'll be turning up Boston and Washington D.C. next. On the smartphone front, we have several new ones this quarter. We are off to a very fast start with the iPhone 4s. In fact, it's been our most successful launch in history, activating more than 1 million iPhone 4s through Tuesday. Only AT&T's networks let the iPhone 4s download twice as fast and surf and talk at the same time and customers just love those features. We also have some really great Android devices that we announced last week, including the Motorola Atrix 2. And in the fourth quarter, we plan to launch our first LTE handsets. Customers who love the state-of-the-art LTE smartphones we plan to introduce. They will be fast, they'll have super bright screens and long-lasting batteries. These new devices, along with an expected seasonal pitch we get from the holidays, sets us up for a really strong fourth quarter. In fact, we expect the fourth quarter to be one of our strongest smartphone sales quarters ever. But before we look too far ahead, let me drill down and cover third quarter wireless results and there's no better place to start this quarter than in our net adds and churns. The details are on Slide 8. We had a benchmark this quarter when we passed 100 million subscribers, adding more than 2.1 million this quarter alone. We also continued the trend that we have been seeing so far this year, with growth across the board in every customer category. That includes postpaid net adds of 319,000 or about the same number we had in the second quarter. Excluding the impacts of the ALLTEL and Centennial integration migrations, postpaid net adds were 384,000. Prepaid net adds were 293,000, more than twice as many as we had in the second quarter, helped by strong phone sales and we had another strong reseller quarter, with 473,000 subscribers added. We also added 1 million connected devices in the third quarter. This is a terrific business for us with lower ARPUs, with good margins and low churn, plus most of these devices have little or no subsidy. And speaking of churn, total churn improved both year-over-year and sequentially. Postpaid churn was stable and we saw iPhone churn decrease, a tremendous vote of confidence in a very competitive environment. It seems like a long time ago when the issue of how we would perform with iPhone competition was top of mind. Well, I think and believe that our results speak for themselves. These results speak volumes about our wireless business. New customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with us. 
Now, let's look at revenue on postpaid ARPU on Slide 9. Our track record of postpaid ARPU growth is unmatched in the industry. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of growing postpaid ARPU. And we grow it from a much larger ARPU base than anyone else. Last quarter, our postpaid ARPU was more than $7 higher than our closest competitor. In the third quarter, our postpaid ARPU was almost $64 per subscriber. Postpaid ARPU for the third quarter grew 1.4% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect ARPU to increase to the 2% range in the fourth quarter, thanks to expected positive impacts from higher smartphone activations in the quarter and from the pressure of the ALLTEL integration being fully behind us. Total service wireless revenues were $14.3 billion, up $600 million or 4.3% from the year earlier. This was driven by subscriber gains and strong adoption of data plans, which was offset somewhat by the lack of an iPhone refresh in the quarter. And we continue to bring in more subscribers onto our network with pure data plans. 18 million or nearly half of our smartphone subscribers are on tiered plans with most choosing the higher priced data plan. Our lower price line continues to be a good entry point for many subscribers and now that we offer a free iPhone with a 2-year contract for the first time ever, the iPhone 3GS, we expect to broaden the smartphone base even more. 
You can also see the benefits of mobile broadband sales in our wireless data results, which are on Slide 10. Data revenues were $5.6 billion, up more than $850 million from the third quarter a year ago. Data revenues are now at $22 billion annualized revenue screen for us, growing at 18% year-over-year. Compare that to just 4 years ago when the mobile broadband was just beginning to emerge. Back then, it was just the $7 billion annualized revenue stream. So we have tripled that number in just 4 years. We've come a long way, yet we're still just getting started. We also hit a significant smartphone milestone this quarter. Smartphone subscribers now make up more than half of our postpaid subscriber base, 52.6%, up from 39.1% a year ago. At the same time, smartphones continue to be nearly 2/3 of our postpaid sales during the quarter, showing more opportunity for growth. ARPU for smartphones continue to be strong, 1.9x that of other devices and customers tend to be sticking with churn below our average. We also delivered another strong quarter for branded computer subscriber growth. This is a new growth area for us that includes data only connections, such as tablets, tethering and aircards. And as you can see, the results continue to impress. We increased sales by 505,000 to reach 4.5 million. 
We are really excited about the opportunities here. There are a lot of exciting new tablets and new data-driven products on the horizon and we have the right business model, the right products and the right network to really grow this business. Now, let's take a look at wireless margins, the details on Slide 11. In addition to subscriber and top line growth, wireless margins expanded this quarter. In fact, we had our best wireless service margin performance in 6 quarters. This comes even with another strong smartphone sales quarter. Our third quarter wireless service EBITDA margin was 43.7% and when you factor in ALLTEL and Storm pressures, margins would've been more than 44%. I think it's worthwhile to take a moment and compare this quarter's results to the second quarter a year ago. That's the last time we had a quarter before an iPhone refresh. What you see is interesting and promising. Our service margins this quarter were actually better and we sold almost 1 million more smartphones than we did the second quarter a year ago. And I think this really speaks to our long-term goal of building a strong smartphone base while working to improve margins. It's important for us to keep our long-term strategy in mind as we plan for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we expect blockbuster smartphone sales in the fourth quarter. You've seen the earlier response to the iPhone 4S and it's been tremendous. Plus, when you factor in a great lineup of other smartphones, new devices from our LTE launch and traditionally strong holiday sales, you start to get an idea of the kind of quarter this is shaping up to be. Obviously, this will impact margins in the fourth quarter but the benefits are clear, including lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth and the opportunity to create long-term value is substantial. That covers wireless. Now I'd like to turn it back to John Stephens to discuss Wireline and consolidated results. John?"

Let's begin with Wireline consumer an",1160,"Thank you, Ralph. We always appreciate you being on the call, especially when you bring such great results. Now, let's take a look at our Wireline business, where we had our first sequential revenue growth in 4 years. Let's begin with Wireline consumer and U-verse. Slide 12 has that information. We believe we have the best video experience in the business but you don't have to take our word for it. J.D. Power has once again named U-verse highest in overall customer satisfaction and that's in every market that we serve where J.D. Power measures us. I strongly believe the best is yet to come. Our goal is to take the best video experience and make it even better. Earlier this week, we announced several connected TV apps that will further integrate our TV and wireless platforms and there are several other really great new features that are coming soon. As U-verse has transformed the viewer experience, it has also transformed our consumer results. IP data, that's U-verse plus other consumer broadband, now represents an annualized revenue stream of almost $11 billion, growing over 19% year-over-year and making up more than half of our consumer revenues. During the quarter, we added 176,000 U-verse subscribers to reach $3.6 billion in service. Our subscriber numbers were impacted somewhat this quarter by a technology upgrade and storms in some of our U-verse service areas. This caused us to pull back at some installations to handle those situations. But sales remained strong and we feel confident that our subscriber net add levels will improve in the fourth quarter. 
We're also seeing broadband and U-verse voice over IP attach rates remaining solid. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple or quad play bundle with us. ARPU for these customers is about $170, up 6% year-over-year and penetration continues to grow. We now have 25% penetration in areas marketed to for 36 months or more and we believe there's a lot of room for growth. U-verse high-speed data also had another great quarter, adding more than 500,000 subscribers. Our U-verse broadband net adds were more than twice our TV additions, with many of these subscribers buying our newer and faster IP DSL broadband service. 
Now, let me provide a quick update on improving trends we are seeing with our Wireline business customers, which you can see on Slide 13. Thanks to robust growth in our strategic business services, we had the first sequential growth in our Wireline business revenue in 3 years. That's sequential growth for the first time in our Wireline business revenue in 3 years. And what makes this even more impressive is that this growth is occurring while we're still seeing pressure from the weak economy, slow employment and the transformation of our business to next-generation IP products. So our business continues to work their way through the economic downturn, they are still investing in services that help drive productivity and efficiency. Business service revenues were down 2.2% year-over-year on a reported basis and 1.7% when you adjust for last year's sale of assets in Japan. But when you look at sequential results, revenues were actually increasing. Much of this success is attributable to continued strong growth of our strategic business services, revenues from products such as Ethernet, VPNs and application services, which is an almost $5.8 billion annualized revenue stream and growing at 19.3% in the third quarter and 19.1% year-to-date. So we're not only growing the revenue but continuing to grow it at a slightly larger rate. We are seeing data growth across a variety of industries in customers, both large and small. Global IP data and integration services are growing at more than 10%. Wholesale had its second sequential quarter of revenue growth and we had our first quarter of broadband growth in 2 years in small business. Our wireless bundles are also increasing. These are very encouraging signs and we plan to build on this success as we go forward. 
Now, let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 14. We said in January that we expected to deliver stable to improved consolidated margins this year, with wireless margin expansion and a disciplined focus on cost initiatives. Through the third quarter, I think it's fair to say we're delivering. Our consolidated operating margin was 19.8%. That's up 260 basis points versus the third quarter a year ago and up sequentially. And when you adjust for the storms, the technology upgrades, the ALLTEL costs, we would've had margins of over 20%. Our reported Wireline operating margin was 12.1% in the third quarter, down both sequentially and year-over-year. While we remain focused on cost initiatives, our results were pressured from declines in voice revenues, storm expenses, technology upgrades as we mentioned earlier. If you take those costs into account, our margins are in the mid-12% range. Our One AT&T initiatives are continuing to make progress. We continue to target cost efficiencies and simplify product offerings to deliver best-in-class services while also achieving cost savings. These initiatives are going well and help us sustain solid margins while still serving customers with the best-in-class operation. 
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flows. Our cash summary is on Slide 15. Through the first 9 months of the year, cash from operations totaled $27.2 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $14.7 billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $12.4 billion with our third quarter free cash flow at its highest level in 2 years and up 7% for the year. And dividend payments totaled $7.6 billion. In terms of uses of cash, net debt is down more than $8 billion over the past 5 quarters and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.41. Our balance sheet is solid. Our debt metrics sound and we have more than $10 billion of cash on hand. Our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in our business, to retire debt and to continue to return substantial value to shareholders. 
Let me close with a quick recap on Slide 16. First, we are seeing great execution across the business, strong gains in all our major growth drivers, mobile broadband, U-verse, strategic business services. Second, as Ralph said, mobile broadband growth has been terrific and the fourth quarter is shaping up to be one of our best yet. Data revenue growth is strong, churn is down, smartphone sales continue to grow. And maybe the biggest news this quarter is the first sequential revenue growth from business wireline customers in 3 years. Overall, these results produced another solid quarter for us, with double-digit adjusted earnings growth and strong free cash flow, allowing us to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to move ahead with our efforts on the T-Mobile transaction. Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. I think we're ready for Q&A."

And this technology quite frankly, is the best I have ever seen in my career. The network technology is fantastic, the devices are fast, they're thin, they have great battery life. It's the first time that I think a network transition is going to be a home run right off the bat. As we launched 3G, it took us about 6 months to a year to really get some really, really cool handsets. This is happening right now with our launch. So I think we've timed it perfectly. And when you complement that with what we're doing with HSPA+, I couldn't be more happy. What I see happening with LTE and data, Simon, is just a huge growth opportunity. We mentioned today that our smartphones now make up 52% of our postpaid base. But I think the way we need to think about smartphones in the future is the smartphone is going to equal the phone in the future. It will be 100% in the next 2 or 3 years. These devices are so good and the costs are coming down so much that I think in the future, you could look at close to 100% penetration, not 2/3 like we're selling today. Huge opportunity in smartphones. And then you have on top of that, these new devices like tablets and MiFis and e-Readers and telematics. And the growth opportunity is off the charts on this. And then you add to that the cloud, the fact that all of these devices in the future are going to want connectivity to the cloud, which means they need to have great bandwidth, great data capability. And this is not just a demand that we're seeing in this country but all around the world. And so our business enterprise can go and pitch products to them that are based on the worldwide standard today with HSPA and LTE in the future. So I see huge growth opportunities as more smartphones penetrate our base, huge opportunity with tablets and a huge opportunity to provide a worldwide capability on a standard technology platform that is probably the best the world has. And the great thing about doing all of that is that we're doing it with the technology, LTE, that provides a reduced cost per megabyte, that is we can produce the megabyte a lot cheaper on LTE and it's also more spectrally efficient. So lower cost, lower spectrum requirements and great revenue potential. I'm very bullish on what we're seeing in data and I think we've only seen the tip of the iceberg because customers love the devices that are coming out and they love using high-speed data."

We'll make those decisions at the end of the year and make our determinations on funding at that time. I will tell you, with that being said, we commonly file and review this process in all our business plans and processes going forward. We have assumptions for pension funding and believe that we can handle those in the normal course of our business within the normal course of cash flows that we are now generating. And quite frankly, they're also tax-deductible, so while the funding dollar's going in 100%, we get the tax benefits that come back at about $0.40 to the dollar. So that's the issue with funding. We'll have more knowledge about that as the results come in for the plans and as we make our elections on funding. Second, second piece on cash taxes, certainly the bonus depreciation rules have provided us a benefit this year, as tax planning has provided our company benefits for a number of years. This quarter is a great example because in comparing year-over-year results, when we show our 13% growth in earnings per share. That's after taking out a significant tax gain out of last year's results. So, my point being though is as with the bonus depreciation rules we continue to plan for that. That payback period is a couple of years out for us and we expect to have other opportunities to offset some, if not all, of that cash pressure."

But if you look at this quarter, we came in around 32% for our EBITDA margins if you adjust for the storms and the technology upgrade costs and we came in around 12.5% if you do the same adjustments on an operating income basis. I think on a full year basis, we're probably in the 10 to 20 basis points lagging on an operating income basis last year's operating income margins for Wireline. So we're hopeful that we can make that up in the fourth quarter. We'll see if we can but we're hopeful about that. So we continue to believe that we have an opportunity to sustain margins at this level or even slightly better than we've done in this quarter, and we're working hard to do that. It is a challenging endeavor. Specifically, as you all know, transforming the business from high-margin legacy products to these next-generation U-verse IP and other services. With regard to our DSL, the most encouraging piece of the DSL story, our net adds for the quarter were about in the 5,000 range. The most encouraging piece of it was the fact that we had 500,000 high-speed U-verse IP DSLAM net adds. So we were able to convert a huge piece of our legacy DSL base into IP DSLAM and we saw gains in small business with that IP DSLAM product for the first time. We'll continue to focus on transforming those DSL lines into high speed. We get great speeds, great service to our customers, good ARPUs. On those areas where we don't have U-verse, I think our plans would've been fairly clear. We expect to have an LTE rollout to 97% of the country. And as Ralph talked about, we're getting great results where we have it so we believe that's going to be able to provide a wireless solution at a high speed, good quality, good cost on a profitable business for us. That's the long-term solution to the non-U-verse areas."

And when you compare it to the prior quarter before iPhone launch, our margins are not only 60 basis points higher but we have almost 1 million more smartphone sales. And so, our point is that while someone may jump to the conclusion that it's a handset driven, and certainly the handsets have an impact, the reality of it is there was a lot of good hard work by the entire management team on all fronts to generate these great margins. It wasn't just a differential handsets because we sold 900,000 more handsets this quarter than I did in the last pre-iPhone launch. That's the first point. And Ralph, did I miss anything with that?"

And that's what we expect is going to happen in greater numbers in the fourth quarter. Third quarter was simply slow because we didn't have an iPhone launch in the third quarter like we did a year ago, but we think that's going to dramatically change and get those back into 2% range. I also mentioned in my notes that we have another device that I think is going to dramatically change those people that are on smartphones and quick messaging devices, the 3GS, which is free with a 2-year contract. We've seen a tremendous, tremendous demand for that device even though it's a generation old. And actually, we're getting more new subscribers coming on the 3GS on the average than other devices. So we also have an inventory sold out on that device. So I'm very, very optimistic on what the fourth quarter is going to look like in terms of smartphone growth. And that's what typically drives ARPU growth, Mike. So we feel very, very confident. The Alltel impact was in the range of about 23 basis points, Mike. But the majority of it was driven through smartphone growth and we are very confident that's going to pick up in the fourth quarter. Okay, the other question on the technology upgrade. Typically, when we provide new upgrades to U-verse, we require a few more dispatches so we planned for that. This time, we reduced promotions so that we could provide good service intervals to customers when they reported any issues with the transition. It worked extremely well. That work is behind us and now we'll go back to the regular mobile business in the fourth quarter."

And you've already gotten more than half your base on the smartphone so the next 47% of your base is going to be taking cheaper smartphones and maybe cheaper plans and maybe not taking a smartphone at all if they can afford it.

The other thing that I feel so bullish about is what is happening in the tablet arena. I mean it's very obvious to me that this tablet revolution is going to continue. I don't see anything in the horizon that stops it and I think customers are going to want both, some smartphones and a tablet and they're going to see their content on the tablet in ways that's going to make them use more and more data. So I think the future of tablet computing is going to be very good for our industry."

I don't think anybody would've expected it to be dramatic in this economic environment.

But the biggest impact to the third quarter ARPU number was still data. It wasn't voice. In terms of the upgrade, the changes in upgrade policy do not impact this year. They'll impact next year. And what we saw was just simply the fact that the iPhone refresh is taking place in the fourth quarter this year compared to the third quarter last year. The big unknown is what happens when you have an iPhone refresh in the fourth quarter, which is the busiest quarter of the year. And this is the first time that happens so we expect that it will be a little higher than average upgrade number in the fourth quarter.

This includes pressure from storm and T-Mobile transaction-related expenses in the third quarter. Our consolidated revenue was stable and consolidated operating margin was up 260 basis points year-over-year and stable sequentially, thanks to our best wireless service margins in 6 quarters and continued strength in Wireline business. Cash flow was superb. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $10.4 billion and free cash flow was $5.1 billion, which brings us to $12.4 billion through the year. That's even with the increased investment in capital expenditures that we told you about last quarter.

The benefits of the combination are both significant and unchanged, and our expectation continues to be that we will reach a successful conclusion. 
Now, let me turn to results and comment on the quarter overall, the highlights are on Slide 5. We are very pleased with what we've accomplished in the third quarter and year-to-date, and we continue to see impressive strength in all our growth engines. Mobile broadband leads the way. Ralph will give you more details in a moment but we had a great quarter. Sales were strong across the board, with gains in every subscriber category. Smartphone sales were robust, even in a quarter where you might expect sales to slow. Branded computing devices were also strong, and we turned in impressive service margin results with our best performance in 6 quarters. There also was good news for our Wireline business, where for the first time in 3 years, we posted sequential growth in total and business revenues. IP data continues to be the driver for business and in Wireline Consumer, where we continue to see positive results. The thing I'm most encouraged by is that in addition to solid earnings, we delivered excellent free cash flow. In fact, we had our strongest free cash flow in 2 years. That comes even with making significant CapEx investments. So you're seeing solid execution in every area of the business, which puts us in a great position heading into the fourth quarter. 
With that as background, let's take a look at detailed results, starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 6. Third quarter consolidated revenues were stable sequentially and year-over-year, but when you look at our results year-to-date, we've seen revenues increase. Our growth drivers continued to be strong. Excellent mobile broadband growth, solid U-verse gains and improved business trends. This was partially offset in the third quarter by declines in voice and directory. We also had an iPhone launch last year, which provided a lift to 2010 third quarter equipment revenues. Of course, we didn't see this in third quarter revenues this year. So when you factor out equipment revenue, consolidated service revenues actually grew 0.4% versus a year ago. Our overall revenue mix has continued its transformation. Year-to-date, 75% of our revenues come from wireless and Wireline data and managed services. That's up from 72% a year ago and 66% just 2 years ago. Revenues from these areas were up 7% year-to-date, so they're growing at a very good clip. We expect this mix shift to continue, and it's one of the reasons we have such a positive view of our business. With that, let me turn it over to Ralph de la Vega, who will provide an update on Wireless results. Ralph?"

As John mentioned, we are excited about the incredible growth that we're seeing in our mobile broadband business. As you can see on Slide 7, the third quarter continued the strong sales momentum that we have seen throughout the year. Smartphone sales have been strong, 4.8 million this quarter and 16 million sold so far this year, exceeding even our most optimistic forecasts coming into the year. We're also seeing strong sales of data-only branded computing devices coming close to our best quarter ever. But you know what? We believe the best is yet to come. In the third quarter with those steps to make, the AT&T network experience even better. 
First, we surpassed our end-of-year enhanced backhaul target, and we see this as a major tipping point for speeds on our network. Our enhanced backhaul now carries more than 2/3 of our data traffic. When you combine this with the advanced technology of HSPA+ devices, such as the iPhone 4s, we're seeing some incredible speeds across our 4G network. We also launched our first LTE cities in the third quarter. By the end of the year, we expect to have LTE service in at least 15 cities covering 17 million POPs, and we'll be turning up Boston and Washington D.C. next. 
On the smartphone front, we have several new ones this quarter. We're off to a very fast start with the iPhone 4s. In fact, it's been our most successful launch in history, activating more than 1 million iPhone 4s' through Tuesday. Only AT&T's networks let the iPhone 4s download twice as fast and surf and talk at the same time and customers just love those features. We also have some really great Android devices that we announced last week, including the Motorola ATRIX 2. And in the fourth quarter, we plan to launch our first LTE handsets. Customers who love the state-of-the-art LTE smartphones we plan to introduce, they will be fast, they'll have super bright screens and long-lasting batteries. These new devices, along with an expected seasonal push we get from the holidays, sets us up for a really strong fourth quarter. In fact, we expect the fourth quarter to be one of our strongest smartphone sales quarters ever. But before we look too far ahead, let me drill down and cover third quarter Wireless results, and there's no better place to start this quarter than in our net adds and churns. The details are on Slide 8. We had a benchmark this quarter when we passed 100 million subscribers, adding more than 2.1 million this quarter alone. We also continued the trend that we have been seeing so far this year, with growth across the board in every customer category. That includes postpaid net adds of 319,000 or about the same number we had in the second quarter. Excluding the impacts of the Alltel and Centennial integration migrations, postpaid net adds were 384,000. Prepaid net adds were 293,000, more than twice as many as we had in the second quarter, helped by strong GoPhone sales, and we had another strong reseller quarter, with 473,000 subscribers added. 
We also added 1 million connected devices in the third quarter. This is a terrific business for us with lower ARPUs, with good margins and low churn, plus most of these devices have little or no subsidy. And speaking of churn, total churn improved both year-over-year and sequentially. Postpaid churn was stable, and we saw iPhone churn decrease, a tremendous vote of confidence in a very competitive environment. It seems like a long time ago when the issue of how we would perform with iPhone competition was top of mind. Well, I think and believe that our results speak for themselves. These results speak volumes about our wireless business. New customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with us. 
Now, let's look at revenue on postpaid ARPU on Slide 9. Our track record of postpaid ARPU growth is unmatched in the industry. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of growing postpaid ARPU. And we grow it from a much larger ARPU base than anyone else. Last quarter, our postpaid ARPU was more than $7 higher than our closest competitor. In the third quarter, our postpaid ARPU was almost $64 per subscriber. Postpaid ARPU for the third quarter grew 1.4% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect ARPU to increase to the 2% range in the fourth quarter, thanks to expected positive impacts from higher smartphone activations in the quarter and from the pressure of the Alltel integration being fully behind us. Total serviced Wireless revenues were $14.3 billion, up $600 million or 4.3% from the year earlier. This was driven by subscriber gains and strong adoption of data plans, which was offset somewhat by the lack of an iPhone refresh in the quarter. And we continue to bring in more subscribers onto our network with pure data plans. 18 million or nearly half of our smartphone subscribers are on tiered plans with most choosing the higher priced data plan. Our lower price line continues to be a good entry point for many subscribers and now that we offer a free iPhone with a 2-year contract for the first time ever, the iPhone 3GS, we expect to broaden the smartphone base even more. 
You can also see the benefits of mobile broadband sales in our wireless data results, which are on Slide 10. Data revenues were $5.6 billion, up more than $850 million from the third quarter a year ago. Data revenues are now at $22 billion annualized revenue screen for us, growing at 18% year-over-year. Compare that to just 4 years ago when the mobile broadband was just beginning to emerge. Back then, it was just the $7 billion annualized revenue stream. So we have tripled that number in just 4 years. We've come a long way, yet we're still just getting started. We also hit a significant smartphone milestone this quarter. Smartphone subscribers now make up more than half of our postpaid subscriber base, 52.6%, up from 39.1% a year ago. At the same time, smartphones continue to be nearly 2/3 of our postpaid sales during the quarter, showing more opportunity for growth. ARPU for smartphones continue to be strong, 1.9x that of other devices and customers tend to be sticking with churn below our average. We also delivered another strong quarter for branded computer subscriber growth. This is a new growth area for us that includes data only connections, such as tablets, tethering and aircards. And as you can see, the results continue to impress. We increased sales by 505,000 to reach 4.5 million. 
We are really excited about the opportunities here. There are a lot of exciting new tablets and new data-driven products on the horizon, and we have the right business model, the right products and the right network to really grow this business. Now, let's take a look at wireless margins, the details on Slide 11. In addition to subscriber and top line growth, wireless margins expanded this quarter. In fact, we had our best wireless service margin performance in 6 quarters. This comes even with another strong smartphone sales quarter. Our third quarter wireless service EBITDA margin was 43.7%, and when you factor in Alltel and storm pressures, margins would've been more than 44%. I think it's worthwhile to take a moment and compare this quarter's results to the second quarter a year ago. That's the last time we had a quarter before an iPhone refresh. What you see is interesting and promising. Our service margins this quarter were actually better, and we sold almost 1 million more smartphones than we did the second quarter a year ago. And I think this really speaks to our long-term goal of building a strong smartphone base while working to improve margins. It's important for us to keep our long-term strategy in mind as we plan for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we expect blockbuster smartphone sales in the fourth quarter. You've seen the earlier response to the iPhone 4S, and it's been tremendous. Plus, when you factor in a great lineup of other smartphones, new devices from our LTE launch and traditionally strong holiday sales, you start to get an idea of the kind of quarter this is shaping up to be. Obviously, this will impact margins in the fourth quarter but the benefits are clear, including lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth and the opportunity to create long-term value is substantial. That covers wireless. Now, I'd like to turn it back to John Stephens to discuss Wireline and consolidated results. John?"

IP data, that's U-verse plus other consumer broadband, now represents an annualized revenue stream of almost $11 billion, growing over 19% year-over-year and making up more than half of our consumer revenues. During the quarter, we added 176,000 U-verse subscribers to reach $3.6 billion in service. Our subscriber numbers were impacted somewhat this quarter by a technology upgrade and storms in some of our U-verse service areas. This caused us to pull back at some installations to handle those situations. But sales remained strong, and we feel confident that our subscriber net add levels will improve in the fourth quarter. 
We're also seeing broadband and U-verse voice over IP attach rates remaining solid. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple or quad play bundle with us. ARPU for these customers is about $170, up 6% year-over-year and penetration continues to grow. We now have 25% penetration in areas marketed to for 36 months or more and we believe there's a lot of room for growth. U-verse high-speed data also had another great quarter, adding more than 500,000 subscribers. Our U-verse broadband net adds were more than twice our TV additions, with many of these subscribers buying our newer and faster IP DSL broadband service. 
Now, let me provide a quick update on improving trends we are seeing with our Wireline business customers, which you can see on Slide 13. Thanks to robust growth in our strategic business services, we had the first sequential growth in our Wireline business revenue in 3 years. That's sequential growth for the first time in our Wireline business revenue in 3 years. And what makes this even more impressive is that this growth is occurring while we're still seeing pressure from the weak economy, slow employment and the transformation of our business to next-generation IP products. So our business continues to work their way through the economic downturn, they are still investing in services that help drive productivity and efficiency. Business service revenues were down 2.2% year-over-year on a reported basis and 1.7% when you adjust for last year's sale of assets in Japan. But when you look at sequential results, revenues were actually increasing. Much of this success is attributable to continued strong growth of our strategic business services, revenues from products such as ethernet, VPNs and application services, which is an almost $5.8 billion annualized revenue stream and growing at 19.3% in the third quarter and 19.1% year-to-date. So we're not only growing the revenue but continuing to grow it at a slightly larger rate. We are seeing data growth across a variety of industries and customers, both large and small. Global IP data and integration services are growing at more than 10%. Wholesale had its second sequential quarter of revenue growth, and we had our first quarter of broadband growth in 2 years in small business. Our wireless bundles are also increasing. These are very encouraging signs, and we plan to build on this success as we go forward. 
Now, let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 14. We said in January that we expected to deliver stable to improved consolidated margins this year, with wireless margin expansion and a disciplined focus on cost initiatives. Through the third quarter, I think it's fair to say we're delivering. Our consolidated operating margin was 19.8%. That's up 260 basis points versus the third quarter a year ago and up sequentially. And when you adjust for the storms, the technology upgrades and the Alltel costs, we would've had margins of over 20%. Our reported Wireline operating margin was 12.1% in the third quarter, down both sequentially and year-over-year. While we remain focused on cost initiatives, our results were pressured from declines in voice revenues, storm expenses, technology upgrades as we mentioned earlier. If you take those costs into account, our margins are in the mid-12% range. Our one AT&T initiatives are continuing to make progress. We continue to target cost efficiencies and simplify product offerings to deliver best-in-class services while also achieving cost savings. These initiatives are going well and help us sustain solid margins while still serving customers with the best-in-class operation. 
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flows. Our cash summary is on Slide 15. Through the first 9 months of the year, cash from operations totaled $27.2 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $14.7 billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $12.4 billion with our third quarter free cash flow at its highest level in 2 years and up 7% for the year. And dividend payments totaled $7.6 billion. In terms of uses of cash, net debt is down more than $8 billion over the past 5 quarters, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.41. Our balance sheet is solid. Our debt metrics sound, and we have more than $10 billion of cash on hand. Our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in our business, to retire debt and to continue to return substantial value to shareholders. 
Let me close with a quick recap on Slide 16. First, we are seeing great execution across the business, strong gains in all our major growth drivers, mobile broadband, U-verse, strategic business services. Second, as Ralph said, mobile broadband growth has been terrific, and the fourth quarter is shaping up to be one of our best yet. Data revenue growth is strong. Churn is down. Smartphone sales continue to grow. And maybe the biggest news this quarter is the first sequential revenue growth from business Wireline customers in 3 years. Overall, these results produced another solid quarter for us, with double-digit adjusted earnings growth and strong free cash flow, allowing us to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to move ahead with our efforts on the T-Mobile transaction. Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. I think we're ready for Q&A."

And this technology quite frankly is the best I have ever seen in my career. The network technology is fantastic. The devices are fast. They're thin. They have great battery life. It's the first time that I think a network transition is going to be a home run right off the bat. As we launched 3G, it took us about 6 months to a year to really get some really, really cool handsets. This is happening right now with our launch. So I think we've timed it perfectly. And when you complement that what we're doing with HSPA+, I couldn't be more happy. What I see happening with LTE and data, Simon, is just a huge growth opportunity. We mentioned today that our smartphones now make up 52% of our postpaid base. But I think the way we need to think about smartphones in the future is the smartphone is going to equal the phone in the future. It will be 100% in the next 2 or 3 years. These devices are so good and the costs are coming down so much that I think in the future, you could look at close to 100% penetration, not 2/3 like we're selling today. Huge opportunity in smartphones. And then you had on top of that these new devices like tablets and MiFis and e-Readers and telematics. And the growth opportunity is off the charts on this. And then you add to that the cloud, the fact that all of these devices in the future are going to want connectivity to the cloud, which means they need to have great bandwidth, great data capability. And this is not just a demand that we're seeing in this country but all around the world. And so our business enterprise can go and pitch products to them that are based on the worldwide standard today of HSPA and LTE in the future. So I see huge growth opportunities as more smartphones penetrate our base, huge opportunity with tablets and a huge opportunity to provide a worldwide capability on a standard technology platform that is probably the best the world has. And the great thing about doing all of that is that we're doing it with the technology, LTE, that provides a reduced cost per megabyte, that is we can produce the megabyte a lot cheaper on LTE, and it's also more spectrally efficient. So lower cost, lower spectrum requirements and great revenue potential. I'm very bullish on what we're seeing in data, and I think we've only seen the tip of the iceberg because customers love the devices that are coming out and they love using high-speed data."

Let me tell you, first of all, with regard to the pension funding issue, there are some processes that we have to go between that every company has to go through between now and the end of the year, not only seeing how our investment results in discount rates and so forth change and results have come out at the end of the year, but also to make some decisions on funding elections that are available to companies today. We'll make those decisions at the end of the year and make our determinations on funding at that time. I will tell you, with that being said, we commonly file and review this process in all our business plans and processes going forward. We have assumptions for pension funding and believe that we can handle those in normal course of our business within the normal course of cash flows that we are now generating. And quite frankly, they're also tax-deductible, so while the funding dollars going in 100%, we get the tax benefits that come back at about $0.40 to the dollar. So that's the issue with funding. We'll have more knowledge about that as the results come in for the plans and as we make our elections on funding. Second, second piece on cash taxes, certainly the bonus depreciation rules have provided us a benefit this year, as tax planning has provided our company benefits for a number of years. This quarter is a great example because in comparing year-over-year results, when we show our 13% growth in earnings per share. That's after taking out a significant tax gain out of last year's results. So my point being though is as with the bonus depreciation rules who provides it, we continue to plan for that. That payback period is a couple of years out for us, and we expect to have other opportunities to offset some, if not all, of that cash pressure."

But if you look at this quarter, we came in around 32% for our EBITDA margins if you adjust for the storms and the technology upgrade costs, and we came in around 12.5% if you do the same adjustments on an operating income basis. I think on a full year basis, we're probably in the 10 to 20 basis points lagging on an operating income basis last year's operating income margins for Wireline. So we're hopeful that we can make that up in the fourth quarter. We'll see if we can or not, but we're hopeful about that. So we continue to believe that we have an opportunity to sustain margins at this level or even slightly better than we've done in this quarter, and we're working hard to do that. It is a challenging endeavor. Specifically, as you all know, transforming the business from high-margin legacy products to these next-generation U-verse IP and other services. With regard to our DSL, the most encouraging piece of the DSL story, our net adds for the quarter were about in the 5,000 range. The most encouraging piece of it was the fact that we had 500,000 high-speed U-verse/IP DSLAM net adds. So we were able to convert a huge piece of our legacy DSL base into U-verse/IP DSLAM, and we saw gains in small business with that IP DSLAM product for the first time. We'll continue to focus on transforming those DSL lines into high speed. We get great speeds, great service to our customers, good ARPUs. On those areas where we don't have U-verse, I think our plans have been fairly clear. We expect to have an LTE rollout to 97% of the country. And as Ralph talked about, we're getting great results where we have it so we believe that's going to be able to provide a wireless solution at a high speed, good quality, good cost on a profitable basis for us. That's the long-term solution to the non-U-verse areas."

And when you compare it to the prior quarter before iPhone launch, our margins are not only 60 basis points higher but we have almost 1 million more smartphone sales. And so our point is that while someone may jump to the conclusion that it's a handset driven, and certainly the handsets have an impact, the reality of it is there was a lot of good hard work by the entire management team on all fronts to generate these great margins. It wasn't just a differential handsets because I sold 900,000 more handsets this quarter than I did in the last pre-iPhone launch. That's the first point. And, Ralph, did I miss anything with that?"

And that's what we expect is going to happen in greater numbers in the fourth quarter. Third quarter was simply slow because we didn't have an iPhone launch in the third quarter like we did a year ago, but we think that's going to dramatically change and get those back into 2% range. I also mentioned in my notes that we have another device that I think is going to dramatically change those people that are on smartphones and quick messaging devices, the 3GS, which is free with a 2-year contract. We've seen a tremendous, tremendous demand for that device even though it's a generation old. And actually, we're getting more new subscribers coming on the 3GS on the average than other devices. So we also have an inventory sold out on that device. So I'm very, very optimistic on what the fourth quarter is going to look like in terms of smartphone growth. And that's what typically drives the ARPU growth, Mike. So we feel very, very confident. The Alltel impact was in the range of about 23 basis points, Mike. But the majority of it was driven through smartphone growth, and we are very confident that's going to pick up in the fourth quarter. Okay, the other question on the technology upgrade. Typically, when we provide new upgrades to U-verse, we require a few more dispatches so we planned for that. This time, we reduced promotions so that we could provide good service intervals to customers when they reported any issues with the transition. It worked extremely well. That work is behind us, and now we'll go back to the regular mobile business in the fourth quarter."

Obviously, we've had a number of companies that are suggesting that things are slowing down quickly at AT&T. If you could kind of just -- but yet, year-to-date spend seems to be pretty healthy. So I just kind of wanted to see if you could give us a peek into the rest of the year for the CapEx plans. And then second if I could, Ralph, just taking another crack at this topic. You guys are talking about half the smartphone base on tiered plans, which means that half the smartphones are still paying you kind of $30 a month and as those guys upgrade their phones and as their life cycle evolves, they'll probably move down the curve. And you've already gotten more than half your base on the smartphone, so the next 47% of your base is going to be taking cheaper smartphones and maybe cheaper plans and maybe not taking a smartphone at all if they can afford it. So as you look down the track with this pressure on the existing smartphone base to lower ARPUs to the existing tiers and the next half of the smartphone base being the lower tiered customers, are you still optimistic that the ARPU can grow in the face of those forces?"

The second thing is our free cash flow allows us to make this investment. I mean, our operating cash flows are great, and they're what's funding this. Third, we're going to continue to invest, and quite frankly, push for investment in our LTE and all of our successful growing products. So we'll continue to make that.

So we're going to continue to see customer data usage increase. We have not seen a decline, and I don't see it any way to decline. That's why I feel so bullish about our position of having 50% of our base already on tiered plans, and we plan to make available more tiered options for customers in the future so they can enjoy the data services that they want. So what I see is exactly the opposite of the scenario you suggested is where everybody is actually using more data. I see it across every product category we sell and that more handsets that we get into a customer's hands that are smartphones, the more data that they use, not the less."

I don't think anybody would've expected it to be dramatic in this economic environment.

What's going on there is that people still trading down minute bucket plans, and maybe it has a bit of a macro component? Is it still family-planning penetration that sort of riding that curve? Maybe just give us a little bit more granularity there and help us think about when that can level out because that's still 60% of the postpaid ARPU? And then second, just on the handset upgrade rates, you had 7% this quarter. The lowest rate we've seen in a while obviously contributed to very strong margins. Help us think through this. Is this tied more to changes in upgrade policies which you guys made, which have hit some of the Windows or more tied to just lack of new handsets and hence, we should expect this to move back to the 8% to 9% range?"

But the biggest impact to the third quarter ARPU number was still data. It wasn't voice. In terms of the upgrade, the changes in upgrade policy do not impact this year. They'll impact next year. And what we saw was just simply the fact that the iPhone refresh is taking place in the fourth quarter this year compared to the third quarter last year. The big unknown is what happens when you have an iPhone refresh in the fourth quarter, which is the busiest quarter of the year.

Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61, a 13% increase over last year's earnings per share, excluding onetime gains and up 3.5% year-to-date. This includes pressure from storm and T-Mobile transaction-related expenses in the third quarter. Our consolidated revenue was stable and consolidated operating margin was up 260 basis points year-over-year and stable sequentially, thanks to our best wireless service margins in 6 quarters and continued strength in Wireline business. Cash flow was superb. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $10.4 billion and free cash flow was $5.1 billion, which brings us to $12.4 billion through the year. That's even with the increased investment in capital expenditures that we told you about last quarter.

The benefits of the combination are both significant and unchanged, and our expectation continues to be that we will reach a successful conclusion. 
Now, let me turn to results and comment on the quarter overall, the highlights are on Slide 5. We are very pleased with what we've accomplished in the third quarter and year-to-date, and we continue to see impressive strength in all our growth engines. Mobile broadband leads the way. Ralph will give you more details in a moment but we had a great quarter. Sales were strong across the board, with gains in every subscriber category. Smartphone sales were robust, even in a quarter where you might expect sales to slow. Branded computing devices were also strong, and we turned in impressive service margin results with our best performance in 6 quarters. There also is good news for our Wireline business, where for the first time in 3 years, we posted sequential growth in total and business revenues. IP data continues to be the driver for business and in Wireline Consumer, where we continue to see positive results. The thing I'm most encouraged by is that in addition to solid earnings, we delivered excellent free cash flow. In fact, we had our strongest free cash flow in 2 years. That comes even with making significant CapEx investments. So you're seeing solid execution in every area of the business, which puts us in a great position heading into the fourth quarter. 
With that as background, let's take a look at detailed results, starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 6. Third quarter consolidated revenues were stable sequentially and year-over-year, but when you look at our results year-to-date, we've seen revenues increase. Our growth drivers continued to be strong. Excellent mobile broadband growth, solid U-verse gains and improved business trends. This was partially offset in the third quarter by declines in voice and directory. We also had an iPhone launch last year, which provided a lift to 2010 third quarter equipment revenues. Of course, we didn't see this in third quarter revenues this year. So when you factor out equipment revenue, consolidated service revenues actually grew 0.4% versus a year ago. Our overall revenue mix has continued its transformation. Year-to-date, 75% of our revenues come from wireless and Wireline data and managed services. That's up from 72% a year ago and 66% just 2 years ago. Revenues from these areas were up 7% year-to-date, so they're growing at a very good clip. We expect this mix shift to continue, and it's one of the reasons we have such a positive view of our business. With that, let me turn it over to Ralph de la Vega, who will provide an update on Wireless results. Ralph?"

As John mentioned, we are excited about the incredible growth that we're seeing in our mobile broadband business. As you can see on Slide 7, the third quarter continued the strong sales momentum that we have seen throughout the year. Smartphone sales have been strong, 4.8 million this quarter and 16 million sold so far this year, exceeding even our most optimistic forecasts coming into the year. We're also seeing strong sales of data-only branded computing devices coming close to our best quarter ever. But you know what? We believe the best is yet to come. In the third quarter with those steps to make, the AT&T network experience even better. 
First, we surpassed our end-of-year enhanced backhaul target, and we see this as a major tipping point for speeds on our network. Our enhanced backhaul now carries more than 2/3 of our data traffic. When you combine this with the advanced technology of HSPA+ devices, such as the iPhone 4s, we're seeing some incredible speeds across our 4G network. We also launched our first LTE cities in the third quarter. By the end of the year, we expect to have LTE service in at least 15 cities covering 17 million POPs, and we'll be turning up Boston and Washington D.C. next. 
On the smartphone front, we have several new ones this quarter. We're off to a very fast start with the iPhone 4s. In fact, it's been our most successful launch in history, activating more than 1 million iPhone 4s' through Tuesday. Only AT&T's networks let the iPhone 4s download twice as fast and surf and talk at the same time and customers just love those features. We also have some really great Android devices that we announced last week, including the Motorola ATRIX 2. And in the fourth quarter, we plan to launch our first LTE handsets. Customers who love the state-of-the-art LTE smartphones we plan to introduce, they will be fast, they'll have super bright screens and long-lasting batteries. These new devices, along with an expected seasonal push we get from the holidays, sets us up for a really strong fourth quarter. In fact, we expect the fourth quarter to be one of our strongest smartphone sales quarters ever. But before we look too far ahead, let me drill down and cover third quarter Wireless results, and there's no better place to start this quarter than in our net adds and churns. The details are on Slide 8. We hit a benchmark this quarter when we passed 100 million subscribers, adding more than 2.1 million this quarter alone. We also continued the trend that we have been seeing so far this year, with growth across the board in every customer category. That includes postpaid net adds of 319,000 or about the same number we had in the second quarter. Excluding the impacts of the Alltel and Centennial integration migrations, postpaid net adds were 384,000. Prepaid net adds were 293,000, more than twice as many as we had in the second quarter, helped by strong GoPhone sales, and we had another solid reseller quarter, with 473,000 subscribers added. 
We also added 1 million connected devices in the third quarter. This is a terrific business for us with lower ARPUs, with good margins and low churn, plus most of these devices have little or no subsidy. And speaking of churn, total churn improved both year-over-year and sequentially. Postpaid churn was stable, and we saw iPhone churn decrease, a tremendous vote of confidence in a very competitive environment. It seems like a long time ago when the issue of how we would perform with iPhone competition was top of mind. Well, I think and believe that our results speak for themselves. These results speak volumes about our wireless business. New customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with us. 
Now, let's look at revenue and postpaid ARPU on Slide 9. Our track record of postpaid ARPU growth is unmatched in the industry. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of growing postpaid ARPU. And we grow it from a much larger ARPU base than anyone else. Last quarter, our postpaid ARPU was more than $7 higher than our closest competitor. In the third quarter, our postpaid ARPU was almost $64 per subscriber. Postpaid ARPU for the third quarter grew 1.4% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect ARPU to increase to the 2% range in the fourth quarter, thanks to expected positive impacts from higher smartphone activations in the quarter and from the pressure of the Alltel integration being fully behind us. Total serviced Wireless revenues were $14.3 billion, up $600 million or 4.3% from the year earlier. This was driven by subscriber gains and strong adoption of data plans, which was offset somewhat by the lack of an iPhone refresh in the quarter. And we continue to bring in more subscribers onto our network with pure data plans. 18 million or nearly half of our smartphone subscribers are on tiered plans with most choosing the higher priced data plan. Our lower price plan continues to be a good entry point for many subscribers and now that we offer a free iPhone with a 2-year contract for the first time ever, the iPhone 3GS, we expect to broaden the smartphone base even more. 
You can also see the benefits of mobile broadband sales in our wireless data results, which are on Slide 10. Data revenues were $5.6 billion, up more than $850 million from the third quarter a year ago. Data revenues are now at $22 billion annualized revenue stream for us, growing at 18% year-over-year. Compare that to just 4 years ago when the mobile broadband was just beginning to emerge. Back then, it was just a $7 billion annualized revenue stream. So we have tripled that number in just 4 years. We've come a long way, yet we're still just getting started. 
We also hit a significant smartphone milestone this quarter. Smartphone subscribers now make up more than half of our postpaid subscriber base, 52.6%, up from 39.1% a year ago. At the same time, smartphones continue to be nearly 2/3 of our postpaid sales during the quarter, showing more opportunity for growth. ARPU for smartphones continued to be strong, 1.9x that of other devices and customers tend to be sticking with churn below our average. We also delivered another strong quarter for branded computer subscriber growth. This is a new growth area for us that includes data only connections, such as tablets, tethering and aircards. And as you can see, the results continue to impress. We increased sales by 505,000 to reach 4.5 million. 
We are really excited about the opportunities here. There are a lot of exciting new tablets and new data-driven products on the horizon, and we have the right business model, the right products and the right network to really grow this business. Now, let's take a look at wireless margins, the details on Slide 11. In addition to subscriber and top line growth, wireless margins expanded this quarter. In fact, we had our best wireless service margin performance in 6 quarters. This comes even with another strong smartphone sales quarter. Our third quarter wireless service EBITDA margin was 43.7%, and when you factor in Alltel and storm pressures, margins would've been more than 44%. 
I think it's worthwhile to take a moment and compare this quarter's results to the second quarter a year ago. That's the last time we had a quarter before an iPhone refresh. What you see is interesting and promising. Our service margins this quarter were actually better, and we sold almost 1 million more smartphones than we did the second quarter a year ago. And I think this really speaks to our long-term goal of building a strong smartphone base while working to improve margins. It's important for us to keep our long-term strategy in mind as we plan for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we expect blockbuster smartphone sales in the fourth quarter. You've seen the earlier response to the iPhone 4S, and it's been tremendous. Plus, when you factor in a great lineup of other smartphones, new devices from our LTE launch and traditionally strong holiday sales, you start to get an idea of the kind of quarter this is shaping up to be. Obviously, this will impact margins in the fourth quarter but the benefits are clear, including lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth and the opportunity to create long-term value is substantial. That covers wireless. Now, I'd like to turn it back to John Stephens to discuss Wireline and consolidated results. John?"

Let's begin with Wireline Consumer an",1161,"Thank you, Ralph. We always appreciate you being on the call, especially when you bring such great results. Now, let's take a look at our Wireline business, where we had our first sequential revenue growth in 4 years. Let's begin with Wireline Consumer and U-verse. Slide 12 has that information. We believe we have the best video experience in the business, but you don't have to take our word for it. J.D. Power has once again named U-verse highest in overall customer satisfaction and that's in every market that we serve where J.D. Power measures us. I strongly believe the best is yet to come. Our goal is to take the best video experience and make it even better. 
Earlier this week, we announced several connected TV apps that will further integrate our TV and wireless platforms, and there are several other really great new features that are coming soon. As U-verse has transformed the viewer experience, it has also transformed our consumer results. IP data, that's U-verse plus other consumer broadband, now represents an annualized revenue stream of almost $11 billion, growing over 19% year-over-year and making up more than half of our consumer revenues. During the quarter, we added 176,000 U-verse subscribers to reach 3.6 million in service. Our subscriber numbers were impacted somewhat this quarter by a technology upgrade and storms in some of our U-verse service areas. This caused us to pull back on some installations to handle those situations. But sales remained strong, and we feel confident that our subscriber net add levels will improve in the fourth quarter. 
We're also seeing broadband and U-verse voice over IP attach rates remaining solid. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple or quad play bundle with us. ARPU for these customers is about $170, up 6% year-over-year and penetration continues to grow. We now have 25% penetration in areas marketed to for 36 months or more and we believe there's a lot of room for growth. U-verse high-speed data also had another great quarter, adding more than 500,000 subscribers. Our U-verse broadband net adds were more than twice our TV additions, with many of these subscribers buying our newer and faster IP DSL broadband service. 
Now, let me provide a quick update on improving trends we are seeing with our Wireline business customers, which you can see on Slide 13. Thanks to robust growth in our strategic business services, we had the first sequential growth in our Wireline business revenue in 3 years. That's sequential growth for the first time in our Wireline business revenue in 3 years. And what makes this even more impressive is that this growth is occurring while we're still seeing pressure from the weak economy, slow employment and the transformation of our business to next-generation IP products. So while business continues to work their way through the economic downturn, they are still investing in services that help drive productivity and efficiency. 
Business service revenues were down 2.2% year-over-year on a reported basis and 1.7% when you adjust for last year's sale of assets in Japan. But when you look at sequential results, revenues were actually increasing. Much of this success is attributable to continued strong growth of our strategic business services, revenues from products such as ethernet, VPNs and application services, which is an almost $5.8 billion annualized revenue stream and growing at 19.3% in the third quarter and 19.1% year-to-date. So we're not only growing the revenue but continuing to grow it at a slightly larger rate. 
We are seeing data growth across a variety of industries and customers, both large and small. Global IP data and integration services are growing at more than 10%. Wholesale had its second sequential quarter of revenue growth, and we had our first quarter of broadband growth in 2 years in small business. Our wireless bundles are also increasing. These are very encouraging signs, and we plan to build on this success as we go forward. 
Now, let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 14. We said in January that we expected to deliver stable to improved consolidated margins this year, with wireless margin expansion and a disciplined focused on cost initiatives. Through the third quarter, I think it's fair to say we're delivering. Our consolidated operating margin was 19.8%. That's up 260 basis points versus the third quarter a year ago and up sequentially. And when you adjust for the storms, the technology upgrades and the Alltel costs, we would've had margins of over 20%. Our reported Wireline operating margin was 12.1% in the third quarter, down both sequentially and year-over-year. While we remain focused on cost initiatives, our results were pressured from declines in voice revenues, storm expenses, technology upgrades as we mentioned earlier. If you take those costs into account, our margins are in the mid-12% range. Our one AT&T initiatives are continuing to make progress. We continue to target cost efficiencies and simplify product offerings to deliver best-in-class services while also achieving cost savings. These initiatives are going well and help us sustain solid margins while still serving customers with the best-in-class operation. 
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flows. Our cash summary is on Slide 15. Through the first 9 months of the year, cash from operations totaled $27.2 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $14.7 billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $12.4 billion with our third quarter free cash flow at its highest level in 2 years and up 7% for the year. And dividend payments totaled $7.6 billion. In terms of uses of cash, net debt is down more than $8 billion over the past 5 quarters, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.41. Our balance sheet is solid. Our debt metrics sound, and we have more than $10 billion of cash on hand. Our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in our business, to retire debt and to continue to return substantial value to shareholders. 
Let me close with a quick recap on Slide 16. First, we are seeing great execution across the business, strong gains in all our major growth drivers, mobile broadband, U-verse, strategic business services. Second, as Ralph said, mobile broadband growth has been terrific, and the fourth quarter is shaping up to be one of our best yet. Data revenue growth is strong. Churn is down. Smartphone sales continue to grow. And maybe the biggest news this quarter is the first sequential revenue growth from business Wireline customers in 3 years. Overall, these results produced another solid quarter for us, with double-digit adjusted earnings growth and strong free cash flow, allowing us to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to move ahead with our efforts on the T-Mobile transaction. Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. I think we're ready for Q&A."

And this technology quite frankly is the best I have ever seen in my career. The network technology is fantastic. The devices are fast. They're thin. They have great battery life. It's the first time that I think a network transition is going to be a home run right off the bat. As we launched 3G, it took us about 6 months to a year to really get some really, really cool handsets. This is happening right now with our launch. So I think we've timed it perfectly. And when you complement that what we're doing with HSPA+, I couldn't be more happy. What I see happening with LTE and data, Simon, is just a huge growth opportunity. We mentioned today that our smartphones now make up 52% of our postpaid base. But I think the way we need to think about smartphones in the future is the smartphone is going to equal the phone in the future. It will be 100% in the next 2 or 3 years. These devices are so good and the costs are coming down so much that I think in the future, you could look at close to 100% penetration, not 2/3 like we're selling today. Huge opportunity in smartphones. And then you add on top of that these new devices like tablets and MiFis and e-Readers and telematics. And the growth opportunity is off the charts on this. And then you add to that the cloud, the fact that all of these devices in the future are going to want connectivity to the cloud, which means they need to have great bandwidth, great data capability. And this is not just the demand that we're seeing in this country but all around the world. And so our business enterprise can go and pitch products to them that are based on the worldwide standard today of HSPA and LTE in the future. So I see huge growth opportunities as more smartphones penetrate our base, huge opportunity with tablets and a huge opportunity to provide a worldwide capability on a standard technology platform that is probably the best the world has. And the great thing about doing all of that is that we're doing it with a technology, LTE, that provides a reduced cost per megabyte, that is we can produce the megabyte a lot cheaper on LTE, and it's also more spectrally efficient. So lower cost, lower spectrum requirements and great revenue potential. I'm very bullish on what we're seeing in data, and I think we've only seen the tip of the iceberg because customers love the devices that are coming out and they love using high-speed data."

We'll make those decisions at the end of the year and make our determinations on funding at that time. I will tell you, with that being said, we commonly follow and review this process and in all our business plans and processes going forward. We have assumptions for pension funding and believe that we can handle those in normal course of our business within the normal course of cash flows that we are now generating. And quite frankly, they're also tax-deductible, so while the funding dollars going in at 100%, we get the tax benefits that come back at about $0.40 to the dollar. So that's the issue with funding. We'll have more knowledge about that as the results come in for the plans and as we make our elections on funding. Second, second piece on cash taxes, certainly the bonus depreciation rules have provided us a benefit this year, as tax planning has provided our company benefits for a number of years. This quarter is a great example because in comparing year-over-year results, when we show our 13% growth in earnings per share. That's after taking out a significant tax gain out of last year's results. So my point being though is as with the bonus depreciation rules that it provides us, we continue to plan for that. That payback period is a couple of years out for us, and we expect to have other opportunities to offset some, if not all, of that cash pressure."

But if you look at this quarter, we came in around 32% for our EBITDA margins if you adjust for the storms and the technology upgrade costs. And we came in around 12.5% if you do those same adjustments on an operating income basis. I think on a full year basis, we're probably in the 10 to 20 basis points lagging on an operating income basis, last year's operating income margins for Wireline. So we're hopeful that we can make that up in the fourth quarter. We'll see if we can or not, but we're hopeful about that. So we continue to believe that we have an opportunity to sustain margins at this level or even slightly better than we've done in this quarter, and we're working hard to do that. It is a challenging endeavor. Specifically, as you all know, transforming the business from high-margin legacy products to these next-generation U-verse IP and other services. With regard to our DSL, the most encouraging piece of the DSL story, and while our net adds for the quarter were about in the 5,000 range. The most encouraging piece of it was the fact that we had 500,000 high-speed U-verse/IP DSLAM net adds. So we were able to convert a huge piece of our legacy DSL base into U-verse/IP DSLAM, and we saw gains in small business with that IP DSLAM product for the first time. We'll continue to focus on transforming those DSL lines into high speed. We get great speeds, great service to our customers, good ARPUs. On those areas where we don't have U-verse, I think our plans have been fairly clear. We expect to have an LTE rollout to 97% of the country. And as Ralph talked about, we're getting great results where we have it so we believe that's going to be able to provide a wireless solution at a high speed, good quality, good cost on a profitable basis for us.

I understand your comment about handset sales impacting margins and they clearly do and they clearly will in the fourth quarter. But with that being said, I think Ralph covered it. For our margins for the quarter reported basis of 43.7%, when you adjust for the merger cost, the close to 44%, they included almost 5 million smartphone sales. And when you compare it to the prior quarter before an iPhone launch, our margins are not only 60 basis points higher but we have almost 1 million more smartphone sales. And so our point is that while someone may jump to the conclusion that it's a handset driven, and certainly the handsets have an impact, the reality of it is there was a lot of good hard work by the entire management team on all fronts to generate these great margins. It wasn't just a differential on handsets because I sold 900,000 more handsets this quarter than I did in the last pre-iPhone launch. That's the first point. And, Ralph, did I miss anything with that?"

And that's what we expect is going to happen in greater numbers in the fourth quarter. Third quarter was simply slow because we didn't have an iPhone launch in the third quarter like we did a year ago, but we think that's going to dramatically change and get those back into 2% range. I also mentioned in my notes that we have another device that I think is going to dramatically change those people that are on smartphones and quick messaging devices, the 3GS, which is free with a 2-year contract. We've seen a tremendous, tremendous demand for that device even though it's a generation old. And actually, we're getting more new subscribers coming on the 3GS on the average than other devices. So we’re also out of inventory, sold out on that device. And so I'm very, very optimistic on what the fourth quarter is going to look like in terms of smartphone growth. And that's what typically drives the ARPU growth, Mike. So we feel very, very confident. The Alltel impact was in the range of about 23 basis points, Mike. But the majority of it was driven through smartphone growth, and we are very confident that's going to pick up in the fourth quarter. Okay, the other question on the technology upgrade. Typically, when we provide new upgrades to U-verse, we required a few more dispatches so we planned for that. This time, we reduced promotions so that we could provide good service intervals to customers when they reported any issues with the transition. It worked extremely well. That work is behind us, and now we'll go back to the regular output -- mode of business in the fourth quarter."

So I just kind of wanted to see if you could give us a peek into the rest of the year for the CapEx plans. And then second if I could, Ralph, just taking another kind of crack at this topic. You guys are talking about half the smartphone base on tiered plans, which means that half the smartphones are still paying you kind of $30 a month and as those guys upgrade their phones and as their life cycle evolves, they'll probably move down the curve. And you've already gotten more than half your base on a smartphone, so the next 47% of your base is going to be taking cheaper smartphones and maybe cheaper plans and maybe not taking a smartphone at all if they can afford it. So as you look down the track with this pressure on the existing smartphone base to lower ARPUs to the existing tiers and the next half of the smartphone base being the lower tiered customers, are you still optimistic that the ARPU can grow in the face of those forces?"

I don't think anybody would've expected it to be dramatic in this economic environment.

Maybe just give us a little bit more granularity there and help us think about when that can level out because that's still 60% of the postpaid ARPU? And then second, just on handset upgrade rates, you had 7% this quarter. That’s the lowest rate we've seen in a while, obviously contributed a very strong margins. Help us think through this.

But the biggest impact to the third quarter ARPU number was still data. It wasn't voice. In terms of the upgrade, the changes in upgrade policy do not impact this year. They'll impact next year.
