Today, with me and participating in the presentation is Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Schade, the company's Chief Financial",2915,"Thank you, now, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our year-end 2010 Earnings Call. Today, with me and participating in the presentation is Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Schade, the company's Chief Financial Officer. Also with me today and available to answer questions are Jason Few, who runs NRG's Retail Company, Reliant; and Chris Moser, who runs the commercial operations functions of this company.
So without further ado, to begin. So ladies and gentlemen, currents and perspective shareholders of NRG, as we speak today, it's now been 32 months since natural gas prices began their relentless fall, and the economy at large entered into a great recession, the likes of which of us wish to experience again in our lifetimes. Yet the financial performance of NRG during this period has been superb. And that financial performance has been built on the foundation of an equally exceptional operating performance across all phases of our operations and across all our regions.
In 2010, the second full year of the great recession, our financial performance surpassed all previous years and company results, say for fiscal year 2009, which was of course the first year of the great recession, a year in which we performed spectacularly, achieving both record financial performance and the acquisition of Reliant.
While I am, for the most part, extremely pleased about the companies financial and operating performance during 2010, I am acutely mindful of the fact that NRG shareholders did not see any of the benefits of our exceptional performance and share price appreciation during that year.
As a management team, we recognize that we have a long way to go in presenting NRG's present value and future potential to the market.
In this presentation and in subsequent presentations that Mauricio, Chris and I will be making during the spring Investor Relations season, we intend to make a concerted effort to explain the NRG value proposition.  From the competitive strength of our core businesses, even in the low commodity price environment, to the meaningful and value of our growth opportunities, as well as our effective risk mitigation in areas which we believe to be of concern to the investment community.
So starting with 2010, as summarized on Slide 3, the company continue to generate a very high level of EBITDA in excess of $2.5 billion, and also throw off a substantial amount of free cash flow.  Indeed, in regards to what should perhaps to be the most important metric to shareholders, free cash flow yield, our free cash flow yield per 2010 was a robust 29%, making our seven-year average exceed 23%. And in response to some people have said that we should measure free cash flow for these purposes after both maintenance and environmental CapEx, we have done it in that way but before growth CapEx.
The substantial amount of that free cash flow yield was redeployed back to stakeholders in the form of debt repayment and through our 2010 share buyback program, and also in the various growth initiatives in which we'll discuss in a minute. But over $650 million of excess free cash flow was returned as cash into the company's coffers, with the resulting that our liquidity position in the end of 2010, $4.3 billion of total liquidity with $3 billion of cash on hand, is stronger than it has ever been. 
It has always been my position that next to safety, the most important thing that we do as executive management at NRG is capital allocation, and given the amount that we are investing on an annual basis and the record amount that we currently have available either to invest in growth or to return to our equity and debt stakeholders, capital allocation has never been more important than it is now. As such, I'm going to put that the greater part of my are remaining remarks on capital, which we expect to invest in our growth initiatives in the months and years to come. Chris will focus a good deal of his comments on capital to be returned to stakeholders.
In terms of the allocation of capital to our growth initiatives, it's important to start with the obvious point that we want to invest the company's capital and assets and initiatives that are not only are likely to yield a return significantly in excess of our risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, but also in business and initiatives which advance the company's strategy. 
As depicted on Slide 4, the company's long-term strategy for some time has been. First, to strengthen and enhance our generation two retail business in our core markets through superior operating performance, continued implementation of our first lean enabled long-term hedging program, and pursuit of both select acquisitions and the repowering of our older facilities with advantage locations inside load pockets in our core market. This part of our strategy, which we have pursued with relentless consistency in a high degree of effectiveness for the past five years was joined a couple of years ago with a supplemental strategy that is overtly green and designed to take advantage of the societal trend towards sustainability.
This has been really in our opinion about to accelerate as a result of the emergence of various consumer-oriented disruptive technologies, which will make green energy at the consumer level the focal point of sustainability. We made considerable progress on both strategic fronts during 2010, with substantial advances across every facet of our sustainability initiatives.
From our rollout of our eVgo network in Houston, which is centered around in innovative fueling package in approach to elected vehicle infrastructure that is already being replicated in other locations, to the smart meter esense applications now being sold by Reliant in quantity, to our unique approach to CCS/EOR being funded in collaboration with the DOE at our facility Harris facility in Texas.  All of these initiatives are exciting and off to a good start, all will come in continent, return value to NRG to shareholders in the medium-term. 
We will hear more about these initiatives in the future but not today, because today consistent with my theme, to concentrate my comments on the growth initiatives which are more immediate and which are key priorities for deployment of your investment capital during 2011.  This is shown on Slide 6. 
By way of background, in 2010, we've committed substantial growth capital in four general areas: zero carbon renewables with an emphasis on solar, new advanced nuclear development, conventional gas-fired acquisitions and repowering's and green retail acquisitions in the form of Green Mountain Energy. All four are likely to be areas of additional capital expenditure in 2011, but with very different investment profiles from 2010.
First, we expect an acceleration and significant expansion in our equity capital invested in high growth, high return solar projects at the greater part of our utility scale solar portfolio should achieve financial close and enter the construction phase during 2011.
Second, investment in conventional and generation assets to be relatively flat year-over-year, and spending on GenConn and Cottonwood should give way to spending on El Segundo. But conventional CapEx could increase depending on our development success as stories will on Encina and also, whether we find any strategic asset that can be acquired at value.
Third capital invested in Green Retail should drop precipitously as obviously to big expenditure in this area in 2010 with the acquisition of Green Mountain. The amount of capital that we'll be investing in and around Green Mountains business in 2011, or to expand into new geographic markets, bigger customers segments and new complimentary green product offerings is fairly minimal.
And finally, and similarly and perhaps, contrary to popular investor belief, even in the STP nuclear Department projects stays on course, the development capital projected to be required of NRG in 2011 will be far less than half of what we invested in 2010, and will be mere fraction of what we'll be investing in solar projects and other capital allocation alternatives. 
So this is a lot to digest so let's go through a little bit more slowly, starting on Slide 7 with Green Mountain. Four months ago, we paid $357 million for business that we expect to contribute $78 million of EBITDA in 2011. Plus, we expect Green Mountain to continue to deliver on a 20-plus percent compound annual growth rate trajectory that they have delivered for the past decade. 
But we didn't acquire Green Mountains just to continue with business as usual. We want to take advantage and we wanted them to take advantage of what we believe are very substantial synergies between Green Mountain at NRG. Essentially, we want Green Mountain to accelerate the depth and breath of their growth in close cooperation with us on the same path that they were following on their own, which means expansion into a high retail price northeast markets where they start with a natural green, leaning constituency. Also, expansion into the larger Commercial segment of the C&I market than they had previously sought to access and finally, expansion of their value-added product offerings to distribute Green generation.
It's early days yet but on at least the first two of these, they are already beginning to bear fruit. Green Mountain has established a small but fast-growing footprint in New York Zone J, and in terms of larger C&I customers, they have won landmark business like the Empire State building. We expect to be reporting on these and many more successes, from and with Green Mountain as the year progresses.
Turning to conventional generation on Slide 8. 2010 was an uneven year, with the successful acquisition of Cottonwood and the Repowering at Devon and Middletown, balanced by the missed opportunities surrounding Dynegy's California asset. Cottonwood and Devon have been smoothly integrated into our south-central and mid-pool lineups respectively, and we are very pleased with the results today. 
Looking forward to 2011, we're very focused on the successful repowering of El Segundo, an advantage which we hope to derive from having a modern, fast-start, low-heat rate, combined cycle plant inside the Los Angeles basin load pocket. 
Beyond El Segundo, we hope to make progress on similar Repowering efforts at Astoria in New York City and in Encina in San Diego, California. Beyond our own Repowering pipeline, the capital we deployed in the acquisition of conventional power plants obviously will depend on market conditions and asset availability in our core regions.
While the acquisition market is lumpy, generalities are difficult and predictions are often proved wrong. The optimism I once held at the first half of 2011 would be a buyer's market for CCGTs in the United States has largely dissipated. I see no sign of a flood of assets on the market, and the combined cycle of transactions which have been announced recently have been priced at levels significantly above what we could justify to ourselves or explain to our shareholders.
With respect to our nuclear projects, while important steps forward have occurred in several areas since our last earnings call, very little of it can be seen within our naked eye. As before, really all critical aspects of the STP 3 & 4 projects run off of our receipt of an acceptable conditional loan guarantee from the government. Certainly, it's a challenge for us to complete meaningful discussions about PPAs with potential off-Takers, while the loan guarantee application remains pending.
So our exit ramp analysis, which is set forth on Slide 9, remains largely unchanged from the previous quarter. Likewise, our viewpoint with respect to NRG's continued participation in the project remains at the most challenging of these hurdles, which is the long-term off-Take requirement, effectively committees to be addressed no later than the third quarter of 2011 before the project enters the substantial pre-construction phase. As such, we reiterate a view which is clearly articulated in both our 10-K and in today's earnings release, that NRG will be in a position by late this summer to make a final decision and our continued financial participation in this project.  At that point, the market to a substantially greater clarity about the prospects for this project and NRG's role in it.
While we understand that there is skepticism amongst some investors that the project and go forward in the current low gas price environment, we nonetheless, believe it might be helpful to you for us to outline as shown on Slide 10 the future capital commitment of NRG in respect to this project. Should it stay on track, with NRG continue to support it financially. 
The overall message is that due to a combination of the first, the very substantial sum that NRG has previously committed to the private development, particularly during the first half of 2010 after the settlement with CPS. Second, taking into account our expectation of an optimal hold amount on the project for energy NRG of approximately 40%, which is down from the 67% that we will own if and when TEPCO invests in a project post loan guarantee award and third, due to the value ascribed for contribution of this site, NRG's cash commitment to the project going forward is less than what otherwise would be suggested by our projected ownership level.
In summary, should the project proceed to financial closing, the total cash commitment for NRG at our 40% hold level, should be something just short of $800 million in aggregate, including cash invested to date. Beyond that, we're likely to have an LV commitment to stand by equity crossover line facility that will be fixed, and while that number is not yet been finally fixed, you should be thinking in the range of a few hundred million dollars maximum. 
In exchange for this sized investment in STP 3 & 4, we expect cash flow from dividends and tax benefits in the range of $500 million a year for the first several years of operations. Obviously, this is a very attractive return, but one which we believe is well just justified given the extraordinary challenges of the undertaking.
Now pulling it back from where we hope the project will be in 2016 or 2017, to where we are here in the first quarter of 2011, you should be focused on what happens after announcements of acceptance of the loan guarantee. As the loan guarantee acceptance national will trigger certain funding obligations from our partners, NRG's share of developments spend for the remainder of the development phase, should approximate $50 million for all of 2011, and half back for 2012. 
While our perspective in 2011, 2012 is perhaps, substantially less than we are anticipating, it remains a lot of money to us, and we're taking vary seriously our commitment to retain our financial discipline around this project and prevent exposure of our balance sheet beyond the specific commitments that I've outlined in this presentation.
Now turning to Slide 11, last but surely not least, there is the solar pipeline. I've said many times and I'll repeat here that in my 20 years of this business, I had never seen investment opportunities in this sector that offer more attractive combination of high returns, low construction risks, long-term PPAs, and repeatable business opportunities than the utility-sized solar projects that we currently have in our advanced development portfolio. 
As such, we intend to do as much of this business as we can get our hands on, with the result being that by the end of this year, we may well have a total initial equity investment in our solar portfolio that exceeds the total amount that we may ever invest in STP 3 & 4 at very attractive near-term returns.
The limiting item for us in terms of these solar investments, is our ability on our own to make optimal use of the considerable tax benefits which will be generated by these projects. This is a topic that Chris Schade will discuss in a few minutes.
While I will end by saying is that this extraordinary pipeline of utility-sized solar projects, which our colleagues at NRG solar have mastered to develop or acquire, provides us with a truly unique opportunity to develop over the next few years, a solar portfolio of true scale and significant benefit even in the context of the larger portfolio of NRG.
Ultimately however, we fully recognize that the current generation of utility-sized solar and wind projects in the United States is largely enabled by favorable government policies and financial assistance. It seems likely that much of that special assistant is going to be phased out over the next few years, leaving renewable technologies depend for themselves in the open market. 
We do not believe that this will be the end of the flourishing market for solar generation. We do believe it will lead to a stronger and more accelerated transition from an industry that is currently biased towards its utility-sized solar plants, to one that's focused more on distributed even residential solar solutions on rooftops and in parking lots. 
We are already planning for this transition now within NRG, so that any potential decline in either the ability of utility-sized solar projects or in the attractiveness of the returns being realized on these project, will be exceeded in aggregate by being exceeded in aggregate by the business we are doing on smaller distributed and residential solar projects through our Green Mountain, and even our Reliant retail sales channel.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

NRG continued it's strong operating and commercial performance during the fourth quarter, making 2010 one of NRG's best years. Slide 13 highlights a few of the key accomplishments achieved in 2010.
Starting with safety, we're particularly pleased with our record performance this year. Our OSHA recordable rate improved 26% over 2009. Our top performance remained strong with 90% availability of our baseload fleet, just shy of our 2009 level. This performance was achieved despite the forced outage event and our STP nuclear plant in November, which I will cover in more detail in the next slide.
On the environmental front, we delivered our second best year and our for energy programs for exceeded our 2010 goals. As I mentioned you in our last call, our cost of the priority given the challenging economic environment our industry is facing.
Our Commercial Operations Group increased our hedge levels in 2011 and continued to look for opportunities doubt years of favorable prices. We successfully transitioned to the market in American begin integrating Green Mountain Energy and the Cottonwood combined cycle plant into our portfolio.
With respect to our projects under construction, the Indian River for environmental project continues to be on track and on budget to be operational by January 2012. Our Middletown project in Connecticut received all major equipments in the fourth quarter, and continues to be on schedule for operation this summer.
Finally, the El Segundo energy center completed aboveground demolition of two existing units and secure major equipment orders. El Segundo is on track to be operational by the summer of 2013.
Turning to our plan performance metrics on Slide 14. continues to be our number one priority. We are very proud to report that we achieve best in the industry making 2010 our best OSHA recordable year. We have 25 sites with no injuries, and nine sites certified, or recertified as OSHA sites. 
Net generation decreased by 6% in the fourth quarter due to mild weather across Texas and a on-planned outage on STP Unit 2 during the month of November. The forced outage event was the result of a break or failure during the routine testing, and was extended to repair a reactor coolant pump seal. In order to prevent recurrence, similar electrical components were checked in both units. Unit 2 is operated without any issues since it was brought back to service on November 26.
For the full year, net generation was flat from 2009 levels, increased Generation in the Northeast and South Central regions driven by the strong summer weather and the addition of Cottonwood, were offset by lower generation in California and Texas. 
For 2010, our coal fleet ability finished the year above the sub-quartile performance level for the industry. Double led the fleet with 92.6% availability factor, and limestone had the best reliability for the year, with a 1.6% forced outage rate.
Our four NRG 2.0 program exceeded the 2010 goal by $49 million, and if is on track to achieve our goal of $450 million by 2011, one year earlier than planned. Savings were achieved through a combination of reliability, capacity and efficiency improvements at generating assets and cost savings across our corporate and regional groups.
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 15, we've closed out the year with another strong quarter. Volumes at NRG margins were consistent with our forecast operations delivered better-than-expected asset management and lower operational costs. 
The Mass segment continue to drive segment improvement in net customer attrition, with a 57% reduction in the fourth quarter versus 2009. This result was driven by marketing, sales and introduction of innovative products to meet our customer needs.
In 2010, we led Texas in innovation, enrolling over 175,000 customers on our Reliant esense product and services that utilize smart grid technology. We also introduced new and unique offers like carbon-state and home protection products, adding not only incremental EBITDA, but increased customers stickiness.
We continue to maintain the lowest PUC customer complaint rate by balancing customer counter price rate. Throughout 2010, we lined successfully demonstrated the customer attrition, and expects to achieve zero net attrition in 2011.
In the C&I segment, both renewal and new deal win rate continue to improve. We have expanded our business in several Northeast states where we can leverage existing energy assets and increased product offerings to include products such as backlog generation. These are for solid platform to grow our business in 2011.
Business continues to show some fundamentals as you can see on Slide 16. Weather normalized demand grew by 2% year-on-year and north of set new winter low 57 kilowatts in February, an increase of almost 2.5% from the previous record. I'd like to take this opportunity to address the events in Texas on February 2.
The men and women of NRG Texas worked very hard to tell me the high demand for electricity due to the extreme cold conditions come increasing or generation by more than 60% from the previous day. Although we have some operational issues, of the approximately 9,500 megawatts of power we have available in Texas during the low-shed event, we maintained between 97% and 91% of that capacity online.
I want to thank all our employees in Texas for their dedication and extraordinary efforts during these events.
Now moving on to reserve volumes in America, we see positive picture of our generation portfolio with faster than expected. This is to some extent reflected in the forward heat rates. As you can see on the chart on the lower right-hand quarter. We believe this trend will continue given the robust growth and the expectation that asset retirement will outpace new builds. We have not seen as much gas switching Texas as we have in the Northeast and Southeast regions. In fact, cash generation was down year-on-year due to increases in new coal and wind generation in Texas.
In the Northeast, the market continues to make some news. In New York, the recent FERC order to increase cost of new entry should provide capacity prices in New York City and rest of state, benefiting our New York portfolio. In PJM, prices remain uncertain until more clarity is given around the minimum offer price rule, the generation in New Jersey and Maryland and renew demand outlook.
Moving on to Slide 17, you can see our detailed plans from sole air emissions from each of our coal plants. As stated in our last earnings call, our plan is to invest approximately $720 million through 2015 in environmental stated to comply with future regulations. Just to remind everyone, the proposed rule does not require additional capital for compliance and have mass proposed what should be released in mid-March, and as you can see in the table, our as mercury controls on all our coal units.
These stake modifications and repowering are expected to meet one cooling requirements. We only have dry fly ash disposals at our all coal facilities. And finally, in most of our facilities, we burn low sulfur, low chlorine ERB coal.
Moving on to our hedge profile and commodities on Slide 18. Our base of portfolio is 100% hedged in 2011 and 50% hedged in 2012, providing the protection in the short term where gas prices today to be weaker given the oversupply situation. Beyond 2012, we chose to remain significantly open. 
After two years of low gas prices, we begin the downside risk unlimited. Our combination of incremental demand from the power sector, particularly in light of possible coal plant retirements, some signs of industry rate by producers, indication that home acreage may be ending, and a dry to gas production will provide better opportunities to catch our baseload portfolio in the future.
With respect to retail, regarding our low to 66% in 2011 from 57% in the third quarter. We continue to match as much generation as low as possible to start maximum synergies between our retail and portfolios.
Our power and coal hedges will be discontinued will be well managed in 2011 and 2012. Given the shape of the coal curve and steep, we have not added any additional in the last quarter. We also remained well hedged in terms of coal transportation now for sometime. 
Our sensitivity to commodity prices given the from 2011, with 2012 to 2015 largely unchanged from last quarter.  Let me remind you that this sensitivity is around our base of portfolio. Interest expense, our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit, particularly in the Texas and South Central regions. With that, I will turn it over to Chris who will discuss our financial results."
413857,118994653,104940,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 20, full-year 2010 adjusted EBITDA was $2.514 billion, just shy of the record 2009 adjusted EBITDA of $2.618 billion and within restated guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.55",2130,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 20, full-year 2010 adjusted EBITDA was $2.514 billion, just shy of the record 2009 adjusted EBITDA of $2.618 billion and within restated guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion. As a result of our continued stopping performance, adjusted cash flow from operations for 2010 was robust at $1.76 billion.
The company's liquidity position at year end including funds deposited by our counter-parties stood by nearly $4.3 billion, a $458 billion increase from December 31, 2009, liquidity of approximately $3.8 million.  Our cash balance at year end 2010 available for both working capital, as well as our 2011 capital allocation program was approximately $2.9 billion.
Now turning to the summary of our 2011 guidance and Capital Allocation Plan. First, we reaffirmed the preliminary 2011 EBITDA guidance range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Second, and as part of our 2011 capital allocation program, we are planning to repurchase $180 million of common stock, and complete $240 million of term loan payment and $39 million for additional facilities, all of which is consistent with NRG's commitment to return excess capital to it's stakeholders.
Third, in 2011, in addition to the amounts deferred from 2010 as a result of extending the cash grant availability, we are currently planning to commit an additional $640 million of net investment to advance our Repowering and renewable development program, particularly, utility scale solar.
Now turning to a more detailed review of 2010 adjusted EBITDA result from Slide 21. The company reported near record results of $2.514 billion adjusted EBITDA, only $104 million lower than the nano adjusted EBITDA of $2.618 billion. These results were achieved despite the decline in forward prices across all of our regions, and clearly benefited from our wholesale generation hedging program and the continued strong performance of Reliant Energy. 
During the year, Reliant Energy contributed $711 million of adjusted EBITDA, comparatively, these results are lower by $158 million from 2009 as we over for over eights months of that year.  The year-on-year decline was driven by an 18% decline in Mass margins, which were the direct result of price reductions enacted following the acquisition, as well as lower margins on customer renewals and new customer acquisitions reflect about the competitive market. 
All told, for 2010, Reliant on net customer attrition rate improved 20.4% from 0.7% in 2009 with total customers at year end steady at $1.5 million.
The wholesale business meanwhile generated $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $173 million lower as compared to a record 2009 EBITDA of $1.976 billion. The comparative year-to-date decline is largely explained by a 32% drop in baseload hedge prices in the Northeast, as well as low margins in Texas, caused by a 60% increase in fuel costs, due largely to higher coal transportation costs at our WA Parish facility. These results were partially upset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA of $28 million from the South Central region due to increases in generation and contracted sales. 
Also increasing adjusted EBITDA were our nearly acquired assets, including Green Mountain Energy, Cottonwood, Northwind Phoenix, South Trent Wind Farm, as well as the full year of operations from the Blythe solar project.
For the fourth quarter, the company reported adjusted EBITDA results of $444 million, a $45 million decline versus 2009. Reliant Energy contributed $170 million of adjusted EBITDA compared to $n104 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Reliant's quarterly results were favorable of $13 mil driven by an improvement in operating costs primarily due to better customer payment habits as related to a decrease of bad debt expense.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, our Wholesale generation business contributed $327 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $58 million declined compared to fourth quarter '09. The change results can largely be attributed to the following items: In the Northeast region, 35% lower hedge prices and a 25% decrease in generation, resulted in a $57 million decline in energy margins quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in generation was largely a result of coal-to-natural gas switching and offsetting this decline in energy margins were favorable year-over-year operating and maintenance expenses of $30 million.
In Texas, the 10% decline in generation at Limestone and WA Parish facilities to lower prices and reduced demand, led to a 6% decline in overall generation for the region. Offsetting this decline were favorable year-on-year operating expense of $17 million that include a gain of land sales of $6 million in 2010.
Now turning to Slide 22 as I mentioned a moment ago, total liquidity at year-end 2010 including funds to private by hedged count remains strong at nearly $4.252 billion. Total cash stood at $2.959 billion, an increase of $653 million as compared to the 2009 year-end cash balance of $2.3 billion. The drivers of the cash increase included adjusted cash from operations of $1.76 billion and debt proceeds of $1.317 billion. 
These increases were offset by several items; first, five completed acquisitions totaling about $1 billion, which included $507  for Cottonwood generation station, $357 million for Green Mountain, $100 million for Northwind Phoenix, $33 million for South Trent Wind Farm and $4 million for the U.S. solar portfolio, 720 megawatts in projects in nine states in California and Arizona. Second, debt and fee payments totaling $813 million, including Term Loan B payments of $453 million, and repayment of a common stock fund, or CSF of over $190 million.
Third, capital expenditures excluding NINA of $445 including $199 million of maintenance, $184 million of environmental primarily related to the Indian River Air Quality Control System project, and $62 million of growth investments. 
For the full year, we made cash contributions to NINA totaling $170 million primarily in the first half of 2010. And finally, we completed share repurchases of 8.5 million shares totaling $180 million.
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 23. Our EBITDA guidance remains unchanged from our November 24 range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Including in this guidance range, our wholesale expectations of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, retail expectations of $480 million to $570 million, and Green Mountain of $70 million to $80 million. As discussed earlier, we are about 100% hedged on our baseload generation for 2011, and are best comfortable with our forecasted results.
As we look forward to our Wholesale business in 2012, we are currently in excess of 50% hedged with a higher average price in 2011 as indicated in our SEC filings. Due to this position and based on the current board curves, we expect flat to marginally lower year-on-year wholesale results in 2012 from 2011. These results will be supplemented with adjusted EBITDA of $85 million from our repowering and solar investments in 2012 that are not subject to market fluctuations.
For our retail business in 2011, our current expectations assuming normal weather, are an EBITDA range of $480 million to $570 million, a  decrease in 2011 guidance compared to current 2010 results as largely explained by lower unit margins in Reliant's Mass business, Reliant's C&I business margins are also expected to decline slightly, but will directly offset by higher terawatt-hours served reflecting our continued dedication to this growing client base in both Texas and PJM.
Finally, we expect Green Mountain Energy contribute $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. We are very excited about enhancing the growth prospects for our Green Energy Retail business during the process of integrating the business for their growing renewables portfolio to enhance these future growth prospects.
During our Q3 Earnings Call, we discussed the 2011 free cash flow guidance of $4.25 to $625 million, and we now currently anticipate free cash flow for 2011 to be in a range of $150 million to $350 million. The difference in guidance is largely explained by certain timing of solar projects, due to Congress extending the availability of cash grants for renewable projects through 2011. NRG postponed its large investments of solar projects from 2010 to 2011 resulting in $267 million of solar expenditures pushed into '11 and relates primarily to our Agro cayote, and CDS solar projects.
As we often like to emphasize, we are in a strong cash flow position based on Friday's closing stock price of $20.89 and our affirmed outlook, free cash flow before growth yield currently stands at between 16% to 20%, or $3.36 to $4.17 per share.
Slide 24 shows the company's projected 2011 year-end cash position which we project to be about $2.5 billion. Beginning with the portion of the Capital Allocation Plan that includes share repurchases and debt repayments in 2011, the company intent to repurchase $180 million of common stock, which is within the constraint of the restricted payments basket, repay $240 million of debt related to our Term Loan B agreement, and approximately $39 million in other facilities, it's important to the company made a Term Loan B prepayment in November that totaled $200 million. 
And finally, complete $907 million of capital allocation in the following projects: $50 million in NINA. $219 million for other Repowering Investments including El Segundo, GenConn Middletown, eVgo, Texas reliability and Princeton Hospital and $638 million for solar projects net of cash grant proceeds, and including the $267 million of deferred payments from 2010.
During the Third Quarter Conference Call, I also mentioned that we usually maintain a minimum cash balance of $700 million largely for working capital margin requirements, the timing of cash payment of interests, property taxes, as well as equity for products we have under construction throughout the year.
Thus, for 2011, we estimated a balance of just over $1.8 billion to allocate between perhaps additional share repurchases, contingent on the restricted payment basket expansion, further investment of high growth opportunities and continued opportunistic management of our debt structure. 
On January 11, the company should $1.2 billion of 7 5/8 senior notes due 2018, and announced the simultaneous cash tender for $1.2 billion of the outstanding 7.25% senior notes due 2014. As of January 25, nearly 945 million bonds have intended, and the remaining 250 million will be redeemed by the end of February pursuant to the embedded coal price.
As a result, we've improved our debt maturity profile, for all of our public debt maturing after 2016, and replace the restricted covenant package with one permitting greater efficiency and flexibility to return value to all energy stakeholders. On a go forward basis, we will continue to moderate the embedded coals into 2016 and '17 maturities, and be opportunistic about replacing those bonds with less restricted covenant packages, similarly to how we handled the 2014 maturity.
Looking at NRG's combined Repowering and Solar portfolio and our EBITDA contribution on Slide 25, you can clearly see the benefit of the program with nearly $550 million of recurring contribution by 2015.
During the fourth quarter, our El Segundo Repowering project receive prior approval from California Public Utilities Commission for a tenure Power Purchase Agreement with Southern California Edison. Commercial operations is expected in the summer of 2013.
Our large utility scale solar projects will also begin to reach commercial operations between the summer of '13 and the first quarter of 2014, and these projects collectively, are driving this EBITDA growth.  Reseller investments are attractive for their high-teens returns, very low construction risks and offtake agreement of 20-plus years with highly rated counter parties. We will continue to provide updates in the progress of these projects as they moved into construction and operation.
As we continue to invest and grow our solar portfolio, it's important to highlight a few economic benefits created with these projects. Slide 26 shows how the combination of cash grant, maker's depreciation and strong cash flows from the PPAs for our projects, result in a payback for our investment, in some cases by 2014 and retain stable cash flows for the remaining term of the PPAs. 
So we believe there will be a turnaround of commodity markets, we are mindful of our ability to create enough taxable income for us to fully absorb tax benefits created by these solar investments. There is clearly a limit to how much tax efficiency we could absorb in anyone year before reducing the total product returns.  As such, to both minimize the tax leakage and enhance our returns, in 2011, we will pursue new equity investors for our solar portfolio to have both the appetite for tax benefits and seek investment one of the largest utility scale solar portfolios in the world. New equity investors will not only help to optimize our existing tax position but allow us to continue to invest in future projects with high returns.
We expect to launch this initiative soon, and look forward to sharing the progress in the future. Now I'll pass it back to David for final comments."

When and how quickly gas prices will recover remains open to conjecture but the case for raising heat rates in our core market of Texas is clear and compelling, and we've positioned our portfolio and our hedge to benefit from that upturn. 
Second, even a environment that has been more conservative in the past year, market mandates for renewable generation and for solar power in particular, remain well supported in both the red and blue states, and the result for us has been a fast-growing portfolio projects that will contribute substantially to shareholder value creation over the short to medium-term.
Finally, there's the inherent value unique amongst our peer group of Wholesale generation combined with the leading retail positioned. While we have executed to such great success in Texas, together with Reliant, we are now in a position to replicate with Green Mountain in the fast-growing green and retail energy sector. There's a bright future indeed, and for all of us at NRG, we'll start to realize it's advantage on behalf of the shareholders of NRG.
So Diana, with that, we'll be happy to take some questions."

But we would definitely like to have some more based load following capability in PJM, particularly Eastern PJM. Having said that, we don't have any optimism about anything coming available in that footprint that we would find probably at a reasonable price. But we keep our ear to the ground. I would say that has been our single greatest priority second to backing up Big Cajun which we've now achieved with Cottonwood."

And in fact, normally, we don't comment on this but as you said, there's been discussions by the public. I guess I should say somethings. I should say first of all, I think is an openness, a willingness, and interest on several load serving entities, large load serving entities in the Texas market to talk about long-term offtake. And I would also say that the events of early February in Texas where a part of the reason the state has rolling brownouts, or even blackouts is because people can't get gas in some power plants. I think as reinforced the idea that having fuel diversity in the state is something that load serving entities want to have. So there's a fairly high level of interest from various parties. But the big qualifier, and I always put in this question is right now, as you say, it's really a discussion.  I mean the project isn't really real to Off-Taker until we have a loan guarantee. I would rue describe anything of your doing with any counter party at this point as being preliminary. And so that's what I would tell you. And based on what we're being told by the company, our interest level I'm gaudily optimistic but mainly, my main attitude towards all of this is, let's wait and see what happens when the loan guarantee is announced, because that's when ourselves and our counter-parties are going to have to get down to business, and people are going to have two make commitments on both sides. So that's the main thing. And what we're trying to empathize here is that, that phase and hopefully, that phase will begin within the coming weeks, it's something that basically needs to be resolved by the summer so that we can all have clarity as within the company and U.S. investors, and analysts as to where we stand vis-à-vis this project."

Today, with me, and participating in the presentation is Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Schade, the company's Chief Financial Officer. Also with me today and available to answer questions are Jason Few, who runs NRG's retail company, Reliant; and Chris Moser, who runs the commercial operations function for this company.
So without further ado, to begin -- so ladies and gentlemen, current and perspective shareholders of NRG, as we speak today, it's now been 32 months since natural gas prices began their relentless fall and the economy at large entered into a great recession, the likes of which, I'm sure none of us wish to experience again in our lifetimes, yet the financial performance of NRG during this period has been superb. And that financial performance has been built on the foundation of an equally exceptional operating performance across all phases of our operations and across all our regions.
In 2010, the second full year of the great recession, our financial performance surpassed all previous years of company results, say for fiscal year 2009, which was of course the first year of the great recession, a year in which we performed spectacularly, achieving both record financial performance and the acquisition of Reliant.
While I am, for the most part, extremely pleased with both the company's financial and its operating performance during 2010, I am acutely mindful of the fact that NRG shareholders did not see any of the benefits of our exceptional performance and share price appreciation during that year.  As a management team, we recognize that we have a long way to go in presenting NRG's present value and future potential to the market.
In this presentation and in subsequent presentations that Mauricio, Chris and I will be making during the spring Investor Relations season, we intend to make a concerted effort to explain the NRG value proposition.  From the competitive strength of our core businesses, even in the low commodity price environment, to the meaningful and measurable value of our growth opportunities, as well as our effective risk mitigation in areas which we believe to be of concern to the investment community.
So starting with 2010, as summarized on Slide 3, the company continued to generate a very high level of EBITDA in excess of $2.5 billion and also throw off a substantial amount of free cash flow.  Indeed, in regard to what should perhaps be the most important metric to shareholders, free cash flow yield, our free cash flow yield for 2010 was a robust 29%, making our seven-year average exceed 23%. And in response to some people who said that we should measure free cash flow for these purposes after both maintenance and environmental CapEx, we have done it in that way but before growth CapEx.
The substantial amount of that free cash flow yield was redeployed back to stakeholders in the form of debt repayment and through our 2010 share buyback program and also in the various growth initiatives, which we'll discuss in a minute. But over $650 million of excess free cash flow was returned as cash into the company's coffers, with the result being that our liquidity position at the end of 2010, $4.3 billion of total liquidity with $3 billion of cash on hand, is stronger than it has ever been. 
It has always been my position that next to safety, the most important thing that we do as executive management at NRG is capital allocation, and given the amount that we are investing on an annual basis and the record amount that we currently have available either to invest in growth or to return to our equity and debt stakeholders, capital allocation has never been more important than it is now. As such, I'm going to focus the greater part of my remaining remarks on capital, which we expect to invest in our growth initiatives in the months and years to come. Chris will focus a good deal of his comments on capital to be returned to stakeholders.
In terms of the allocation of capital to our growth initiatives, it's important to start with the obvious point that we want to invest the company's capital and assets and initiatives that not only are likely to yield a return significantly in excess of our risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, but also in businesses and initiatives which advance the company's strategy. 
As depicted on Slide 4, the company's long-term strategy for some time has been twin-tracked. First, to strengthen and enhance our generation to retail business in our core markets through superior operating performance, continued implementation of our first-lean-enabled, long-term hedging program and pursuit of both select acquisitions and the repowering of our older facilities with advantage locations inside load pockets in our core market. This comply of our strategy which we have pursued with relentless consistency in a high degree of effectiveness for the past five years was joined a couple of years ago with a supplemental strategy that is overtly green and designed to take advantage of the societal trend towards sustainability.
This sustainability trend is in our opinion about to accelerate as a result of the emergence of various consumer-oriented disruptive technologies, which will make green energy at the consumer level the focal point of sustainability. We made considerable progress on both strategic fronts during 2010, with substantial advances across every facet of our sustainability initiative.
From our rollout of our eVgo network in Houston, which is centered around in innovative fueling package in approach to electric vehicle infrastructure that is already being replicated in other locations to the smart meter e-Sense applications now being sold by Reliant in quantity to our unique approach to CCS/EOR being funded in collaboration with the DOE at our facility Parish facility in Texas.  All of these initiatives are exciting and off to a good start. All will, I am confident, return considerable value to NRG to shareholders in the medium term. 
You will hear more about these initiatives in the future but not today, because today, consistent with my theme, I want to concentrate my comments on the growth initiatives which are more immediate and which are key priorities for deployment of your investment capital during 2011.  This is shown on Slide 6. 
By way of background, in 2010, we've committed substantial growth capital in four general areas: Zero carbon renewables, with an emphasis on solar; new advanced nuclear development; conventional gas-fired acquisitions and repowerings; and green retail acquisitions in the form of Green Mountain Energy. All four are likely to be areas of additional capital expenditure in 2011 but with very different investment profiles from 2010.
First, we expect an acceleration and significant expansion in our equity capital invested in high-growth, high-return solar projects. At the greater part of our utility scale, solar portfolio should achieve financial close and enter the construction phase during 2011.
Second, investment in conventional and generation assets should be relatively flat year-on-year, as spending on GenConn and Cottonwood should give way to spending on El Segundo, but conventional CapEx could increase depending on our development success as Astoria, Saguaro or Encina and also, whether we find any strategic assets that can be acquired at value.
Third, capital invested in green retail should drop precipitously as obviously the big expenditure in this area in 2010 with the acquisition of Green Mountain. The amount of capital that we will be investing in around Green Mountains business in 2011 or to expand into new geographic markets, bigger customers segments and new complimentary green product offerings is fairly minimal.
And finally, and similarly and perhaps, contrary to popular investor belief, even if the STP nuclear development project stays on course, the development capital projected to be required of NRG in 2011 will be far less than half of what we invested in 2010 and will be a mere fraction of what we will be investing in solar projects and other capital allocation alternatives. 
So this is a lot to digest, so let's go through a little bit more slowly, starting on Slide 7 with Green Mountain. Four months ago, we paid $357 million for a business that we expect to contribute $70 million, $80 million of EBITDA in 2011, plus, we expect Green Mountain to continue to deliver on a 20-plus percent compound annual growth rate trajectory that they have delivered for the past decade.  But we didn't acquire Green Mountain just to continue with business as usual. We wanted to take advantage, and we wanted them to take advantage of what we believe are very substantial synergies between Green Mountain and NRG. 
Essentially, we want Green Mountain to accelerate the depth and breadth of their growth in close cooperation with us on the same path that they were following on their own, which means expansion into a high retail price northeast markets, where they start with a natural green-leaning constituency, also, expansion into the larger Commercial segment of the C&I market than they have previously sought to access. And finally, expansion of their value-added product offerings include distributed green generation.
It's early days yet, but at least the first two of these, they are already beginning to bear fruit. Green Mountain has established a small but fast-growing footprint in New York Zone J, and in terms of larger C&I customers, they have won landmark business like the Empire State Building. We expect to be reporting on these and many more successes from and with Green Mountain as the year progresses.
Turning to conventional generation on Slide 8. 2010 was an uneven year, with the successful acquisition of Cottonwood and the repowering at Devon and Middletown, balanced by the missed opportunities surrounding Dynegy's California asset. Cottonwood and Devon have been smoothly integrated into our South Central and NEPOOL lineups respectively, and we are very pleased with the results today. 
Looking forward to 2011, we're very focused on the successful repowering of El Segundo, an advantage which we hope to derive from having a modern, fast-start, low-heat rate, combined-cycle plant inside the Los Angeles basin load pocket.  Beyond El Segundo, we hope to make progress on similar repowering efforts at Astoria in New York City and Encina in San Diego County. Beyond our own Repowering pipeline, the capital we deployed in the acquisition of conventional power plants, obviously, will depend on market conditions and asset availability in our core regions.
While the acquisition market is lumpy, generalities are difficult and predictions are often proved wrong, the optimism I once held at the first half of 2011 would be a buyer's market for CCGTs in the United States has largely dissipated. I see no sign of a flood of assets on the market and the combined cycle of transactions which have been announced recently have been priced at levels significantly above what we could justify to ourselves or explain to our shareholders.
With respect to our nuclear projects, while important steps forward have occurred in several areas since our last earnings call, very little of it can be seen within the naked eye. As before, really all critical aspects of the STP 3 & 4 projects run off of our receipt of an acceptable conditional loan guarantee from the government. Certainly, it's a challenge for us to complete meaningful discussions about PPAs with potential off-takers, while the loan guarantee application remains pending.
So our exit ramp analysis, which is set forth on Slide 9, remains largely unchanged from the previous quarter. Likewise, our viewpoint with respect to NRG's continued participation in the project remains at the most challenging of these hurdles, which is the long-term off-take requirement, effectively needs to be addressed no later than the third quarter of 2011 before the project enters the substantial pre-construction phase. 
As such, we reiterate a view which is clearly articulated in both our 10-K and in today's earnings release, that NRG will be in a position by late this summer to make a final decision and our continued financial participation in this project.  At that point, the market should have substantially greater clarity about the prospects for this project and NRG's role in it.
While we understand that there is skepticism amongst some investors that the project can go forward in the current low gas price environment, we nonetheless, believe it might be helpful to you for us to outline as shown on Slide 10 the future capital commitment of NRG in respect to this project, should it stay on track, with NRG continuing to support it financially. 
The overall message is that due to a combination of first, the very substantial sum that NRG has previously committed to the private development, particularly during the first half of 2010 after the settlement with CPS. Second, taking into account our expectation of an optimal hold amount in the project for energy NRG of approximately 40%, which is down from the 67% that we will own if and when TEPCO invests in a project post-loan guarantee award. And third, due to the value ascribed to NRG for its contribution of this site, NRG's cash commitment to the project going forward is less than what otherwise would be suggested by our projected ownership level.
In summary, should the project proceed to financial closing, the total cash commitment for NRG at our 40% hold level should be something just short of $800 million in aggregate, including cash invested to date. Beyond that, we are likely to have an LC commitment to a standby equity crossover line facility that will be fixed. And while that number has not yet been finally fixed, you should be thinking in the range of a few hundred million dollars maximum. 
In exchange for this size of investment in STP 3 & 4, we expect cash flow from dividends and tax benefits in the range of $500 million a year for the first several years of operations. Obviously, this is a very attractive return but one which we believe is well just justified given the extraordinary challenges of the undertaking.
Now pulling it back from where we hope the project will be in 2016 or 2017 to where we are here in the first quarter of 2011, you should be focused on what happens after announcements of acceptance of the loan guarantee. As the loan guarantee acceptance naturally, will trigger certain funding obligations from our partners, NRG's share of cash development spend for the remainder of the development phase should approximate $50 million for all of 2011 and half of that for 2012. 
While our perspective 2011, 2012 development standard is perhaps substantially less than may the market were anticipating, it remains a lot of money to us, and we're taking very seriously our commitment to retain our financial discipline around this project and prevent exposure of our balance sheet beyond the specific commitments that I've outlined in this presentation.
Now turning to Slide 11, last but certainly not least, there is the solar pipeline. I've said many times, and I'll repeat here, that in my 20 years of this business, I had never seen investment opportunities in this sector that offer more attractive combination of high returns, low construction risks, long-term PPAs and repeatable business opportunities than the utility-sized solar projects that we currently have in our advanced development portfolio. 
As such, we intend to do as much of this business as we can get our hands on, with the result being that by the end of this year, we may well have a total initial equity investment in our solar portfolio that exceeds the total amount that we may ever invest in STP 3 & 4 at very attractive near-term returns.  The limiting item for us in terms of these solar investments is our ability on our own to make optimal use of the considerable tax benefits which will be generated by these projects. This is a topic that Chris Schade will discuss in a few minutes.
What I will end by saying is that this extraordinary pipeline of utility-sized solar projects, which our colleagues at NRG Solar have mastered to develop or acquire, provides us with a truly unique opportunity to develop over the next few years a solar portfolio of true scale and significant benefit even in the context of the larger portfolio of NRG.
Ultimately, however, we fully recognize that the current generation of utility-sized solar and wind projects in the United States is largely enabled by favorable government policies and financial assistance. It seems likely that much of that special assistance is going to be phased out over the next few years, leaving renewable technologies defend for themselves in the open market. 
We do not believe that this will be the end of the flourishing market for solar generation. We do believe it will lead to a stronger and more accelerated transition from an industry that is currently biased towards utility-sized solar plants to one that's focused more on distributed and even residential solar solutions on rooftops and in parking lots. 
We are already planning for this transition now within NRG, so that any potential decline in either the ability of utility-sized solar projects or in the attractiveness of the returns being realized on these projects, will be exceeded in aggregate by the increase in the business we are doing on smaller distributed and residential solar projects through our Green Mountain and even our Reliant retail sales channel.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

NRG continued it's strong operating and commercial performance during the fourth quarter, making 2010 one of NRG's best years. Slide 13 highlights a few of the key accomplishments achieved in 2010.
Starting with safety, we're particularly pleased with our record performance this year. Our OSHA recordable rate improved 26% over 2009. Our top performance remained strong with 90% availability of our baseload fleet, just shy of our 2009 level. This performance was achieved despite the forced outage event on our STP nuclear plant in November, which I will cover in more detail in the next slide.
On the environmental front, we delivered our second best year, and our FORNRG program exceeded our 2010 goals. As I mentioned with you in our last call, controlling our cost is the priority, given the challenging economic environment our industry is facing.
Our Commercial Operations Group increased our hedge levels in 2011 and continues to look for opportunities to catch the odd years of favorable prices. We successfully transitioned to the Nodal market in ERCOT and began integrating Green Mountain Energy and the Cottonwood combined cycle plant into our portfolio.
With respect to our projects under construction, the Indian River Unit 4 environmental back-end controls project continues to be on track and on budget to be operational by January 2012. Our Middletown project in Connecticut received all major equipments in the fourth quarter and continues to be on schedule for operation this summer.  Finally, the El Segundo Energy Center completed aboveground demolition of two existing units and secured major equipment orders. El Segundo is on track to be operational by the summer of 2013.
Turning to our plant performance metrics on Slide 14. Safety continues to be our number one priority. We are very proud to report that we achieved top decile in the industry, making 2010 our best OSHA recordable year. We have 25 sites with no injuries and nine sites certified or recertified as OSHA DPPs our worksites. 
Net generation decreased by 6% in the fourth quarter due to mild weather across Texas and a 22-day on-plan outage at STP Unit 2 during the month of November. The forced outage event was the result of a breaker failure during the routine testing and was extended to repair a reactor coolant pump seal. In order to prevent recurrence, similar electric components were checked in both units. Unit 2 has operated without any issues since it was brought back to service on November 26.
For the full year, net generation was flat from 2009 levels, increased generation in the Northeast and South Central regions driven by the strong summer weather and the addition of Cottonwood, were offset by lower generation in California and Texas. 
For 2010, our coal fleet ability finished the year above the sub-quartile performance level for the industry. WA Parish led the fleet with 92.6% availability factor, and Limestone had the best reliability for the year, with a 1.6% forced outage rate.
Our FORNRG 2.0 program exceeded the 2010 goal by $49 million, and it is on track to achieve our goal of $150 million by 2011, one year earlier than planned. Savings were achieved through a combination of reliability, capacity and efficiency improvements at generating assets and cost savings across our corporate and regional groups.
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 15, we've closed out the year with another strong quarter. Volumes at NRG margins were consistent with our forecast, while Operations delivered better-than-expected asset management and lower operational costs. 
The Mass segment continues to drive segment improvement in net customer attrition with a 57% reduction in the fourth quarter versus 2009. This result was driven by marketing, sales and introduction of innovative products to meet our customer needs.
In 2010, we led Texas in innovation, enrolling over 175,000 customers on our Reliant e-Sense product and services that utilize smart grid technology. We also introduced new and unique offers like carbon-state [ph] and home protection products, adding not only incremental EBITDA but increased customer stickiness.
We continue to maintain the lowest PUC customer complaint rate while balancing customer counterpricing. Throughout 2010, we in line successfully demonstrated the decategorized [ph] customer attrition and expects to achieve zero net attrition in 2011.
In the C&I segment, both renewal and new deal win rates continue to improve. We have expanded our business in several Northeast states where we can leverage existing energy assets and increased product offerings to include products such as backlog generation. These provides a solid platform to grow our business in 2011.
Business continues to show some fundamentals as you can see on Slide 16. Weather-normalized demand grew by 2% year-on-year and ERCOT set a new winter peak low of 57 kilowatts in February, an increase of almost 2.5% from the previous record. I'd like to take this opportunity to address the events in Texas on February 2.
The men and women of NRG Texas worked very hard to determine the high demand for electricity due to the extreme cold conditions, increasing our generation by more than 60% from the previous day. Although we have some operational issues, of the approximately 9,500 megawatts of power we have available in Texas during the low-shed event, we maintained between 97% and 91% of that capacity online.  I want to thank all our employees in Texas for their dedication and extraordinary efforts during these events.
Now moving on to reserve volumes in ERCOT, we see a positive feature of our generation portfolio with reserved margins tightening faster than expected. This is to some extent reflected in the forward heat rates, as you can see on the chart on the lower right-hand quarter. We believe this trend will continue, given the robust growth and the expectation that asset retirement will outpace new builds. We have not seen as much coal-to-gas switching in Texas as we have in the Northeast and Southeast regions. In fact, cash generation was down year-on-year due to increases in new coal and wind generation in Texas.
In the Northeast, the back-end market continues to make some news. In New York, the recent FERC order to increase cost of new entry should provide a boost to capacity prices in New York City and rest of state, benefiting our New York portfolio. In PJM, prices remain uncertain until more clarity is given around the minimum offer price rule, the subsidized generation in New Jersey and Maryland and we view demand outlook.
Moving on to Slide 17, you can see our detailed plan to control air emissions for each of our coal plants. As stated in our last earnings call, our plan is to invest approximately $720 million through 2015 in environmental projects stated to comply with future regulations. 
Just to remind everyone, the proposed CATR rule does not require additional capital for compliance. The HAP MACT proposed rule should be released in mid-March, and as you can see in the table, our plant considers mercury controls on all our coal units.
Intake modifications and repowering are expected to meet once thru cooling requirements. We only have dry fly ash disposals at our all coal facilities. And finally, in most of our facilities, we burn low sulfur, low chlorine PRB coal.
Moving on to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 18. Our baseload portfolio is now 100% hedged in 2011 and 50% hedged in 2012, providing the protection in the short term where gas prices continue to be weaker given the oversupply situation. Beyond 2012, we choose to remain significantly open. 
After two years of low gas prices, we believe the downside risk is limited. Our combination of incremental demand from the power sector, particularly in light of possible coal plant retirements, some signs of the interest rate by producers, indication that drilling to home acreage may be ending, and a move from dry to wet gas production will provide better opportunities to catch our baseload portfolio in the future.
With respect to retail, we have increased our pipe load to 66% in 2011 from 57% in the third quarter. We continue to match as much generation load as possible to start maximum synergies between our retail and OSHA portfolios.
Our power and coal hedges continue to be well managed in 2011 and 2012. Given the shape of the coal curve and steep contango, we have not added any additional [ph] since the last quarter. We also remain well hedged in terms of coal transportation now for sometime. 
Our sensitivity to commodity prices given is negligible for 2011, with 2012 to 2015 largely unchanged from last quarter.  Let me remind you that this sensitivity is around our baseload portfolio. Interest expense, our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit, particularly, in the Texas and South-Central regions. 
With that, I will turn it over to Chris who will discuss our financial results."

Second, and as part of our 2011 capital allocation program, we are planning to repurchase $180 million of common stock, and complete $240 million of term loan debt repayments and $39 million for additional facilities, all of which is consistent with NRG's commitment to return excess capital to it's stakeholders.  Third, in 2011, in addition to the amount deferred from 2010 as a result of extending the cash grant availability, we are currently planning to commit an additional $640 million of net investment to advance our Repowering and renewable development program, particularly, utility-scale solar.
Now turning to a more detailed review of 2010 adjusted EBITDA result from Slide 21. The company reported near record results of $2.514 billion adjusted EBITDA, only $104 million lower than the 2009 adjusted EBITDA of $2.618 billion. These results were achieved despite the decline in forward prices across all of our regions and clearly benefited from our wholesale generation hedging program and the continued strong performance of Reliant Energy. 
During the year, Reliant Energy contributed $711 million of adjusted EBITDA. Comparatively, these results are lower by $158 million from 2009 as we underlined [ph] for only eight months of that year.  The year-on-year decline was driven by an 18% decline in Mass margins, which were the direct result of price reductions enacted following the acquisition, as well as lower margins on customer renewals and new customer acquisitions reflective of the competitive market.  All told, for 2010, Reliant on net customer attrition rate improved to 0.4% from 0.7% in 2009 with total customers at year end steady at $1.5 million.
The wholesale business meanwhile generated $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $173 million lower as compared to a record 2009 EBITDA of $1.976 billion. The comparative year-to-date decline is largely explained by a 32% drop in baseload hedge prices in the Northeast, as well as low margins in Texas, caused by a 60% increase in fuel costs, due largely to higher coal transportation costs at our WA Parish facility. These results were partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA of $28 million from the South Central region due to increases in generation and contracted sales. 
Also increasing adjusted EBITDA were our nearly acquired assets, including Green Mountain Energy, Cottonwood, Northwind Phoenix, South Trent Wind Farm, as well as the full year of operations from the Blythe solar project.
For the fourth quarter, the company reported adjusted EBITDA results of $444 million, a $45 million decline versus 2009. Reliant Energy contributed $170 million of adjusted EBITDA compared to $104 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Reliant's quarterly results were favorable $13 million driven by an improvement in operating costs primarily due to better customer payment habits as related to a decrease in bad debt expense.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, our Wholesale Generation business contributed $327 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $58 million decline compared to fourth quarter '09. The change in results can largely be attributed to the following items: In the Northeast region, 35% lower hedge prices and a 25% decrease in generation resulting in a $57 million decline in energy margins quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in generation was largely a result of coal-to-natural gas switching and offsetting this decline in energy margins were favorable year-on-year operating and maintenance expenses of $30 million.
In Texas, the 10% decline in generation at Limestone and WA Parish facilities due to lower prices and reduced demand led to a 6% decline in overall generation for the region. Offsetting this decline were favorable year-on-year operating expense of $17 million that include a gain on land sales of $6 million in 2010.
Now turning to Slide 22. As I mentioned a moment ago, total liquidity at year-end 2010 excluding funds to deposited by hedged counterparts remains strong at nearly $4.252 billion. Total cash stood at $2.959 billion, an increase of $653 million as compared to the 2009 year-end cash balance of $2.3 billion. The drivers of the cash increase included adjusted cash from operations of $1.76 billion and debt proceeds of $1.317 billion. 
These increases were offset by several items; First, five completed acquisitions totaling about $1 billion, which included $507  for Cottonwood generation station, $357 million for Green Mountain, $100 million for Northwind Phoenix, $32 million for South Trent Wind Farm and for the U.S. solar portfolio, 720 megawatts in government projects in nine states in California and Arizona. Second, debt and fee payments totaling $813 million, including Term Loan B payments of $453 million and repayment of a common stock fund or CSF of $190 million.  
And third, capital expenditures excluding NINA of $445, including $199 million of maintenance, $184 million of environmental, primarily related to the Indian River Air Quality Control System project, and $62 million of growth investments.  For the full year, we made cash contributions to NINA totaling $170 million primarily in the first half of 2010. And finally, we completed share repurchases of 8.5 million shares, totaling $180 million.
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 23. Our EBITDA guidance remains unchanged from our November 24 range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Including in this guidance range are wholesale expectations of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, retail expectations of $480 million to $570 million, and Green Mountain of $70 million to $80 million. As Mauricio had discussed earlier, we are about 100% hedged on our baseload generation for 2011 and are best comfortable with our forecasted results.
As we look forward to our Wholesale business in 2012, we are currently in excess 50% hedged with a higher average price in 2011 as indicated in our SEC filings. Due to this position and based on the current forward curves, we expect flat to marginally lower year-on-year wholesale results in 2012 from 2011. These results will be supplemented with adjusted EBITDA of $85 million from our repowering and solar investments in 2012 that are not subject to market fluctuations.
For our retail business in 2011, our current expectations, assuming normal weather, are an EBITDA range of $480 million to $570 million, the decrease in 2011 guidance compared to current 2010 results is largely explained by lower unit margins in Reliant's Mass business. Reliant's C&I business margins are also expected to decline slightly, but will be directly offset by higher terawatt-hours served, reflecting our continued dedication to this growing client base in both Texas and PJM.
Finally, we expect Green Mountain Energy to contribute $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. We are very excited about enhancing the growth prospects for our Green Energy Retail business during the process of integrating the business with our growing renewables portfolio to enhance these future growth prospects.
During our Q3 earnings call, we discussed the 2011 free cash flow guidance of $425 million to $625 million, and we now currently anticipate free cash flow for 2011 to be in a range of $150 million to $350 million. The difference in guidance is largely explained by certain timing of solar projects, due to Congress extending the availability of cash grants for renewable projects through 2011. NRG postponed its large investments in solar projects from 2010 to 2011, resulting in $267 million of solar expenditures pushed into '11 and relates primarily to our Agua Caliente, Ivanpah and CVSR solar projects.
As we often like to emphasize, we are in a strong cash flow position based on Friday's closing stock price of $20.89 and our affirmed outlook, free cash flow before growth yield currently stands at between 16% to 20%, or $3.36 to $4.17 per share.
Slide 24 shows the company's projected 2011 year-end cash position which we project to be about $2.5 billion. Beginning with the portion of the Capital Allocation Plan that includes share repurchases and debt repayments in 2011, the company intends to repurchase $180 million of common stock, which is within the constraint of the restricted payments basket, repay $240 million of debt related to our Term Loan B agreement, and approximately $39 million in other facilities. It's important to note that the company made a Term Loan B prepayment in November that totaled $200 million. 
And finally, we complete $907 million of capital allocation in the following projects: $50 million in NINA; $219 million for other Repowering investments including El Segundo, GenConn Middletown, eVgo, Texas Reliability and Princeton Hospital and $638 million for solar projects, net of cash grant proceeds, and including the $267 million of deferred payments from 2010.
During the third quarter conference call, I also mentioned that we usually maintain a minimum cash balance of $700 million largely for working capital margin requirements, the timing of cash payments, of interests, property taxes, as well as equity for projects we have under construction throughout the year.  Thus, for 2011, we estimate a balance of just over $1.8 billion to allocate between perhaps additional share repurchases, contingent on the restricted payment of basket expansion, further investments of high-growth opportunities and continued opportunistic management of our debt structure. 
On January 11, the company issued $1.2 billion of 7 5/8 senior notes due 2018 and announced the simultaneous cash tender for $1.2 billion of the outstanding 7 1/4 senior notes due 2014. As of January 25, nearly 945 million bonds have tendered, and the remaining 250 million will be redeemed by the end of February pursuant to the embedded coal price.  As a result, we've improved our debt maturity profile, for all of our public debt matures after 2016, and replace the restricted covenant package with one permitting greater efficiency and flexibility to return value to all NRG stakeholders. 
On a go forward basis, we will continue to moderate the embedded coals into 2016 and '17 maturities and be opportunistic about replacing those bonds with less restricted covenant packages, similarly to how we handle the 2014 maturity.
Looking at NRG's combined Repowering and Solar portfolio and our EBITDA contribution on Slide 25, you can clearly see the benefit of the program with nearly $550 million of recurring contribution by 2015.
During the fourth quarter, our El Segundo Repowering project received prior approval from the California Public Utilities Commission for a ten-year Power Purchase Agreement with Southern California Edison. Commercial operation's expected in the summer of 2013.
Our large utility-scale solar projects will also begin to reach commercial operations between the summer of '13 and the first quarter of 2014, and these projects collectively, are driving this EBITDA growth.  These solar investments are attractive for their high-teens returns, very low construction risks and offtake agreement of 20-plus years with highly rated counterparties. We will continue to provide updates in the progress of these projects as they move into construction and operation.
As we continue to invest and grow our solar portfolio, it's important to highlight a few economic benefits created with these projects. Slide 26 shows how the combination of cash grant, maker's depreciation and strong cash flows from the PPAs for our projects result in a payback for our investments, in some cases by 2014, and retain stable cash flows for the remaining term of the PPAs. 
While we believe there will be a turnaround of commodity markets, we are mindful of our ability to create enough taxable income for us to fully absorb tax benefits created by these solar investments. There is clearly a limit to how much tax efficiency we could absorb in any one year before reducing the total product returns.  As such, to both minimize the tax leakage and enhance our returns, in 2011, we will pursue new equity investors for our solar portfolio, who have both the appetite for tax benefits and seek investment to one of the largest utility-scale solar portfolios in the world. New equity investors would not only help to optimize our existing tax position but allow us to continue to invest in future projects with high returns.
We expect to launch this initiative soon and look forward to sharing the progress in the future. Now I'll pass it back to David for final comments."

And so in collusion, on Slide 28, we put what we think are some of the value drivers around the investment proposition at NRG. And it starts with the fact that 2 1/2 years into the commodity price down cycle, it appears to us that we ended in size, the bottom of the trough has been reached, and the only way to go is up.  When or how quickly gas prices will recover remains open to conjecture, but the case for rising heat rates in our core market of Texas is clear and compelling. And we've positioned our portfolio and our hedge to benefit from that upturn. 
Second, even in a playful environment that has turned more conservative in the past year, market mandates for renewable generation and for solar power in particular, remain well supported in both the red and blue states. And the result for us has been a fast-growing portfolio of projects that will contribute substantially to shareholder value creation over the short to medium-term.
Finally, there's the inherent value unique amongst our peer group of Wholesale generation combined with the leading retail position. While we have executed to such great success in Texas, together with Reliant, we are now in a position to replicate with Green Mountain in the fast-growing green and retail energy sector. It's a bright future indeed, and for all of us at NRG, we'll strive to realize its vantage on behalf of the shareholders of NRG.
So Diana, with that, we'll be happy to take some questions."

And in fact, normally, we don't comment on it but since as you said, there's been discussions by the public. I guess, I should say some things. I would say, first of all, I think there's an openness, a willingness, and interest on several load-serving entities, large load-serving entities in the Texas market to talk about long-term offtake. And I would also say that the events of early February in Texas, where a part of the reason the state have rolling brownouts or even blackouts is because people couldn't get gas to some power plant, I think has reinforced the idea that having fuel diversity in the state is something that load-serving entities want to have. So there's a fairly high level of interest from various parties, but the big qualifier, I always put in this question is, right now, as you say, it's really discussions.  I mean, the project isn't really real to off-takers until we have a loan guarantee. So I would describe anything that we're doing with any counterparty at this point is being preliminary. And so that's what I would tell you. And based on what we're being told by the camp, their interest level, I'm gullibly optimistic. But mainly, my main attitude towards all of this is, let's wait and see what happens when the loan guarantee's announced, because that's when ourselves and our counterparties are going to have to get down to business, and people are going to have to make commitments on both sides. So that's the main thing, and what we're trying to empathize here is that, that phase and hopefully, that phase will begin within the coming weeks, is something that basically needs to be resolved by the summer so that we can all have clarity as within the company and U.S. investors and analysts as to where we stand vis-à-vis this project."

Today, with me, and participating in the presentation is Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Schade, the company's Chief Financial Officer. Also with me today and available to answer questions are Jason Few, who runs NRG's retail company, Reliant; and Chris Moser, who runs the commercial operations function for this company.
So without further ado, to begin -- so ladies and gentlemen, current and perspective shareholders of NRG, as we speak today, it's now been 32 months since natural gas prices began their relentless fall and the economy at large entered into a great recession, the likes of which, I'm sure none of us wish to experience again in our lifetimes, yet the financial performance of NRG during this period has been superb. And that financial performance has been built on the foundation of an equally exceptional operating performance across all phases of our operations and across all our regions.
In 2010, the second full year of the great recession, our financial performance surpassed all previous years of company results, save for fiscal year 2009, which was of course the first year of the great recession, a year in which we performed spectacularly, achieving both record financial performance and the acquisition of Reliant.
While I am, for the most part, extremely pleased with both the company's financial and its operating performance during 2010, I am acutely mindful of the fact that NRG shareholders did not see any of the benefits of our exceptional performance and share price appreciation during that year. As a management team, we recognize that we have a long way to go in presenting NRG's present value and future potential to the market.
In this presentation and in subsequent presentations that Mauricio, Chris and I will be making during the spring Investor Relations season, we intend to make a concerted effort to explain the NRG value proposition. From the competitive strength of our core businesses, even in a low commodity price environment, to the meaningful and measurable value of our growth opportunities, as well as our effective risk mitigation in areas which we believe to be of concern to the investment community.
So starting with 2010, as summarized on Slide 3, the company continued to generate a very high level of EBITDA in excess of $2.5 billion and also throw off a substantial amount of free cash flow. Indeed, in regard to what should perhaps be the most important metric to shareholders, free cash flow yield, our free cash flow yield for 2010 was a robust 29%, making our seven-year average exceed 23%. And in response to some people who said that we should measure free cash flow for these purposes after both maintenance and environmental CapEx, we have done it in that way but before growth CapEx.
A substantial amount of that free cash flow yield was redeployed back to stakeholders in the form of debt repayment and through our 2010 share buyback program and also into various growth initiatives, which we'll discuss in a minute. But over $650 million of excess free cash flow was returned as cash into the company's coffers, with the result being that our liquidity position at the end of 2010, $4.3 billion of total liquidity with $3 billion of cash on hand, is stronger than it has ever been. 
It has always been my position that next to safety, the most important thing that we do as executive management at NRG is capital allocation, and given the amount that we are investing on an annual basis and the record amount that we currently have available either to invest in growth or to return to our equity and debt stakeholders, capital allocation has never been more important than it is now. As such, I'm going to focus the greater part of my remaining remarks on capital, which we expect to invest in our growth initiatives in the months and years to come. Chris will focus a good deal of his comments on capital to be returned to stakeholders.
In terms of the allocation of capital to our growth initiatives, it's important to start with the obvious point that we want to invest the company's capital in assets and initiatives that not only are likely to yield a return significantly in excess of our risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, but also in businesses and initiatives which advance the company's strategy. 
As depicted on Slide 4, the company's long-term strategy for some time has been twin-tracked. First, to strengthen and enhance our generation to retail business in our core markets through superior operating performance, continued implementation of our first-lean-enabled, long-term hedging program and pursuit of both select acquisitions and the repowering of our older facilities with advantage locations inside load pockets in our core markets. This comply of our strategy which we have pursued with relentless consistency and a high degree of effectiveness for the past five years was joined a couple years ago with a supplemental strategy that is overtly green and designed to take advantage of the societal trend towards sustainability.
This sustainability trend is, in our opinion, about to accelerate as a result of the emergence of various consumer-oriented disruptive technologies, which will make green energy at the consumer level the focal point of sustainability. We made considerable progress on both strategic fronts during 2010, with substantial advances across every facet of our sustainability initiative.
From our rollout of our eVgo network in Houston, which is centered around an innovative fueling package in approach to electric vehicle infrastructure that is already being replicated in other locations through the smart meter e-Sense applications now being sold by Reliant in quantity, to our unique approach to CCS/EOR being funded in collaboration with the DOE at our Parish facility in Texas. All of these initiatives are exciting and off to a good start. All will, I am confident, return considerable value to NRG to shareholders in the medium term. 
You will hear more about these initiatives in the future but not today, because today, consistent with my theme, I want to concentrate my comments on the growth initiatives which are more immediate and which are key priorities for deployment of your investment capital during 2011. This is shown on Slide 6. 
By way of background, in 2010, we committed substantial growth capital in four general areas: Zero carbon renewables, with an emphasis on solar; new advanced nuclear development; conventional gas-fired acquisitions and repowerings; and green retail acquisitions in the form of Green Mountain Energy. All four are likely to be areas of additional capital expenditure in 2011 but with very different investment profiles from 2010.
First, we expect an acceleration and significant expansion in our equity capital invested in high-growth, high-return solar projects. At the greater part of our utility scale, solar portfolio should achieve financial close and enter the construction phase during 2011.
Second, investment in conventional generation assets should be relatively flat year-on-year, as spending on GenConn and Cottonwood should give way to spending on El Segundo, but conventional CapEx could increase depending on our development success at Astoria, Saguaro or Encina and also, whether we find any strategic assets that can be acquired at value.
Third, capital invested in green retail should drop precipitously as obviously the big expenditure in this area in 2010 with the acquisition of Green Mountain. The amount of capital that we will be investing in and around Green Mountains business in 2011 or to expand into new geographic markets, bigger customers segments and new complimentary green product offerings is fairly minimal.
And finally, and similarly and perhaps, contrary to popular investor belief, even if the STP nuclear development project stays on course, the development capital projected to be required of NRG in 2011 will be far less than half of what we invested in 2010 and will be a mere fraction of what we will be investing in solar projects and other capital allocation alternatives. 
So this is a lot to digest, so let's go through a little bit more slowly, starting on Slide 7 with Green Mountain. Four months ago, we paid $357 million for a business that we expect to contribute $70 million, $80 million of EBITDA in 2011, plus, we expect Green Mountain to continue to deliver on a 20-plus percent compound annual growth rate trajectory that they have delivered for the past decade.  But we didn't acquire Green Mountain just to continue with business as usual. We wanted to take advantage, and we wanted them to take advantage of what we believe are very substantial synergies between Green Mountain and NRG. 
Essentially, we want Green Mountain to accelerate the depth and breadth of their growth in close cooperation with us on the same path that they were following on their own, which means expansion into a high retail price Northeast markets, where they start with a natural green-leaning constituency, also, expansion into the larger Commercial segment of the C&I market than they have previously sought to access. And finally, expansion of their value-added product offerings to include distributed green generation.
It's early days yet, but on at least the first two of these, they are already beginning to bear fruit. Green Mountain has established a small but fast-growing footprint in New York Zone J, and in terms of larger C&I customers, they have won landmark business like the Empire State Building. We expect to be reporting on these and many more successes from and with Green Mountain as the year progresses.
Turning to conventional generation on Slide 8. 2010 was an uneven year, with the successful acquisition of Cottonwood and the repowering at Devon and Middletown, balanced by the missed opportunities surrounding Dynegy's California asset. Cottonwood and Devon have been smoothly integrated into our South Central and NEPOOL lineups respectively, and we are very pleased with the results today.
Looking forward to 2011, we're very focused on the successful repowering of El Segundo, an advantage which we hope to derive from having a modern, fast-start, low-heat rate, combined-cycle plant inside the Los Angeles basin load pocket.  Beyond El Segundo, we hope to make progress on similar repowering efforts at Astoria in New York City and Encina in San Diego County. Beyond our own Repowering pipeline, the capital we deploy in the acquisition of conventional power plants, obviously, will depend on market conditions and asset availability in our core regions.
While the acquisition market is lumpy, generalities are difficult and predictions are often proved wrong, the optimism I once held at the first half of 2011 would be a buyer's market for CCGTs in the United States has largely dissipated. I see no sign of a flood of assets on the market and the combined cycle of transactions which have been announced recently have been priced at levels significantly above what we could justify to ourselves or explain to our shareholders.
With respect to our nuclear project, while important steps forward have occurred in several areas since our last earnings call, very little of it can be seen with the naked eye. As before, really all critical aspects of the STP 3 & 4 project run off of our receipt of an acceptable conditional loan guarantee from the government. Certainly, it is a challenge for us to complete meaningful discussions about PPAs with potential off-takers, while the loan guarantee application remains pending.
So our exit ramp analysis, which is set forth on Slide 9, remains largely unchanged from the previous quarter. Likewise, our viewpoint with respect to NRG's continued participation in the project remains at the most challenging of these hurdles, which is the long-term off-take requirement, effectively needs to be addressed no later than the third quarter of 2011 before the project enters the substantial pre-construction phase. 
As such, we reiterate the view which is clearly articulated in both our 10-K and in today's earnings release, that NRG will be in a position by late this summer to make a final decision on our continued financial participation in this project.  At that point, the market should have substantially greater clarity about the prospects for this project and NRG's role in it.
While we understand that there is skepticism amongst some investors that the project can go forward in the current low gas price environment, we nonetheless, believe it might be helpful to you for us to outline as shown on Slide 10 the future capital commitment of NRG in respect to this project, should it stay on track, with NRG continuing to support it financially. 
The overall message is that due to a combination of first, the very substantial sum that NRG has previously committed to the project development, particularly during the first half of 2010 after the settlement with CPS. Second, taking into account our expectation of an optimal hold amount in the project for NRG of approximately 40%, which is down from the 67% that we will own if and when TEPCO invests in a project post-loan guarantee award. And third, due to the value ascribed to NRG for its contribution of the site, NRG's cash commitment to the project going forward is less than what otherwise would be suggested by our projected ownership level.
In summary, should the project proceed to financial closing, the total cash commitment for NRG at our 40% hold level should be something just short of $800 million in aggregate, including cash invested to date. Beyond that, we are likely to have an LC commitment to a standby equity crossover line facility that will be fixed. And while that number has not yet been finally fixed, you should be thinking in the range of a few hundred million dollars maximum. 
In exchange for this size investment in STP 3 & 4, we expect cash flow from dividends and tax benefits in the range of $500 million a year for the first several years of operations. Obviously, this is a very attractive return but one which we believe is well just justified given the extraordinary challenges of the undertaking.
Now pulling it back from where we hope the project will be in 2016 or 2017 to where we are here in the first quarter of 2011, you should be focused on what happens after announcements of acceptance of the loan guarantee. As the loan guarantee acceptance naturally will trigger certain funding obligations from our partners, NRG's share of cash development spent for the remainder of the development phase should approximate $50 million for all of 2011 and half that for 2012. 
While our perspective 2011, 2012 development standard is perhaps substantially less than many in the market were anticipating, it remains a lot of money to us, and we're taking very seriously our commitment to retain our financial discipline around this project and prevent exposure of our balance sheet beyond the specific commitments that I've outlined in this presentation.
Now turning to Slide 11, last but certainly not least, there is the solar pipeline. I've said many times, and I'll repeat here, that in my 20 years in this business, I had never seen investment opportunities in this sector that offer more attractive combination of high returns, low construction risks, long-term PPAs and repeatable business opportunities than the utility-sized solar projects that we currently have in our advanced development portfolio. 
As such, we intend to do as much of this business as we can get our hands on, with the result being that by the end of this year, we may well have a total initial equity investment in our solar portfolio that exceeds the total amount that we may ever invest in STP 3 & 4 at very attractive near-term returns. The limiting item for us in terms of these solar investments is our ability on our own to make optimal use of the considerable tax benefits which will be generated by these projects. This is a topic that Chris Schade will discuss in a few minutes.
What I will end by saying is that this extraordinary pipeline of utility-sized solar projects, which our colleagues at NRG Solar have managed to develop or acquire, provides us with a truly unique opportunity to develop over the next few years a solar portfolio of true scale and significant benefit, even in the context of the larger portfolio of NRG.
Ultimately, however, we fully recognize that the current generation of utility-sized solar and wind projects in the United States is largely enabled by favorable government policies and financial assistance. It seems likely that much of that special assistance is going to be phased out over the next few years, leaving renewable technologies to fend for themselves in the open market. 
We do not believe that this will be the end of the flourishing market for solar generation. We do believe it will lead to a stronger and more accelerated transition from an industry that is currently biased towards utility-sized solar plants to one that's focused more on distributed and even residential solar solutions on rooftops and in parking lots. 
We are already planning for this transition now within NRG, so that any potential decline in either the availability of utility-sized solar projects or in the attractiveness of the returns being realized on these projects, will be exceeded in aggregate by the increase in the business we are doing on smaller distributed and residential solar projects through our Green Mountain and even our Reliant retail sales channel.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

NRG continued its strong operating and commercial performance during the fourth quarter, making 2010 one of NRG's best years. Slide 13 highlights a few of the key accomplishments achieved in 2010.
Starting with safety, we're particularly pleased with our record performance this year. Our OSHA recordable rate improved 26% over 2009. Our top performance remained strong with 90% availability of our baseload fleet, just shy of our 2009 level. This performance was achieved despite a forced outage event on our STP nuclear plant in November, which I will cover in more detail in the next slide.
On the environmental front, we delivered our second best year, and our FORNRG program far exceeded our 2010 goal. As I mentioned to you on our last call, controlling our cost is a priority, given the challenging economic environment our industry is facing.
Our Commercial Operations Group increased our hedge levels in 2011 and continues to look for opportunities to catch the odd years of favorable prices. We successfully transitioned to the Nodal Market in ERCOT and began integrating Green Mountain Energy and the Cottonwood combined cycle plant into our portfolio.
With respect to our projects under construction, the Indian River Unit 4 environmental back-end control project continues to be on track and on budget to be operational by January 2012. Our Middletown project in Connecticut received all major equipments in the fourth quarter and continues to be on schedule for operation this summer. Finally, the El Segundo Energy Center completed aboveground demolition of two existing units and secured major equipment orders. El Segundo is on track to be operational by the summer of 2013.
Turning to our plant performance metrics on Slide 14. Safety continues to be our number one priority. We are very proud to report that we achieved top decile in the industry, making 2010 our best OSHA recordable year. We have 25 sites with no injuries and nine sites certified or recertified as OSHA VPP Star worksites.
Net generation decreased by 6% in the fourth quarter due to mild weather across Texas and a 22-day on-plan outage at STP Unit 2 during the month of November. The forced outage event was the result of a breaker failure during routine testing and was extended to repair a reactor coolant pump seal. In order to prevent recurrence, similar electric components were checked in both units. Unit 2 has operated without any issues since it was brought back to service on November 26.
For the full year, net generation was flat from 2009 levels. Increased generation in the Northeast and South Central regions driven by the strong summer weather and the addition of Cottonwood, were offset by lower generation in California and Texas. 
For 2010, our coal fleet availability finished the year above the sub-quarter performance level for the industry. WA Parish led the fleet with 92.6% availability factor, and Limestone had the best reliability for the year, with a 1.6% forced outage rate.
Our FORNRG 2.0 program exceeded the 2010 goal by $49 million, and it is on track to achieve our goal of $150 million by 2011, one year earlier than planned. Savings were achieved through a combination of reliability, capacity and efficiency improvements at generating assets and cost savings across our corporate and regional groups.
Turning to our retail operations on Slide 15, we closed out the year with another strong quarter. Volumes and margins were consistent with our forecast, while Operations delivered better-than-expected asset management and lower operational costs. 
The Mass segment continues to drive segment improvement in net customer attrition with a 57% reduction in the fourth quarter versus 2009. This result was driven by marketing, sales and introduction of innovative products to meet our customer needs.
In 2010, we led Texas in innovation, enrolling over 175,000 customers on our Reliant e-Sense product and services that utilize smart grid technology. We also introduced new and unique offers like carbon-state [ph] and home protection products, adding not only incremental EBITDA but increased customer stickiness.
We continue to maintain the lowest PUC customer complaint rate while balancing customer counterpricing. Throughout 2010, we aligned to successfully demonstrate that we have stabilized customer attrition and expect to achieve zero net attrition in 2011.
In the C&I segment, both renewal and new deal win rates continue to improve. We have expanded our business in several Northeast states where we can leverage existing energy assets and increase product offerings to include products such as backlog generation. These provides a solid platform to grow our business in 2011.
Business continues to show some fundamentals as you can see on Slide 16. Weather-normalized demand grew by 2% year-on-year and ERCOT set a new winter peak low of 57 kilowatts in February, an increase of almost 2.5% from the previous record. I'd like to take this opportunity to address the events in Texas on February 2.
The men and women of NRG Texas worked very hard to help meet the high demand for electricity due to the extreme cold conditions, increasing our generation by more than 60% from the previous day. Although we had some operational issues, of the approximately 9,500 megawatts of power we had available in Texas during the low-shed event, we maintained between 97% and 91% of that capacity online.  I want to thank all our employees in Texas for their dedication and extraordinary efforts during these events.
Now moving on to reserve volumes in ERCOT, we see a positive feature of our generation portfolio with reserved margins tightening faster than expected. This is to some extent reflected in the forward heat rates, as you can see on the chart on the lower right-hand quarter. We believe this trend will continue, given the robust growth and the expectation that asset retirement will outpace new builds. We have not seen as much coal-to-gas switching in Texas as we have in the Northeast and Southeast regions. In fact, cash generation was down year-on-year due to increases in new coal and wind generation in Texas.
In the Northeast, the back-end market continues to make some news. In New York, the recent FERC order to increase cost of new entry should provide a boost to capacity prices in New York City and rest of state, benefiting our New York portfolio. In PJM, prices remain uncertain until more clarity is given around the minimum offer price rule, the subsidized generation in New Jersey and Maryland and review demand outlook.
Moving on to Slide 17, you can see our detailed plan to control air emissions for each of our coal plants. As stated in our last earnings call, our plan is to invest approximately $720 million through 2015 in environmental projects tailored to comply with future regulations. 
Just to remind everyone, the proposed CAIR rule does not require additional capital for compliance. The HAP MACT proposed rule should be released in mid-March, and as you can see in the table, our plant considers mercury controls on all our coal units.
Intake modifications and repowering are expected to meet once for cooling requirements. We only have dry fly ash disposals at our all coal facilities. And finally, in most of our facilities, we burn low sulfur, low chlorine PRB coal.
Moving on to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 18. Our baseload portfolio is now 100% hedged in 2011 and 50% hedged in 2012, providing the protection in the short term where gas prices continue to be weaker given the oversupply situation. Beyond 2012, we choose to remain significantly open. 
After two years of low gas prices, we believe the downside risk is limited. Our combination of incremental demand from the power sector, particularly in light of possible coal plant retirements, some signs of the interest rate by producers, indication that drilling to home acreage may be ending, and a move from dry to wet gas production will provide better opportunities to catch our baseload portfolio in the future.
With respect to retail, we have increased our pipe load to 66% in 2011 from 57% in the third quarter. We continue to match as much generation load as possible to start maximum synergies between our retail and wholesale portfolios.
Our power and coal hedges continue to be well managed in 2011 and 2012. Given the shape of the coal curve and steep contango, we have not added any additional occasions since the last quarter. We also remain well hedged in terms of coal transportation now for some time. 
Our sensitivity to commodity prices is agreeable for 2011, with 2012 to 2015 largely unchanged from last quarter. Let me remind you that this sensitivity is around our baseload portfolio. Interest expense, our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit, particularly, in the Texas and South Central regions. 
With that, I will turn it over to Chris who will discuss our financial results."
413857,118994653,105219,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 20, full-year 2010 adjusted EBITDA was $2.514 billion, just shy of the record 2009 adjusted EBITDA of $2.618 billion and within our previously stated guidance of $2.5 bil",2141,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 20, full-year 2010 adjusted EBITDA was $2.514 billion, just shy of the record 2009 adjusted EBITDA of $2.618 billion and within our previously stated guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion. As a result of our continued strong operating performance, adjusted cash flow from operations for 2010 was robust at $1.76 billion.
The company's liquidity position at year end, excluding funds deposited by counterparties, stood at nearly $4.3 billion, a $458 million increase from December 31, 2009, liquidity of approximately $3.8 billion.  Our cash balance at year end 2010 available for both working capital as well as our 2011 capital allocation program was approximately $2.9 billion.
Now turning to a summary of our 2011 guidance in Capital Allocation Plan. First, we reaffirmed the preliminary 2011 EBITDA guidance range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Second, and as part of our 2011 capital allocation program, we are planning to repurchase $180 million of common stock, and complete $240 million of term loan debt repayments and $39 million for additional facilities, all of which is consistent with NRG's commitment to return excess capital to its stakeholders.  Third, in 2011, in addition to the amount deferred from 2010 as a result of extending the cash grant availability, we are currently planning to commit an additional $640 million of net investment to advance our Repowering and renewable development program, particularly, utility-scale solar.
Now turning to a more detailed review of 2010 adjusted EBITDA result from Slide 21. The company reported near record results of $2.514 billion adjusted EBITDA, only $104 million lower than the 2009 adjusted EBITDA of $2.618 billion. These results were achieved despite the decline in forward prices across all of our regions and clearly benefited from our wholesale generation hedging program and the continued strong performance of Reliant Energy. 
During the year, Reliant Energy contributed $711 million of adjusted EBITDA. Comparatively, these results are lower by $158 million from 2009 as we overlined for only eight months of that year.  The year-on-year decline was driven by an 18% decline in Mass margins, which were the direct result of price reductions enacted following the acquisition, as well as lower margins on customer renewals and new customer acquisitions reflective of the competitive market.  All told, for 2010, Reliant saw net customer attrition rates improve to 0.4% from 0.7% in 2009 with total customers at year end steady at 1.5 million.
The wholesale business meanwhile generated $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $173 million lower as compared to a record 2009 EBITDA of $1.976 billion. The comparative year-to-date decline is largely explained by a 32% drop in baseload hedge prices in the Northeast, as well as lower margins in Texas, caused by a 60% increase in fuel costs, due largely to higher coal transportation costs at our WA Parish facility. These results were partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA of $28 million from the South Central region due to increases in generation and contracted sales.
Also increasing adjusted EBITDA were our newly acquired assets, including Green Mountain Energy, Cottonwood, Northwind Phoenix, South Trent Wind Farm, as well as the full year of operations from the Blythe solar project.
For the fourth quarter, the company reported adjusted EBITDA results of $444 million, a $45 million decline versus 2009. Reliant Energy contributed $117 million of adjusted EBITDA compared to $104 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Reliant's quarterly results were favorable $13 million driven by an improvement in operating costs primarily due to better customer payment habits as related to a decrease in bad debt expense.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, our Wholesale Generation business contributed $327 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $58 million decline compared to fourth quarter '09. The change in results can largely be attributed to the following items: In the Northeast region, 35% lower hedge prices and a 25% decrease in generation resulting in a $57 million decline in energy margins quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in generation was largely a result of coal-to-natural gas switching and offsetting this decline in energy margins were favorable year-on-year operating and maintenance expenses of $13 million.
In Texas, the 10% decline in generation at the Limestone and WA Parish facilities due to lower power prices and reduced demand led to a 6% decline in overall generation for the region. Offsetting this decline were favorable year-on-year operating expenses of $17 million that included gain on land sales of $6 million in 2010.
Now turning to Slide 22. As I mentioned a moment ago, total liquidity at year-end 2010 excluding funds deposited by hedged counterparts remained strong at nearly $4.252 billion. Total cash stood at $2.959 billion, an increase of $653 million as compared to the 2009 year-end cash balance of $2.3 billion. The drivers of the cash increase included adjusted cash from operations of $1.76 billion and debt proceeds of $1.317 billion. 
These increases were offset by several items: First, five completed acquisitions totaling about $1 billion, which included $507 million for Cottonwood generation station, $357 million for Green Mountain, $100 million for Northwind Phoenix, $32 million for South Trent Wind Farm and for the U.S. solar portfolio, 720 megawatts of development projects in nine states in California and Arizona. Second, debt and fee payments totaling $813 million, including Term Loan B payments of $453 million and a repayment of a common stock fund or CSF of $190 million.
And third, capital expenditures excluding NINA of $445 million, including $199 million of maintenance, $184 million of environmental, primarily related to the Indian River Air Quality Control System project, and $62 million of growth investments. For the full year, we made cash contributions to NINA totaling $170 million primarily in the first half of 2010. And finally, we completed share repurchases of 8.5 million shares, totaling $180 million.
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 23. Our EBITDA guidance remains unchanged from our November 24 range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Included in this guidance range are wholesale expectations of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, retail expectations of $480 million to $570 million, and Green Mountain of $70 million to $80 million. As Mauricio discussed earlier, we are about 100% hedged on our baseload generation for 2011 and are thus comfortable with our forecasted results.
As we look forward to our Wholesale business in 2012, we are currently in excess 50% hedged with a higher average price in 2011 as indicated in our SEC filings. Due to this position and based on the current forward curves, we expect flat to marginally lower year-on-year wholesale results in 2012 from 2011. These results will be supplemented with adjusted EBITDA of $85 million from our repowering and solar investments in 2012 that are not subject to market fluctuations.
For our retail business in 2011, our current expectations, assuming normal weather, are an EBITDA range of $480 million to $570 million, the decrease in 2011 guidance compared to current 2010 results is largely explained by lower unit margins in Reliant's Mass business. Reliant's C&I business margins are also expected to decline slightly, but be directly offset by higher terawatt-hours served, reflecting our continued dedication to this growing client base in both Texas and PJM.
Finally, we expect Green Mountain Energy to contribute $70 million to $80 million of EBITDA. We are very excited about enhancing the growth prospects for our Green Energy Retail business during the process of integrating the business with our growing renewables portfolio to enhance these future growth prospects.
During our Q3 earnings call, we discussed the 2011 free cash flow guidance of $425 million to $625 million, and we now currently anticipate free cash flow for 2011 to be in a range of $150 million to $350 million. The difference in guidance is largely explained by certain timing of solar projects, due to Congress extending the availability of cash grants for renewable projects through 2011. NRG postponed its large investments in solar projects from 2010 to 2011, resulting in $267 million of solar expenditures pushed into '11 and relates primarily to our Agua Caliente, Ivanpah and CVSR solar projects.
As we often like to emphasize, we are in a strong cash flow position based on Friday's closing stock price of $20.89 and our affirmed outlook. Free cash flow before growth yield currently stands at between 16% to 20%, or $3.36 to $4.17 per share.
Slide 24 shows the company's projected 2011 year-end cash position which we project to be about $2.5 billion. Beginning with the portion of the Capital Allocation Plan that includes share repurchases and debt repayments in 2011, the company intends to repurchase $180 million of common stock, which is within the constraint of the restricted payments basket; repay $240 million of debt related to our Term Loan B agreement; and approximately $39 million in other facilities. It's important to note that the company made a Term Loan B prepayment in November that totaled $200 million. 
And finally, complete $907 million of capital allocation in the following projects: $50 million in NINA; $219 million for other Repowering investments including El Segundo, GenConn Middletown, eVgo, Texas Reliability and Princeton Hospital and $638 million for solar projects, net of cash grant proceeds, and including the $267 million of deferred payments from 2010.
During the third quarter conference call, I also mentioned that we usually maintain a minimum cash balance of $700 million largely for working capital margin requirements, the timing of cash payments, of interests, property taxes, as well as equity for projects we have under construction throughout the year. Thus, for 2011, we estimate a balance of just over $1.8 billion to allocate between perhaps additional share repurchases, contingent on the restricted payments basket expansion, further investments of high-growth opportunities and continued opportunistic management of our debt structure. 
On January 11, the company issued $1.2 billion of 7 5/8 senior notes due 2018 and announced the simultaneous cash tender for $1.2 billion of the outstanding 7 1/4 senior notes due 2014. As of January 25, nearly 945 million bonds have tendered, and the remaining 250 million will be redeemed by the end of February pursuant to the embedded coal price. As a result, we've improved our debt maturity profile, all of our public debt matures after 2016, and replace the restricted covenant package with one permitting greater efficiency and flexibility to return value to all NRG stakeholders. 
On a go forward basis, we will continue to moderately embed in calls in the 2016 and '17 maturities and be opportunistic about replacing those bonds with less restricted covenant packages, similarly to how we handle the 2014 maturity.
Looking at NRG's combined Repowering and Solar portfolio and our EBITDA contribution on Slide 25, you can clearly see the benefit of the program with nearly $550 million of recurring contribution by 2015.
During the fourth quarter, our El Segundo Repowering project received prior approval from the California Public Utilities Commission for a ten-year Power Purchase Agreement with Southern California Edison. Commercial operation's expected in the summer of 2013.
Our large utility-scale solar projects will also begin to reach commercial operations between the summer of '13 and the first quarter of 2014, and these projects collectively are driving this EBITDA growth.  These solar investments are attractive for their high-teens returns, very low construction risks and offtake agreement of 20-plus years with highly rated counterparties. We will continue to provide updates on the progress of these projects as they move into construction and operation.
As we continue to invest and grow our solar portfolio, it's important to highlight a few economic benefits created with these projects. Slide 26 shows how the combination of cash grant, maker's depreciation and strong cash flows from the PPAs for our projects result in a payback for our investments, in some cases by 2014, and retain stable cash flows for the remaining term of the PPAs. 
Though we believe there will be a turnaround in commodity markets, we are mindful of our ability to create enough taxable income for us to fully absorb tax benefits created by these solar investments. There is clearly a limit to how much tax efficiency we could absorb in any one year before reducing the total project returns. As such, to both minimize the tax leakage and enhance our returns, in 2011, we will pursue new equity investors for our solar portfolio, who have both the appetite for tax benefits and seek investment to one of the largest utility-scale solar portfolios in the world. New equity investors would not only help to optimize our existing tax position but allow us to continue to invest in future projects with high returns.
We expect to launch this initiative soon and look forward to sharing the progress in the future. Now I'll pass it back to David for final comments."

And so in conclusion, on Slide 28, we put what we think are some of the value drivers around the investment proposition at NRG. And it starts with the fact that 2 1/2 years into the commodity price down cycle, it appears to us that the end is in sight, the bottom of the trough has been reached, and the only way to go is up.  When or how quickly gas prices will recover remains open to conjecture, but the case for rising heat rates in our core market of Texas is clear and compelling. And we've positioned our portfolio and our hedge both to benefit from that upturn.
Second, even in a political environment that has turned more conservative in the past year, market mandates for renewable generation and for solar power in particular, remain well supported in both the red and blue states. And the result for us has been a fast-growing portfolio of projects that will contribute substantially to shareholder value creation over the short to medium-term.
Finally, there's the inherent value unique amongst our peer group of Wholesale generation combined with the leading retail position. While we have executed to such great success in Texas, together with Reliant, we are now in position to replicate with Green Mountain in the fast-growing green and retail energy sector. It's a bright future indeed, and for all of us at NRG, we'll strive to realize its vantage on behalf of the shareholders of NRG.
So Deanna, with that, we'd be happy to take some questions."

And given the inventory that we have and the hedge profile, we think that we can weigh to be more opportunistic about when to catch the coal prices. With respect to gas, we continue to see further declines in the front part of the curve, which we've been pretty well insulated. But as I mentioned in my remarks, I mean, I think when you look at 2012 and beyond, and where those price levels are, we see very little downside risk from that. And we think that there are several factors that are converging that could potentially move gas prices, assuming they could be higher than where they are today."

And in fact, normally, we don't comment on it but since as you said, there's been discussions by the public, I guess I should say some things. I would say, first of all, I think there's an openness, a willingness, and interest on several load-serving entities, large load-serving entities in the Texas market to talk about long-term offtake. And I would also say that the events of early February in Texas, where a part of the reason the state had rolling brownouts or even blackouts is because people couldn't get gas to some power plants, I think has reinforced the idea that having fuel diversity in the state is something that load-serving entities want to have. So there's a fairly high level of interest from various parties, but the big qualifier I always put on this question is, right now, as you say, it's really discussions.  I mean, the project isn't really real to off-takers until we have a loan guarantee. So I would describe anything that we're doing with any counterparty at this point is being preliminary. And so that's what I would tell you. And based on what we're being told by the camp, their interest level, I'm guardedly optimistic. But mainly, my main attitude towards all this is, let's wait and see what happens when the loan guarantee's announced, because that's when ourselves and our counterparties are going to have to get down to business, and people are going to have to make commitments on both sides. So that's the main thing, and what we're trying to empathize here is that, that phase, and hopefully that phase will begin within the coming weeks, is something that basically needs to be resolved by the summer so that we can all have clarity as within the company and U.S. investors and analysts as to where we stand vis-à-vis this project."

But I would say, if the exit ramp is that, actually it turns out that there is no loan guarantee in the offing -- I haven't actually asked this question directly, but I think our partners in Japan -- and we would be aligned that there would be, that the project would stop if there's no hope of a federal loan guarantee. If on the other hand, there was a federal loan guarantee, but we were taking the exit ramp because we were unable to lineup the offtake, I don't know what our partners would do in that circumstance. Maybe they would continue with the project, that would be their prerogative to do. I just know that if we don't have that offtake arrangement, then we will stop funding."

We're also joined by Chris Moser, who runs the company's commercial operations; and Jason Few, who runs the Reliant Energy, and both will be available to answer any specific question that you have in that area.
As all of us here are cognizant of the fact that we took up a good deal of your time just a couple of weeks ago discussing the STP 3&4 situation in light of the event in Japan, our prepared remarks today are going to be unusually brief. I'll also going to be referring to a slide deck, which I think is available on the website. 
So as illustrated on Slide 3, to put it quite simply, we had a very good result in the first quarter of 2011. $455 million of adjusted EBITDA, ahead of our expectations, and even when adjusted for seasonality, a good start in our objective of achieving or even exceeding our full year guidance range.
Our better-than-expected financial performance was underpinned by a very robust operational and commercial performance by both our core generation business and our two retail energy providers, Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy. This robust performance was achieved notwithstanding long bounds of extreme winter weather experienced across our geographic footprint. While I know that the conventional wisdom is that wholesale generators are expected to do well financially during periods of extreme weather, what we found during the weather events that grip the Texas market in early February is that there's often a divide between that expectation and reality. Reality depends on the dedication of hard-working employees and their successful execution and I am very pleased to report that this winter our plant and our people performed exceptionally, our retail for requirements were integrated properly hedged. And as a result, the company and its shareholders did very well.
The first quarter was generally marked by weak natural gas prices and wholesale electricity prices, which were unexceptional. But are benefited substantially by the strong operating and financial performance of Reliant, which delivered $151 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. 
I noted previously that wholesale generation usually using does well during extreme weather events, conversely retail load providers often can do poorly. In this regard, Reliant defied the conventional wisdom we performed better operationally and financially during the February weather events, and that is a testament not only to the exceptional operating performance of Reliant's management and staff, but to the intrinsic benefit of NRG's combined wholesale retail business model. 
Time and time again, over the past 2 years, but perhaps never more visibly this quarter, with have demonstrated the advantages of the integrated business model of matching we built a generation. Both in terms of commercial risk management and in terms of optimizing earnings and cash flow.
And from a cash perspective, the first quarter 2011 was another and a long string of highly cash generative quarters for the company. This is important to us because as we often say, this is how we manage NRG and have managed through our 7 years at the company. To maximize cash generation and to allocate it efficiently and effectively. 
The company, since the first quarter ended, executed $103 million out of our $180 million 2011 capital allocation program for share buybacks and repaid another $161 million of our outstanding debt as a result of the functioning of our mandatory cash.
Finally, on Slide 3, the first quarter also was an eventful time in terms of the future shape of our industry. Not only the events in Fukushima but the promulgation of the new EPA rules and impacting coal plants, the enactment into law of the 33% renewable portfolio standard in California, the unexpected extension of certain Federal tax credits for renewable generation and even the penetrable rice in the price of crude oil and gasoline are all likely to have a profound impact on the future shape of our industry.
In part because Fukushima has impacted us quite directly, we have spent a considerable amount of time over the past months, effective on this event and considering their impact on our businesses and our opportunities. Our conclusion that apart from the actions we already have announced and implemented with respect to our nuclear development program, the rest of our strategy is more compelling than ever. We're on the right check both in terms of focusing on our solar focus renewable strategy and in putting more time and effort into our conventional gas fired up our efforts and high-value locations within our core markets. And I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in these 2 areas during the quarter. 
With respect to our industry-leading Solar portfolio, we now have a clear line of sight into the financing of nearly 900 megawatts of solar projects, all which will begin construction by the end of this year. Most of these utility scale solar projects are solar PV Project and all of them are being built with the benefit of long-term PPAs from either Pacific Gas & Electric or Southern California Edison. 
Finally, there are big 3 solar projects, Ivanpah, California Valley Solar Ranch and Agua Caliente, have all received either a conditional loan guarantee commitment from the Department of Energy or, in the case of Ivanpah, already have begun to draw down their DOE loan.
With respect to conventional power generation, we now have 1,400 megawatts of gas plants, either under construction or with long-term contracts at Middletown and Connecticut, El Segundo and California and Old Bridge in New Jersey. We have another 1,580 megawatts permitted at Astoria, in New York City and Encina in California, which are seeking long-term offtake arrangements in order to move forward. 
In short, both with respect to renewables and congressional repowering, we have an attractive growth pipeline with limited risk and strong double-digit returns, and we see more opportunity in this area as a result of the pressure arising on incumbent baseload generation as a result of the events of the past few months, and we are in a good position to capitalize on these opportunities.
We expect to provide more detail around both our solar and our conventional growth pipeline on our second quarter call. 
Turning to Slide 4. I have often said that the most important thing that we are directly responsible for is the executive management of NRG is capital allocation. As depicted on this slide, for the past 7 years, we have deployed a lot of capital, both from the substantial cash flow regularly generated by the company and from the external financing done in connection with the Texas Genco transaction. 
We have been quite consistent in our approach to capitalize our allocation, our focused having been on being balance, prudent and disciplined while maintaining the ability to act quickly when attractive opportunities arise, as we demonstrated both with the Texas Genco and with the Reliant acquisitions. 
For the most part, our approach is work to the benefit of our shareholders. Indeed, in the first quarter of 2011, around 90% of the company's EBITDA was generated by assets and businesses which we did not own when we started 7 years ago. 
Further, we have taken the occasion of the STP 3&4 write-downs to reassess our approach to capital allocation in light of the current circumstances and the risk and the opportunities of our industry. While there certainly are aspect of our approach which we're going to modify as a result of lessons learned, we're going to continue to emphasize balance, discipline and prudence with a dose of opportunities and when attractive situations arise. 
What is missing and what has been missing is capital flexibility. The restrictive covenants in our loan agreement simply make it impossible for us to allocate capital in the most efficient manner possible. Of course, we and all of you on the phone have know this for a long time. And indeed, we have attempted several times over the past years in various ways and with varying degrees of success to ease the constraints on our freedom of action with respect to the company's capital. But we have done so always guided by the fact that we need to gain that freedom of action in an economically rational way. 
Today, we have announced that we are already pursuing a debt refinancing package that is designed ultimately to give us much greater freedom of action with respect to the deployment of the company's capital. Chris Schade [ph] is going to speak in much greater detail about our approach to this refinancing and the overall plans. So I simply want to point out is shown on Slide 5 that the ultimate goal of this program is to put us in a position where we have the opportunity to use a good chunk of the companies excess liquidity, to increase the stake of the companies existing shareholders and the extraordinary cash flow generation machine, which is NRG. 
Even the currently subdued commodity price cycle, the company is demonstrating a high-teen free cash flow yield. As we go forward, we want to have the ability to protect and enhance that yield, not only by increasing free cash flow but also by significantly reducing the number of shares outstanding. This is one of the quickest and most certain ways in which we can clearly and demonstrably create incremental value for NRG shareholders. 
For the next several months, we will provide you with regular reports on our progress and implementing that financing plans. So now, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

We're off to a positive starting 2011 with both our Wholesale and Retail business and delivering strong operating performance during the first quarter. As David mentioned, EPA provided much awaited clarity around environmental rules, affecting our generation portfolio. I will discuss those proposed rules in more detail in a moment.
But the key takeaway is that we do not expect that this time any additional environmental CapEx beyond what we have previously announced. With respect to our projects on the construction, the Middletown project is in the final commissioning phase and we expect is unit the rich commercial operation in June. The Indian River back-end control project and the El Segundo energy Center pilot project are progressing according to schedule. 
Finally, the Ivanpah concentrated solar power project in California has started construction work and is expected to be fully operational in 2013.
As we have said in the past, the strong commitment to safety is a foundation to achieve superior operating results. And the first quarter of this year is a clear example of that. 
Starting with safety on Slide 8. Our OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 was well within top decile in our industry, making it one of our best quarters ever. We have 35 sites out of 39 without a recordable injury in this first quarter. 
Our overall net generation increased by 1.221 [ph] hours, driven primarily by higher generation in Texas led by STP and the addition of Cottonwood to our subcentral portfolio. Generation in the Northeast was adversely impacted by lower will dispatch in February and March. Our plants performed exceptionally well, improving on the availability and reliability metrics. particularly when needed the most during the severe weather event that struck Texas in early February. The base ability factor was over 90% and reliability, measured by force outage rate, significantly improved compared to Q1 of 2010. Our gas and oil fleet maintained their superior our reliability of 97% while increasing the overall number of start from prior year.
Turning to our retail operation on slide 9. We delivered another quarter of strong financial results. As we indicated in our last call, we anticipated bringing our customer count to net zero losses by the end of the year. In fact, this quarter, our net residential customer count grew by 11,000 since the end of 2010. Reliant also delivered lower bad debt expenses and our hedging strategy during the weather of February [ph] was effective, avoiding any negative financial impact.
On the Residential segment, we continue to lead the marketing Texas with innovative products and services that take advantage of SmartMeter capabilities, and we now have over 220,000 customers using at least one e-Sense product. We're also well along in the process to launch as a residential retail provider in the Northeast. We intend to fully leverage the integrated Energy Reliant model we have successfully executed in Texas. The C&I segment delivered the strongest performance since the acquisition and tripled fine low compared to Q1 of 2010. The C&I expansion into PJM has also preceded well and by the end of the first quarter, the team have signed nearly 1 terawatt-hours of term business.
Finally, the last 2 years, we have chosen to hedge of the retail portfolio exposure to our here again we structured transactions. This year, we have made a decision not to insure for a few reasons. Distribution system has been strengthened by the company after Hurricane Ike. The risk of selling back high prices supply at much lower prices have been reduced, and the cost of insurance has increased compared to last year.
Moving on to our market update on Slide 10. Texas continues to show strong fundamentals with demand growing by a healthy 1.8% on a weather normalized basis in the first quarter. America setting a new winter big load of 57 gigawatts in February. On the supply side, we see in terms of new generation and thus, tightening our reserve margins should lead to high forward in Texas. 
We have also seen several positive developments for competitive capacity markets in the Northeast. In New York, to include property taxes and interconnection costs in miscalculation of cost of new entries. In PJM, approved a minimum offer price rule amendment and requires the generation to bid not lower than 90% of net code. 
Finally, in New England, expanded the price will through 2016 and instructed the ISO to develop a minimum offer price mechanism, similar to those using PJM in New York. All positive developments for our assets.
With respect to natural gas, prices have turned up, especially in the back end of the curve. I believe there are many factors particularly demand driven that are starting to change long-term market sentiments such as the prospects for nuclear power in Fukushima, the incremental power demand from all retirement and the possibility to export gas from the U.S. 
As you can see on to Slide 11, we have taken this opportunity to increase our hedges in 2012 from 52% to 60%. Providing some downside protection where fundamentals continue to be vulnerable.
Beyond 2012, we remain on the sidelines given our fundamental view. Retail increase our price role obligations by 13% in 2011 and 8% in 2012. One of the benefits of our wholesale retail combination is that we control when to vertically integrate the business and achieve maximum synergies and when to decouple it and go to market. These ongoing optimization translates into higher margins for our portfolio. 
Our commercial group continues to focus on supporting our retail expansion in the Northeast, and also origination activities.
Just this quarter, we began serving two Arkansas series, totaling 350 megawatts of big loads on our South Central region. We will continue to build on our successes, and the strength of our physical assets.
As I said in my opening remarks, March was a busy month for EPA. We released a proposed utility map and 316 B rules. These rules, combined with a transport will, bring much needed clarity and certainty for the electric industry's planning process. I would just cover some of the highlights which I outlined on Slide 12 and allow Energy to reaffirm its compliant strategy. 
As you recall, the transport will is a new program for importance to our planet will be allocations position on trading and limited requirements in Texas. The proposed macaroon provides flexibility in the compliance can be achieved through facility averaging and company selected control technology. We also recognize inherent differences in mercury emissions from micro. 
Finally, the 316 bureau which addresses water usage is not going powers. These rules, we provided some proximity for compliance, would have a significant impact in the power markets. We continue to expect between 30 to 40 gigawatts of capacity to be retiring in the next few years. 
So in terms of Energy's generation portfolio, in the past, we have this potential implication of our worst case regulatory scenario, with an incremental cost from our base plant of $900 million to $1 billion. Given that all 3 proposed PPOs came within our expectation, while we await final rules, we don't expect to incur any incremental CapEx, and we are reaffirming our base capital investments of $720 million for compliance with current regulations. 
Now I will turn it over to Chris for the financial review."

We are pleased with our strong first quarter results of adjusted EBITDA of $455 million and cash from operations of $216 million. Reliant Energy continued to perform well and contribute $151 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010, Reliant's Q1 2011 results were approximately $40 million less, and largely explained by a combination of lower volume sold and lower unit margins on both newly acquired and customer renewal's.
As Mauricio also discussed, since acquired Reliant a primary goal has been to limit customer attrition and create new customer growth through a strategy of enhanced services and offerings. During the first quarter and as a direct result of these efforts, Reliant experienced favorable mass customer growth with the addition of 11,000 new customers since year end 2010. 
During Q1, our Wholesale generation business contributed $304 million of adjusted EBITDA and approximate $100 million declined compared to Q1 2010. Texas wholesale generation contribute $235 million of adjusted EBITDA, a strong performance in light of the challenging commodity market, but weaker than Q1 2010. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was caused by a combination of lower realized energy prices based on lower hedged prices and higher fuel transportation costs, which drove a 15% decline in realized margins per megawatt hour. Offsetting this declines were favorable quarter-on-quarter operating expenses of $14 million.
In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA declined $66 million due to a lower gross margin driven by a 25% decline in coal generation, lower hedged prices and a decrease to capacity revenues due to the expiration of contract of our Connecticut plant, as well as lower realized LFRM prices and volumes. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating cost of $28 million, as we look to reduce regional cost across the board, but particularly at lower performing. 
The West and South Central region benefited from higher capacity revenue and increased merchant activity, and together contributed $42 million of EBITDA during the first quarter of 2011, a 17% greater number than Q1 2010 performance.
At this time, we are maintaining 2011 EBITDA guidance range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion, an increase in free cash flow before growth guidance by $175 million to a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Before turning to the next slide, I would like briefly to provide an update to our 2011 capital allocation plans. We recently purchased $130 million of Energy shares or 6.2 million shares at an average price of $20.87. This leaves $50 million for additional purchases under the announced 2011 plan, which will be completed before year end. We will also continue to consider the possibility of further share repurchases within the confines of our existing receptive payment basket and our high-yield notes.
Turning to Slide 15, total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by hedged counterparts, remain strong during Q1 at about $4 billion, which included total cash of $2.7 billion. This healthy liquidity position permits ample room for us to continue to execute on our near-term solar development program, as well as consider future capital allocation commitments. 
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 16. Although Energy has begun the year on a strong note, we are currently maintaining the 2011 EBITDA guidance as I previously said of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. However, we are raising free cash flow growth by $175 million. 
Increase in free cash flow guidance is directly a result of the increase in margin collateral received during the first quarter, as well as a reduction in environmental CapEx cost by the issuance of tax exempt funds associated with the Indian River Air Quality Control System project.
It is our goal to provide greater priority and performance by narrowing EBITDA guidance range throughout the year after Q1, since the summer weather conditions can meaningfully affect our performance.
On Slide 17, I would like to explain our goals to simplify our existing capital structure as David has previously stated. This undertaking low end involves a two-stage process and a compass our existing first lien facilities, as well as those Senior Notes containing certain restrictive covenants. Stage 1 is focused on our first lien debt and is expected to be completed around the end of Q2 or early Q3 of 2011. Our goal during Stage 1 is to issue a single $2.3 billion revolver to replace an existing $1 billion revolver and $1.3 billion letter of credit facility. We also intend to issue a new seven-year $1.6 billion term loan B facility to replace two outstanding existing term loan B tranches. Our primary goal in this process will be to eliminate investment basket restrictions, cash flow sweep restrictions and mirror the covenant packages currently in the indentures governing our most recent bond issuances and specifically those in 2018, '19 and 2020. 
Second in Stage 2 is our goal to refinance the $3.5 billion of 2016 and 2017 notes over the coming 6 to 9 months. The completion of this stage is consistent with our strategy of refinancing these bonds at respective call dates similar to the transaction we completed in January of this year and in our 2014 maturity. As part of this refinancing, we expect to replace restrictive covenant packages with a more flexible structure, allowing us to return value to shareholders. 
Furthermore, upon completion of the final refinancing, Energy will have a coming covenant package across all debt maturities.
As a reminder, those coming covenants of which I am referring to are governed by cash metrics rather than income, which we believe is better aligned and more suited with power NRG's rented business. Long-term benefits Energy and its stakeholders through successful execution of its debt restructuring are numerous. First, there is an immediate improvement in that maturity profile there as maturity of either first lien debt or bonds no sooner than 2016. Second, the common covenant package will be aligned across the NRG capital structure, permitting greater flexibility and a creation of a long range approach to capital allocation, both for a more efficient approach to the reinvestment of our business and/or return to shareholders. We look forward to sharing our long range of more predictable planning goals with you in the future as we complete this refinancing process and work through future growth plans and capital requirements.
And now I'll turn it over to David for questions."

And before we open the floor to questions. Just one summary remark. We've been asked many times over the past few weeks whether we plan any new strategic initiatives to take the place of nuclear development. And the short and simple answer to that question is no. Our strategy was and still is a multi-growth strategy incorporating many initiatives, which are designed to capitalize on what we see is being a very attractive opportunities opened to 21st century power companies. We think if we successfully execute on these initiatives, we will substantially enhance shareholder value in the years to come. The prospect for the nuclear Renaissance in the United States either have not affected our other initiatives or in some cases, they've actually enhanced the attractiveness of these other opportunities. 
So our plan, quite simply, is to redeploy the time energy and resources we were putting into new nuclear development into a near -- people at NRG know that I'm a big fan of liberation into the four Rs of renewables, repowering, retail and repurchases. So with that, Laura, we'll be happy to answer any questions that people have."

As I mentioned, that's close to 1,000 megawatts. Beyond that, we have a development pipeline. It's earlier stage and so things can come and go but that can be another couple thousand megawatts over the next few years. So we're going to have a lot of focus on that area. To date, that has been out in the southwest United States. We are going to get more involved in solar further east, I mean, certainly in Texas but also actually in the East. But that's still a work in progress. On the conventional side, one of the things that we think it's going to come about obviously is that we've had sort of a reversal in terms of solid fuel base load, while clearly the prospects for nuclear development in the country outside of the deep South has been substantially. And now that they have much greater clarity about coal-fired generation because of the promulgation of the EPA rules, we at least have a sense of what's going to happen in that market number internationally price opportunities and you can price of gas and alternatives. We have a lot of great sites around the company in the Northeast in Texas in the West Coast, the transmission system depends upon our from a lot of our sites.

Today, I'm joined here by Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Schade, the company's Chief Financial Officer, and they will also be giving part to the presentation.
We're also joined by Chris Moser, who runs the company's Commercial Operations; and Jason Few, who runs the Reliant Energy, and both will be available to answer any specific questions that you have in their area.
As all of us here are cognizant of the fact that we took up a good deal of your time just a couple of weeks ago discussing the STP 3&4 situation in light of the event in Japan, our prepared remarks today are going to be unusually brief. I'm also going to be referring to a slide deck, which I think is available on the website. 
So as illustrated on Slide 3, to put it quite simply, we had a very good result in the first quarter of 2011, $455 million of adjusted EBITDA, ahead of our expectations and even when adjusted for seasonality, a good start in our objective of achieving or even exceeding our full-year guidance range.
Our better-than-expected financial performance was underpinned by a very robust operational and commercial performance by both our core generation business and our 2 retail energy providers, Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy. This robust performance was achieved notwithstanding long bouts of extreme winter weather experienced across our geographic footprint. While I know that the conventional wisdom is that wholesale generators are expected to do well financially during periods of extreme weather, what we found during the weather events that gripped the Texas market in early February is that there is often a divide between net expectation and reality. Reality depends on the dedication of hard-working employees and on their successful execution, and I am very pleased to report that this winter, our plants and our people performed exceptionally. Our retail load requirements were in aggregate properly hedged. And as a result, the company and its shareholders did very well.
The first quarter was generally marked by weak natural gas prices and wholesale electricity prices, which were unexceptional. But our results benefited substantially by the strong operating and financial performance of Reliant, which delivered $151 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. 
I noted previously that wholesale generation usually using does well during extreme weather events. Conversely, retail load providers often can do poorly. In this regard, Reliant defied the conventional wisdom. It performed very well operationally and financially during the February weather events, and that is a testament not only to the exceptional operating performance of Reliant's management and staff, but to the intrinsic benefit of NRG's combined wholesale, retail business model. 
Time and time again, over the past 2 years, but perhaps never more visibly than this quarter, we have demonstrated the advantages of the integrated business model of matching retail to generation both in terms of commercial risk management and in terms of optimizing earnings and cash flow.
And from a cash perspective, the first quarter 2011 was another and a long string of highly cash-generative quarters for the company. This is important to us because as we often say, this is how we manage NRG and have managed through our 7 years at the company: To maximize cash generation and to allocate it efficiently and effectively. 
The company, since the first quarter ended, executed $130 million out of our $180 million 2011 capital allocation program for share buybacks and repaid another $161 million of our outstanding debt as a result of the functioning of our mandatory cash sweep.
Finally, on Slide 3, the first quarter also was an eventful time in terms of the future shape of our industry, not only the events at Fukushima but the promulgation of the new EPA rules impacting coal plants, the enactment into law of the 33% renewable portfolio standard in California, the unexpected extension of certain Federal tax credits for renewable generation and even the seemingly inexorable rise in the price of crude oil and gasolines are all likely to have a profound impact on the future shape of our industry.
In part because Fukushima has impacted us quite directly, we have spent a considerable amount of time over the past months to reflect on these events and considering their impact on our businesses and our opportunities. Our conclusion that apart from the actions we already have announced and implemented with respect to our nuclear development program, the rest of our strategy is more compelling than ever. We're on the right track both in terms of focusing on our solar-focused renewable strategy and in putting more time and effort into our conventional gas-fired repowering efforts in high-value locations within our core markets. And I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in these 2 areas during the quarter. 
With respect to our industry-leading Solar portfolio, we now have a clear line of sight into the financing of nearly 900 megawatts solar projects, all which will begin construction by the end of this year. Most of these utility scale solar projects are solar PV projects, and all of them are being built with the benefit of long-term PPAs from either Pacific Gas & Electric or Southern California Edison. 
Finally, there are big 3 solar projects, Ivanpah, California Valley Solar Ranch and Agua Caliente, have all received either a conditional loan guarantee commitment from the Department of Energy or in the case of Ivanpah, already have begun to draw down their DOE loan.
With respect to conventional power generation, we now have 1,400 megawatts of gas plants, either under construction or with long-term contracts at Middletown and Connecticut, El Segundo and California and Old Bridge in New Jersey. We have another 1,580 megawatts permitted at Astoria in New York City and Encina in California, which are seeking long-term offtake arrangements in order to move forward. 
In short, both with respect to renewables and conventional repowering, we have an attractive growth pipeline with limited risk and strong double-digit returns, and we see more opportunity in this area as a result of the pressure arising on incumbent baseload generation as a result of the events of the past few months, and we are in a good position to capitalize on these opportunities.
We expect to provide more detail around both our solar and our conventional growth pipeline on our second quarter call. 
Turning to Slide 4. I have often said that the most important thing that we are directly responsible for as the executive management of NRG is capital allocation. As depicted on this slide, for the past 7 years, we have deployed a lot of capital, both from the substantial cash flow regularly generated by the company and from the external financing done in connection with the Texas Genco transaction. 
We have been quite consistent in our approach to capitalize our allocation, our focused having been on being balanced, prudent and disciplined while maintaining the ability to act quickly when attractive opportunities arise, as we demonstrated both with the Texas Genco and with the Reliant acquisitions. 
For the most part, our approach is work to the benefit of our shareholders. Indeed, in the first quarter of 2011, around 90% of the company's EBITDA was generated by assets and businesses which we did not own when we started 7 years ago. 
Further, we have taken the occasion of the STP 3&4 write-down to reassess our approach to capital allocation in light of the current circumstances and the risks and the opportunities of our industry. While there certainly are aspect of our approach which we are going to modify as a result of lessons learned, we're going to continue to emphasize balance, discipline and prudence with a dose of opportunities when attractive situations arise. 
What is missing and what has been missing is capital flexibility. The restrictive covenants in our loan agreement simply make it impossible for us to allocate capital in the most efficient manner possible. Of course, we and all of you on the phone have know this for a long time. And indeed, we have attempted several times over the past years in various ways and with varying degrees of success to ease the constraints on our freedom of action with respect to the company's capital. But we have done so always guided by the fact that we need to gain that freedom of action in an economically rational way. 
Today, we have announced that we are already pursuing a debt refinancing package that is designed ultimately to give us much greater freedom of action with respect to the deployment of the company's capital. Chris Schade is going to speak in much greater detail about our approach to this refinancing and the overall plans. Though I simply want to point out is shown on Slide 5 that the ultimate goal of this program is to put us in a position where we have the opportunity to use a good chunk of the company's excess liquidity, to increase the stake of the companies existing shareholders and the extraordinary cash flow generation machine which is NRG. 
Even the currently subdued commodity price cycle, the company is demonstrating a high-teen free cash flow yield. As we go forward, we want to have the ability to protect and enhance that yield, not only by increasing free cash flow but also by significantly reducing the number of shares outstanding. This is one of the quickest and most certain ways in which we can clearly and demonstrably create incremental value for NRG shareholders. 
For the next several months, we will provide you with regular reports on our progress in implementing that financing plan. So now, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

Turning to Slide 7. Now, we're off to a positive start in 2011 with both our Wholesale and Retail businesses delivering strong operating performances during the first quarter. As David mentioned, EPA provided",1261,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Now, we're off to a positive start in 2011 with both our Wholesale and Retail businesses delivering strong operating performances during the first quarter. As David mentioned, EPA provided much awaited clarity around environmental rules affecting our generation portfolio. I will discuss those proposed rules in more detail in a moment.
But the key takeaway is that we do not expect at this time any additional environmental CapEx beyond what we have previously announced. With respect to our projects on the construction, the Middletown project is in the final commissioning phase and we expect these units to reach commercial operation in June. The Indian River Back-End Control project and the El Segundo Energy Center Repowering project are progressing according to schedule. 
Finally, the Ivanpah Concentrated Solar Power project in California has started construction work, and it is expected to be fully operational in 2013.
As we have said in the past, the strong commitment to safety is a foundation to achieve superior operating results. And the first quarter of this year is a clear example of that. 
Starting with safety on Slide 8. Our OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 was well within top decile in our industry, making it one of our best quarters ever. We have 35 sites out of 39 without a recordable injury in this first quarter. 
Our overall net generation increased by 1.2 terawatt-hours, driven primarily by higher generation in Texas led by STP and the addition of Cottonwood to our subcentral portfolio. Generation in the Northeast was adversely impacted by lower coal dispatch in February and March. Our baseload plants performed exceptionally well, improving on last year's availability and reliability metrics, particularly when needed the most during the severe weather event that struck Texas in early February. The baseload availability factor was over 90% and reliability, measured by force outage rate, significantly improved compared to Q1 of 2010. Our gas and oil fleet maintained their superior start reliability of 97% while increasing the overall number of starts from prior year.
Turning to our retail operation on Slide 9. We delivered another quarter of strong financial results. As we indicated in our last call, we anticipated bringing our customer count to net 0 losses by the end of the year. In fact, this quarter, our net residential customer count grew by 11,000 since the end of 2010. Reliant also delivered lower bad debt expenses and our hedging strategy during the weather events in February was effective, avoiding any negative financial impact.
On the Residential segment, we continue to lead the market in Texas with innovative products and services that take advantage of smart meter capabilities, and we now have over 220,000 customers using at least one e-Sense product. We're also well along in the process to launch as a residential retail provider in the Northeast. We intend to fully leverage the integrated Energy Reliant model we have successfully executed in Texas. The C&I segment delivered the strongest performance since the acquisition and tripled fine load compared to Q1 of 2010. The C&I expansion into PJM has also preceded well and by the end of the first quarter, the team have signed nearly 1 terawatt-hours of term business.
Finally, the last 2 years, we have chosen to hedge at the retail portfolio exposure to our hurricane via structured transactions. This year, we have made the decision not to insure for a few reasons. Distribution system has been strengthened by the TMD [ph] company after Hurricane Ike. The risk of selling back high price supply at much lower prices have been reduced, and the cost of insurance has increased compared to last year.
Moving on to our market update on Slide 10. Texas continued to show strong fundamentals with demand growing by a healthy 1.8% on a weather normalized basis in the first quarter. And ERCOT is setting a new winter peak low of 57 gigawatts in February. On the supply side, we see little in terms of new generation and thus, tightening our reserve margin should lead to higher forward heat rate in Texas. 
We have also seen several positive developments for competitive capacity markets in the Northeast. In New York, FERC ordered an ISO to include property taxes and interconnection costs in its calculation of cost of new entries. In PJM, FERC approved a minimum offer price rule amendment and requires new generation to bid no lower than 90% of net CONE. 
Finally, in New England, FERC extended the price will through 2016 and instructed the ISO to develop a minimum offer price mechanism, similar to those using PJM in New York. All positive developments for our assets.
With respect to natural gas, prices have turned up, especially in the back end of the curve. I believe there are many factors, particularly demand driven, that are starting to change long-term market sentiments such as the prospect for nuclear power post-Fukushima, the incremental power demand from coal retirement and the possibility to export gas from the U.S. 
As you can see on Slide 11, we have taken this opportunity to increase our hedges in 2012 from 52% to 60%, providing some downside protection where fundamentals continue to be vulnerable.
Beyond 2012, we remain on the sidelines given our fundamental view. Retail increased our priced load obligations by 13% in 2011 and 8% in 2012. One of the benefits of our wholesale, retail combination is that we control when to vertically integrate the business and achieve maximum synergies and when to decouple it in go-to-market. These ongoing optimization translates into higher margins for our portfolio. 
Our commercial group continues to focus on supporting our retail expansion in the Northeast and wholesale origination activities.
Just this quarter, we began serving two Arkansas series, totaling 350 megawatts of peak low on our South Central region. We will continue to build on our successes and the strength of our physical assets.
As I said in my opening remarks, March was a busy month for EPA. It released a proposed utility MACT and 316(b) rules. These rules, combined with a transport rule issued last July bring much needed clarity and certainty for the electric industry's planning process. I will just cover some of the highlights which I outlined on Slide 12 that allow NRG to reaffirm its compliant strategy. 
As you recall, the transport rule is a new Cap & Trade program for SO2 and NOx. Important to our planning will be allocations, restriction on trading and limited requirements in Texas. The proposed MACT rule provides flexibility and that compliance can be achieved through facility averaging and company selected control technology. It also recognizes the inherent differences in mercury emissions from lignite coal. 
Finally, the 316(b) rule, which addresses water usage, have not mandate cooling towers. These rules, while providing some flexibility for compliance, will have a significant impact in the power markets. We continue to expect between 30 to 40 gigawatts of capacity to be retiring in the next few years. 
So in terms of NRG's generation portfolio, in the past week, I've just told that potential implications of a worst case regulatory scenario, with an incremental cost from our base plant of $900 million to $1 billion. Given that all 3 proposed EPA rules came within our expectation, while we await the final rules, we don't expect to incur any incremental CapEx, and we are reaffirming our base capital investment of $720 million for compliance with current regulations. 
Now I will turn it over to Chris for the financial review."

We are pleased with our strong first quarter results of adjusted EBITDA of $455 million and cash from operations of $216 million. Reliant Energy continued to perform well and contributed $151 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, Reliant's Q1 2011 results were approximately $40 million less and largely explained by a combination of lower volume sold and lower unit margins on both newly acquired and customer renewals.
As Mauricio also discussed, since acquiring Reliant, a primary goal has been to limit customer attrition and create new customer growth through a strategy of enhanced services and offerings. During the first quarter and as a direct result of these efforts, Reliant experienced favorable mass customer growth with the addition of 11,000 new customers since year-end 2010. 
During Q1, our Wholesale Generation business contributed $304 million of adjusted EBITDA and approximate $100 million declined compared to Q1 2010. Texas wholesale generation contribute $235 million of adjusted EBITDA, a strong performance in light of the challenging commodity markets but weaker than Q1 2010. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was caused by a combination of lower realized energy prices based on lower hedged prices and higher fuel transportation costs, which drove a 15% decline in realized margins per megawatt hour. Offsetting this declines were favorable quarter-on-quarter operating expenses of $14 million.
In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA declined $66 million due to a lower gross margin driven by a 25% decline in coal generation, lower hedged prices and a decrease to capacity revenues due to the expiration of RMR contracts in certain of our Connecticut plants, as well as lower realized LFRM prices and volumes. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating cost of $28 million as we look to reduce regional costs across the board but particularly at lower performing...
The West and South Central regions benefited from higher capacity revenue and increased merchant activity and together contributed $42 million of EBITDA during the first quarter of 2011, a 17% greater number than Q1 2010 performance.
At this time, we are maintaining 2011 EBITDA guidance range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion, an increase in free cash flow before growth guidance by $175 million to a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Before turning to the next slide, I would like briefly to provide an update to our 2011 capital allocation plans. We recently purchased $130 million of NRG shares or 6.2 million shares at an average price of $20.87. This leaves $50 million for additional purchases under the announced 2011 plan, which will be completed before year end. We will also continue to consider the possibility of further share repurchases within the confines of our existing restricted payment baskets and our high-yield notes.
Turning to Slide 15, total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by hedged counterparts, remained strong during Q1 at about $4 billion, which included total cash of $2.7 billion. This healthy liquidity position permits ample room for us to continue to execute on our near-term solar development program, as well as considered future capital allocation commitments. 
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 16. Although NRG has begun the year on a strong note, we are currently maintaining the 2011 EBITDA guidance as I've previously said at $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. However, we are raising free cash flow growth by $175 million. 
Increase in free cash flow guidance is directly a result of the increase in margin collateral received during the first quarter, as well as a reduction of environmental CapEx caused by the issuance of tax exempt funds associated with the Indian River Air Quality Control System project. 
It is our goal to provide greater priority and performance by narrowing EBITDA guidance range throughout the year after Q1, since the summer weather conditions can meaningfully affect our performance.
On Slide 17, I would like to explain our goals to simplify our existing capital structure as David has previously stated. This undertaking will involve a 2-stage process and encompass our existing first lien facilities, as well as those senior notes containing certain restrictive covenants. Stage 1 is focused on our first lien debt and is expected to be completed around the end of Q2 or early Q3 of 2011. Our goal during Stage 1 is to issue a single $2.3 billion revolver to replace an existing $1 billion revolver and $1.3 billion letter of credit facility. We also intend to issue a new 7-year $1.6 billion term loan B facility to replace 2 outstanding existing term loan B tranches. Our primary goal in this process will be to eliminate investment basket restrictions, cash flow sweep restrictions and mirror the covenant packages currently in the indentures governing our most recent bond issuances and specifically those in 2018, '19 and 2020. 
Second in Stage 2. It is our goal to refinance the $3.5 billion of 2016 and 2017 notes over the coming 6 to 9 months. The completion of this stage is consistent with our strategy of refinancing these bonds at respective coal dates similar to the transaction we completed in January of this year and our 2014 maturity. As part of this refinancing, we expect to replace restrictive covenant packages with a more flexible structure, allowing us to return value to shareholders. 
Furthermore, upon completion of the final refinancing, NRG will have a common covenant package across all debt maturities.
As a reminder, those common covenants of which I am referring to are governed by cash flow metrics rather than income, which we believe is better aligned and more suited with power NRG rented [ph] business. Long term benefits NRG and its stakeholders through successful execution of this debt restructuring are numerous. First, there is an immediate improvement in the debt maturity profile with the nearest maturity of either our first lien debt or bonds no sooner than 2016. Second, a common covenant package will be aligned across the NRG capital structure permitting greater flexibility and a creation of a long range approach to capital allocation, both for a more efficient approach to the reinvestment in our business and/or return to shareholders. We look forward to sharing our long range of more predictable planning goals with you in the future as we complete this refinancing process and work through future growth plans and capital requirements.
Now, I'll turn it over to David for questions."

And before we open the floor to questions. Just one summary remark. We've been asked many times over the past few weeks whether we plan any new strategic initiatives to take the place of nuclear development. And the short and simple answer to that question is no. Our strategy was and still is a multi-pronged growth strategy incorporating many initiatives, which are designed to capitalize on what we see is being very attractive opportunities opened to the 21st century power companies. We think if we successfully execute on these initiatives, we will substantially enhance shareholder value in the years to come. The dimmed prospect for the nuclear renaissance in the United States either have not affected our other initiatives or in some cases, they've actually enhanced the attractiveness of these other opportunities. 
So our plan, quite simply, is to redeploy the time, energy and resources we were putting into new nuclear developments into a near -- people at NRG know that I'm a big fan of alliteration into the 4 Rs of renewables, repowering, retail and repurchases. So with that, Laura, we'd be happy to answer any questions that people have."

It's overwhelmingly when you focused on solar, and we have this pipeline that we think will go into construction, well, use the benefit of the cash ITC program that's available through the remainder of this year. As I mentioned, that's close to 1,000 megawatts. Beyond that, we have a development pipeline. It's earlier stage and so things can come and go, but that can be another a couple thousand megawatts over the next few years. So we're going to have a lot of focus on that area. To date, that has been out in the southwest United States. We are looking to get more involved in solar further East, I mean, certainly in Texas but also actually in the East. But that's still a work in progress. 
On the conventional side, one of the things that we think it's going to come about obviously is that we've had sort of a reversal in terms of solid fuel baseload. Well clearly, the prospects for a nuclear development in the country outside of the deep South have been substantially. And now that we have much greater clarity about coal-fired generation because of the promulgation of the EPA rules, we at least have a sense of what's going to happen in that market and you can actually price opportunities and you can price of gas as an alternative. We have a lot of great sites around the company in the Northeast and Texas and the West Coast. The transmission system depends upon power from a lot of our sites. So we have really mainly a brownfield development, redevelopment effort as many different sites around the country, and I think we're going to be re-evaluating that and see if we can get more plants permitted. But I think with where our market prices are, we are currently operating on the assumption that anything we do is going to benefit one way or another from a long-term offtake arrangements. And we'll try to be more specific on the second quarter call because there are live projects that we think will have greater certainty by that time."

On the retail side, the convention is that during these events, retail providers tend to be heard.

But keep in mind that the result of our presenting, yes, I mean, the February 2 events held but this is in prior quarter results."

Today, I'm joined here by Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Schade, the company's Chief Financial Officer, and they will also be giving part of the presentation.
We're also joined by Chris Moser, who runs the company's Commercial Operations; and Jason Few, who runs the Reliant Energy, and both will be available to answer any specific questions that you have in their area.
As all of us here are cognizant of the fact that we took up a good deal of your time just a couple of weeks ago discussing the STP 3&4 situation in light of the event in Japan, our prepared remarks today are going to be unusually brief. I'm also going to be referring to a slide deck, which I think is available on the website. 
So as illustrated on Slide 3, to put it quite simply, we had a very good result in the first quarter of 2011, $455 million of adjusted EBITDA, ahead of our expectations and even when adjusted for seasonality, a good start in our objective of achieving or even exceeding our full-year guidance range.
Our better-than-expected financial performance was underpinned by a very robust operational and commercial performance by both our core generation business and our 2 retail energy providers, Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy. This robust performance was achieved notwithstanding long bouts of extreme winter weather experienced across our geographic footprint. While I know that the conventional wisdom is that wholesale generators are expected to do well financially during periods of extreme weather, what we found during the weather events that gripped the Texas market in early February is that there is often a divide between net expectation and reality. Reality depends on the dedication of hard-working employees and on their successful execution, and I am very pleased to report that this winter, our plants and our people performed exceptionally. Our retail load requirements were in aggregate properly hedged. And as a result, the company and its shareholders did very well.
The first quarter was generally marked by weak natural gas prices and wholesale electricity prices, which were unexceptional. But our results benefited substantially by the strong operating and financial performance of Reliant, which delivered $151 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. 
I noted previously that wholesale generation usually does well during extreme weather events. Conversely, retail load providers often can do poorly. In this regard, Reliant defied the conventional wisdom. It performed very well operationally and financially during the February weather events, and that is a testament not only to the exceptional operating performance of Reliant's management and staff, but to the intrinsic benefit of NRG's combined wholesale, retail business model. 
Time and time again, over the past 2 years, but perhaps never more visibly than this quarter, we have demonstrated the advantages of the integrated business model of matching retail to generation, both in terms of commercial risk management and in terms of optimizing earnings and cash flow.
And from a cash perspective, the first quarter 2011 was another in a long string of highly cash-generative quarters for the company. This is important to us because as we often say, this is how we manage NRG and have managed through our 7 years at the company: To maximize cash generation and to allocate it efficiently and effectively. 
The company, since the first quarter ended, executed $130 million out of our $180 million 2011 capital allocation program for share buybacks and repaid another $161 million of our outstanding debt as a result of the functioning of our mandatory cash sweep.
Finally, on Slide 3, the first quarter also was an eventful time in terms of the future shape of our industry, not only the events at Fukushima but the promulgation of the new EPA rules impacting coal plants, the enactment into law of the 33% renewable portfolio standard in California, the unexpected extension of certain Federal tax credits for renewable generation and even the seemingly inexorable rise in the price of crude oil and gasolines are all likely to have a profound impact on the future shape of our industry.
In part because Fukushima has impacted us quite directly, we have spent a considerable amount of time over the past months reflecting on these events and considering their impact on our businesses and our opportunities. Our conclusion that apart from the actions we already have announced and implemented with respect to our nuclear development program, the rest of our strategy is more compelling than ever. We're on the right track both in terms of focusing on our solar-focused renewable strategy and in putting more time and effort into our conventional gas-fired repowering efforts in high-value locations within our core markets. And I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in these 2 areas during the quarter. 
With respect to our industry-leading Solar portfolio, we now have a clear line of sight into the financing of nearly 900 megawatts of solar projects, all which will begin construction by the end of this year. Most of these utility scale solar projects are solar PV projects, and all of them are being built with the benefit of long-term PPAs from either Pacific Gas & Electric or Southern California Edison. 
Finally, there are big 3 solar projects. Ivanpah, California Valley Solar Ranch and Agua Caliente, have all received either a conditional loan guarantee commitment from the Department of Energy or in the case of Ivanpah, already have begun to draw down their DOE loan.
With respect to conventional power generation, we now have 1,400 megawatts of gas plants, either under construction or with long-term contracts at Middletown and Connecticut, El Segundo and California and Old Bridge in New Jersey. We have another 1,580 megawatts permitted at Astoria in New York City and Encina in California, which are seeking long-term offtake arrangements in order to move forward. 
In short, both with respect to renewables and conventional repowerings, we have an attractive growth pipeline with limited risk and strong double-digit returns, and we see more opportunity in this area as a result of the pressure arising on incumbent baseload generation as a result of the events of the past few months, and we are in a good position to capitalize on these opportunities.
We expect to provide more detail around both our solar and our conventional growth pipeline on our second quarter call. 
Turning to Slide 4. I have often said that the most important thing that we are directly responsible for as the executive management of NRG is capital allocation. As depicted on this slide, for the past 7 years, we have deployed a lot of capital, both from the substantial cash flow regularly generated by the company and from the external financing done in connection with the Texas Genco transaction. 
We have been quite consistent in our approach to capitalize our allocation, our focused having been on being balanced, prudent and disciplined while maintaining the ability to act quickly when attractive opportunities arise, as we demonstrated both with the Texas Genco and with the Reliant acquisitions. 
For the most part, our approach has worked to the benefit of our shareholders. Indeed, in the first quarter of 2011, around 90% of the company's EBITDA was generated by assets and businesses which we did not own when we started 7 years ago. 
Further, we have taken the occasion of the STP 3&4 write-down to reassess our approach to capital allocation in light of the current circumstances and the risks and the opportunities of our industry. While there certainly are aspects of our approach which we are going to modify as a result of lessons learned, we're going to continue to emphasize balance, discipline and prudency with a dose of opportunism when attractive situations arise. 
What is missing and what has been missing is capital flexibility. The restrictive covenants in our loan agreement simply make it impossible for us to allocate capital in the most efficient manner possible. Of course, we and all of you on the phone have known this for a long time. And indeed, we have attempted several times over the past years in various ways and with varying degrees of success to ease the constraints on our freedom of action with respect to the company's capital. But we have done so always guided by the fact that we need to gain that freedom of action in an economically rational way. 
Today, we have announced that we are already pursuing a debt refinancing package that is designed ultimately to give us much greater freedom of action with respect to the deployment of the company's capital. Chris Schade is going to speak in much greater detail about our approach to this refinancing and the overall plans. So I simply want to point out as shown on Slide 5 that the ultimate goal of this program is to put us in a position where we have the opportunity to use a good chunk of the company's excess liquidity, to increase the stake of the company's existing shareholders and the extraordinary cash flow generation machine which is NRG. 
Even in the currently subdued commodity price cycle, the company is demonstrating a high-teen free cash flow yield. As we go forward, we want to have the ability to protect and enhance that yield, not only by increasing free cash flow but also by significantly reducing the number of shares outstanding. This is one of the quickest and most certain ways in which we can clearly and demonstrably create incremental value for NRG shareholders. 
Over the next several months, we will provide you with regular reports on our progress in implementing that financing plan. So now, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

Now, we're off to a positive start in 2011 with both our Wholesale and Retail businesses delivering strong operating performances during the first quarter. As David mentioned, EPA provided much awaited clarity around environmental rules affecting our generation portfolio. I will discuss those proposed rules in more detail in a moment.
But the key takeaway is that we do not expect at this time any additional environmental CapEx beyond what we have previously announced. With respect to our projects on the construction, the Middletown project is in the final commissioning phase and we expect these units to reach commercial operation in June. The Indian River Back-End Control project and the El Segundo Energy Center Repowering project are progressing according to schedule. 
Finally, the Ivanpah Concentrated Solar Power project in California has started construction work, and it is expected to be fully operational in 2013.
As we have said in the past, the strong commitment to safety is a foundation to achieve superior operating results. And the first quarter of this year is a clear example of that. 
Starting with safety on Slide 8. Our OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 was well within top decile in our industry, making it one of our best quarters ever. We have 35 sites out of 39 without a recordable injury in this first quarter. 
Our overall net generation increased by 1.2 terawatt-hours, driven primarily by higher generation in Texas led by STP and the addition of Cottonwood to our subcentral portfolio. Generation in the Northeast was adversely impacted by lower coal dispatch in February and March. Our baseload plants performed exceptionally well, improving on last year's availability and reliability metrics, particularly when needed the most during the severe weather event that struck Texas in early February. The baseload availability factor was over 90% and reliability, measured by force outage rate, significantly improved compared to Q1 of 2010. Our gas and oil fleet maintained their superior start reliability of 97% while increasing the overall number of starts from prior year.
Turning to our retail operation on Slide 9. We delivered another quarter of strong financial results. As we indicated in our last call, we anticipated bringing our customer count to net 0 losses by the end of the year. In fact, this quarter, our net residential customer count grew by 11,000 since the end of 2010. Reliant also delivered lower bad debt expenses and our hedging strategy during the weather events in February was effective, avoiding any negative financial impact.
On the Residential segment, we continue to lead the market in Texas with innovative products and services that take advantage of smart meter capabilities, and we now have over 220,000 customers using at least one e-Sense product. We're also well along in the process to launch as a residential retail provider in the Northeast. We intend to fully leverage the integrated Energy Reliant model we have successfully executed in Texas. The C&I segment delivered the strongest performance since the acquisition and tripled fine load compared to Q1 of 2010. The C&I expansion into PJM has also preceded well and by the end of the first quarter, the team have signed nearly 1 terawatt-hours of term business.
Finally, the last 2 years, we have chosen to hedge at the retail portfolio exposure to our hurricane via structured transactions. This year, we have made the decision not to insure for a few reasons. Distribution system has been strengthened by the TMD [ph] company after Hurricane Ike. The risk of selling back high price supply at much lower prices have been reduced, and the cost of insurance has increased compared to last year.
Moving on to our market update on Slide 10. Texas continued to show strong fundamentals with demand growing by a healthy 1.8% on a weather normalized basis in the first quarter. And ERCOT is setting a new winter peak low of 57 gigawatts in February. On the supply side, we see little in terms of new generation and thus tightening our reserve margin should lead to higher forward heat rate in Texas. 
We have also seen several positive developments for competitive capacity markets in the Northeast. In New York, FERC ordered an ISO to include property taxes and interconnection costs in its calculation of cost of new entries. In PJM, FERC approved a minimum offer price rule amendment and required new generation to bid no lower than 90% of net CONE. 
Finally, in New England, FERC extended the price will [ph] through 2016 and instructed the ISO to develop a minimum offer price mechanism, similar to those using PJM in New York. All positive developments for our assets.
With respect to natural gas, prices have turned up, especially in the back end of the curve. I believe there are many factors, particularly demand driven, that are starting to change long-term market sentiments such as the prospect for nuclear power post-Fukushima, the incremental power demand from coal retirement and the possibility to export gas from the U.S. 
As you can see on Slide 11, we have taken this opportunity to increase our hedges in 2012 from 52% to 60%, providing some downside protection where fundamentals continue to be vulnerable.
Beyond 2012, we remain on the sidelines given our fundamental view. Retail increased our price load obligations by 13% in 2011 and 8% in 2012. One of the benefits of our wholesale, retail combination is that we control when to vertically integrate the business and achieve maximum synergies and when to decouple it in go-to-market. These ongoing optimization translates into higher margins for our portfolio. 
Our commercial group continues to focus on supporting our retail expansion in the Northeast and wholesale origination activities.
Just this quarter, we began serving two Arkansas series, totaling 350 megawatts of peak load on our South Central region. We will continue to build on our successes and the strength of our physical assets.
As I said in my opening remarks, March was a busy month for EPA. It released a proposed utility MACT and 316(b) rules. These rules, combined with a transport rule issued last July bring much needed clarity and certainty to the electric industry's planning process. I will just cover some of the highlights which I outlined on Slide 12 that allow NRG to reaffirm its compliant strategy. 
As you recall, the transport rule is a new Cap & Trade program for SO2 and NOx. Important to our planning will be allocations, restriction on trading and limited requirements in Texas. The proposed MACT rule provides flexibility in that compliance can be achieved through facility averaging and company selected control technology. It also recognizes the inherent differences in mercury emissions from lignite coal. 
Finally, the 316(b) rule, which addresses water usage, have not mandate cooling towers. These rules, while providing some flexibility for compliance, will have a significant impact in the power markets. We continue to expect between 30 to 40 gigawatts of capacity to be retiring in the next few years. 
So in terms of NRG's generation portfolio, in the past week, I've disclosed the potential implications of a worst case regulatory scenario, with an incremental cost from our base plant of $900 million to $1 billion. Given that all 3 proposed EPA rules came within our expectation, while we await the final rules, we don't expect to incur any incremental CapEx, and we are reaffirming our base capital investment of $720 million for compliance with current regulations. 
Now I will turn it over to Chris for the financial review."

We are pleased with our strong first quarter results of adjusted EBITDA of $455 million and cash from operations of $216 million. Reliant Energy continued to perform well and contributed $151 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, Reliant's Q1 2011 results were approximately $40 million less and largely explained by a combination of lower volume sold and lower unit margins on both newly acquired and customer renewals.
As Mauricio also discussed, since acquiring Reliant, a primary goal has been to limit customer attrition and create new customer growth through a strategy of enhanced services and offerings. During the first quarter and as a direct result of these efforts, Reliant experienced favorable mass customer growth with the addition of 11,000 new customers since year-end 2010. 
During Q1, our Wholesale Generation business contributed $304 million of adjusted EBITDA, an approximate $100 million decline compared to Q1 2010. Texas wholesale generation contribute $235 million of adjusted EBITDA, a strong performance in light of the challenging commodity markets but weaker than Q1 2010. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was caused by a combination of lower realized energy prices based on lower hedged prices and higher fuel transportation costs, which drove a 15% decline in realized margins per megawatt hour. Offsetting these declines were favorable quarter-on-quarter operating expenses of $14 million.
In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA declined $66 million due to a lower gross margin driven by a 25% decline in coal generation, lower hedged prices and a decrease to capacity revenues due to the expiration of RMR contracts in certain of our Connecticut plants, as well as lower realized LFRM prices and volumes. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating cost of $28 million as we look to reduce regional costs across the board but particularly at lower performing...
The West and South Central regions benefited from higher capacity revenue and increased merchant activity and together contributed $42 million of EBITDA during the first quarter of 2011, a 17% greater number than Q1 2010 performance.
At this time, we are maintaining 2011 EBITDA guidance range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion, an increase in free cash flow before growth guidance by $175 million to a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Before turning to the next slide, I would like briefly to provide an update to our 2011 capital allocation plans. We recently purchased $130 million of NRG shares or 6.2 million shares at an average price of $20.87. This leaves $50 million for additional purchases under the announced 2011 plan, which will be completed before year end. We will also continue to consider the possibility of further share repurchases within the confines of our existing restricted payment baskets and our high-yield notes.
Turning to Slide 15, total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by hedged counterparts, remained strong during Q1 at about $4 billion, which included total cash of $2.7 billion. This healthy liquidity position permits ample room for us to continue to execute on our near-term solar development program, as well as considered future capital allocation commitments. 
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 16. Although NRG has begun the year on a strong note, we are currently maintaining the 2011 EBITDA guidance as I've previously said at $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. However, we are raising free cash flow growth by $175 million. 
Increase in free cash flow guidance is directly a result of the increase in margin collateral received during the first quarter, as well as a reduction to environmental CapEx caused by the issuance of tax exempt funds associated with the Indian River Air Quality Control System project. 
It is our goal to provide greater priority and performance by narrowing EBITDA guidance range throughout the year after Q1, since the summer weather conditions can meaningfully affect our performance.
On Slide 17, I would like to explain our goals to simplify our existing capital structure as David has previously stated. This undertaking will involve a 2-stage process and encompass our existing first lien facilities, as well as those senior notes containing certain restrictive covenants. Stage 1 is focused on our first lien debt and is expected to be completed around the end of Q2 or early Q3 of 2011. Our goal during Stage 1 is to issue a single $2.3 billion revolver to replace an existing $1 billion revolver and $1.3 billion letter of credit facility. We also intend to issue a new 7-year, $1.6 billion term loan B facility to replace 2 outstanding existing term loan B tranches. Our primary goal in this process will be to eliminate investment basket restrictions, cash flow sweep restrictions and mirror the covenant packages currently in the indentures governing our most recent bond issuances and specifically those in 2018, '19 and 2020. 
Second in Stage 2. It is our goal to refinance the $3.5 billion of 2016 and 2017 notes over the coming 6 to 9 months. The completion of this stage is consistent with our strategy of refinancing these bonds at respective coal dates similar to the transaction we completed in January of this year and our 2014 maturity. As part of this refinancing, we expect to replace restrictive covenant packages with a more flexible structure, allowing us to return value to shareholders. 
Furthermore, upon completion of the final refinancing, NRG will have a common covenant package across all debt maturities.
As a reminder, those common covenants of which I am referring to are governed by cash flow metrics rather than income, which we believe is better aligned and more suited with how NRG runs its business. Long term benefits NRG and its stakeholders through successful execution of this debt restructuring are numerous. First, there is an immediate improvement in the debt maturity profile with the nearest maturity of either our first lien debt or bonds no sooner than 2016. Second, a common covenant package will be aligned across the NRG capital structure permitting greater flexibility and a creation of a long range approach to capital allocations, both for a more efficient approach to the reinvestment in our business and/or return to shareholders. We look forward to sharing our long range of more predictable planning goals with you in the future as we complete this refinancing process and work through future growth plans and capital requirements.
Now, I'll turn it over to David for questions."

And before we open the floor to questions. Just one summary remark. We've been asked many times over the past few weeks whether we plan any new strategic initiatives to take the place of nuclear development. And the short and simple answer to that question is no. Our strategy was and still is a multi-pronged growth strategy incorporating many initiatives, which are designed to capitalize on what we see as being very attractive opportunities opened to the 21st century power companies. We think if we successfully execute on these initiatives, we will substantially enhance the shareholder value in the years to come. The dimmed prospect for the nuclear renaissance in the United States either have not affected our other initiatives or in some cases, they've actually enhanced the attractiveness of these other opportunities. 
So our plan, quite simply, is to redeploy the time, energy and resources we were putting into new nuclear developments into a near -- people at NRG know that I'm a big fan of alliteration into the 4 Rs of renewables, repowerings, retail and repurchases. So with that, Laura, we'd be happy to answer any questions that people have."

It's overwhelmingly when you focused on solar, and we have this pipeline that we think will go into construction, we'll use the benefits of the cash ITC program that's available through the remainder of this year. As I mentioned, that's close to 1,000 megawatts. Beyond that, we have a development pipeline. It's earlier stage and so things can come and go, but that can be another couple thousand megawatts over the next few years. So we're going to have a lot of focus on that area. To date, that has been out in the southwest United States. We are looking to get more involved in solar further East, I mean, certainly in Texas but also actually in the East. But that's still a work in progress. 
On the conventional side, one of the things that we think is going to come about obviously is that we've had sort of a reversal in terms of solid fuel baseload. While clearly, the prospects for a nuclear development in the country outside of the deep South have dimmed substantially. And now that we have much greater clarity about coal-fired generation because of the promulgation of the EPA rules, we at least have a sense of what's going to happen in that market and you can actually price opportunities and you can price gas as an alternative. We have a lot of great sites around the company in the Northeast and Texas and the West Coast. The transmission system depends upon power from a lot of our sites. So we have mainly a brownfield development, redevelopment effort at many different sites around the country, and I think we're going to be re-evaluating that and see if we can get more plans permitted. But I think with where our market prices are, we are currently operating on the assumption that anything we do is going to benefit one way or another from a long-term offtake arrangement. And we'll try to be more specific on the second quarter call because there are live projects that we think will have greater certainty by that time."

On the retail side, the convention is that during these events, retail providers tend to be heard. In our case, through the hedge profile that we have provided to Reliant, they were no longer insulated on February 2 but to some extent benefited by the sudden decrease of our power prices following these events, with higher loads that were maintained because of our coal [ph] prices.

Today, I'm joined here by Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Schade, the company's Chief Financial Officer, and they will also be giving part of the presentation.
We're also joined by Chris Moser, who runs the company's Commercial Operations; and Jason Few, who runs the Reliant Energy, and both will be available to answer any specific questions that you have in their area.
As all of us here are cognizant of the fact that we took up a good deal of your time just a couple of weeks ago discussing the STP 3&4 situation in light of the event in Japan, our prepared remarks today are going to be unusually brief. I'm also going to be referring to a slide deck, which I think is available on the website. 
So as illustrated on Slide 3, to put it quite simply, we had a very good result in the first quarter of 2011, $455 million of adjusted EBITDA, ahead of our expectations and even when adjusted for seasonality, a good start in our objective of achieving or even exceeding our full-year guidance range.
Our better-than-expected financial performance was underpinned by a very robust operational and commercial performance by both our core generation business and our 2 retail energy providers, Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy. This robust performance was achieved notwithstanding long bouts of extreme winter weather experienced across our geographic footprint. While I know that the conventional wisdom is that wholesale generators are expected to do well financially during periods of extreme weather, what we found during the weather events that gripped the Texas market in early February is that there is often a divide between net expectation and reality. Reality depends on the dedication of hard-working employees and on their successful execution, and I am very pleased to report that this winter, our plants and our people performed exceptionally. Our retail load requirements were in aggregate properly hedged. And as a result, the company and its shareholders did very well.
The first quarter was generally marked by weak natural gas prices and wholesale electricity prices, which were unexceptional. But our results benefited substantially by the strong operating and financial performance of Reliant, which delivered $151 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. 
I noted previously that wholesale generation usually does well during extreme weather events. Conversely, retail load providers often can do poorly. In this regard, Reliant defied the conventional wisdom. It performed very well operationally and financially during the February weather events, and that is a testament not only to the exceptional operating performance of Reliant's management and staff, but to the intrinsic benefit of NRG's combined wholesale, retail business model. 
Time and time again, over the past 2 years, but perhaps never more visibly than this quarter, we have demonstrated the advantages of the integrated business model of matching retail to generation, both in terms of commercial risk management and in terms of optimizing earnings and cash flow.
And from a cash perspective, the first quarter 2011 was another in a long string of highly cash-generative quarters for the company. This is important to us because as we often say, this is how we manage NRG and have managed through our 7 years at the company: To maximize cash generation and to allocate it efficiently and effectively. 
The company, since the first quarter ended, executed $130 million out of our $180 million 2011 capital allocation program for share buybacks and repaid another $161 million of our outstanding debt as a result of the functioning of our mandatory cash sweep.
Finally, on Slide 3, the first quarter also was an eventful time in terms of the future shape of our industry, not only the events at Fukushima but the promulgation of the new EPA rules impacting coal plants, the enactment into law of the 33% renewable portfolio standard in California, the unexpected extension of certain Federal tax credits for renewable generation and even the seemingly inexorable rise in the price of crude oil and gasolines are all likely to have a profound impact on the future shape of our industry.
In part because Fukushima has impacted us quite directly, we have spent a considerable amount of time over the past months reflecting on these events and considering their impact on our businesses and our opportunities. Our conclusion that apart from the actions we already have announced and implemented with respect to our nuclear development program, the rest of our strategy is more compelling than ever. We're on the right track both in terms of focusing on our solar-focused renewable strategy and in putting more time and effort into our conventional gas-fired repowering efforts in high-value locations within our core markets. And I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in these 2 areas during the quarter. 
With respect to our industry-leading Solar portfolio, we now have a clear line of sight into the financing of nearly 900 megawatts of solar projects, all which will begin construction by the end of this year. Most of these utility scale solar projects are solar PV projects, and all of them are being built with the benefit of long-term PPAs from either Pacific Gas & Electric or Southern California Edison. 
Finally, there are big 3 solar projects. Ivanpah, California Valley Solar Ranch and Agua Caliente, have all received either a conditional loan guarantee commitment from the Department of Energy or in the case of Ivanpah, already have begun to draw down their DOE loan.
With respect to conventional power generation, we now have 1,400 megawatts of gas plants, either under construction or with long-term contracts at Middletown and Connecticut, El Segundo and California and Old Bridge in New Jersey. We have another 1,580 megawatts permitted at Astoria in New York City and Encina in California, which are seeking long-term offtake arrangements in order to move forward. 
In short, both with respect to renewables and conventional repowerings, we have an attractive growth pipeline with limited risk and strong double-digit returns, and we see more opportunity in this area as a result of the pressure arising on incumbent baseload generation as a result of the events of the past few months, and we are in a good position to capitalize on these opportunities.
We expect to provide more detail around both our solar and our conventional growth pipeline on our second quarter call. 
Turning to Slide 4. I have often said that the most important thing that we are directly responsible for as the executive management of NRG is capital allocation. As depicted on this slide, for the past 7 years, we have deployed a lot of capital, both from the substantial cash flow regularly generated by the company and from the external financing done in connection with the Texas Genco transaction. 
We have been quite consistent in our approach to capitalize our allocation, our focused having been on being balanced, prudent and disciplined while maintaining the ability to act quickly when attractive opportunities arise, as we demonstrated both with the Texas Genco and with the Reliant acquisitions. 
For the most part, our approach has worked to the benefit of our shareholders. Indeed, in the first quarter of 2011, around 90% of the company's EBITDA was generated by assets and businesses which we did not own when we started 7 years ago. 
Further, we have taken the occasion of the STP 3&4 write-down to reassess our approach to capital allocation in light of the current circumstances and the risks and the opportunities of our industry. While there certainly are aspects of our approach which we are going to modify as a result of lessons learned, we're going to continue to emphasize balance, discipline and prudency with a dose of opportunism when attractive situations arise. 
What is missing and what has been missing is capital flexibility. The restrictive covenants in our loan agreement simply make it impossible for us to allocate capital in the most efficient manner possible. Of course, we and all of you on the phone have known this for a long time. And indeed, we have attempted several times over the past years in various ways and with varying degrees of success to ease the constraints on our freedom of action with respect to the company's capital. But we have done so always guided by the fact that we need to gain that freedom of action in an economically rational way. 
Today, we have announced that we are already pursuing a debt refinancing package that is designed ultimately to give us much greater freedom of action with respect to the deployment of the company's capital. Chris Schade is going to speak in much greater detail about our approach to this refinancing and the overall plans. So I simply want to point out as shown on Slide 5 that the ultimate goal of this program is to put us in a position where we have the opportunity to use a good chunk of the company's excess liquidity, to increase the stake of the company's existing shareholders and the extraordinary cash flow generation machine which is NRG. 
Even in the currently subdued commodity price cycle, the company is demonstrating a high-teen free cash flow yield. As we go forward, we want to have the ability to protect and enhance that yield, not only by increasing free cash flow but also by significantly reducing the number of shares outstanding. This is one of the quickest and most certain ways in which we can clearly and demonstrably create incremental value for NRG shareholders. 
Over the next several months, we will provide you with regular reports on our progress in implementing that financing plan. So now, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

Now, we're off to a positive start in 2011 with both our Wholesale and Retail businesses delivering strong operating performances during the first quarter. As David mentioned, EPA provided much awaited clarity around environmental rules affecting our generation portfolio. I will discuss those proposed rules in more detail in a moment.
But the key takeaway is that we do not expect at this time any additional environmental CapEx beyond what we have previously announced. With respect to our projects on the construction, the Middletown project is in the final commissioning phase and we expect these units to reach commercial operation in June. The Indian River Back-End Control project and the El Segundo Energy Center Repowering project are progressing according to schedule. 
Finally, the Ivanpah Concentrated Solar Power project in California has started construction work, and it is expected to be fully operational in 2013.
As we have said in the past, the strong commitment to safety is a foundation to achieve superior operating results. And the first quarter of this year is a clear example of that. 
Starting with safety on Slide 8. Our OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 was well within top decile in our industry, making it one of our best quarters ever. We have 35 sites out of 39 without a recordable injury in this first quarter. 
Our overall net generation increased by 1.2 terawatt-hours, driven primarily by higher generation in Texas led by STP and the addition of Cottonwood to our subcentral portfolio. Generation in the Northeast was adversely impacted by lower coal dispatch in February and March. Our baseload plants performed exceptionally well, improving on last year's availability and reliability metrics, particularly when needed the most during the severe weather event that struck Texas in early February. The baseload availability factor was over 90% and reliability, measured by force outage rate, significantly improved compared to Q1 of 2010. Our gas and oil fleet maintained their superior start reliability of 97% while increasing the overall number of starts from prior year.
Turning to our retail operation on Slide 9. We delivered another quarter of strong financial results. As we indicated in our last call, we anticipated bringing our customer count to net 0 losses by the end of the year. In fact, this quarter, our net residential customer count grew by 11,000 since the end of 2010. Reliant also delivered lower bad debt expenses and our hedging strategy during the weather events in February was effective, avoiding any negative financial impact.
On the Residential segment, we continue to lead the market in Texas with innovative products and services that take advantage of smart meter capabilities, and we now have over 220,000 customers using at least one e-Sense product. We're also well along in the process to launch as a residential retail provider in the Northeast. We intend to fully leverage the integrated Energy Reliant model we have successfully executed in Texas. The C&I segment delivered the strongest performance since the acquisition and tripled fine load compared to Q1 of 2010. The C&I expansion into PJM has also preceded well and by the end of the first quarter, the team have signed nearly 1 terawatt-hours of term business.
Finally, the last 2 years, we have chosen to hedge at the retail portfolio exposure to our hurricane via structured transactions. This year, we have made the decision not to insure for a few reasons. Distribution system has been strengthened by the TMD [ph] company after Hurricane Ike. The risk of selling back high price supply at much lower prices have been reduced, and the cost of insurance has increased compared to last year.
Moving on to our market update on Slide 10. Texas continued to show strong fundamentals with demand growing by a healthy 1.8% on a weather normalized basis in the first quarter. And ERCOT is setting a new winter peak low of 57 gigawatts in February. On the supply side, we see little in terms of new generation and thus tightening our reserve margin should lead to higher forward heat rate in Texas. 
We have also seen several positive developments for competitive capacity markets in the Northeast. In New York, FERC ordered an ISO to include property taxes and interconnection costs in its calculation of cost of new entries. In PJM, FERC approved a minimum offer price rule amendment and required new generation to bid no lower than 90% of net CONE. 
Finally, in New England, FERC extended the price will [ph] through 2016 and instructed the ISO to develop a minimum offer price mechanism, similar to those using PJM in New York. All positive developments for our assets.
With respect to natural gas, prices have turned up, especially in the back end of the curve. I believe there are many factors, particularly demand driven, that are starting to change long-term market sentiments such as the prospect for nuclear power post-Fukushima, the incremental power demand from coal retirement and the possibility to export gas from the U.S. 
As you can see on Slide 11, we have taken this opportunity to increase our hedges in 2012 from 52% to 60%, providing some downside protection where fundamentals continue to be vulnerable.
Beyond 2012, we remain on the sidelines given our fundamental view. Retail increased our price load obligations by 13% in 2011 and 8% in 2012. One of the benefits of our wholesale, retail combination is that we control when to vertically integrate the business and achieve maximum synergies and when to decouple it in go-to-market. These ongoing optimization translates into higher margins for our portfolio. 
Our commercial group continues to focus on supporting our retail expansion in the Northeast and wholesale origination activities.
Just this quarter, we began serving two Arkansas series, totaling 350 megawatts of peak load on our South Central region. We will continue to build on our successes and the strength of our physical assets.
As I said in my opening remarks, March was a busy month for EPA. It released a proposed utility MACT and 316(b) rules. These rules, combined with a transport rule issued last July bring much needed clarity and certainty to the electric industry's planning process. I will just cover some of the highlights which I outlined on Slide 12 that allow NRG to reaffirm its compliant strategy. 
As you recall, the transport rule is a new Cap & Trade program for SO2 and NOx. Important to our planning will be allocations, restriction on trading and limited requirements in Texas. The proposed MACT rule provides flexibility in that compliance can be achieved through facility averaging and company selected control technology. It also recognizes the inherent differences in mercury emissions from lignite coal. 
Finally, the 316(b) rule, which addresses water usage, have not mandate cooling towers. These rules, while providing some flexibility for compliance, will have a significant impact in the power markets. We continue to expect between 30 to 40 gigawatts of capacity to be retiring in the next few years. 
So in terms of NRG's generation portfolio, in the past week, I've disclosed the potential implications of a worst case regulatory scenario, with an incremental cost from our base plant of $900 million to $1 billion. Given that all 3 proposed EPA rules came within our expectation, while we await the final rules, we don't expect to incur any incremental CapEx, and we are reaffirming our base capital investment of $720 million for compliance with current regulations. 
Now I will turn it over to Chris for the financial review."

Reliant Energy continued to perform well and contributed",1071,"Thanks, Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14. We are pleased with our strong first quarter results of adjusted EBITDA of $455 million and cash from operations of $216 million. Reliant Energy continued to perform well and contributed $151 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, Reliant's Q1 2011 results were approximately $40 million less and largely explained by a combination of lower volume sold and lower unit margins on both newly acquired and customer renewals.
As Mauricio also discussed, since acquiring Reliant, a primary goal has been to limit customer attrition and create new customer growth through a strategy of enhanced services and offerings. During the first quarter and as a direct result of these efforts, Reliant experienced favorable mass customer growth with the addition of 11,000 new customers since year-end 2010. 
During Q1, our Wholesale Generation business contributed $304 million of adjusted EBITDA, an approximate $100 million decline compared to Q1 2010. Texas wholesale generation contribute $235 million of adjusted EBITDA, a strong performance in light of the challenging commodity markets but weaker than Q1 2010. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was caused by a combination of lower realized energy prices based on lower hedged prices and higher fuel transportation costs, which drove a 15% decline in realized margins per megawatt hour. Offsetting these declines were favorable quarter-on-quarter operating expenses of $14 million.
In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA declined $66 million due to a lower gross margin driven by a 25% decline in coal generation, lower hedged prices and a decrease to capacity revenues due to the expiration of RMR contracts in certain of our Connecticut plants, as well as lower realized LFRM prices and volumes. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating cost of $28 million as we look to reduce regional costs across the board but particularly at lower performing...
The West and South Central regions benefited from higher capacity revenue and increased merchant activity and together contributed $42 million of EBITDA during the first quarter of 2011, a 17% greater number than Q1 2010 performance.
At this time, we are maintaining 2011 EBITDA guidance range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion, an increase in free cash flow before growth guidance by $175 million to a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Before turning to the next slide, I would like briefly to provide an update to our 2011 capital allocation plans. We recently purchased $130 million of NRG shares or 6.2 million shares at an average price of $20.87. This leaves $50 million for additional purchases under the announced 2011 plan, which will be completed before year end. We will also continue to consider the possibility of further share repurchases within the confines of our existing restricted payment baskets and our high-yield notes.
Turning to Slide 15, total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by hedged counterparts, remained strong during Q1 at about $4 billion, which included total cash of $2.7 billion. This healthy liquidity position permits ample room for us to continue to execute on our near-term solar development program, as well as considered future capital allocation commitments. 
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 16. Although NRG has begun the year on a strong note, we are currently maintaining the 2011 EBITDA guidance as I've previously said at $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. However, we are raising free cash flow growth by $175 million. 
Increase in free cash flow guidance is directly a result of the increase in margin collateral received during the first quarter, as well as a reduction to environmental CapEx caused by the issuance of tax exempt funds associated with the Indian River Air Quality Control System project. 
It is our goal to provide greater priority and performance by narrowing EBITDA guidance range throughout the year after Q1, since the summer weather conditions can meaningfully affect our performance.
On Slide 17, I would like to explain our goals to simplify our existing capital structure as David has previously stated. This undertaking will involve a 2-stage process and encompass our existing first lien facilities, as well as those senior notes containing certain restrictive covenants. Stage 1 is focused on our first lien debt and is expected to be completed around the end of Q2 or early Q3 of 2011. Our goal during Stage 1 is to issue a single $2.3 billion revolver to replace an existing $1 billion revolver and $1.3 billion letter of credit facility. We also intend to issue a new 7-year, $1.6 billion term loan B facility to replace 2 outstanding existing term loan B tranches. Our primary goal in this process will be to eliminate investment basket restrictions, cash flow sweep restrictions and mirror the covenant packages currently in the indentures governing our most recent bond issuances and specifically those in 2018, '19 and 2020. 
Second in Stage 2. It is our goal to refinance the $3.5 billion of 2016 and 2017 notes over the coming 6 to 9 months. The completion of this stage is consistent with our strategy of refinancing these bonds at respective coal dates similar to the transaction we completed in January of this year and our 2014 maturity. As part of this refinancing, we expect to replace restrictive covenant packages with a more flexible structure, allowing us to return value to shareholders. 
Furthermore, upon completion of the final refinancing, NRG will have a common covenant package across all debt maturities.
As a reminder, those common covenants of which I am referring to are governed by cash flow metrics rather than income, which we believe is better aligned and more suited with how NRG runs its business. Long term benefits NRG and its stakeholders through successful execution of this debt restructuring are numerous. First, there is an immediate improvement in the debt maturity profile with the nearest maturity of either our first lien debt or bonds no sooner than 2016. Second, a common covenant package will be aligned across the NRG capital structure permitting greater flexibility and a creation of a long range approach to capital allocations, both for a more efficient approach to the reinvestment in our business and/or return to shareholders. We look forward to sharing our long range of more predictable planning goals with you in the future as we complete this refinancing process and work through future growth plans and capital requirements.
Now, I'll turn it over to David for questions."

And before we open the floor to questions. Just one summary remark. We've been asked many times over the past few weeks whether we plan any new strategic initiatives to take the place of nuclear development. And the short and simple answer to that question is no. Our strategy was and still is a multi-pronged growth strategy incorporating many initiatives, which are designed to capitalize on what we see as being very attractive opportunities opened to the 21st century power companies. We think if we successfully execute on these initiatives, we will substantially enhance the shareholder value in the years to come. The dimmed prospect for the nuclear renaissance in the United States either have not affected our other initiatives or in some cases, they've actually enhanced the attractiveness of these other opportunities. 
So our plan, quite simply, is to redeploy the time, energy and resources we were putting into new nuclear developments into a near -- people at NRG know that I'm a big fan of alliteration into the 4 Rs of renewables, repowerings, retail and repurchases. So with that, Laura, we'd be happy to answer any questions that people have."

It's overwhelmingly when you focused on solar, and we have this pipeline that we think will go into construction, we'll use the benefits of the cash ITC program that's available through the remainder of this year. As I mentioned, that's close to 1,000 megawatts. Beyond that, we have a development pipeline. It's earlier stage and so things can come and go, but that can be another couple thousand megawatts over the next few years. So we're going to have a lot of focus on that area. To date, that has been out in the southwest United States. We are looking to get more involved in solar further East, I mean, certainly in Texas but also actually in the East. But that's still a work in progress. 
On the conventional side, one of the things that we think is going to come about obviously is that we've had sort of a reversal in terms of solid fuel baseload. While clearly, the prospects for a nuclear development in the country outside of the deep South have dimmed substantially. And now that we have much greater clarity about coal-fired generation because of the promulgation of the EPA rules, we at least have a sense of what's going to happen in that market and you can actually price opportunities and you can price gas as an alternative. We have a lot of great sites around the company in the Northeast and Texas and the West Coast. The transmission system depends upon power from a lot of our sites. So we have mainly a brownfield development, redevelopment effort at many different sites around the country, and I think we're going to be re-evaluating that and see if we can get more plants permitted. But I think with where our market prices are, we are currently operating on the assumption that anything we do is going to benefit one way or another from a long-term offtake arrangement. And we'll try to be more specific on the second quarter call because there are live projects that we think will have greater certainty by that time."

On the retail side, the convention is that during these events, retail providers tend to be heard. In our case, through the hedge profile that we have provided to Reliant, they were no longer insulated on February 2 but to some extent benefited by the sudden decrease of our power prices following these events, with higher loads that were maintained because of our coal [ph] prices.

For this quarterly earnings call, which is the 30th such call in the history of the new NRG, we come to you for the first time from Houston Texas where the temperature forecast today is hot, followed by periods of hotter. The humidity is about as stick as New York cheesecake and the air conditioning is working overtime. With earth cut shuttering it slowed record everyday this week, hopefully, this will be a good day to be in the electricity business in Texas.
For this call, I'm joined by our COO, Mauricio Gutierrez; and our CFO, Chris Schade, both will be joining me delivering prepared remarks.
I'm also joined here today by Jason Few, the Head of the High Flying Reliant; and Tom, the President of Scorching Hide NRG Solar. Both of will be available to answer any questions you may have regarding their respective areas of responsibility.
Now turning to the presentation. We have a lot of a very positive things to talk about today. So let's go straight to the highlight page, which is Slide 3 of the presentation. As Chris will elaborate on a little later, the financial results speak for themselves. Boyd by Reliant's continued exceptional performance, we now have posted a very healthy $517 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. We also earned a position to narrow the range in revised upward our full year 2011 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.9 billion to $2 billion. What is particularly positive about this result is that while we certainly had benefited from a very warm summer today, we also benefited substantially from the immense progress Reliant has made in slowing and ultimately reversing the long-term decline in its customer account. And Reliant has achieved this positive a reversal, not by eroding margins excessively but rather through its best-in-class customer care, its effective use of multiple sales channels and its expanded product offering.
Reliant's exceptional financial and operating performance was replicated during the quarter by Green Mountain, which performed well. And also across our wholesale generation fleet where we realized a baseload fleet availability around the critical 90% mark and achieved a very high level of reliability in Epicor startups, which is obviously a very important operating metric, particularly during the hot and high-priced summer peak hours. 
At it has been for the past 7.5 years, the strong operating performance achieved by our plant operations group, together with the 4 hedging program implemented by our commercial operations team, achieved a substantially cash generative result, which in turn feeds our very strong liquidity and our strategic capital allocation efforts.
This quarter and year-to-date, our financial team has gone from success to success in a steps it has taken to simplify our capital structure and to enable us to allocate our shareholders capital with maximum efficiency. Now only our 2,017 bonds remain in our way and they become redeemable in just 5 months time. But NRG's commitment to efficient allocation stand still for no man nor will it will be frustrated by the obstacles placed in its path by any individual bond issue. So I'm very pleased today to announce an additional $250 million share buyback program, which together with the $50 million of shares, which remain to be repurchased under our previously announced 2011 program, means that we have $300 million of NRG shares to be purchased before the end of 2011. 
This supplemental buyback program, which we intend to implement over the balance of 2011, is made possible by the accounting impact of our recently concluded IRS audit on our -- and the impact of that on our existing RP basket. Chris well explain that in greater detail.
When fully implemented, we will have completed $430 million of share repurchases in 2011. But I would prefer for you to think of this new $250 million share buyback program as a down payment on what maybe to come in the first quarter 2012. 
Finally, our cash position is so strong that while we have committed substantial capital on 2011, both of buying back shares and paying down debt, we continue to be able to invest substantial capital in growing the company's portfolio in various low risk value enhancing ways. 
Most notably, our Solar effort to achieve very significant successes during the quarter. Our big 3 Solar progress projects progressed well and are on track, notwithstanding a temporary hiccup caused by a desert issue at one of the 3 projects. And in the most exciting development in the quarter, we achieved a major step forward towards competitive advantage in large-scale rooftop solar when our project and partnership with Prologis received conditional approval for a $1.4 billion DOE loan guarantee. 
We consider large-scale rooftop solar to be a critical and highly attractive area within the distributed generation space and one that is going to an increasing amount of favorable public policy supports in the years to come.
So before I go into a little bit more detail on all of these, I ask you, the shareholders and prospective shareholders of NRG, to consider this, if this is what NRG can accomplish 36 months into a deep commodity down cycle, imagine what we can achieve as we come out of that down cycle. And as our core commodities trend upwards toward mid-cycle levels, the potential is enormous. So let me just amplify a few of my points starting on Slide 4.
From an earnings call perspective, this is the second anniversary of our purchase of Reliant. Those who were skeptical on this call 2 years ago that Reliant could sustain strong financial results quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year have to accept that Reliant business model as supported by NRG's wholesale fleet and commercial operations team is a very strong and valuable business and is now an intrinsic part of our business model, a part that makes us absolutely unique amongst our immediate peer group. As part of our new guidance, we expect Reliant to contribute over $600 million of EBITDA in calendar year 2011. 
And as I said previously, it is no longer business that is contracting in size over time. Not only are we seeing the day when Reliant is able to grow its customer count, but we see greater value creation opportunities for Reliant presenting themselves in expanded product offerings and in geographic expansion. 
Indeed, like many retailers, we see this as a particularly right opportunity for retail expansion in the Northeast United States. And both Reliant end of the mountain are having positive early success as in their efforts in that markets. And in fact, since I have a large group of people listening on the phone and many of you are located in the Northeast United States, I invite you to visit reliant.com or greenmountain.com. With a minimal of fuss, you can enjoy the financial and customer care benefits of Reliant or Green Mountain as I do at my home in New Jersey. And while I'm in sales mode, Reliant Green Mountain obviously served businesses as well as individuals, so feel free to call your employees to switch to Reliant or Green Mountain so that you can enjoy the benefits at the office, as well as at home.
Now reverting back from that brief commercial to my presentation and from the Northeast to Texas, I want to point out that the robust supply-demand fundamentals in Texas indicate a bright future for the biggest part of our operation and a future that will be realized sooner rather than later. The 60-gigawatt record loads that ERCOT is setting everyday this week indicates a peak reserve margin for ERCOT in the 10% range rather than in the 17% range officially predicted by ERCOT just 3 months ago. Of course, this record performance was significantly influenced by the heat, but in case haven't been paying attention, it's getting significantly hotter almost everywhere every year. And that trend, if anything, seems destined to accelerate, one of my Texas colleagues who was in the room today reminded me that in college station, Texas was 99 degrees yesterday. Maybe that doesn't seem as so remarkable, but it was 99 degrees at 11:00 at night. 
So I think everyone should consider that what we currently or what we like to think of as being abnormally hot is actually probably the new summer normal. 
Finally, we continue to invest in the revitalization of our conventional fleet, led by several recoveries at geographically favorable location and/or near load pockets employing new fast start combined cycle technology that should higher efficiency while being able to respond to the system's increasing need for capacity resources, that can respond quickly to great fluctuations caused by a high percentage of intermittent renewable plants. 
In particular, I'm speaking about El Segundo in Los Angeles, which is in construction. But we also have high expectations for our Encina in San Diego County and for Astoria in New York City. What this all adds up to is a company that is able to deliver a high teen free cash flow yield before growth investments and even nearly a double-digit free cash flow yield even after taking account our several hundred million dollars of current year investments in attractive growth projects.
Turning to Slide 5 and continue to focus on capital allocation. As those of you who have followed us for several years understand we have always pursued a very balanced capital allocation program. Over the life of the new NRG, we have deployed about $9 billion of the company's capital relatively evenly across 4 buckets of capital allocation that are depicted on the pie chart of this page. 
Notwithstanding that the greater part of the attention to our capital allocation program has been on share buybacks, the single largest deployment over that period has been to debt repayment, with $3.1 billion of debt paid down. The first half of 2011 was no different in this regard, with the company having paid down almost $600 million of debt in the first half of the year alone. This is consistent with our commitment to prudent balance sheet management, which has been an unwavering aspect of our management approach at NRG over the past 8 years and will continue to be so into the indefinite future. 
But now we have the additional $250 million of share buybacks announced today, which serves as a precursor for the additional capital allocation actions we hope to take after we clear away the 2,017 bonds in the first quarter of 2012.
The good news is that even after this additional buyback in 2011, even after our substantial debt repayment, even after we invest a very substantial amount of equity capital on solar projects and conventional combined cycle projects and even after we spend our typical net $200 million  to $3 million a year on major maintenance and environmental CapEx in our assets, we expect to end 2011 with several hundred million dollars of cash on our balance sheet in excess of what we feel we need to run our business. As a result, we will be well positioned to set up 2012 as another year of significant return of capital to shareholders.
Now finally before turning over to Mauricio, let me say a few words about our thriving solar effort. Our first year utility scale solar projects identified on Slide 6 are all progressing either on schedule or ahead of schedule through the final development and financing phase and, in many cases, into construction. Tom Doyle would be pleased to answer any questions you might have about any of these projects. 
A point that I want to reemphasize about this solar project is the relative lack of risk. In the 20 years that I have been in this business developing financing and building power plants, never have I been associated with utility scale projects that feature such a relative absence of risk. When we assess these large scale solar projects from the point of view of political risk, technological risk, environmental risk, commercial risk by which I mean uptake risk and most of all, completion risk, the risk profile is nowhere on the chart even compared to a standard start combined cycle power plant. So we like this business a lot and think it's an appropriate place to invest our shareholders' capital. 
But as we've said previously, we expect the Solar business to migrate over the next few years towards more distributed applications. And a couple weeks back I was privileged to be with Governor Jerry Brown of California when he spoke of his firm intent to bring 12,000 megawatts of distributive generation to California. We expect to distribute Solar increasingly to benefit from supportive public policy at the state and local level. Because distributive solar means jobs and not just any type of jobs, it means local just for contractors and other small-business employers. This is why in my opinion, you no longer hear much talk about a high voltage transmission systems expanding the country. Public policymakers want to keep it local. And since we always have thought and said that the idea of a high-voltage national transmission system was nonsensical, we fully support this keep at local approach. We have taken several steps over the past several months to put ourselves in a position to be a leader in capitalizing on this trend to distribute solar. We will come back next quarter and talk more about what we have done in this area. But I will just mention again this one program. The multistate warehouse rooftop program on lines that we have with Prologis with financial support from Bank of America and the Department of Energy is a hugely important and strategic initiative that will enable us to scale up and reduce costs in this critical segment of the distributed market. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

And now we delivered another strong operating performance during the second quarter in both our generation and retail segments. Some of the highlights are listed on Slide 8.

And now we delivered another strong operating performance during the second quarter in both our generation and retail segments. Some of the highlights are listed on Slide 8. Starting with safety, we maintained our performance with the recordable rate of 0.78 for the first of the year. This is our #1 focus across the operations group and will continue to strive towards a 0 in workplace.
Our plant performance metrics saw a significant improvements on availability and starting reliability compared to the second quarter of 2010. Even though we successfully concluded our spring outage season, we're in a very solid operational position during this critical summer months. 
On the commercial front, we added significant hedges for 2012 while effectively managing the retail supply requirements during the warmest year on record in Texas. On the environmental front, the EPA released the final cross state air pollution rule in July. As you all know, the main change was the inclusion of Texas in the rule. And while there will be some incremental operating expenses, we are reaffirming today our environmental capital plan of approximately $720 million.
Finally, we continue to make good progress in our repowering and solar projects. In June, we reached commercial operations on our 200-megawatt Middletown repowering project in Connecticut and started the commissioning sequence for roadrunner solar projects in New Mexico. All other projects in Indian River, El Segundo and Ivanpah continue to be on schedule. 
Now turning to Slide 9 for a more detailed review of our operating performance. Net generation was higher by 2.5 terawatt hours during the second quarter compared to 2010. Driven primarily by generation in Texas due to a record whether in June and the addition of Cottonwood in our South Central portfolio. Our basel plants continued their strong operating performance and posted an equivalent availability factor, or EAF, of 91% for the second quarter. 
Indian River led the fleet with 97% availability followed by Parish and both with over 94% availability. In the beginning of the year, we have seen a significant increase in the number of starts on our gas and oil fleet. During the second quarter, our peak in units responded with an impressive 99%
Starting reliability, ensuring we didn't miss any opportunity during the high-priced our. 
Moving on to our retail operations on Slide 10. We delivered yet another quarter of strong financial results. Texas experienced record temperatures for the month of June. And with our hedging strategy and relatively stable market prices, we achieved significant earnings. We also continue to grow net mass customer count, making that 2 consecutive quarters of growth with 17,000 additional customers in the end of 2010. We feel even stronger about delivering net 0 customer losses by the end of the year.
Reliant also delivered lower bad debt expenses on our map segments. Its strong performance has enabled NRG's retail business to be the largest in Texas while also delivering the stronger customer satisfaction levels. On the residential segment, with our expansion into the Northeast and are now serving customers in 3 states. While we have grown the number of different customers with a smart meter services from 220,000 at the end of the first quarter to 350,000 today. 
Our CNI expansion into the Northeast continues as well, with sales teams currently operating at 6 states. This segment has experienced increased competition and compressed margins and we're being selective on transactions where margins justify the risk of serving that load.
Moving on to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivities on Slide 11. We increased our baseload hedges from 60% to 75% in 2012 where gas fundamentals remain weak. In addition, we saw an opportunity to increase our coal hedges for 2012 ahead of the EPO rule and our commercial operations did a great job executing in the market and hedging 100% of our requirements. 
Beyond 2012, we continue to remain open on our baseload and peak in portfolios. We see limited downside risk on the gas market from current levels, the top with our view that our recovery is already underway in our urban market, driven by robust demand, lack of supply and stringent environmental rules, we anticipate ample opportunities to layer additional power hedges in the near future.
Expanding a bit further on this market dynamics on Slide 12, you can see that Texas continues to show strong signs of growth and economic recovery. During the second quarter, demand grew by a healthy 2.5% on a weather normalized basis. And during the extreme weather conditions over the past few weeks, we're spending back to back new peak low records of over 68 gigawatts, almost a 4% increase from the record just set last summer.
On the upper right-hand corner, we have provided a new reserved margins for our customer that we release in May, which shows reserved margins falling below the target of 13.75% by 2014. 2 points I want to make on this forecast. On the low growth assumption, we believe they are too optimistic in the near term and aggressive on the later years. And 2, on the supply side, we remain skeptical about new generation given the forward spart spread steel supporting new build economics. The basement from our point of view is that we may see reserve margins fall sooner than 2014, possibly 1 or 2 years sooner. 
On the environmental front, the more stringent air pollution room accelerate some retirements in Texas. The market has already started to play some of these back as you can see on the lower right chart. It is difficult to assess at this point the ultimate impact as it will depend on the price of allowances and changes on the generations pack, which will have significant seasonal differences. But we believe the remaining baseload call generators like NRG will benefit from increased gas on the margin. 
Finally, we have been talking about gaining clarity on EPA requirements in 2012 for the transport rule, now the air pollution rule. It differed from the proposal in a number of respects. Among the most noteworthy for NRG were the tightening of allocations, inclusion of Texas in the group 2 SO2 and those programs, limitation of lease to seasons on programs, removal of Connecticut and Delaware from the list of states and the loss of trading flexibility in the early years. 
As I review on prior calls, our investment in existing control technologies and use of place a large part in our ability to manage the final air pollution rule. We anticipate from our early analysis of this rule that NRG can comply through an integrated strategy. Increased cover efficiency by about 10% to 15%, fuel switching to lower sulfur PRB coal and additional blending at our limestone facility, seasonal dispatch and allowance purchases. We believe that incremental compliance costs are not material and can largely be offset by impact in electricity prices as we saw in the previous slide. 
Overall, given what I have reviewed between our current operational and commercial competitive advantages and the signs of improving fundamental drivers in our core market, we expect NRG's base business portfolio to realize enhanced returns over the next few years. With that, I will turn it over to Chris Schade for the financial review."
413857,138259873,152214,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricion, and good morning. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15, we are very pleased with our results for both the quarter and year-to-date 2011 having announced adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and $972 million, respectively. Duri",1338,"Thank you, Mauricion, and good morning. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15, we are very pleased with our results for both the quarter and year-to-date 2011 having announced adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and $972 million, respectively. During the second quarter, Reliant Energy continued to perform well, contributing $176 million of adjusted EBITDA as the business benefited from the warmest June on record leading to a 9% increase in mass volumes. NRG's wholesale generation business recorded $341 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter, Texas wholesale generation contributed $215 million of adjusted EBITDA as the fleet average capacity factor improved 3%, allowing the region to benefit from the favorable weather. However, despite the improvement in operational performance, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decreased to $128 million, largely as a result of lower quarter-on-quarter NRG and hedge prices realized in 2010.
In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $47 million, approximately $50 million decline versus the second quarter of 2010 and it was driven by lower hedge prices and a substantial decrease in capacity revenues offset by lower operating costs.
The West and South Central regions delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of $20 million from the prior year's period. These regions continue to benefit from strong merchant activity particularly in the South Central with the addition of Cottonwood.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2011 was $972 million, with Reliant contributing $327 million and our wholesale business adding $645 million. Reliant's business has performed extremely well by continuing to grow its mass customer base and the $13 million improvement in the C&I business on a year-on-year, due in part to an improvement in unit margins. 
The NRG wholesale businesses ahs also performed well and benefited from an 8% year-on-year increase in generation sold or 3.7 terawatt hours and a 3% improvement in baseload operational performance. The results were offset again by lower energy prices, higher fuel and transport costs and lower capacity revenues.
Following the completion of a Federal tax audit during the quarter, net income increased by over $600 million due to the reversal of tax liabilities resulting from a confirmation of the company's net operating loss positions. For those of you who that are new to NRG, net income is the determinant of the size of the restricted payments back to calculation under our most restrictive instruments, which are the 2017 bonds. As a result of this $600 million accounting reversal, our RP basket expanded by an additional $300 million during the quarter. Due to the expanded RP basket and taking into account the significant undervaluation that persists in the company's share price performance today, we are able to increase our share purchase program by $250 million, bringing the total 2011 share repurchase program to 430 million. To date, we have completed 130 million of a share repurchases leaving 300 million of additional share repurchases, which we intend to complete before year-end 2011.
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 16. As David mentioned, we are raising the adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1.9 billion to $2 billion. This increase is largely driven by the strong performance of the Reliant Energy retail business, as it has benefited this year from favorable weather conditions and improved customer retention. We now expect Reliant to contribute between $610 million to $660 million of EBITDA compared to our original expectations of a range between $480 million to $570 million. Meanwhile, the wholesale business has performed as expected. And as such, we are narrowing our original guidance range to $1.22 billion to $1.26 billion. 
Turning to free cash flow, we currently expect free cash flow before growth to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting strong cash flow, offset by the impact of collateral movements and the first lien refinancing.
Now turning to Slide 17. Total liquidity remains strong for the first half of the year at $3.3 billion. Total cash at the end of Q2 was $2.1 billion, which was a decrease of about $900 million from the year-end 2010. The decrease in cash was largely explained by debt prepayments of about $560 million, maintenance of environmental CapEx net of financing of about $115 million, investments on solar and repairing projects net of financing of about $310 million, $103 million of share repurchases all offset by about $300 million of cash from operations.
Based on our current forecast and changes to the Capital Allocation Plan, we now expects to end 2011 with almost $2.1 billion of cash even including the impact of the expanded share repurchase program announced today.
Although not illustrated on this slide, I would like to quickly provide an update of our ongoing efforts to sell down equity in our solar development projects. We continue to target a 49% sell down of 880 megawatts of utility projects that will accomplish 3 goals. One, efficiently manage the Solar tax attributes; two, attract new investors to solar development; and three, free up comp to be redeployed in our prolific solar pipeline.
The progress of this initiative has admittedly being even slower than expected, mostly as a result of the presumable the agreement through the Department of Energy for the larger projects. With that said, we remain confident there were, which financial close with a net effect of increasing liquidity this year. Our share buyback plans are not dependent on the timing of this sell down. 
On Slide 18, I would like to provide an update to the simplification of the capital structure encompassing both our first lien facilities, as well as the senior notes that we announced during the Q1 earnings call. We successfully completed Stage 1 by replacing our existing $1 billion revolver and $1.3 billion letter of credit facility with a single $2.3 billion revolving credit facility due in 2016. 
Additionally, we issued a new single $1.6 billion term loan B facility that matures in 2018 to replace 2 existing term loan B tranches with maturities in 2013, and '15. This refinancing eliminate investment basket restrictions and cash flow sweep requirements while aligning the covenant structure in our first lien with our newer fund indentures.
Stage 2 the refinancing of the 3.5 billion of senior notes is progressing as indicated. In May, we completed the redemption of 2.4 billion 2016 Senior Notes with the issuance of Senior with a simplified indenture package maturing in 2019 and 2021. Over the coming months, we will look to complete the final stage of the simplification with the refinancing of the 2017 Senior Notes.
As I mentioned on the Q1 earnings call, the long-term benefits to NRG and the stake holders, the successful execution of this debt restructuring strategy are numerous. First, there is an immediate improvement in the debt maturity profile with the nearest maturity by the first lien debt or bonds no earlier than 2016. Second, a common covenant package will be aligned across the NRG cap structure permitting greater flexibility and the creation of a long range approach to capital allocation, but for a more efficient approach to investing our business and to return to shareholders.
And finally, as it was announced earlier this morning, I'll be leaving NRG in early September to pursue an exciting and unique new opportunity in the healthcare industry. This decision is in no way a reflection of the current health of the company or a judgment about its future prospects. On the contrary, I am quite proud to have had the opportunity to work alongside with incredibly talented and gifted team to strengthen the company's financial position and improve NRG's ability to provide greater returns to shareholders. I'm also grateful to have had been able to help execute David Crane's strategy of transitioning NRG to a 21st century power provider, particularly as it relates to building one of the country's largest solar power companies. As a current and future shareholder, I look forward to following NRG's transformative progress. Now I'll turn it over to David for closing remarks."

So on behalf of myself and everyone at NRG, I wish him well in his new endeavor. With respect to a new CFO, we have just commenced consideration of potential successors for Chris and while it is early days yet, I want you to know that I have every expectation that we will be able to consider our alternatives and fill the position in a much shorter period of time than last time around. 
The second and final thing I would tell you at this early stage in our CFO's search is that we have a very, very capable finance and accounting teams with deeply experience management and they will continue to pursue the company's various financing and capital allocation initiatives no matter how short or how long the CFO and to period turns out to be. 
So now turning to the concluding slide on Page 20.
Sometimes the NRG story, by which I mean our investment proposition, consume rather complicated. But I think at this juncture and at this share price it boils down to 3 things that you may wish to consider as drivers for further investment in NRG. First, our unique wholesale asset retail business mix that has its core strength in Texas, the best and strongest growing in regional mark in the United States with the reserve margin that has proven itself in the past few days to be surprisingly tight. 
Second, our robustly growing green energy portfolio of projects and businesses, led by our industry leading multi-faceted solar programs. And third, our willingness in our significant ability to return excess capital through our capital allocation program in a manner that creates value for our shareholders. This is a business model which we have been pursuing relentlessly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. And with that, Kiana, we will be happy to take questions from people on the phone."

Obviously, with where the company share prices now seriously undervalued from our perspective, we see investment in the company stock as to be about the best thing that the company can do with its money. We honestly have no idea what the company share price will be in the first quarter next year. Obviously, we hope that it will move into a particular direction from where it is right now. So I don't want to give you a particular number in that regard. But I would tell you that as we think through what will happen once we are out from underneath the this restricted payment basket is that I think one thing that will be trying to change people's mindset on is the idea that there is a specific amount of buyback that will do every year on recurring basis. That was something that we put in place about 5 years ago because looking forward with the RP basket is part of our life. We sort of saw that we'd have that ability to do that. I think what you'll see in the first quarter next year is that the way we're going to look at it is we want to rightsize our balance sheet from the point of view of how much liquidity we've maintained and go back to the way most people do buybacks, which is not something they do the same number every year. But if they have excess cash, they do it and if they don't have excess cash, they don't do it. So I think that's the way we'll be looking at whatever decision we make in the first quarter of the year is how much excess cash do we have and what should we do of it so that the balance sheet isn't constantly carrying this big -- it's a high quality problem but this burden of too much high cost capital."

But I mean let me address some of the other potential uses since you mentioned them. I think you can see the limits of my predictive capacity because I had anticipated in early 2010 that 2011 would be a good time to be in the market buying power plants. But nothing could be further from the truth. I'll tell you what we've seen in the last several months is that -- and this is speaking about gas fire to power plants is that, that there are a lot of people chasing the gas plants in the market and they're willing to pay prices that we can't justify. And the price that we're taking things are worth in the price of people are paying for that is not shrinking, it's getting larger. The other thing we're seeing in the market for gas power plants is it's not just a strategic buyers in the market anymore it's financial buyers. It seems that people are anticipating a turn in commodity cycle and private enterprises that don't have to worry at all about near-term accretion dilution or a mass plant so the idea that pressure is about to turn in a positive direction. So I would say of all the things that you might see us investing money in, the least likely that you'll see as investing money in is in buying gas fire combined cycle power plants. Another question that comes up is what about coal plants now that we have a little bit greater clarity because EPA rules are our there? I think it's really too early to tell on that because first of all, I'm not sure. No one's sure exactly how the EPA rules are going to kick in and whether they are going to be applied on time I think so. I think the jury's still out on whether there is to be value obtained in buying coal plants. And I would mention we continue to seek, we would like to have a larger conventional power plant business in the Northeast United States particularly in PJM so it continues to be an explanation of this company but I'm not I'm just confident that we can do that at value. And so that's not as mentally use of cash resources. So apart from that on the M&A front, there are things that we see in the alternative energy space around the retail business that will kill output to try to do in terms of our integral. But those types of terms are much more dial number of things and would not impact if it in any way what we're confident in contemplating in terms of capital allocation. Over the next several months.

And so we start by setting that aside. The second thing I think that you will, you can count on us doing is that we will look at the equity capital when we get to the first quarter next year, we'll look at the equity capital that we expect to invest in the Solar projects and the Congressional projects that are well underway. One of the things about -- another one of the things that I like about Solar development is that the heat rate on solar development seems to be significantly higher than the heat rate on conventional power generation. And so if it looks like we have projects in the pipeline there going to require equity capital in the foreseeable period of time. For example, calendar year 2012, we will take that into account. And then we look at having deducted those 2 things and obviously the main environmental CapEx and the other things that we do every year then that's the number. And right now, we projected that number will be in the several hundred million dollar range. And so I know I did some of them with the previous question in terms of ranking this very of capital and to some degree, I don't think that we have to rank this capital because we have so much capital that if we have very strong investments, I think we can do more than one thing. But I think we will look where we stand at the time in the Spring of 2012. And this is important and then we will consult with our Board of Directors because they will have a very strong point of view on this. And then we will look at the options in terms of return of capital to all the stakeholders this shareholders serving but even whether there should be more debt repayment."

And what we're particularly concerned in retail right now would have rolled under obviously price competition from other retailers and for the reasons that we really describes Reliant had been able to withstand that attack. But what we maybe facing over the next 3 years is that if ERCOT, which does not have a lot of generations supply coming through the construction pipeline gets very tight on generation side, Jason's wholesale costs may arise in compressed retail margins in that regard. But and so will Jason be able to do $600 million or $700 million a year every year going forward and that sort of pricing wholesale pricing environment. But, of course, of the good thing for our NRG shareholders is what Jason sees in terms of compression is what our generation side will see is a greater margin in Texas, we're still roughly 2/3 generation and 1/3 retail. So ultimately, the company overall will benefit in that situation even if Reliant has difficulty posting the same type of a number year on year out, year in, year out.

For this quarterly earnings call, which is the 30th such call in the history of the new NRG, we come to you for the first time from Houston, Texas where the temperature forecast for today is hot, followed by periods of hotter. The humidity is about as thick as New York cheesecake, and the air conditioners are working overtime. With ERCOT shuttering, it slowed record everyday this week. Hopefully, this will be a good day to be in the electricity business in Texas.
For this call, I'm joined by our COO, Mauricio Gutierrez; and our CFO, Chris Schade, both who will be joining me in delivering prepared remarks.
I'm also joined here today by Jason Few, the Head of high-flying Reliant; and Tom Doyle, the President of scorching hot NRG Solar, both of whom will be available to answer any questions you may have regarding their respective areas of responsibility.
Now turning to the presentation. We have a lot of very positive things to talk about today. So let's go straight to the highlight page, which is Slide 3, of the presentation. As Chris will elaborate on a little later, the financial results speak for themselves. Void by Reliant's continued exceptional performance, we not only posted a very healthy $517 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, we also earned a position to narrow the range and revise upward our full year 2011 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.9 billion to $2 billion. What is particularly positive about this result is that while we certainly had benefited from a very warm summer today, we also benefited substantially from the immense progress Reliant has made in slowing and ultimately reversing the long-term decline in its customer account. And Reliant has achieved this positive reversal, not by eroding margins excessively but rather through its best-in-class customer care, its effective use of multiple sales channels and its expanded product offering.
Reliant's exceptional financial and operating performance was replicated during the quarter by Green Mountain which performed well, and also across our wholesale generation fleet where we realized a baseload fleet availability around the critical 90% mark and achieved a very high level of reliability in peaker startups, which is obviously a very important operating metric, particularly during the hot and high-priced summer peak hours. 
As it has been for the past 7.5 years, the strong operating performance achieved by our plant operations group, together with the 4 hedging program implemented by our commercial operations team, achieved a substantially cash generative result, which in turn feeds our very strong liquidity and our strategic capital allocation efforts.
This quarter and year-to-date, our financial team has gone from success to success in the steps it has taken to simplify our capital structure and to enable us to allocate our shareholders' capital with maximum efficiency. Now only our 2,017 bonds remain in our way, and they become redeemable in just 5 months time. But NRG's commitment to efficient capital allocation stands still for no man, nor will it will be frustrated by the obstacles placed in its path by any individual bond issue. So I'm very pleased today to announce an additional $250 million share buyback program, which together with the $50 million of shares which remain to be repurchased under our previously announced 2011 program, means that we have $300 million of NRG shares to be purchased before the end of 2011. 
This supplemental buyback program, which we intend to implement over the balance of 2011, is made possible by the accounting impact of our recently concluded IRS audit on our -- and the impact of that on our existing RP basket. Chris well explain that in greater detail.
When fully implemented, we will have completed $430 million of share repurchases in 2011. But I would prefer for you to think of this new $250 million share buyback program as a down payment on what may be to come in the first quarter of 2012. 
Finally, our cash position is so strong that while we have committed substantial capital on 2011, both to buying back shares and paying down debt, we continue to be able to invest substantial capital in growing the company's portfolio in various low-risk value-enhancing ways. 
Most notably, our solar effort to achieve very significant successes during the quarter. Our big 3 solar progress -- projects progressed well and are on track, notwithstanding a temporary hiccup caused by a desert tortoise issue at one of the 3 projects. And in the most exciting development in the quarter, we achieved a major step forward towards competitive advantage in large-scale rooftop solar when our project and partnership with Prologis received conditional approval for a $1.4 billion DOE loan guarantee. 
We consider large-scale rooftop solar to be a critical and highly attractive area within the distributed generation space, and one that is going to attract an increasing amount of favorable public policy support in the years to come.
So before I go into a little bit more detail on all of this, I ask you, the shareholders and prospective shareholders of NRG to consider this. If this is what NRG can accomplish 36 months into a deep commodity down cycle, imagine what we can achieve as we come out of that down cycle, and as our core commodities trend upwards towards mid-cycle levels. The potential is enormous. So let me just amplify a few of my points starting on Slide 4.
From an earnings call perspective, this is the second anniversary of our purchase of Reliant. Those who were skeptical on this call 2 years ago that Reliant could sustain strong financial results quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year have to accept that Reliant's business model, as supported by NRG's wholesale fleet and commercial operations team, is a very strong and valuable business and is now an intrinsic part of our business model, a part that makes us absolutely unique amongst our immediate peer group. As part of our new guidance, we expect Reliant to contribute over $600 million of EBITDA in calendar year 2011. 
And as I said previously, it is no longer business that is contracting in size over time. Not only are we seeing the day when Reliant is able to grow its customer count, but we see greater value creation opportunities for Reliant presenting themselves in expanded product offerings and in geographic expansion. 
Indeed, like many retailers, we see this as a particularly right opportunity for retail expansion in the Northeast United States. And both Reliant and Green Mountain are having positive early success in their efforts in that market. And in fact, since I have a large group of people listening on the phone and many of you are located in the Northeast United States, I invite you to visit reliant.com or greenmountain.com. With a minimal of fuss, you can enjoy the financial and customer care benefits of Reliant or Green Mountain, as I do at my home in New Jersey. And while I'm in sales mode, Reliant and Green Mountain obviously served businesses as well as individuals. So feel free to call your employer to switch to Reliant or Green Mountain, so that you can enjoy the benefits at the office as well as at home.
Now reverting back from that brief commercial to my presentation and from the Northeast to Texas, I want to point out that the robust supply-demand fundamentals in Texas indicate a bright future for the biggest part of our operation and a future that will be realized sooner rather than later. The 60-gigawatt record loads that ERCOT is setting everyday this week indicates a peak reserve margin for ERCOT in the 10% range rather than in the 17% range officially predicted by ERCOT just 3 months ago. Of course, this record performance was significantly influenced by the heat. But in case people haven't been paying attention, it's getting significantly hotter almost everywhere every year. And that trend, if anything, seems destined to accelerate. One of my Texas colleagues who was in the room today reminded me that in College Station, Texas, it was 99 degrees yesterday. Maybe that doesn't seem so remarkable, but it was 99 degrees at 11:00 at night. 
So I think everyone should consider that what we currently or what we like to think of as being abnormally hot is actually probably the new summer normal. 
Finally, we continue to invest in the revitalization of our conventional fleet, led by several recoveries at geographically favorable locations in or near load pockets, employing new fast-start combined cycle technology that achieves high efficiency while being able to respond to the system's increasing need for capacity resources, that can respond quickly to great fluctuations caused by a high percentage of intermittent renewable plants. 
In particular, I'm speaking about El Segundo in Los Angeles, which is in construction. But we also have high expectations for Encina in San Diego County and for Astoria in New York City. What this all adds up to is a company that is able to deliver a high teen free cash flow yield before growth investment, and even nearly a double-digit free cash flow yield even after taking account our several hundred million dollars of current year investment in attractive growth projects.
Turning to Slide 5 and continuing to focus on capital allocation. As those of you who have followed us for several years understand we have always pursued a very balanced capital allocation program. Over the life of the new NRG, we have deployed about $9 billion of the company's capital relatively evenly across 4 buckets of capital allocation that are depicted on the pie chart on this page. 
Notwithstanding that the greater part of the attention to our capital allocation program has been on share buybacks, the single largest deployment over that period has been the debt repayment with $3.1 billion of debt paydown. The first half of 2011 was no different in this regard, with the company having paid down almost $600 million of debt in the first half of the year alone. This is consistent with our commitment to prudent balance sheet management, which has been an unwavering aspect of our management approach at NRG over the past 8 years and will continue to be so into the indefinite future. 
But now, we have the additional $250 million of share buybacks announced today, which serves as a precursor for the additional capital allocation actions we hope to take after we clear away the 2,017 bonds in the first quarter of 2012.
The good news is that even after this additional buyback in 2011, even after our substantial debt repayment, even after we invest a very substantial amount of equity capital on solar projects and conventional combined cycle projects, and even after we spend our typical net $200 million to $300 million a year on major maintenance and environmental CapEx in our assets, we expect to end 2011 with several hundred million dollars of cash on our balance sheet in excess of what we feel we need to run our business. As a result, we will be well positioned to set up 2012 as another year of significant return of capital to shareholders.
Now finally before turning over to Mauricio, let me say a few words about our thriving solar effort. Our first year utility-scale solar projects identified on Slide 6 are all progressing either on schedule or ahead of schedule through the final development and financing phase and in many cases into construction. Tom Doyle would be pleased to answer any questions you might have about any of these projects. 
A point that I want to re-emphasize about the solar project is the relative lack of risk. In the 20 years that I have been in this business developing, financing and building power plants, never have I been associated with utility-scale projects that feature such a relative absence of risk. When we assess these large-scale solar projects from the point of view of political risk, technological risk, environmental risk, commercial risk, by which I mean off-take risk, and most of all, completion risk, the risk profile is nowhere on the chart even compared to a standard gas-fired combined cycle power plant. So we like this business a lot and think it's an appropriate place to invest our shareholders' capital. 
But as we have said previously, we expect the solar business to migrate over the next few years towards more distributed applications. And a couple weeks back, I was privileged to be with Governor Jerry Brown of California when he spoke of his firm intent to bring 12,000 megawatts of distributed generation to California. We expect to distribute solar increasingly to benefit from supportive public policy at the state and local levels. Because distributed solar means jobs and not just any type of jobs, it means local jobs for contractors and other small-business employers. This is why in my opinion, you no longer hear much talk about a high-voltage transmission system spanning the country. Public policymakers want to keep it local. And since we always have thought and said that the idea of a high-voltage national transmission system was nonsensical, we fully support this ""keep it local"" approach. We have taken several steps over the past several months to put ourselves in a position to be a leader in capitalizing on this trend to distribute solar. We will come back next quarter and talk more about what we have done in this area. But I will just mention again this one program, the multistate warehouse rooftop program alliance that we have with Prologis, with financial support from Bank of America and the Department of Energy, is a hugely important and strategic initiative that will enable us to scale up and reduce costs in this critical segment of the distributed market. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

And we delivered another strong operating performance during the second quarter in both our generation and retail segments. Some of the highlights are listed on Slide 8. Starting with safety, we maintained our top decile performance with an OSHA recordable rate of 0.78 for the first half of the year. This is our #1 focus across the operations group, and we will continue to strive towards a zero injury workplace.
Our plant performance metrics saw significant improvements on availability and starting reliability compared to the second quarter of 2010. Even though we successfully concluded our spring outage season, we're in a very solid operational position during these critical summer months. 
On the commercial front, we added significant hedges for 2012 while effectively managing the retail supply requirements during the warmest year on record in Texas. On the environmental front, the EPA released the final Cross State Air Pollution Rule in July. As you all know, the main change was the inclusion of Texas in the rule. And while there will be some incremental operating expenses, we are reaffirming today our environmental capital plan of approximately $720 million.
Finally, we continue to make good progress in our repowering and solar projects. In June, we reached commercial operations on our 200-megawatt Middletown repowering project in Connecticut, and started the commissioning sequence for a Road Runner solar project in New Mexico. All other projects in Indian River, El Segundo and Ivanpah continue to be on schedule. 
Now turning to Slide 9 for a more detailed review of our operating performance. Net generation was higher by 2.5 terawatt hours during the second quarter compared to 2010, driven primarily by generation in Texas due to a record weather in June and the addition of Cottonwood in our South Central portfolio. Our baseload plants continued their strong operating performance and posted an equivalent availability factor, or EAF, of 91% for the second quarter. 
Indian River led the fleet with 97% availability, followed by Parish and Big Cajun, both with over 94% availability. In the beginning of the year, we have seen a significant increase in the number of starts on our gas and oil fleet. During the second quarter, our peaking units responded with an impressive 99% starting reliability, ensuring we didn't miss any opportunity during the high-priced hours. 
Moving on to our retail operations on Slide 10. We delivered yet another quarter of strong financial results. Texas experienced record temperatures for the month of June. And with our hedging strategy and relatively stable market prices, we achieved significant earnings. We also continued to grow net mass customer count, making that 2 consecutive quarters of growth with 17,000 additional customers in the end of 2010. We feel even stronger about delivering net 0 customer losses by the end of the year.
Reliant also delivered lower bad debt expenses on our mass segment. Its strong performance has enabled NRG's retail business to be the largest in Texas while also delivering the stronger customer satisfaction levels. On the residential segment, we launched our expansion into the Northeast and are now serving customers in 3 states. While we have grown the number of e-Sense customers with smart meter services from 220,000 at the end of the first quarter to 350,000 today. 
Our C&I expansion into the Northeast continues as well, with sales teams currently operating at 6 states. This segment has experienced increased competition and compressed margins, and we're being selective on transactions where margins justify the risk of serving that load.
Moving on to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivity on Slide 11. We increased our baseload hedges from 60% to 75% in 2012 where gas fundamentals remained weak. In addition, we saw an opportunity to increase our coal hedges for 2012 ahead of the EPA rule, and our commercial operations did a great job executing in the market and hedging 100% of our requirements. 
Beyond 2012, we continue to remain open on our baseload and peaking portfolios. We see limited downside risk on the gas market from current levels. That coupled with our view that our recovery is already underway in our core ERCOT market, driven by robust demand, lack of supply and stringent environmental rules, we anticipate ample opportunities to layer additional power hedges in the near future.
Expanding a bit further on these market dynamics on Slide 12. You can see that Texas continues to show strong signs of growth and economic recovery. During the second quarter, demand grew by a healthy 2.5% on a weather-normalized basis. And given the extreme weather conditions over the past few weeks, we're spending back-to-back new peak load record of over 68 gigawatts, almost a 4% increase from the record just set last summer.
On the upper right-hand corner, we have provided a new reserve margin forecast from ERCOT released in May, which shows reserve margins falling below the target of 13.75% by 2014. Two points I want to make on this forecast. On the load growth assumptions, we believe they are too optimistic in the near term and aggressive on the later years. And two, on the supply side, we remain skeptical about new generation, given the forward spark spread still don't support new build economics. What this means for -- from our point of view is that we may see reserve margins fall sooner than 2014, possibly 1 or 2 years sooner. 
On the environmental front, the more stringent air pollution rule may accelerate some retirements in the Northeast and interconnect in Texas. The market has already started to play some of this impact as you can see on the lower right chart. It is difficult to assess at this point the ultimate impact, as it will depend on the price of allowances and changes on the generations effect, which will have significant seasonal differences. But we believe the remaining baseload coal generators, like NRG, will benefit from increased gas on the margin. 
Finally, we have been talking about gaining clarity on EPA requirements in 2012 for the transport rule, now the air pollution rule. It differed from the proposal in a number of respects. Amongst the most noteworthy for NRG were the tightening of allocations, inclusion of Texas in the Group 2 SO2 and NOx programs, limitation of Louisiana to only the Ozone season NOx program, removal of Connecticut and Delaware from the list of states and the loss of trading flexibility in the early years. 
As I review on prior calls, our investment in existing control technologies and use of PRB coal plays a large part in our ability to manage the final air pollution rule. We anticipate from our early analysis of this rule that NRG can comply through an integrated strategy, increased cover efficiency by about 10% to 15%, fuel switching to lower sulfur PRB coal and additional blending at our Limestone facility, seasonal dispatch and allowance purchases. We believe that incremental compliance costs are not material and can largely be offset the by impact in electricity prices as we saw in the previous slide. 
Overall, given what I have reviewed between our current operational and commercial competitive advantages and the signs of improving fundamental drivers in our core market, we expect NRG's base business portfolio to realize enhanced returns over the next few years. With that, I will turn it over to Chris Schade for the financial review."

Durin",1336,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15, we are very pleased with our results for both the quarter and year-to-date 2011 having announced adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and $972 million, respectively. During the second quarter, Reliant Energy continued to perform well, contributing $176 million of adjusted EBITDA as the business benefited from the warmest June on record leading to a 9% increase in mass volumes. NRG's wholesale generation business reported $341 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter. Texas wholesale generation contributed $215 million of adjusted EBITDA as the fleet average capacity factor improved 3%, allowing the region to benefit from the favorable weather. However, despite the improvement in operational performance, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decreased to $128 million, largely as a result of lower quarter-on-quarter NRG and hedge prices realized in 2010.
In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $47 million, approximately $50 million decline versus the second quarter of 2010. And it was driven by lower hedge prices and a substantial decrease in capacity revenues, all offset by lower operating costs.
The West and South Central regions delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of $20 million from the prior year's period. These regions continued to benefit from strong merchant activity, particularly in the South Central with the addition of Cottonwood.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2011 was $972 million, with Reliant contributing $327 million and our wholesale business adding $645 million. Reliant's business has performed extremely well by continuing to grow its mass customer base and the $13 million improvement in the C&I business year-on-year, due in part to an improvement in unit margins. 
The NRG wholesale business has also performed well and benefited from an 8% year-on-year increase in generations sold or 3.7 terawatt hours, and a 3% improvement in baseload operational performance. The results were offset again by lower energy prices, higher fuel and transport costs and lower capacity revenues.
Following the completion of a federal tax audit during the quarter, net income increased by over $600 million due to the reversal of tax liabilities, resulting from a confirmation of the company's net operating loss positions. For those of you that are new to NRG, net income is the determinant of the size of the restricted payment capacity calculation under our most restricted instruments, which are the 2,017 bonds. As a result of this $600 million accounting reversal, our RP basket expanded by an additional $300 million during the quarter. Due to the expanded RP basket and taking into account the significant undervaluation that persists in the company's share price performance today, we are able to increase our share purchase program by $250 million, bringing the total 2011 share repurchase program to $430 million. To date, we have completed $130 million of the share repurchases, leaving $300 million of additional share repurchases, which we intend to complete before year end 2011.
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 16. As David mentioned, we are raising the adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1.9 billion to $2 billion. This increase is largely driven by the strong performance of the Reliant Energy retail business, as it has benefited this year from favorable weather conditions and improved customer retention. We now expect Reliant to contribute between $610 million to $660 million of EBITDA, compared to our original expectations of a range between $480 million to $570 million. Meanwhile, the wholesale business has performed as expected. And as such, we are narrowing our original guidance range to $1.22 billion to $1.26 billion. 
Turning to free cash flow. We currently expect free cash flow before growth to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting strong cash flow, offset by the impact of collateral movements and the first lien refinancing.
Now turning to Slide 17. Total liquidity remains strong for the first half of the year at $3.3 billion. Total cash at the end of Q2 was $2.1 billion, which was a decrease of about $900 million from the year end 2010. The decrease in cash was largely explained by debt repayments of about $560 million, maintenance of environmental CapEx net of financing of about $115 million, investments on solar and repairing projects net of financing of about $310 million, $103 million of share repurchases, all offset by about $300 million of cash from operations.
Based on our current forecast and changes to the Capital Allocation Plan, we now expect to end 2011 with almost $2.1 billion of cash, even including the impact of the expanded share repurchase program announced today.
Although not illustrated on this slide, I would like to quickly provide an update of our ongoing efforts to sell down equity in our solar development projects. We continue to target a 49% sell-down of 880 megawatts of utility projects that will accomplish 3 goals: one, efficiently manage the solar tax attributes; two, attract new investors to solar development; and three, free up capital to be redeployed in our prolific solar pipeline.
The progress of this initiative has admittedly been slower than expected, mostly a result of the pace of moving agreements through the Department of Energy for the larger projects. With that said, we remain confident that we'll reach a financial close with a net effect of increasing liquidity this year. Our share buyback plans are not dependent on the timing of this sell-down. 
On Slide 18, I would like to provide an update to the simplification of the capital structure, encompassing both our first lien facilities as well as the senior notes that we announced during the Q1 earnings call. We successfully completed Stage 1 by replacing our existing $1 billion revolver and $1.3 billion letter of credit facility, with a single $2.3 billion revolving credit facility due in 2016. 
Additionally, we issued a new single $1.6 billion Term Loan B Facility that matures in 2018 to replace 2 existing Term Loan B tranches with maturities in 2013, '15. This refinancing eliminate investment basket restrictions and cash flow sweep requirements, while aligning the covenant structure in our first lien with our newer fund indentures.
Stage 2, the refinancing of the $3.5 billion of senior notes is progressing as indicated. In May, we completed the redemption of $2.4 billion 2016 senior notes with the issuance of senior notes with a simplified indenture package maturing in 2019 and 2021. Over the coming months, we will look to complete the final stage of the simplification with the refinancing of the 2017 senior notes.
As I mentioned on the Q1 earnings call, the long-term benefits to NRG and the stakeholders through successful execution of this debt restructuring strategy are numerous. First, there is an immediate improvement in the debt maturity profile with the nearest maturity by the first lien debt or bonds no earlier than 2016. Second, a common covenant package will be aligned across the NRG capital structure, permitting greater flexibility and the creation of a long range approach to capital allocation, both for a more efficient approach to reinvestment in our business and/or to return to shareholders.
And finally, as it was announced earlier this morning, I will be leaving NRG in early September to pursue an exciting and unique new opportunity in the healthcare industry. This decision is in no way a reflection of the current health of the company or a judgment about its future prospects. On the contrary, I am quite proud to have had the opportunity to work alongside an incredibly talented and gifted team to strengthen the company's financial position and improve NRG's ability to provide greater returns to shareholders. I'm also grateful to have had been able to help execute David Crane's strategy of transitioning NRG to a 21st century power provider, particularly as it relates to building one of the country's largest solar power companies. As a current and future shareholder, I look forward to following NRG's transformative progress. Now I'll turn it over to David for closing remarks."

And before I give those closing remarks, I just want to mention about Chris' departure, which obviously we announced in the second press release this morning. I'm very sorry to see Chris go, as I think he did much during his comparatively short time with the company to streamline some of our critical processes and simplify our balance sheet, so that we would be in a better position to optimize the allocation of the company's capital.
So on behalf of myself and everyone at NRG, I wish him well in his new endeavor. With respect to a new CFO, we have just commenced consideration of potential successors for Chris. And while it is early days yet, I want you to know that I have every expectation that we will be able to consider our alternatives and fill the position in a much shorter period of time than last time around. 
The second and final thing I would tell you at this early stage in our CFO's search is that we have a very, very capable finance and accounting teams with deeply experienced management. And they will continue to pursue the company's various financing and capital allocation initiatives no matter how short or how long the CFO into a pregnant period turns out to be. 
So now turning to the concluding slide on Page 20.
Sometimes the NRG story, by which I mean our investment proposition, can seem rather complicated. But I think at this juncture and at this share price, it boils down to 3 things that you may wish to consider as drivers for further investment in NRG: first, our unique wholesale asset retail business mix that has its core strength in Texas, the best and strongest growing regional market in the United States with the reserve margin that has proven itself in the past few days to be surprisingly tight; second, our robustly growing green energy portfolio of projects and businesses, led by our industry-leading multifaceted solar program; and third, our willingness in our significant ability to return excess capital through our capital allocation program in a manner that creates value for our shareholders. This is a business model, which we have been pursuing relentlessly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. And with that, Kiara, we will be happy to take questions from people on the phone."

I think, it's really early to say whether it'll be 100% successful. But I would say from our perspective, even 50% successful or 75% successful would be a great win, and that would mean that the investment for us would be over 4 years in the $500 million to $700 million range. So translating that to EBITDA, it might be a little bit early for us to do that, but I think that, that's something we try and flesh out on our next call. Tom, do you want to add to that?"

That was something that we put in place about 5 years ago because looking forward with the RP basket is part of our life. We sort of saw that we'd have that ability to do that. I think what you'll see in the first quarter next year is that the way we're going to look at it is that, we want to rightsize our balance sheet from the point of view of how much liquidity we've maintained and go back to the way most people do buybacks, which is not something they do the same number every year. But if they have excess cash, they do it, and if they don't have excess cash, they don't do it.

And I think you can see the limits of my predictive capacity because I had anticipated in early 2010 that 2011 would be a good time to be in the market buying power plants. But nothing could be further from the truth. I'll tell you what we've seen in the last several months is that -- and this is speaking, Ameet, about gas-fired power plants is that, that there are a lot of people chasing the gas plants in the market, and they're willing to pay prices that we can't justify. And the price that we're thinking things are worth and the price that people are paying for plans is not shrinking, it's getting larger. The other thing we're seeing in the market for gas-fired power plants is it's not just strategic buyers in the market anymore, it's financial buyers. And it seems that people are anticipating a turn in the commodity cycle, and private enterprises that don't have to worry at all about near-term accretion dilution or a mass in power plants on the idea that the forward price curve is about to turn in a positive direction. So I would say of all the things that you might see us investing money in, the least likely thing you'll see as investing money in is in buying gas-fired combined cycle power plants. Another question that comes up is what about coal plants now that we have a little bit greater clarity because EPA rules are our there? I think it's really too early to tell on that because first of all, I'm not sure, no one's sure exactly how the EPA rules are going to kick in, and whether they're going to be applied on time I think so. I think the jury's still out on whether there is to be value obtained in buying coal plants. And I would mention we continue to seek, we would like to have a larger conventional power plant business in the Northeast United States, particularly in PJM, so it continues to be an aspiration of this company. But I'm not -- I'm just telling you, I'm confident that we can do that at value. And so, that's not as likely a use of cash resources. So apart from that on the M&A front, there are things that we see in the alternative energy space around the retail business that would fill out what we're trying to do in terms of our intrinsic growth. But those types of things are a much smaller to other number of things and would not impact in any way what we're confident in contemplating in terms of capital allocation over the next several months. Ameet, how was that for a long winded answer, did that answer -- somewhere in there, was there an answer to your question?"

And so we start by setting that aside. The second thing I think that you will -- you can count on us doing is that we will look at the equity capital when we get to the first quarter next year. We'll look at the equity capital that we expect to invest in the solar projects and the conventional projects that are well underway. One of the things about -- another one of the things that I like about solar development is that the heat rate on solar development seems to be significantly higher than the heat rate on conventional power generation. And so if it looks like we have projects in the pipeline that are going to require equity capital in the foreseeable period of time, for example, calendar year 2012, we will take that into account. And then we look at having deducted those 2 things and obviously, the main is environmental CapEx, and the other thing is that we do every year, then that's the number. And right now, we projected that number will be in the several hundred million dollar range. And so I know and I didn't avoid the previous question in terms of ranking this very excess use of capital. And to some degree, I don't think that we have to rank this use of the capital because we have so much capital that if we have very strong investments, I think we can do more than one thing. But I think we will look where we stand at that time in the Spring of 2012. And this is important, and then we will consult with our Board of Directors because they will have a very strong point of view on this. And then, we will look at the options in terms of return of capital to all the stakeholders, the shareholders certainly but even whether there should be more debt repayment."

But what we may be facing over the next 3 years is that if ERCOT, which does not have a lot of generations supply coming through the construction pipeline, gets very tight on generation side, Jason's wholesale costs may arise in compressed retail margins in that regard. And so, will Jason be able to do $600 million or $700 million a year every year going forward, not in that sort of rising wholesale pricing environment. But of course, the good thing for an NRG shareholder is what Jason sees in terms of compression is what our generation side will see is greater margin.

Void by Reliant's continued exceptional performance, we not only posted a very healthy $517 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, we also are in a position to narrow the range and revise upward our full year 2011 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.9 billion to $2 billion. What is particularly positive about this result is that while we certainly have benefited from a very warm summer today, we also benefited substantially from the immense progress Reliant has made in slowing and ultimately reversing the long-term decline in its customer account. And Reliant has achieved this positive reversal, not by eroding margins excessively but rather through its best-in-class customer care, its effective use of multiple sales channels and its expanded product offering.
Reliant's exceptional financial and operating performance was replicated during the quarter by Green Mountain which performed well, and also across our wholesale generation fleet where we realized a baseload fleet availability around the critical 90% mark and achieved a very high level of reliability in peaker startups, which is obviously a very important operating metric, particularly during the hot and high-priced summer peak hours. 
As it has been for the past 7.5 years, the strong operating performance achieved by our plant operations group, together with the forward hedging program implemented by our commercial operations team, achieved a substantially cash generative result, which in turn feeds our very strong liquidity and our strategic capital allocation efforts.
This quarter and year-to-date, our financial team has gone from success to success in the steps it has taken to simplify our capital structure and to enable us to allocate our shareholders' capital with maximum efficiency. Now only our 2017 bonds remain in our way, and they become redeemable in just 5 months' time. But NRG's commitment to efficient capital allocation stands still for no man, nor will it will be frustrated by the obstacles placed in its path by any individual bond issue. So I'm very pleased today to announce an additional $250 million share buyback program, which together with the $50 million of shares which remain to be repurchased under our previously announced 2011 program, means that we have $300 million of NRG shares to be purchased before the end of 2011. 
This supplemental buyback program, which we intend to implement over the balance of 2011, is made possible by the accounting impact of our recently concluded IRS audit on our -- and the impact of that on our existing RP basket. Chris well explain that in greater detail.
When fully implemented, we will have completed $430 million of share repurchases in 2011. But I would prefer for you to think of this new $250 million share buyback program as a down payment on what may be to come in the first quarter of 2012. 
Finally, our cash position is so strong that while we have committed substantial capital on 2011, both to buying back shares and paying down debt, we continue to be able to invest substantial capital in growing the company's portfolio in various low-risk value-enhancing ways. 
Most notably, our solar efforts achieved very significant successes during the quarter. Our big 3 solar progress -- projects progressed well and are on track, notwithstanding a temporary hiccup caused by a desert tortoise issue at one of the 3 projects. And in the most exciting development in the quarter, we achieved a major step forward towards competitive advantage in large-scale rooftop solar when our project and partnership with Prologis received conditional approval for a $1.4 billion DOE loan guarantee. 
We consider large-scale rooftop solar to be a critical and highly attractive area within the distributed generation space, and one that is going to attract an increasing amount of favorable public policy support in the years to come.
So before I go into a little bit more detail on all of this, I ask you, the shareholders and prospective shareholders of NRG to consider this. If this is what NRG can accomplish 36 months into a deep commodity down cycle, imagine what we can achieve as we come out of that down cycle, and as our core commodities trend upwards towards mid-cycle levels. The potential is enormous. So let me just amplify a few of my points starting on Slide 4.
From an earnings call perspective, this is the second anniversary of our purchase of Reliant. Those who were skeptical on this call 2 years ago that Reliant could sustain strong financial results quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year have to accept that Reliant's business model, as supported by NRG's wholesale fleet and commercial operations team, is a very strong and valuable business and is now an intrinsic part of our business model, a part that makes us absolutely unique amongst our immediate peer group. As part of our new guidance, we expect Reliant to contribute over $600 million of EBITDA in calendar year 2011. 
And as I said previously, it is no longer a business that is contracting in size over time. Not only are we seeing the day when Reliant is able to grow its customer count, but we see greater value creation opportunities for Reliant presenting themselves in expanded product offerings and in geographic expansion. 
Indeed, like many retailers, we see this as a particularly ripe opportunity for retail expansion in the Northeast United States. And both Reliant and Green Mountain are having positive early success in their efforts in that market. And in fact, since I have a large group of people listening on the phone and many of you are located in the Northeast United States, I invite you to visit reliant.com or greenmountain.com. With a minimal of fuss, you can enjoy the financial and customer care benefits of Reliant or Green Mountain, as I do at my home in New Jersey. And while I'm in sales mode, Reliant and Green Mountain obviously serve businesses as well as individuals. So feel free to call your employer to switch to Reliant or Green Mountain, so that you can enjoy the benefits at the office as well as at home.
Now reverting back from that brief commercial to my presentation and from the Northeast to Texas, I want to point out that the robust supply-demand fundamentals in Texas indicate a bright future for the biggest part of our operation and a future that will be realized sooner rather than later. The 60-gigawatt record loads that ERCOT is setting every day this week indicates a peak reserve margin for ERCOT in the 10% range rather than in the 17% range officially predicted by ERCOT just 3 months ago. Of course, this record performance was significantly influenced by the heat. But in case people haven't been paying attention, it's getting significantly hotter almost everywhere every year. And that trend, if anything, seems destined to accelerate. One of my Texas colleagues who was in the room today reminded me that in College Station, Texas, it was 99 degrees yesterday. Maybe that doesn't seem so remarkable, but it was 99 degrees at 11:00 at night. 
So I think everyone should consider that what we currently or what we like to think of as being abnormally hot is actually probably the new summer normal. 
Finally, we continue to invest in the revitalization of our conventional fleet, led by several recoveries [ph] at geographically favorable locations in or near load pockets, employing new fast-start combined cycle technology that achieves high efficiency while being able to respond to the system's increasing need for capacity resources, that can respond quickly to grid fluctuations caused by a high percentage of intermittent renewable plants. 
In particular, I'm speaking about El Segundo in Los Angeles, which is in construction. But we also have high expectations for Encina in San Diego County and for Astoria in New York City. What this all adds up to is a company that is able to deliver a high teen free cash flow yield before growth investment, and even nearly a double-digit free cash flow yield even after taking account our several hundred million dollars of current year investment in attractive growth projects.
Turning to Slide 5 and continuing to focus on capital allocation. As those of you who have followed us for several years understand we have always pursued a very balanced capital allocation program. Over the life of the new NRG, we have deployed about $9 billion of the company's capital relatively evenly across 4 buckets of capital allocation that are depicted on the pie chart on this page. 
Notwithstanding that the greater part of the attention to our capital allocation program has been on share buybacks, the single largest deployment over that period has been to debt repayment with $3.1 billion of debt paid down. The first half of 2011 was no different in this regard, with the company having paid down almost $600 million of debt in the first half of the year alone. This is consistent with our commitment to prudent balance sheet management, which has been an unwavering aspect of our management approach at NRG over the past 8 years and will continue to be so into the indefinite future. 
But now, we have the additional $250 million of share buybacks announced today, which serves as a precursor for the additional capital allocation actions we hope to take after we clear away the 2017 bonds in the first quarter of 2012.
The good news is that even after this additional buyback in 2011, even after our substantial debt repayment, even after we invest a very substantial amount of equity capital on solar projects and conventional combined cycle projects, and even after we spend our typical net $200 million to $300 million a year on major maintenance and environmental CapEx in our assets, we expect to end 2011 with several hundred million dollars of cash on our balance sheet in excess of what we feel we need to run our business. As a result, we will be well positioned to set up 2012 as another year of significant return of capital to shareholders.
Now finally before turning over to Mauricio, let me say a few words about our thriving solar effort. Our first tier utility-scale solar projects identified on Slide 6 are all progressing either on schedule or ahead of schedule through the final development and financing phase and in many cases into construction. Tom Doyle would be pleased to answer any questions you might have about any of these projects. 
A point that I want to re-emphasize about these solar project is the relative lack of risk. In the 20 years that I have been in this business developing, financing and building power plants, never have I been associated with utility-scale projects that feature such a relative absence of risk. When we assess these large-scale solar projects from the point of view of political risk, technological risk, environmental risk, commercial risk, by which I mean off-take risk, and most of all, completion risk, the risk profile is nowhere on the chart even compared to a standard gas-fired combined cycle power plant. So we like this business a lot and think it's an appropriate place to invest our shareholders' capital. 
But as we have said previously, we expect the solar business to migrate over the next few years towards more distributed applications. And a couple weeks back, I was privileged to be with Governor Jerry Brown of California when he spoke of his firm intent to bring 12,000 megawatts of distributed generation to California. We expect to distribute solar increasingly to benefit from supportive public policy at the state and local levels. Because distributed solar means jobs and not just any type of jobs, it means local jobs for contractors and other small-business employers. This is why in my opinion, you no longer hear much talk about a high-voltage transmission system spanning the country. Public policymakers want to keep it local. And since we always have thought and said that the idea of a high-voltage national transmission system was nonsensical, we fully support this ""keep it local"" approach. We have taken several steps over the past several months to put ourselves in a position to be a leader in capitalizing on this trend to distribute solar. We will come back next quarter and talk more about what we have done in this area. But I will just mention again this one program, the multistate warehouse rooftop program alliance that we have with Prologis, with financial support from Bank of America and the Department of Energy, is a hugely important and strategic initiative that will enable us to scale up and reduce costs in this critical segment of the distributed market. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

NRG delivered another strong operating performance during the second quarter in both our generation and retail segments. Some of the highlights are listed on Slide 8. Starting with safety, we maintained our to",1233,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. NRG delivered another strong operating performance during the second quarter in both our generation and retail segments. Some of the highlights are listed on Slide 8. Starting with safety, we maintained our top [indiscernible] performance with an OSHA recordable rate of 0.78 for the first half of the year. This is our #1 focus across the operations group, and we will continue to strive towards a zero injury workplace.
Our plant performance metrics saw significant improvements on availability and starting reliability compared to the second quarter of 2010. Even though we successfully concluded our spring outage season, we're in a very solid operational position during these critical summer months. 
On the commercial front, we added significant hedges for 2012 while effectively managing the retail supply requirements during the warmest year on record in Texas. On the environmental front, the EPA released the final Cross State Air Pollution Rule in July. As you all know, the main change was the inclusion of Texas in the rule. And while there will be some incremental operating expenses, we are reaffirming today our environmental capital plan of approximately $720 million.
Finally, we continue to make good progress in our repowering and solar projects. In June, we reached commercial operations on our 200-megawatt Middletown repowering project in Connecticut, and started the commissioning sequence for Road Runner solar project in New Mexico. All other projects in Indian River, El Segundo and Ivanpah continue to be on schedule. 
Now turning to Slide 9 for a more detailed review of our operating performance. Net generation was higher by 2.5 terawatt hours during the second quarter compared to 2010, driven primarily by generation in Texas due to record weather in June and the addition of Cottonwood in our South Central portfolio. Our baseload plants continued their strong operating performance and posted an equivalent availability factor, or EAF, of 91% for the second quarter. 
Indian River led the fleet with 97% availability, followed by Parish and Big Cajun, both with over 94% availability. In the beginning of the year, we have seen a significant increase in the number of starts on our gas and oil fleet. During the second quarter, our peaking units responded with an impressive 99% starting reliability, ensuring we didn't miss any opportunity during the high-priced hours. 
Moving on to our retail operations on Slide 10. We delivered yet another quarter of strong financial results. Texas experienced record temperatures for the month of June. And with our hedging strategy and relatively stable market prices, we achieved significant earnings [indiscernible]. We also continued to grow net mass customer count, making that 2 consecutive quarters of growth with 17,000 additional customers in the end of 2010. We feel even stronger about delivering net 0 customer losses by the end of the year.
Reliant also delivered lower bad debt expenses on our mass segment. Its strong performance has enabled NRG's retail business to be the largest in Texas while also delivering the stronger customer satisfaction levels. On the residential segment, we launched our expansion into the Northeast and are now serving customers in 3 states. We have grown the number of e-Sense customers with smart meter services from 220,000 at the end of the first quarter to 350,000 today. 
Our C&I expansion into the Northeast continues as well, with sales teams currently operating in 6 states. This segment has experienced increased competition and compressed margins, and we're being selective on transactions where margins justify the risk of serving that load.
Moving on to our hedge profile and commodity sensitivity on Slide 11. We increased our baseload hedges from 60% to 75% in 2012 where gas fundamentals remained weak. In addition, we saw an opportunity to increase our coal hedges for 2012 ahead of the EPA rule, and our commercial operations group did a great job executing in the market and hedging 100% of our requirements. 
Beyond 2012, we continue to remain open on our baseload and peaking portfolios. We see limited downside risk on the gas market from current levels. That coupled with our view that our recovery is already underway in our core ERCOT market, driven by robust demand, lack of supply and stringent environmental rules, we anticipate ample opportunities to layer additional power hedges in the near future.
Expanding a bit further on these market dynamics on Slide 12. You can see that Texas continues to show strong signs of growth and economic recovery. During the second quarter, demand grew by a healthy 2.5% on a weather-normalized basis. And given the extreme weather conditions over the past few weeks, we're setting back-to-back new peak load record of over 68 gigawatts, almost a 4% increase from the record just set last summer.
On the upper right-hand corner, we have provided a new reserve margin forecast from ERCOT released in May, which shows reserve margins falling below the target of 13.75% by 2014. Two points I want to make on this forecast. On the load growth assumptions, we believe they are too optimistic in the near term and aggressive on the later years. And two, on the supply side, we remain skeptical about new generation, given the forward spark spread still don't support new build economics. What this means for -- from our point of view is that we may see reserve margins fall sooner than 2014, possibly 1 or 2 years sooner. 
On the environmental front, the more stringent air pollution rule may accelerate some retirements in the Northeast interconnect and [ph] Texas. The market has already started to price some of this impact as you can see on the lower right chart. It is difficult to assess at this point the ultimate impact, since it will depend on the price of allowances and changes on the generations effect [ph], which will have significant seasonal differences. But we believe the remaining baseload coal generators, like NRG, will benefit from increased gas on the margin. 
Finally, we have been talking about gaining clarity on EPA requirements in 2012 for the transport rule, now the air pollution rule. It differed from the proposal in a number of respects. Amongst the most noteworthy for NRG were the tightening of allocations, inclusion of Texas in the Group 2 SO2 and NOx programs, limitation of Louisiana to only the Ozone season NOx program, removal of Connecticut and Delaware from the list of states and the loss of trading flexibility in the early years. 
As I have reviewed on prior calls, our investment in existing control technologies and use of PRB coal plays a large part in our ability to manage the final air pollution rule. We anticipate from our early analysis of this rule that NRG can comply through an integrated strategy, increased cover efficiency by about 10% to 15%, fuel switching to lower sulfur PRB coal and additional blending at our Limestone facility, seasonal dispatch and allowance purchases. We believe that incremental compliance costs are not material and can largely be offset by the impact in electricity prices as we saw in the previous slide. 
Overall, given what I have reviewed between our current operational and commercial competitive advantages and the signs of improving fundamental drivers in our core market, we expect NRG's base business portfolio to realize enhanced returns over the next few years. With that, I will turn it over to Chris Schade for the financial review."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15, we are very pleased with our results for both the quarter and year-to-date 2011 having announced adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and $972 million, respectively. Durin",1336,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15, we are very pleased with our results for both the quarter and year-to-date 2011 having announced adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and $972 million, respectively. During the second quarter, Reliant Energy continued to perform well, contributing $176 million of adjusted EBITDA as the business benefited from the warmest June on record leading to a 9% increase in mass volumes. NRG's wholesale generation business reported $341 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter. Texas wholesale generation contributed $215 million of adjusted EBITDA as the fleet's average capacity factor improved 3%, allowing the region to benefit from the favorable weather. However, despite the improvement in operational performance, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decreased $128 million, largely as a result of lower quarter-on-quarter energy and hedge prices realized in 2010.
In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $47 million, approximately $50 million decline versus the second quarter of 2010. And it was driven by lower hedge prices and a substantial decrease in capacity revenues, all offset by lower operating costs.
The West and South Central regions delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of $20 million from the prior year's period. These regions continued to benefit from strong merchant activity, particularly in the South Central with the addition of Cottonwood.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2011 was $972 million, with Reliant contributing $327 million and our wholesale business adding $645 million. Reliant's business has performed extremely well by continuing to grow its mass customer base and the $13 million improvement in the C&I business year-on-year, due in part to an improvement in unit margins. 
The NRG wholesale business has also performed well and benefited from an 8% year-on-year increase in generations sold or 3.7 terawatt hours, and a 3% improvement in baseload operational performance. The results were offset again by lower energy prices, higher fuel and transport costs and lower capacity revenues.
Following the completion of a federal tax audit during the quarter, net income increased by over $600 million due to the reversal of tax liabilities, resulting from a confirmation of the company's net operating loss positions. For those of you that are new to NRG, net income is the determinant of the size of the restricted payment capacity calculation under our most restricted instruments, which are the 2017 bonds. As a result of this $600 million accounting reversal, our RP basket expanded by an additional $300 million during the quarter. Due to the expanded RP basket and taking into account the significant undervaluation that persists in the company's share price performance today, we are able to increase our share purchase program by $250 million, bringing the total 2011 share repurchase program to $430 million. To date, we have completed $130 million of the share repurchases, leaving $300 million of additional share repurchases, which we intend to complete before year end 2011.
Now turning to 2011 guidance on Slide 16. As David mentioned, we are raising the adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1.9 billion to $2 billion. This increase is largely driven by the strong performance of the Reliant Energy retail business, as it has benefited this year from favorable weather conditions and improved customer retention. We now expect Reliant to contribute between $610 million to $660 million of EBITDA compared to our original expectations of a range between $480 million to $570 million. Meanwhile, the wholesale business has performed as expected. And as such, we are narrowing our original guidance range to $1.22 billion to $1.26 billion. 
Turning to free cash flow. We currently expect free cash flow before growth to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting strong cash flow, offset by the impact of collateral movements and the first lien refinancing.
Now turning to Slide 17. Total liquidity remains strong for the first half of the year at $3.3 billion. Total cash at the end of Q2 was $2.1 billion, which was a decrease of about $900 million from the year end 2010. The decrease in cash was largely explained by debt repayments of about $560 million, maintenance of environmental CapEx net of financing of about $115 million, investments on solar and repairing projects net of financing of about $310 million, $130 million of share repurchases, all offset by about $300 million of cash from operations.
Based on our current forecast and changes to the Capital Allocation Plan, we now expect to end 2011 with almost $2.1 billion of cash, even including the impact of the expanded share repurchase program announced today.
Although not illustrated on this slide, I would like to quickly provide an update of our ongoing efforts to sell down equity in our solar development projects. We continue to target a 49% sell-down of 880 megawatts of utility projects that will accomplish 3 goals: One, efficiently manage the solar tax attributes; two, attract new investors to solar development; and three, free up capital to be redeployed in our prolific solar pipeline.
The progress of this initiative has admittedly been slower than expected, mostly a result of the pace of moving agreements through the Department of Energy for the larger projects. With that said, we remain confident that we'll reach a financial close with a net effect of increasing liquidity this year. Our share buyback plans are not dependent on the timing of this sell-down. 
On Slide 18, I would like to provide an update to the simplification of the capital structure, encompassing both our first lien facilities as well as the senior notes that we announced during the Q1 earnings call. We successfully completed Stage 1 by replacing our existing $1 billion revolver and $1.3 billion letter of credit facility, with a single $2.3 billion revolving credit facility due in 2016. 
Additionally, we issued a new single $1.6 billion Term Loan B Facility that matures in 2018 to replace 2 existing Term Loan B tranches with maturities in 2013 and '15. This refinancing eliminate investment basket restrictions and cash flow sweep requirements, while aligning the covenant structure in our first lien with our newer bond indentures.
Stage 2, the refinancing of the $3.5 billion of senior notes is progressing as indicated. In May, we completed the redemption of $2.4 billion 2016 senior notes with the issuance of senior notes with a simplified indenture package maturing in 2019 and 2021. Over the coming months, we will look to complete the final stage of the simplification with the refinancing of the 2017 senior notes.
As I mentioned on the Q1 earnings call, the long-term benefits to NRG and its stakeholders through successful execution of this debt restructuring strategy are numerous. First, there is an immediate improvement in the debt maturity profile with the nearest maturity by the first lien debt or bonds no earlier than 2016. Second, a common covenant package will be aligned across the NRG capital structure, permitting greater flexibility and the creation of a long range approach to capital allocation, both for a more efficient approach to reinvestment in our business and/or to return to shareholders.
And finally, as it was announced earlier this morning, I will be leaving NRG in early September to pursue an exciting and unique new opportunity in the healthcare industry. This decision is in no way a reflection of the current health of the company or a judgment about its future prospects. On the contrary, I am quite proud to have had the opportunity to work alongside an incredibly talented and gifted team to strengthen the company's financial position and improve NRG's ability to provide greater returns to shareholders. I'm also grateful to have had been able to help execute David Crane's strategy of transitioning NRG to a 21st century power provider, particularly as it relates to building one of the country's largest solar power companies. As a current and future shareholder, I look forward to following NRG's transformative progress. Now I'll turn it over to David for closing remarks."

So on behalf of myself and everyone at NRG, I wish him well in his new endeavor. With respect to a new CFO, we have just commenced consideration of potential successors for Chris. And while it is early days yet, I want you to know that I have every expectation that we will be able to consider our alternatives and fill the position in a much shorter period of time than last time around. 
The second and final thing I would tell you at this early stage in our CFO's search is that we have a very, very capable finance and accounting teams with deeply experienced management. And they will continue to pursue the company's various financing and capital allocation initiatives no matter how short or how long the CFO interim [ph] period turns out to be. 
So now turning to the concluding slide on Page 20. Sometimes the NRG story, by which I mean our investment proposition, can seem rather complicated. But I think at this juncture and at this share price, it boils down to 3 things that you may wish to consider as drivers for further investment in NRG: First, our unique wholesale asset retail business mix that has its core strength in Texas, the best and strongest growing regional market in the United States with the reserve margin that has proven itself in the past few days to be surprisingly tight; second, our robustly growing green energy portfolio of projects and businesses, led by our industry-leading multifaceted solar program; and third, our willingness and our significant ability to return excess capital through our capital allocation program in a manner that creates value for our shareholders. This is a business model, which we had been pursuing relentlessly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. And with that, Kiara, we will be happy to take questions from people on the phone."

Obviously, with where the company share prices now, seriously undervalued from our perspective, we see investment in the company's stock is to be about the best thing that the company can do with its money. We obviously have no idea what the company share price will be in the first quarter next year. Obviously, we hope that it moved in a particular direction from where it is right now. So I don't want to give you a particular number in that regard. But I would tell you that as we think through what will happen once we are out from underneath the -- out from underneath this restricted payment basket is that, I think, one thing that we'll be trying to change people's mindset on is the idea that there is a specific amount of buyback that we'll do every year on a recurring basis. That was something that we put in place about 5 years ago because looking forward with the RP basket is part of our life. We sort of saw that we'd have that ability to do that. I think what you'll see in the first quarter next year is that the way we're going to look at it is that, we want to right size our balance sheet from the point of view of how much liquidity we've maintained and go back to the way most people do buybacks, which is not something they do the same number every year. But if they have excess cash, they do it, and if they don't have excess cash, they don't do it. So I think that's the way we'll be looking at whatever decision we make in the first quarter of the year is -- how much excess cash do we have and what should we do of it, so that the balance sheet isn't constantly carrying this big -- it's a high quality problem, but this burden of too much high cost capital."

But I mean, let me address some of the other potential uses since you mentioned them. And I think you can see the limits of my predictive capacity because I had anticipated in early 2010 that 2011 would be a good time to be in the market buying power plants. But nothing could be further from the truth. I'll tell you what we've seen in the last several months is that -- and this is speaking, Ameet, about gas-fired power plants is that, that there are a lot of people chasing the gas plants in the market, and they're willing to pay prices that we can't justify. And the price that we're thinking things are worth and the price that people are paying for plants is not shrinking, it's getting larger. The other thing we're seeing in the market for gas-fired power plants is it's not just strategic buyers in the market anymore, it's financial buyers. And it seems that people are anticipating a turn in the commodity cycle, and private enterprises that don't have to worry at all about near-term accretion dilution are amassing power plants on the idea that the forward price curve is about to turn in a positive direction. So I would say of all the things that you might see us investing money in, the least likely thing you'll see as investing money in is in buying gas-fired combined cycle power plants. Another question that comes up is what about coal plants now that we have a little bit greater clarity because EPA rules are out there? I think it's really too early to tell on that because first of all, I'm not sure, no one's sure exactly how the EPA rules are going to kick in, and whether they're going to be applied on time and things. So I think the jury's still out on whether there is to be value obtained in buying coal plants. And I would mention we continue to seek, we would like to have a larger conventional power plant business in the Northeast United States, particularly in PJM, so it continues to be an aspiration of this company. But I'm not -- I'm just telling you, I'm not confident that we can do that at value. And so, that's not as likely a use of cash resources. So apart from that on the M&A front, there are things that we see in the alternative energy space or around the retail business that would fill out what we're trying to do in terms of our intrinsic growth. But those types of things are a much smaller dollar number things and would not impact, I think, in any way what we're confident in contemplating in terms of capital allocation over the next several months. Ameet, how was that for a long winded answer, did that answer -- somewhere in there, was there an answer to your question?"

And so we start by setting that aside. The second thing I think that you will -- you can count on us doing is that we will look at the equity capital when we get to the first quarter next year. We'll look at the equity capital that we expect to invest in the solar projects and the conventional projects that are well on their way. One of the things about -- another one of the things that I like about solar development is that the hit rate on solar development seems to be significantly higher than the hit rate on conventional power generation. And so if it looks like we have projects in the pipeline that are going to require equity capital in a foreseeable period of time, for example, calendar year 2012, we will take that into account. And then we look at having deducted those 2 things and obviously, the main is environmental CapEx, and the other things we do every year, then that's the number. And right now, we projected that number will be in the several hundred million dollar range. And so I know -- and I did sort of avoid the previous question in terms of ranking these various uses of capital. And to some degree, I don't think that we have to rank these uses of capital because we have so much capital that if we have very strong investments, I think we can do more than one thing. But I think we will look where we stand at that time in the Spring of 2012. And this is important, and then we will consult with our Board of Directors because they will have a very strong point of view on this. And then, we will look at the options in terms of return of capital to all the stakeholders, the shareholders certainly but even whether there should be more debt repayment."

But what we may be facing over the next 3 years is that if ERCOT, which does not have a lot of generations supply coming through the construction pipeline, gets very tight on generation side, Jason's wholesale costs may rise and compressed retail margins in that regard. And so, will Jason be able to do $600 million or $700 million a year every year going forward, not in that sort of rising wholesale pricing environment. But of course, the good thing for an NRG shareholder is what Jason sees in terms of compression is what our generation side will see as greater margin. In Texas, we're still roughly 2/3 generation and 1/3 retail. So ultimately, the company overall will benefit in that situation even if Reliant has difficulty posting that same type of number year on, year out -- year in, year out."

Also joining us our Jason Few who runs Reliant, our principal retail company at NRG; and Chris Moser, who runs the commercial operations of the group. Both Jason and Chris will be available to answer your questions. 
I'm going to get right into my presentation. I'm going to referring to a slide presentation, which you can refer to our website. And kicking off with Slide 3. I think during this call, we want to look back at the results for the quarter that just concluded, but even more so, we want to look ahead with the company is headed over the months and quarters to come. As we look forward, and I want to tell you this upfront so you're not surprised, Michael is to convince you that the company is extremely well-positioned to take advantage of and benefit from the opportunities available to it in this market environment and under current commodity prices. During 2011, we have committed a substantial amount of the company's growth capital and a series of value-enhancing investments in areas where the company has both special confidence and competitive advantage. Importantly, given the commodity price environment that we live in, all of these projects and businesses offer revenue streams that either do not rise and fall in correlation with the short-term fluctuations and natural gas prices, or in the case of retail, actually are negatively correlated with natural gas prices. Three of these growth areas are highlighted on Slide 3. With the 400 megawatt GenConn peaker projects, which came online in this summer, the 660 megawatt Old Bridge CCGT, which secured a long-term capacity offtake agreement in the New Jersey states solicitation earlier this year. And the 550 megawatt El Segundo repowering project has achieved financial closing this quarter. We have almost 1,500 net megawatt of advanced, gas-fired project with long-term offtake agreements, which are going to contribute steady streams of earnings and cash flows to the company for decades to come. 
With respect to renewables, we had previously signaled to the market over the past several quarters that as a result of the expiration of the Section 1705 federal loan guarantee program at the end of the third quarter and the expected expiration of the 1603 cash grant ITC at the end of the fourth quarter, there would be a surge of renewable projects that would begin construction before the end of this year. I'm quite pleased to report to you that our big 3 solar projects Ivanpah, Agua Caliente and CVSR successfully navigated the very challenging DOE loan guarantee application process and are now being constructed in full speed. Led by these 3 projects, we now have a total of 881 net megawatts of utilities solar projects in operation under construction or in the final stages of advanced development. All 881 megawatts with long-term offtake agreements were highly creditworthy load serving entities. 
And finally, there's the acquisition of the international Energy Plus Holdings, a young but very fast-growing retail electricity provider concentrated in the Northeast United States. Energy Plus' unique approach to the retail electricity market is based on its exclusive partnership relationships with a long list of airlines, hotel chains and affinity organizations that enable Energy Plus as part of its home electricity supply offer to offer frequent flyer miles, frequent gas points and other targeted benefits the customer classes with the preexisting relationship or loyalty to the airlines, hotel chains and other groups with whom Energy Plus have partners. These 3 areas: gas-fired, conventional, generation large-scale solar both with offtake agreements and expanded retail are going to provide significant growth of the company's bottom line over the next couple of years, and they're going to do it in a way that does not depend upon the recovery in natural gas prices. In addition to where we stand in terms of the deployment of our growth capital, I'm also very pleased to report of where the company stands in terms of our buyback program. Since our announcement of an additional buyback on our second quarter call, we have aggressively executed against that plan such that year-to-date, we have deployed $378 million in buyback from the market, 17.5 million shares of NRG stock, which added an average price about $21 per share is a price far below what we as the company management and Board of Directors believe to be the intrinsic value of the company. We believe this actual yield break for NRG Energy remaining shareholders as we resume our EBITDA growth in 2012 with the financial benefits be spread more generously across a substantially reduced share count. 
And now it leads to my final point on this slide, looking ahead to 2012. With 2011 adjusted EBITDA projected to come in between $1.8 billion and $1.85 billion, we are initiating EBITDA guidance for 2012 with an uptick to a range of $1.825 billion to $2 billion, and with free cash flow before growth of $800 million to $1 billion. This upswing in annual guidance is important because we are projecting this increase not as a result of higher-priced gas hedges entered into long ago, and not because of a higher gas market price. In both cases, the truth is quite the contrary. But because the company expects greater contribution from contracted assets, because we will benefit from the first really significant contribution of EBITDA from our new business areas, and most importantly, because of the bullish prospects with the other key component of our wholesale pricing equation namely Texas heat rates. Our plan for 2012, key elements of which are shown in a little more detail in Slide 4 is focused on making sure that we benefit from both the rising heat rate environment in Texas and any market design changes that will be implemented to incent more production in that state. While it's impossible to predict what type of weather Texas will experience in 2012, we believe the supply demand equation is very tight, and we expect substantial volatility. Ford heat rates still has ways to go before they incent new power generation, so the burden is incumbent fleet to stand and deliver flawlessly. And our Texas operations team is hard work preparing to do that. 
On the retail side, with Reliant leading that charge towards another banner year for retail at NRG, we are seeking more of the same, healthy and sustainable margins, low bad debt write-offs and a customer count between Reliant, Green Mountain and Energy Plus is growing at a healthy pace. In terms of our conventional Brownfield repowering program, the challenges faced by various incumbent coal and nuclear generation assets in our core regions has created greater opportunity for new projects at our existing sites. Beyond GenConn, Old Bridge and El Segundo, the nearly 1,500 net megawatt of projects with offtake agreements that I previously mentioned, we have another 1,500 megawatts of permitted gas-fired CCGTs within the load pockets in New York City and California and other CCGT projects earlier in the development pipeline. We will be moving forward on these projects so long as we can secure long-term offtake agreements. 
So to give you a sense of how we are setting our management priorities for 2012, please turn to Slide 5. Mauricio will be providing you more details in these areas, but I want to give you my personal assurance that our management focus in 2012 will be squarely on implementation of what we started in 2010 and 2011. First and foremost, we need to deliver on the full promise of our combined generation and retail potential in Texas in the same way that we have done for 8 of the first 9 months of 2011 in Texas in a way which we regrettably did not do in August. Secondly, we are focused on making sure that both El Segundo and our big solar projects are constructed on time and under budget. On the solar projects, we have a very high level of technology partners, Right Source, SunPower and First Solar. We have a high degree of confidence in Beckville, which involved in 2 of the big 3 projects, and we have a high degree of confidence in our own project management personnel who are providing oversight to these massive construction projects. So far, our experience in solar construction has been fairly highly positive. But given the sheer scale of the projects that we now have under construction, we are taking nothing for granted. Finally, and as we have discussed on previous calls, the date is fast approaching when we can look to refinance our 2017 bonds and be free to allocate our excess capital in a manner that maximizes value to our shareholders. As we prepare to enter this new era of reduced adult supervision from our bondholders, I want to emphasize a few points. First, we continue to believe in a balanced approach to capital deployment. Second, we continue to subscribe in the overriding principle of prudent balance sheet management. And finally, we believe our capital deployment program in 2011  adhere to these fundamental principles, and we fully intend to adhere to these principles in 2012. Having said that, at this share price level, we see enormous value to be had in investing in NRG stock. 
Beyond these 3 top near-term priorities, we will continue to push our effort to position NRG into first mover status in key areas that we believe have the potential to transform the energy business over the next several years. Time constraints preclude me from going to all these areas into much detail right now, but I do want to expand the discussion and little bit more about our solar strategy. I do this in part because of the significant capital commitment that we have made to our solar program depicted on Slide 6 during 2011, and I do this in part because it is inevitable that in the highly politicized, world that we live in, you probably already heard or read in the popular media a great deal about solar power that is distorted, misinterpreted or just flat-out wrong. So let me start with some basic facts that underpin our fast-moving and generally successful effort to be a leader in solar power generation in the United States. 
Fact #1, solar generation as a domestic energy resource installed locally by American workers built on the strength of American technological innovation and tapping into America's abundant solar resource, which for all practical purposes is inexhaustible. Fact #2, solar generation, particularly solar photovoltaic, puts less strain on other scarce commodities than any other form of power generation, particularly when it comes to what I like to call the big 3 of sustainability: freshwater, arable land and clean air. Fact #3, while solar is an intermittent resource, the sun is more reliable and predictable than the wind. And solar energy's availability is more coincident with the all-important peak summer load that the wind is. Fact #4, while large scale solar power development in the United States has been very substantially assisted by a variety of federal government programs, beginning with energy policy back in 2005, passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President George Bush, the primary driver for the U.S. solar industry has in fact been renewable energy portfolios standards enacted at the state level by red and blue states alike, led by California with its 33% renewable portfolio standard passed into law and signed by Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, which leads to my fifth and last fact about solar, and this by far the most important to us as a company. The price of solar panels, in particular, and of solar installations, more generally, is dropping like a stone. And for NRG, as probably the single largest consumer of solar panels in the United States, that is a very good thing. Moreover, we are convinced that the cost of solar installation is going to continue to drop precipitously both in absolute terms and relative to other forms of power generation. Most forms of power generation, including wind depend on brute force in a form of thermal energy or kinetic energy to make electricity. Increased size equals increased scale. Certainly, the wind industry has followed this approach. But solar photovoltaic is different. Solar PV is in essence a nanotechnology. As such, we believe some offshoot of Moore's Law applies to solar photovoltaic technology. Call it, if you will, create solar correlated to Moore's law, but we believe the delivered cost of energy from solar PV, which has been cut in half in the last 24 months will be cut in half again in the next 24 months. The ramifications of this price trend will be far reaching. We will be in a situation where within 2 years the price of delivered power from solar installations will be able to undercut the retail price of grid power in roughly 20 states. Many of these high-priced retail states are in our core regions. This low-cost solar power installed in every increasing volumes under distributed and semi-distributed basis in a way that obviates the need for a lot very long high-voltage transmission lines has a potential to revolutionize the hub-and-spoke power system, which currently makes up their American power industry. There's a perception of Wall Street investors that the solar industry is completely a creature of government financial largesse and market support. And that perception is largely true, but it's only true if you're looking backwards. As I've stated previously our big 3 utility scale solar projects could not have occurred without federal loan guarantee program and the California State renewable portfolio standard. And as all have seen over the years, when government rubs up against the business, that the blessing of government support for any particular industry is inevitably followed by a curse when the government yanks away that support usually without warning, without reason and at a time when the industry can at least afford it. But if we look forward, we see a solar industry that's going to trend strongly towards distributed and residential installation. And while market penetration for distributed and residential solar can and should be enhanced by enlightened government policies, the fact is that distributed and residential solar is a free-market construct. And solar energy at its present and certainly at its future price point will achieve explosive growth and substantial market share as a matter of consumer choice. NRG is positioning itself competitively through NRG Solar's warehouse group program with the DOE and through its 3 retail electricity providers to lead this transformation and to secure the benefit of it for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

Beginning with a few highlights for the third quarter on Slide 9. Our portfolio performed exceptionally well during the quarter, improving in both availability and reliability metrics as compared to the third",1201,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with a few highlights for the third quarter on Slide 9. Our portfolio performed exceptionally well during the quarter, improving in both availability and reliability metrics as compared to the third quarter of 2010. On the commercial front, we increased our hedges in 2012 given the weak fundamentals we continue to see in the gas market. In October, the EPA released an update to the cash -- increasing the allocation of allowances for the state where we operate. These changes provide us with greater flexibility for compliance as we continue to prepare for 2012 start date. Also in the compliance front, we're in the process of integrating Backend Controls and Indian River during the outage, and we're on track to be fully operational by January 1, 2012. With respect to our growth projects, we began commercial operations for the 21 Roadrunner solar PV project this summer, ahead of schedule and under budget. The Ubuntu combined cycle repowering project began construction and is on track by the summer of 2013. Last, our EPC continues to focus on supporting the solar buildup, which I will cover in more detail later in the presentation. 
Starting with safety on Slide 10. Our top 10 performance with OSHA recordable rate of 0.75, with 38 out of 45 sites without a reportable injury. This quite remarkable given the extreme weather conditions that our operators experience at many of our sites and further demonstrates our safety culture. Net generation increased by 11% during the third quarter compared to 2012. This increase was driven primarily by higher generation in Texas due to the record heat and the additional cost of goods into our central portfolio. It was partially offset by lower generation in the Northeast affected by lower power prices, higher gas switching and milder weather in August. 
As I mentioned, our [indiscernible] performed exceptionally well during the quarter. We have an availability factor of 95% and a forced outage rate of just 2%. PPM Parish led the fleet with over 98% availability. Our gas fleet saw significant decrease in generation. Overall, performed well to some specific exceptions and heavier cycle imposing the end of summer. Moving onto our retail operations on Slide 11. Despite August extreme weather and volatile market prices, we're still on track to finish the year comfortably within our region 2011 EBITDA guidance range. We continue to grow our residential segment with 34,000 additional customers in the end of 2010, demonstrating our ability to leverage our brand strength, while balancing margin in customer accounts. Reliant also delivered another quarterly lower bad debt expense, and our segment illustrating the power of scale capabilities and the strength of the Texas economy. 
On the residential segment, with I had continues to differentiate itself through innovative solutions and leader of real customer value through applications on the smart meter infrastructure as a result, Reliant has increased customer account 3 quarters in a row with our enrollment with 400,000 customers. Reliant had will average this innovation along with its strong customer service platform expanding to the Northeast and Midwest where we are now serving customers in 5 states. Our C&I segment remains largest provider accounts in Texas in our expansion into the Northeast is on target where we now serve over. Pricing dynamics in the sector remained very competitive we will continue to be selective on transactions that deliver attractive margin, which are reflected in our business results for the quarter. This is performance has enabled Reliant to be the largest retail provider in Texas when delivering strong customer satisfaction and achieving results that exceed our steady-state natural gas commitment of $400 million to $500 million. 
Turning to our profile in Slide 12. Our Basel portfolio is now mostly hedged for 2012, consistent with our view that natural gas fundamentals remain weak in the short term. For quite some time, our philosophy output of Basel portfolio versus your power in keeping the heat rate open given our bullish view particularly in the ERCOT markets we have benefited from the recent run-up of the rates and believe that based on market fundamentalists there is more remain. As we discussed in our last call, we have made solar adjustments are hedging strategy on the gas portfolio in excess we will maintain a portion of the offense to ensure we have a long life position as we head into next year and to mitigate some of the operational risks embedded in our portfolio. As for the other side of our dock spread we secured most of our 2012 will requirements ahead of the at attractive levels we will continue to be opportunistic about adding incremental hedges given our significant open power position beyond 2012. 
Moving onto our market update on Slide 13. Texas fundamentals remain stronger in the third quarter that -- healthy 2% and as you will know a new record loan of 68.3 gigawatts in August, employing a 4% actual operating reserve well below ERCOT's target level of 13.75%. On the supply side, the pipeline generation projects in ERCOT is almost an empty they still regeneration and irrespective of gas prices there needs to be significant current levels as indicated in the upper right chart. Post changes prior good to support adequacy step in the right direction we believe more is required generation. As you can see in the bottom right chart coal prices to free cash flow levels after short the Iranian we continue to be wind market given the current gas prices environment and the more stringent environmental rules. Last in the Northeast we saw increasing coal to gas switching giving low gas prices find weather in August as you can see the bottom left chart where we show quarterly changes in generation from last year we stated dynamics to continue through 2012 and believe economics will open in the Northeast will continue to be challenged. 
Turning to Slide 14, our EPC organization who have been successfully managing over $1.4 billion of repowering an environmental retrofit project has been transitioning to support our solar efforts over the past 2 years. We are engaged in many contractors solar suppliers and developers provided construction management and oversight services to our projects. Starting with -- the solar feud is over 40% complete and connection is now constructed and moving into the start-up phase. CVSR is off to a good start, and will Ivanpah is well underway this progress as planned, and Unit 2 has initiated work on the foundations of major equipment. We will continue to focus on supporting the development efforts of these projects so in closing, our base business portfolio was well-positioned to benefit from the entire fundamentals in the market particularly in Texas. Gives us a glimpse of potential market prices that we can expect in a statement mentioned, we are all focus in making the necessary adjustments to make sure that we deliver the full potential of our wholesale retail model going forward. With that combined with our repowering opportunities solar growth plans and retail expansion we expected to deliver this incremental value in our core regions. With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 16. NRG is reporting third quarter and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results of $458 million and $1.43 billion, respectively. Reliant Energy, which contributed $135 million of adjusted EBITD",1661,"Thank you Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 16. NRG is reporting third quarter and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results of $458 million and $1.43 billion, respectively. Reliant Energy, which contributed $135 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reported its first year-over-year improvement customer since our acquisition Reliant customer expansion was partially offset by lower unit margins resulting to some degree from competitive offering as a result of increased energy cost. Meanwhile, NRG full scale business and $323 million of adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter. $183 million of these adjusted EBITDA came from our Texas region, which benefited from a 1.2 terawatt hour increase in generation versus the third quarter of 2010. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decreased $205 million, however, and increased baseload availability was eclipsed by a combination of lower baseload hedges and the August impact. In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $47 million. Approximately $58 million decline versus the third quarter of 2010 was driven by lower hedge prices decreased coal generation and substantial decline capacity revenues. These decreases were offset by lower operating costs and favorable equity earnings from GenConn Middletown, which came online in June of this year. The last assets had a very strong order contributing $35 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is an increase of $10 million from the prior quarter -- prior year quarter as the region is contributing -- continue to realize increased volumes and favorable capacity prices in California. This South Central region delivered $44 million of adjusted EBITDA and the third quarter of 2011 this is a $5 million increase over the third quarter of 2010. Year-to-date 2011 adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.43 billion that was split between $462 million from Reliant and $968 million from wholesale. Reliant remains on track to exceed $550 million in EBITDA this year and wholesale business benefited 10% year-on-year increase in generation sold or 5.8 terawatt hours due impart to the acquired assets, including Cottonwood Solar projects, which contributed 3.7 terawatt hours. Results were offset by lower energy prices and higher fuel transport cost and lower capacity revenues. As we turn to capital allocation in 2011, during our second quarter conference call, as an advance of the 2012 GAAP allocation, we announced the $250 million increase to the 2011 share repurchase program bringing the total planned 2011 repurchases to $430 million. To date, we have completed share repurchases of $378 million or $17.5 million, and we anticipate completing the balance of $52 million of authorized share repurchases during the fourth quarter. During the year, we also reduced core corporate debt by $577 million Reliant our prudent balance sheet management objectives with 2011 financial performance. 
Now turning to the 2011 guidance on Slide 17 as David mentioned earlier we are raising the lower end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $25 million to $1.8 billion with the upper end of the range remaining at $1.85 billion. This improvement is largely a result of a strong September and healthy expectations for our retail businesses. And turning to the free cash flow we have revised our guidance of our free cash flow for growth to a range of $800 million to $850 million. The decline in free cash flow guidance is due to an increase in cash collateral postings. During the 2011 growth investment on Slide 18, we now expect a total of $806 million in growth investments for 2011, which represents a $238 million increase over our August 4, 2011, guidance of $568 million. 
This increase was attributable almost exclusively to an acceleration of a timing of previously identified projects, in particular our Solar projects. The $80 million increase in our expected conventional investments was driven by an acceleration of investment in our El Segundo repowering project by $63 million that was in order to remain on schedule with construction displayed a delay on the closing of $540 million facility I mentioned earlier. This will now resulted in a project being completed in 2013 without additional contributions from NRG. The $158 million increasing our Solar investments is also the result of an acceleration of spent in our Agua Caliente and CVSR projects. We've made significant strides over the last quarter and deploying capital to invest in NRG's future while maintaining a solid liquidity position as our total current liquidity is $1.9 billion which you will see on Slide 19. As we anticipated the net reduction in our revolver availability is primarily due to the required posting of letters of credit to support our equity commitments to our 3 largest Solar projects. As we make these equity investments over time, which I'll review with you shortly, these postings will then be released to us dollar-for-dollar. In essence as we have a post on the bulk of our Tier 1 Solar portfolio our liquidity position now reflects the full effect of our equity commitments in these projects. 
Turning to projected year in cash and cash equivalents, which will form the basis of our 2012 GAAP allocation program. Our projected year end cash position is approximately $1.3 billion. Our projected year-end balance of $1.3 billion in compares to approximately $1.9 billion, which was projected on our second quarter earnings call. the $600 million reduction at expected cash is largely due to $250 million acceleration of convention in solar investments that I discussed in the prior slide, as well as the acquisition of energy plus for and $193 million, which was closed on September 30 of this year. As we focus on capital allocation, we currently projected cash balance at the end of 2011 after deducting $700 million minimum cash, we target for working capital will then form a key component of our 2012 Capital Allocation Plan. 
Turning to Slide 20, as David mentioned earlier, we are initiating 2012 guidance with a range representing an increase over tower 2011 outlook with consolidated 2012 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.82 billion to $2 billion. We expect an upswing in our wholesale business to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion things to the contribution to know assets some of which include publicly a day, CVSR, Alpine, Roadrunner, as well as the anticipated expansion in heat rates in the ERCOT market. Also contributing to the uplift is an improvement in overall hedge prices across the portfolio, which is partially offset by lower natural gas prices and a continuation of lower capacity prices in the Northeast. Our retail outlook, which for 2012 now reflects our 3 distinct platforms, Reliant, Green Mountain Energy and the newly acquired Energy Plus it's for EBITDA in the range of $625 million the $700 million as we look to drive EBITDA growth by leveraging our 3 distinct retail companies. Our 2012 free cash flow before growth, which reflects components of operating cash flow now included in EBITDA, as well as the impact of our expected 2012 maintenance environmental capital expenditures remain strong with a range of between $800 million to $1 billion. These details are included in the appendix as part of our Reg G disclosures. 
Our free cash flow yield continues to demonstrate the attractiveness of our share price, which we will take advantage of us we refer to another $52 million of shares in the fourth quarter. I've chosen to devote a separate slide for 2012 growth in order to combine a bit more detail regarding this important component of our capital allocation strategy. On Slide 21, our committed growth investments are broken down into conventional to solar as discussed earlier. Importantly, we have termed these committed growth investments to reflect the projects to which we are either trained contractually committed, which represents the bulk of the items on Slide 21 or strategically committed for 2012. In addition, for those of investments to which we have commitments beyond 2012, I've also provided details regarding our adjusted investments in the future periods as we move closer to having all of these important projects online and contributing their full EBITDA potential. Our total 2012 expected growth investments are $825 million, which consist primarily of the big 3 solar projects. Beyond 2012, we have approximately $380 million of committed investments largely devoted to our Tier 1 solar portfolio. Agua Caliente now represents a significant portion of that now and that is not reflect the benefit of a cash grant as this project greatly requires DOE then sent to apply for that grant. These growth investments would be offset by proceeds from our ongoing efforts to monetize a portion of these projects as we are now able to more fully focus attention in shift resources towards this initiative now that the important than consuming DOE process is behind us. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 22, our 2017 bond refinancing, which we expect to complete by the first quarter of 2012 represents the final step in creating significantly greater flexibility to allocate capital in an optimal manner. Our expected excess capital at year end is $600 million, which is that of targeted cash for working capital combined with our 2012 free cash flow guidance of $800 million to $1 billion implies $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of expected cash available for committed growth in capital allocation in 2012. We expect to allocate $825 million of this  cash towards committed growth investments in 2012 as you recall from the prior slide. And this amount is largely comprised of continued equity funding for the solar project the $575 million and $775 million, which remains is the amount of cash we expect to become on available data become a share repurchases, debt pay downs and future growth initiatives, including the potential opportunity to accelerate perhaps a small portion of our currently committed growth investments from 2013 to 2012, if we are able to achieve higher returns an earlier commercial operation results. We expect to provide greater detail regarding 2012 capital allocation program on our fourth quarter conference call. And with that, I'll turn it over to David for his closing remarks."

I would say we have this communication internally all the time because I end up talking a lot of these new business areas doesn't mean that we're going to ignore it conventional business. In fact, I've said for years and years long before NRG got involved with the renewables business I thought the natural people renewables business in the conventional. So we're not afraid of owning conventional generation. We're very proud of our coal plants, the way they operate in environmentally and everything. What would tell you is just a couple of things. One is we would definitely like to all more generation in the Northeast. We've said that for years now. We have not been successful to be able to acquire generation prices that we thought made sense. We would not shy away. I mean, we already own coal plants both in the Northeastern Texas, so whether we own more or not, we don't think it changes what the company is about. But the main thing I would tell you right now is the economics of coal plants in the Northeast are just phenomenally challenged right now. And I don't know -- we are being as assertive with asset management as one could be with our own coal plants, and it's not a pretty picture. And so if we were to buy coal plants in the Northeast, I'm pretty confident that other people are looking at the same sort of numbers that we're looking at. And to be frank, most of those numbers have parentheticals around them. So why would say that we would be interested in looking at coal plants in the Northeast, but the price would have to reflect the value. And I think we referred to it. It's almost an option value they. I guess, that's what I would tell you."

Both Jason and Chris will be available to answer your questions. 
I'm going to get right into my presentation. I'm going to be referring to a slide presentation, which you can refer to on our website. And kicking off with Slide 3. I mean, during this call, we want to look back at the results for the quarter that just concluded, but even more so, we want to look ahead at where the company is headed over the months and quarters to come. As we look forward, and I want to tell you this upfront so you're not surprised, my call is to convince you that the company is extremely well positioned to take advantage of and benefit from the opportunities available to it in this market environment and under current commodity prices. During 2011, we have committed a substantial amount of the company's growth capital and a series of value-enhancing investments in areas where the company has both special confidence and competitive advantage. Importantly, given the commodity price environment that we live in, all of these projects and businesses offer revenue streams that either do not rise and fall in correlation with the short-term fluctuations in natural gas prices, or in the case of retail, actually are negatively correlated with natural gas prices. Three of these growth areas are highlighted on Slide 3. With the 400 megawatt GenConn peaker projects, which came online in this summer, the 660 megawatt Old Bridge CCGT, which secured a long-term capacity offtake agreement in the New Jersey state solicitation earlier this year, and the 550 megawatt El Segundo repowering project have achieved financial closing this quarter. We have almost 1,500 net megawatt of advanced gas-fired project with long-term offtake agreements, which are going to contribute steady streams of earnings and cash flows to the company for decades to come. 
With respect to renewables, we had previously signaled to the market over the past several quarters that as a result of the expiration of the Section 1705 federal loan guarantee program at the end of the third quarter and the expected expiration of the 1603 cash grant ITC at the end of the fourth quarter, there would be a surge of renewable projects that would begin construction before the end of this year. I'm quite pleased to report to you that our big 3 solar projects, Ivanpah, Agua Caliente and CVSR, successfully navigated the very challenging DOE loan guarantee application process and are now being constructed at full speed. Led by these 3 projects, we now have a total of 881 net megawatts of utility-scale solar projects in operation under construction or in the final stages of advanced development, all 881 megawatts with long-term offtake agreements with highly creditworthy load serving entities. 
And finally, there's the acquisition of Energy Plus Holdings, a young but very fast-growing retail electricity provider concentrated in the Northeast United States. Energy Plus' unique approach to the retail electricity market is based on its exclusive partnership relationships, with a long list of airlines, hotel chains and affinity organizations that enable Energy Plus as part of its home electricity supply offer to offer frequent flyer miles, frequent gas points and other targeted benefits that customer classes with the preexisting relationship or loyalty to the airlines, hotel chains and other groups with whom Energy Plus have partners. These 3 areas, gas-fired, conventional, generation large-scale solar both with offtake agreements and expanded retail, are going to provide significant growth to the company's bottom line over the next couple of years, and they're going to do it in a way that does not depend upon a recovery in natural gas prices. In addition to where we stand in terms of the deployment of our growth capital, I'm also very pleased to report of where the company stands in terms of our buyback program. Since our announcement of an additional buyback on our second quarter call, we have aggressively executed against that plan such that year-to-date, we have deployed $378 million in buyback from the market, 17.5 million shares of NRG stock, which had an average price of about $21 per share is a price far below what we, the company management and Board of Directors, believe to be the intrinsic value of the company. We believe this actual yield break the events for all NRG Energy remaining shareholders as we resume our EBITDA growth in 2012 with the financial benefits be spread more generously across a substantially reduced share count. 
And that leads to my final point on this slide, looking ahead to 2012. With 2011 adjusted EBITDA projected to come in between $1.8 billion and $1.85 billion, we are initiating EBITDA guidance for 2012 with an uptick to a range of $1.825 billion to $2 billion and with free cash flow before growth of $800 million to $1 billion. This upswing in our annual guidance is important because we are projecting this increase not as a result of higher-priced gas hedges entered into long ago and not because of a higher gas market price. In both cases, the truth is quite to the contrary. But because the company expects greater contribution from contracted assets, because we will benefit from the first really significant contribution of EBITDA from our new business areas, and most importantly, because of the bullish prospects for the other key component of our wholesale pricing equation, namely Texas heat rates. Our plan for 2012, key elements of which are shown in a little more detail on Slide 4, is focused on making sure that we benefit from both the rising heat rate environment in Texas and any market design changes that will be implemented to incent more production in that state. While it's impossible to predict what type of weather Texas will experience in 2012, we believe the supply-demand equation is very tight and we expect substantial volatility. Forward heat rates still have ways to go before they incent any new power generation, so the burden is on the incumbent fleet to stand and deliver flawlessly. And our Texas operations team is hard at work preparing to do that. 
On the retail side, with Reliant leading the charge towards another banner year for retail at NRG, we are seeking more of the same: healthy and sustainable margins, low bad debt write-offs and a customer count between that Reliant, Green Mountain and Energy Plus is growing at a healthy pace. In terms of our conventional Brownfield/Repowering program, the challenges faced by various incumbent coal and nuclear generation assets in our core regions have created greater opportunity for new projects at our existing sites. Beyond GenConn, Old Bridge and El Segundo, the nearly 1,500 net megawatts of projects with offtake agreements that I previously mentioned, we have another 1,500 megawatts of permitted gas-fired CCGTs within the load pockets in New York City and California and other CCGT projects earlier in the development pipeline. We will be moving forward on these projects so long as we can secure long-term offtake agreements. 
So to give you a sense of how we are setting our management priorities for 2012, please turn to Slide 5. Mauricio will be providing you more details in these areas, but I want to give you my personal assurance that our management focus in 2012 will be squarely on forceful implementation of what we started in 2010 and 2011. First and foremost, we need to deliver on the full promise of our combined generation and retail potential in Texas in the same way that we have done for 8 of the first 9 months in 2011 in Texas in a way which we regrettably did not do in August. 
Secondly, we are focused on making sure that both El Segundo and our big solar projects are constructed on time and under budget. On the solar projects, we have a very high level of confidence in our technology partners, BrightSource, SunPower and First Solar. We have a high degree of confidence in Beckville, [ph] which is involved in 2 of the big 3 projects, and we have a high degree of confidence in our own project management personnel, who are providing oversight to these massive construction projects. So far, our experience in solar construction has been very highly positive. But given the sheer scale of the projects that we now have under construction, we are taking nothing for granted. 
Finally, and as we have discussed on previous calls, the date is fast approaching when we can look to refinance our 2017 bonds and be free to allocate our excess capital in a manner that maximizes value to our shareholders. As we prepare to enter this new era of reduced adult supervision from our bondholders, I want to emphasize a few points. First, we continue to believe in a balanced approach to capital deployment. Second, we continue to subscribe in the overriding principle of prudent balance sheet management. And finally, we believe our capital deployment program in 2011  adhere to these fundamental principles, and we fully intend to adhere to these principles in 2012. Having said that, at this share price level, we see enormous value to be had in investing in NRG stock. 
Beyond these 3 top near-term priorities, we will continue to push our effort to position NRG into first mover status in key areas that we believe have the potential to transform the energy business over the next several years. Time constraints preclude me from going into all these areas in too much detail right now, but I do want to expand the discussion and little bit more about our solar strategy. I do this in part because of the significant capital commitment that we had made to our solar program, depicted on Slide 6, during 2011. And I do this in part because it is inevitable that in the highly politicized, post-cylindrical [ph] world that we live in, you have probably already heard or read in the popular media a great deal about solar power that is distorted, misinterpreted or just flat-out wrong. So let me start with some basic facts that underpin our fast-moving and generally successful effort to be a leader in solar power generation in the United States. 
Fact #1. Solar generation is a domestic energy resource installed locally by American workers, built on the strength of American technological innovation and tapping into America's abundant solar resource, which for all practical purposes is inexhaustible. 
Fact #2. Solar generation, and particularly solar photovoltaic, puts less strain on other scarce commodities than any other form of power generation, particularly when it comes to what I like to call the big 3 of sustainability: freshwater, arable land and clean air. 
Fact #3. While solar is an intermittent resource, the sun is more reliable and predictable than the wind. And solar energy's availability is more coincident with the all-important peak summer load that the wind is. 
Fact #4. While large-scale solar power development in the United States has been very substantially assisted by a variety of federal government programs, beginning with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President George Bush, the primary driver for the U.S. solar industry has in fact been renewable energy portfolio standards enacted at the state level by red and blue states alike, led by California with its 33% renewable portfolio standard passed into law and signed by Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, which leads to my fifth and last fact about solar, and this by far the most important to us as a company. 
The price of solar panels, in particular, and of solar installations, more generally, is dropping like a stone. And for NRG, as probably the single largest consumer of solar panels in the United States, that is a very good thing. Moreover, we are convinced that the cost of solar installations is going to continue to drop precipitously both in absolute terms and relative to other forms of power generation. 
Most forms of power generation, including wind, depend on brute force in the form of thermal energy or kinetic energy to make electricity. Increased size equals increased scale. Certainly, the wind industry has followed this approach. But solar photovoltaic is different. Solar PV is in essence a nanotechnology. As such, we believe some offshoot of Moore's Law applies to solar photovoltaic technology. Call it, if you will, crane   solar corollary to Moore's Law, but we believe the delivered cost of energy from solar PV, which has been cut in half in the last 24 months, will be cut in half again in the next 24 months. The ramifications of this price trend will be far reaching. We will be in a situation where within 2 years the price of delivered power from solar installations will be able to undercut the retail price of grid power in roughly 20 states. Many of these high-priced retail states are in our core regions. This low-cost solar power installed in every increasing volumes on a distributed and semi-distributed basis in a way that obviates the need for a lot very long high-voltage transmission lines has the potential to revolutionize the hub-and-spoke power system, which currently makes up the American power industry. 
There's a perception of Wall Street investors that the solar industry is completely a creature of government financial largesse and market support. And that perception is largely true, but it's only true if you're looking backwards. As I've stated previously, our big 3 utility scale solar projects could not have occurred without the federal loan guarantee program and the California State renewable portfolio standard. And as all of us have seen over the years, when government rubs up against business, that the blessing of government support for any particular industry is inevitably followed by a curse when the government yanks away that support usually without warning, without reason and at a time when the industry can least afford it. 
But if we look forward, we see a solar industry that's going to trend strongly towards distributed and residential installation. And while market penetration for distributed and residential solar can and should be enhanced by enlightened government policies, the fact is that distributed and residential solar is a free-market construct. And solar energy at its present and certainly at its future price point will achieve explosive growth and substantial market share as a matter of consumer choice. 
NRG is positioning itself competitively through NRG Solar's warehouse group start program with [indiscernible] and the DOE and through its 3 retail electricity providers to lead this transformation and to secure the benefit of it for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

Beginning with a few highlights for the third quarter on Slide 9. Our [indiscernible] portfolio performed exceptionally well during the quarter, improving in both availability and reliability metrics as compared to the third quarter of 2010. On the commercial front, we increased our hedges in 2012 given the weak fundamentals we continue to see in the gas market. In October, the EPA released an update to the cash [indiscernible] increasing the allocation of allowances for the state where we operate. These changes provide us with greater flexibility for compliance as we continue to prepare for our 2012 start date. Also in the compliance front, we're in the process of integrating back-end controls at Indian River during the current fall outage and are on track to be fully operational by January 1, 2012. With respect to our growth projects, we began commercial operations for the 21-megawatt Roadrunner solar PV project this summer, ahead of schedule and under budget. The El Segundo combined cycle repowering project began construction and is on track to be in service by the summer of 2013. Last, our EPC organization continues to focus on supporting the solar buildout, which I will cover in more detail later in the presentation. 
Starting with safety on Slide 10. Starting with our top decile performance with an OSHA recordable rate of 0.75, with 38 out of 45 sites without a recordable injury this quarter. This quite remarkable given the extreme weather conditions that our operators experience at many of our sites and further demonstrates our safety culture. Net generation increased by 11% during the third quarter compared to 2010. This increase was driven primarily by higher generation in Texas due to the record heat and the additional cost of goods added into our central portfolio. This was partially offset by lower generation in the Northeast affected by lower power prices, higher coal-to-gas switching and milder weather in August. 
As I mentioned, our baseload fleet performed exceptionally well during the quarter with an availability factor of 95% and a forced outage rate of just 2%. FPPM Parish [ph] led the fleet with over 98% availability. Our gas fleet saw a significant increase in generation and number of starts. Overall, it performed well with some specific exceptions due to age and heavier cycling imposed in the end of this summer. 
Moving onto our retail operations on Slide 11. Despite August's extreme weather and volatile market prices, we're still on track to finish the year comfortably within our region in 2011 EBITDA guidance range. We continue to grow our residential segment with 34,000 additional customers since the end of 2010, demonstrating our ability to leverage our brand's strength while balancing margins in customer accounts. Reliant also delivered another quarterly lower bad debt expense, and our vast segment illustrating the power of scale back office capabilities and the strength of the Texas economy. 
On the residential segment, Reliant continued to differentiate itself through innovative solutions and the leader of real customer value through applications and services based on the Smart Meter infrastructure. As a result, Reliant has increased customer account 3 quarters in a row with our e-Sense enrollment with 400,000 customers. Reliant will leverage this innovation along with its strong customer service platform as it is  expanding to the Northeast and Midwest where we are now serving customers in 5 states. 
Our C&I segment remains the largest provider to business accounts in Texas, and our expansion to the Northeast is on target where we now serve over 2 terawatt hours. While the pricing dynamics in the sector remains very competitive, we will continue to be selective on transactions that deliver attractive margins, which are reflected in our business results for the quarter. This strong performance has enabled Reliant to be the largest retail provider in Texas while delivering strong customer satisfaction and achieving results that exceed our steady-state natural gas commitment of $400 million to $500 million. 
Turning to our cash profile in Slide 12. Our baseload portfolio is now mostly hedged for 2012, consistent with our view that natural gas fundamentals remain weak in the short term. For quite some time, our hedging philosophy has been to hedge output of our baseload portfolio with natural gas as a profit for power and keep the heat rate open given our bullish view particularly in the ERCOT market. We have benefited from the recent run-up in heat rates and believe that based on market fundamentals, there is more outside remaining. As we discussed in our last call, we have made some adjustments to our hedging strategy on the gas portfolio in Texas. We will maintain a portion of the peaking fleet on hedge to ensure we have a long biased position as we head into next year and to mitigate some of the operational risks embedded in our portfolio. As for the other side of our dock spread, we secured most of our 2012 coal requirement ahead of the cash per [ph] rules at attractive levels. We will continue to be opportunistic about adding incremental hedges given our significant open power position beyond 2012. 
Moving onto our market update on Slide 13. Texas fundamentals remain stronger during the third quarter. The line grew by healthy 2% and as you will know, ERCOT set new record peak loan of 68.3 gigawatts in August, implying a 4% actual operating reserve well below ERCOT's target level of 13.75%. 
On the supply side, the pipeline on generation projects in ERCOT is almost empty while forward heat [indiscernible] recently they still don't incentivise new regeneration and irrespective of gas prices there needs to be significant offset from current levels as indicated in the upper right chart. 
Recent proposed changes by ERCOT on the PUCT to support resource adequacy are a step in the right direction for we believe more is required to incentivise new generation. As you can see in the bottom right chart, here the coal prices coverage rates to pre-CSAPR levels after a short lead rally. We continue to believe that the compact wind in the market is not just applied given the current gas price environment and the more stringent environmental rules. 
Last in the Northeast we saw increasing coal-to-gas switching given low gas prices and relatively mild weather in August, as you can see in the bottom left chart where we show quarterly changes in generation from last year. We expect the dynamics to continue through 2012 and believe economic performance in the Northeast will continue to be challenged. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our EPC organization, who has been successfully managing over $1.4 billion of repowering an environmental retrofit projects, has been transitioning to support our solar efforts over the past 2 years. We are engaged in major contractors, solar suppliers and developers providing construction management and oversight services to our projects. Starting with Agua Caliente, the solar field is over 40% complete and the interconnection is now constructed and moving into the start-up phase. CVSR is off to a good start, and Ivanpah is well underway on Unit 1, where erection of the first solar receiver tower is progressing as planned,, and Unit 2 has initiated work on the foundations of major equipment. We will continue to focus on supporting the development efforts of new projects like Borrego, Alpine and Avra Valley. 
So in closing, our base business portfolio is well positioned to benefit from higher fundamentals in the market particularly in Texas. All these gave us a glimpse of the potential market prices that we can expect, and as David mentioned, we are all focused in making the necessary adjustments to ensure we deliver the full potential of our integrated wholesale-retail model going forward. With that, combined with our repowering opportunities, solar growth plans and retail expansion, we expect to deliver healthy incremental value in our core regions. 
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."
413857,141930583,184123,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you Mauricio.

Reliant Energy, which contributed $135 million of adjusted EBITD",1684,"Thank you Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 16. NRG is reporting third quarter and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results of $458 million and $1.43 billion, respectively. Reliant Energy, which contributed $135 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, reported its first year-over-year improvement in mass customer since our acquisition. Reliant's customer expansion, however, was partially offset by lower unit margins resulting to some degree from competitive offering but in larger part as a result of increased energy costs. 
Meanwhile, NRG's wholesale business and $323 million of adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter. $183 million of this adjusted EBITDA came from our Texas region, which benefited from a 1.2 terawatt hour increase in generation versus the third quarter of 2010. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decreased $205 million, however, as increased baseload availability was eclipsed by a combination of lower baseload hedges and the August impact. In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $47 million. The approximately $58 million decline versus the third quarter of 2010 was driven by lower hedge prices, decreased coal generation and a substantial decline in capacity revenues. These decreases were offset by lower operating costs and favorable equity earnings from GenConn Middletown, which came online in June of this year. 
The West asset had a very strong quarter, contributing $35 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is an increase of $10 million from the prior quarter -- prior year quarter as the region is contributing -- continue to realize increased volumes and favorable capacity prices in California. The South Central region delivered $44 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2011, which is a $5 million increase over the third quarter of 2010. Year-to-date 2011 adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.43 billion, and that was split between $462 million from Reliant and $968 million from wholesale. 
Reliant remains on track to exceed $550 million in EBITDA this year, and meanwhile wholesale business benefited, growing 10% year-on-year increase in generation sold for 5.8 terawatt hours due in part to the acquired assets, including Cottonwood, South Trent and solar projects, which contributed 3.7 terawatt hours. Results were offset by lower energy prices, higher fuel and transport costs and lower capacity revenues. 
As we turn to capital allocation in 2011, during our second quarter conference call, as an advance on the 2012  capital allocation, we announced the $250 million increase to the 2011 share repurchase program, bringing the total planned 2011 repurchases to $430 million. To date, we have completed share repurchases of $378 million or $17.5 million shares and we anticipate completing the balance of $52 million of authorized share repurchases during the fourth quarter. During the year, we also reduced corporate debt by $577 million, better aligning our prudent balance sheet management objectives with 2011 financial performance. 
Now turning to the 2011 guidance on Slide 17. As David mentioned earlier, we are raising the lower end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $25 million to $1.8 billion, with the upper end of the range remaining at $1.85 billion. This improvement is largely a result of a strong September and healthy expectations for our retail businesses. 
And turning to free cash flow, we have revised our guidance for free cash flow before growth to a range of $800 million to $850 million. The decline in free cash flow guidance is due to an increase in cash collateral postings. 
Turning to 2011 growth investment on Slide 18. We now expect a total of $806 million in growth investments for 2011, which represents a $238 million increase over our August 4, 2011 guidance of $568 million. 
This increase was attributable almost exclusively to an acceleration of the timing of previously identified projects, in particular our solar projects. The $80 million increase in our expected conventional investments was driven by an acceleration of our investment in our El Segundo repowering project by $63 million, and that was in order to remain on schedule with construction despite a delay on the closing of the $540 million facility that I mentioned earlier. This will now resulted in the project being completed in 2013 without additional contributions from NRG. The $158 million increasing in our solar investments is also the result of an acceleration of spend at our Agua Caliente and CVSR projects. 
We've made significant strides over the last quarter in deploying capital to invest in NRG's future while maintaining a solid liquidity position as our total current liquidity is $1.9 billion, which you will see on Slide 19. As we anticipated the net reduction in our revolver availability is primarily due to the required posting of letters of credit to support our equity commitments to our 3 largest solar projects. As we make these equity investments over time, which I'll review with you shortly, these healthy postings will then be released to us dollar-for-dollar. In essence, as we have now closed on the bulk of our Tier 1 solar portfolio, our liquidity position now reflects the full effect of our equity commitments in these important projects. 
Turning to projected year in cash and cash equivalents, which will form the basis of our 2012  capital allocation program. Our projected year-end cash position is approximately $1.3 billion. Our projected year-end balance of $1.3 billion in compares to approximately $1.9 billion, which was projected on our second quarter earnings call. The $600 million reduction in that expected cash is largely due to the $250 million acceleration of conventional on solar investments that I discussed on the prior slide, as well as the acquisition of Energy Plus for $193 million, which was closed on September 30 of this year. As we focus on capital allocation, the currently projected cash balance at the end of 2011 after deducting $700 million minimum cash we target for working capital will then form a key component of our 2012 Capital Allocation Plan. 
Turning to Slide 20. As David mentioned earlier, we're initiating 2012 guidance with a range representing an increase over our 2011 outlook, with consolidated 2012 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.82 billion to $2 billion. We expect an upswing in our wholesale business to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, thanks to the contribution from new assets, some of which include Agua Caliente, CVSR, Alpine, Roadrunner, as well as the anticipated expansion in heat rates in the ERCOT market. Also contributing to the uplift is an improvement in overall hedge prices across the portfolio, which is partially offset by lower natural gas prices and a continuation of lower capacity prices in the Northeast. Our retail outlook, which for 2012 now reflects our 3 distinct platforms, Reliant, Green Mountain Energy and the newly acquired Energy Plus, is for EBITDA in the range of $625 million the $700 million as we look to drive EBITDA growth by leveraging our 3 distinct retail companies. Our 2012 free cash flow before growth, which reflects components of operating cash flow not included in EBITDA, as well as the impact of our expected 2012 maintenance and environmental capital expenditures, remain strong with a range of between $800 million to $1 billion. These details are included in the appendix as part of our Reg G  disclosure. 
Our free cash flow yield continues to demonstrate the attractiveness of our share price, which we will take advantage of us we repurchase another $52 million of shares in the fourth quarter. 
I've chosen to devote a separate slide for our 2012 growth investments in order to provide a bit more detail regarding this important component of our capital allocation strategy. On Slide 21, our committed growth investments are broken down into conventional and solar, as I discussed earlier. Importantly, we have termed these committed growth investments to reflect the projects to which we are either contractually committed, which represents the bulk of the items on Slide 21, or strategically committed for 2012. In addition, for those of investments to which we have commitments beyond 2012, I've also provided details regarding our expected investments in these future periods as we move closer to having all of these important projects online and contributing their full EBITDA potential. 
Our total 2012 expected growth investments are $825 million, which consist primarily of the big 3 solar projects. Beyond 2012, we have approximately $380 million of committed investments largely devoted to our Tier 1 solar portfolio. Agua Caliente now represents a significant portion of that amount and that does not reflect the benefit of a cash grant as this project currently requires DOE consent to apply for that grant. These growth investments should be offset by proceeds from our ongoing efforts to monetize a portion of these projects as we are now able to more fully focus attention and shift resources towards this initiative now that the important but time-consuming DOE process is behind us. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 22, our 2017 bond refinancing, which we expect to complete by the first quarter of 2012, represents the final step in creating significantly greater flexibility to allocate capital in an optimal manner. Our expected excess cash at year end is $600 million, which is net of targeted cash for working capital, combined with our 2012 free cash flow guidance of $800 million to $1 billion, implies $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of expected cash available for committed growth in capital allocation in 2012. We expect to allocate $825 million of this  cash towards committed growth investments in 2012 as, you will recall from the prior slide. And this amount is largely comprised of continued equity funding for our big 3 solar projects. The $575 million to $775 million, which remains is the amount of cash we expect to have available data to allocate among share repurchases, debt paydown and future growth initiatives, including the potential opportunity to accelerate perhaps a small portion of our currently committed growth investments from 2013 into 2012 if we are able to achieve higher returns and earlier commercial operation results. We expect to provide greater detail regarding the 2012 capital allocation program on our February earnings call. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks."

I would say that we have this communication internally all the time. Because I end up talking a lot of these new business areas doesn't mean that we're going to ignore the conventional business. In fact, I've said for years and years long before NRG got involved in the renewables business that I thought the natural people to be in the renewables business were people who were actually in the conventional. So we're not afraid of owning conventional generation. We're very proud of our coal plants, the way they operate environmentally and everything. What I would tell you is just a couple of things. One is we would definitely like to own more generation in the Northeast. We've said that for years now. We have not been successful to be able to acquire generation at prices that we thought made sense. We would not shy away. I mean, we already own coal plants both in the Northeastern Texas, so whether we own more or not, we don't think that really changes what the company is about. But the main thing I would tell you right now is the economics of coal plants in the Northeast are just phenomenally challenged right now. And I don't know -- we are being as assertive with asset management as one can be with our own coal plants, and it's not a pretty picture. And so if we were to buy coal plants in the Northeast, I'm pretty confident that other people are looking at the same sort of numbers that we're looking at. And to be frank, most of those numbers have parentheticals around them. And so I would say that we would be interested in looking at coal plants in the Northeast, but the price would have to reflect the value. And I think we've referred to it. I mean, it's almost an option value play. So I guess, that's what I would tell you."

I mean, during this call, we want to look back at the results for the quarter that just concluded, but even more so, we want to look ahead at where the company is headed over the months and quarters to come. As we look forward, and I want to tell you this upfront so that you're not surprised, my call is to convince you that the company is extremely well positioned to take advantage of and benefit from the opportunities available to it in this market environment and under current commodity prices. During 2011, we have committed a substantial amount of the company's growth capital and a series of value-enhancing investments in areas where the company has both special confidence and competitive advantage. Importantly, given the commodity price environment that we live in, all of these projects and businesses offer revenue streams that either do not rise and fall in correlation with the short-term fluctuations in natural gas prices, or in the case of retail, actually are negatively correlated with natural gas prices. Three of these growth areas are highlighted on Slide 3. With the 400 megawatt GenConn peaker projects, which came online in this summer, the 660 megawatt Old Bridge CCGT, which secured a long-term capacity offtake agreement in the New Jersey state solicitation earlier this year, and the 550 megawatt El Segundo repowering project that achieved financial closing this quarter. We have almost 1,500 net megawatt of advanced gas-fired project with long-term offtake agreements, which are going to contribute steady streams of earnings and cash flows to the company for decades to come. 
With respect to renewables, we had previously signaled to the market over the past several quarters that as a result of the expiration of the Section 1705 federal loan guarantee program at the end of the third quarter and the expected expiration of the 1603 cash grant ITC at the end of the fourth quarter, there would be a surge of renewable projects that would begin construction before the end of this year. I'm quite pleased to report to you that our big 3 solar projects, Ivanpah, Agua Caliente and CVSR, successfully navigated the very challenging DOE loan guarantee application process and are now being constructed at full speed. Led by these 3 projects, we now have a total of 881 net megawatts of utility-scale solar projects in operation under construction or in the final stages of advanced development, all 881 megawatts with long-term offtake agreements with highly creditworthy load serving entities. 
And finally, there's the acquisition of Energy Plus Holdings, a young but very fast-growing retail electricity provider concentrated in the Northeast United States. Energy Plus' unique approach to the retail electricity market is based on its exclusive partnership relationships, with a long list of airlines, hotel chains and affinity organizations that enable Energy Plus as part of its home electricity supply offer to offer frequent flyer miles, frequent gas points and other targeted benefits that customer classes with the preexisting relationship or loyalty to the airlines, hotel chains and other groups with whom Energy Plus have partners. These 3 areas, gas-fired, conventional, generation large-scale solar both with offtake agreements and expanded retail, are going to provide significant growth to the company's bottom line over the next couple of years, and they're going to do it in a way that does not depend upon a recovery in natural gas prices. In addition to where we stand in terms of the deployment of our growth capital, I'm also very pleased to report of where the company stands in terms of our buyback program. Since our announcement of an additional buyback on our second quarter call, we have aggressively executed against that plan such that year-to-date, we have deployed $378 million in buyback from the market, 17.5 million shares of NRG stock, which had an average price of about $21 per share is a price far below what we, the company management and Board of Directors, believe to be the intrinsic value of the company. We believe this actual yield break the events for all NRG Energy remaining shareholders as we resume our EBITDA growth in 2012 with the financial benefits be spread more generously across a substantially reduced share count. 
And that leads to my final point on this slide, looking ahead to 2012. With 2011 adjusted EBITDA projected to come in between $1.8 billion and $1.85 billion, we are initiating EBITDA guidance for 2012 with an uptick to a range of $1.825 billion to $2 billion and with free cash flow before growth of $800 million to $1 billion. This upswing in our annual guidance is important because we are projecting this increase not as a result of higher-priced gas hedges entered into long ago and not because of a higher gas market price. In both cases, the truth is quite to the contrary. But because the company expects greater contribution from contracted assets, because we will benefit from the first really significant contribution of EBITDA from our new business areas, and most importantly, because of the bullish prospects for the other key component of our wholesale pricing equation, namely Texas heat rates. Our plan for 2012, key elements of which are shown in a little more detail on Slide 4, is focused on making sure that we benefit from both the rising heat rate environment in Texas and any market design changes that will be implemented to incent more production in that state. While it's impossible to predict what type of weather Texas will experience in 2012, we believe the supply-demand equation is very tight and we expect substantial volatility. Forward heat rates still have ways to go before they incent any new power generation, so the burden is on the incumbent fleet to stand and deliver flawlessly. And our Texas operations team is hard at work preparing to do that. 
On the retail side, with Reliant leading the charge towards another banner year for retail at NRG, we are seeking more of the same: healthy and sustainable margins, low bad debt write-offs and a customer count that between Reliant, Green Mountain and Energy Plus is growing at a healthy pace. In terms of our conventional Brownfield/Repowering program, the challenges faced by various incumbent coal and nuclear generation assets in our core regions has created greater opportunity for new projects at our existing sites. Beyond GenConn, Old Bridge and El Segundo, the nearly 1,500 net megawatts of projects with offtake agreements that I previously mentioned, we have another 1,500 megawatts of permitted gas-fired CCGTs within load pockets in New York City and California and other CCGT projects earlier in the development pipeline. We will be moving forward on these projects so long as we can secure long-term offtake agreements. 
So to give you a sense of how we are setting our management priorities for 2012, please turn to Slide 5. Mauricio will be providing you more detail in these areas, but I want to give you my personal assurance that our management focus in 2012 will be squarely on forceful implementation of what we started in 2010 and 2011. First and foremost, we need to deliver on the full promise of our combined generation and retail potential in Texas in the same way that we have done for 8 of the first 9 months of 2011 in Texas in a way which we regrettably did not do in August. 
Secondly, we are focused on making sure that both El Segundo and our big solar projects are constructed on time and under budget. On the solar projects, we have a very high level of confidence in our technology partners, BrightSource, SunPower and First Solar. We have a high degree of confidence in Beckville, [ph] which is involved in 2 of the big 3 projects, and we have a high degree of confidence in our own project management personnel, who are providing oversight to these massive construction projects. So far, our experience in solar construction has been very highly positive. But given the sheer scale of the projects that we now have under construction, we are taking nothing for granted. 
Finally, and as we have discussed on previous calls, the date is fast approaching when we can look to refinance our 2017 bonds and be free to allocate our excess capital in a manner that maximizes value to our shareholders. As we prepare to enter this new era of reduced adult supervision from our bondholders, I want to emphasize a few points. First, we continue to believe in a balanced approach to capital deployment. Second, we continue to subscribe in the overriding principle of prudent balance sheet management. And finally, we believe our capital deployment program in 2011 adhere to these fundamental principles, and we fully intend to adhere to these principles in 2012. Having said that, at this share price level, we see enormous value to be had in investing in NRG stock. 
Beyond these 3 top near-term priorities, we will continue to push our efforts to position NRG into first mover status in key areas that we believe have the potential to transform the energy business over the next several years. Time constraints preclude me from going into all these areas in too much detail right now, but I do want to expand the discussion and little bit more about our solar strategy. I do this in part because of the significant capital commitment that we had made to our solar program, depicted on Slide 6, during 2011. And I do this in part because it is inevitable that in the highly politicized, post-cylindrical [ph] world that we live in, you have probably already heard or read in the popular media a great deal about solar power that is distorted, misinterpreted or just flat-out wrong. So let me start with some basic facts that underpin our fast-moving and generally successful effort to be a leader in solar power generation in the United States. 
Fact #1. Solar generation is a domestic energy resource installed locally by American workers, built on the strength of American technological innovation and tapping into America's abundant solar resource, which for all practical purposes is inexhaustible. 
Fact #2. Solar generation, and particularly solar photovoltaic, puts less strain on other scarce commodities than any other form of power generation, particularly when it comes to what I like to call the big 3 of sustainability: freshwater, arable land and clean air. 
Fact #3. While solar is an intermittent resource, the sun is more reliable and predictable than the wind. And solar energy's availability is more coincident with the all-important peak summer load than the wind is. 
Fact #4. While large-scale solar power development in the United States has been very substantially assisted by a variety of federal government programs, beginning with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President George Bush, the primary driver for the U.S. solar industry has in fact been renewable energy portfolio standards enacted at the state level by red and blue states alike, led by California with its 33% renewable portfolio standard passed into law and signed by Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, which leads to my fifth and last fact about solar, and this by far the most important to us as a company. 
The price of solar panels, in particular, and of solar installations, more generally, is dropping like a stone. And for NRG, as probably the single largest consumer of solar panels in the United States, that is a very good thing. Moreover, we are convinced that the cost of solar installations is going to continue to drop precipitously both in absolute terms and relative to other forms of power generation. 
Most forms of power generation, including wind, depend on brute force in the form of thermal energy or kinetic energy to make electricity. Increased size equals increased scale. Certainly, the wind industry has followed this approach. But solar photovoltaic is different. Solar PV is in essence a nanotechnology. As such, we believe some offshoot of Moore's Law applies to solar photovoltaic technology. Call it, if you will, crane   solar corollary to Moore's Law, but we believe the delivered cost of energy from solar PV, which has been cut in half in the last 24 months, will be cut in half again in the next 24 months. The ramifications of this price trend will be far reaching. We will be in a situation where within 2 years the price of delivered power from solar installations will be able to undercut the retail price of grid power in roughly 20 states. Many of these high-priced retail states are in our core regions. This low-cost solar power installed in every increasing volumes on a distributed and semi-distributed basis in a way that obviates the need for a lot very long high-voltage transmission lines has the potential to revolutionize the hub-and-spoke power system, which currently makes up the American power industry. 
There's a perception of Wall Street investors that the solar industry is completely a creature of government financial largesse and market support. And that perception is largely true, but it's only true if you're looking backwards. As I've stated previously, our big 3 utility scale solar projects could not have occurred without the federal loan guarantee program and the California State renewable portfolio standard. And as all of us have seen over the years, when government rubs up against business, that the blessing of government support for any particular industry is inevitably followed by a curse when the government yanks away that support usually without warning, without reason and at a time when the industry can least afford it. 
But if we look forward, we see a solar industry that's going to trend strongly towards distributed and residential installation. And while market penetration for distributed and residential solar can, and should be, enhanced by enlightened government policies, the fact is that distributed and residential solar is a free-market construct. And solar energy at its present and certainly at its future price point will achieve explosive growth and substantial market share as a matter of consumer choice. 
NRG is positioning itself competitively through NRG Solar's warehouse group start program with [indiscernible] and the DOE and through its 3 retail electricity providers to lead this transformation and to secure the benefit of it for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."
413857,141930583,184238,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with a few highlights for the third quarter on Slide 9. Our available portfolio performed exceptionally well during the quarter, improving in both availability and reliability metrics as compared to",1324,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with a few highlights for the third quarter on Slide 9. Our available portfolio performed exceptionally well during the quarter, improving in both availability and reliability metrics as compared to the third quarter of 2010. On the commercial front, we increased our hedges in 2012 given the weak fundamentals we continue to see in the gas market. In October, the EPA released an update to the cash [indiscernible] increasing the allocation of allowances for the state where we operate. These changes provide us with greater flexibility for compliance as we continue to prepare for our 2012 start date. Also in the compliance front, we're in the process of integrating back-end controls at Indian River during the current fall outage and are on track to be fully operational by January 1, 2012. With respect to our growth projects, we began commercial operations for the 21-megawatt Roadrunner solar PV project this summer, ahead of schedule and under budget. The El Segundo combined cycle repowering project began construction and is on track to be in service by the summer of 2013. Last, our EPC organization continues to focus on supporting the solar buildout, which I will cover in more detail later in the presentation. 
Starting with safety on Slide 10. Starting with our top decile performance with an OSHA recordable rate of 0.75, with 38 out of 45 sites without a recordable injury this quarter. This quite remarkable given the extreme weather conditions that our operators experience at many of our sites and further demonstrates our safety culture. Net generation increased by 11% during the third quarter compared to 2010. This increase was driven primarily by higher generation in Texas due to the record heat and the additional cost of goods added into our central portfolio. This was partially offset by lower generation in the Northeast affected by lower power prices, higher coal-to-gas switching and milder weather in August. 
As I mentioned, our baseload fleet performed exceptionally well during the quarter with an availability factor of 95% and a forced outage rate of just 2%. FPPM Parish [ph] led the fleet with over 98% availability. Our gas fleet saw a significant increase in generation and number of starts. Overall, it performed well with some specific exceptions due to age and heavier cycling imposed in the end of this summer. 
Moving onto our retail operations on Slide 11. Despite August's extreme weather and volatile market prices, we're still on track to finish the year comfortably within our region in 2011 EBITDA guidance range. We continue to grow our residential segment with 34,000 additional customers since the end of 2010, demonstrating our ability to leverage our brand's strength while balancing margins in customer accounts. Reliant also delivered another quarterly lower bad debt expense, and our vast segment illustrating the power of scale back office capabilities and the strength of the Texas economy. 
On the residential segment, Reliant continued to differentiate itself through innovative solutions and the leader of real consumer value through applications and services based on the Smart Meter infrastructure. As a result, Reliant has increased customer account 3 quarters in a row with our e-Sense enrollment with 400,000 customers. Reliant will leverage this innovation along with its strong customer service platform as it is expanding to the Northeast and Midwest where we are now serving customers in 5 states. 
Our C&I segment remains the largest provider to business accounts in Texas, and our expansion to the Northeast is on target where we now serve over 2 terawatt hours. While the pricing dynamics in the sector remains very competitive, we will continue to be selective on transactions that deliver attractive margins, which are reflected in our business results for the quarter. This strong performance has enabled Reliant to be the largest retail provider in Texas while delivering strong customer satisfaction and achieving results that exceed our steady-state natural gas commitment of $400 million to $500 million. 
Turning to our cash profile in Slide 12. Our baseload portfolio is now mostly hedged for 2012, consistent with our view that natural gas fundamentals remain weak in the short term. For quite some time, our hedging philosophy has been to hedge output of our baseload portfolio with natural gas as a profit for power and keep the heat rate open given our bullish view particularly in the ERCOT market. We have benefited from the recent run-up in heat rates and believe that based on market fundamentals, there is more outside remaining. As we discussed in our last call, we have made some adjustments to our hedging strategy on the gas portfolio in Texas. We will maintain a portion of the peaking fleet on hedge to ensure we have a long biased position as we head into next year and to mitigate some of the operational risks embedded in our portfolio. As for the other side of our dock spread, we secured most of our 2012 coal requirement ahead of the cash per [ph] rules at attractive levels. We will continue to be opportunistic about adding incremental hedges given our significant open power position beyond 2012. 
Moving onto our market update on Slide 13. Texas fundamentals remain stronger during the third quarter. The line grew by healthy 2% and as you will know, ERCOT set new record peak loan of 68.3 gigawatts in August, implying a 4% actual operating reserve well below ERCOT's target level of 13.75%. 
On the supply side, the pipeline on generation projects in ERCOT is almost empty while forward heat [indiscernible] recently they still don't incentivize new regeneration and irrespective of gas prices there needs to be significant offset from current levels as indicated in the upper right chart. 
Recent proposed changes by ERCOT on the PUCT to support resource adequacy are a step in the right direction for we believe more is required to incentivize new generation. As you can see in the bottom right chart, here the coal prices coverage rates to pre-CSAPR levels after a short lead rally. We continue to believe that the compact wind in the market is not just applied given the current gas price environment and the more stringent environmental rules. 
Last in the Northeast we saw increasing coal-to-gas switching given low gas prices and relatively mild weather in August, as you can see in the bottom left chart where we show quarterly changes in generation from last year. We expect these dynamics to continue through 2012 and believe economic performance in the Northeast will continue to be challenged. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our EPC organization, who has been successfully managing over $1.4 billion of repowering an environmental retrofit projects, has been transitioning to support our solar efforts over the past 2 years. We are engaged with major contractors, solar suppliers and developers providing construction management and oversight services to our projects. Starting with Agua Caliente, the solar field is over 40% complete and the interconnection is now constructed and moving into the start-up phase. CVSR is off to a good start, and Ivanpah is well underway on Unit 1, where erection of the first solar receiver tower is progressing as planned, and Unit 2 has initiated work on the foundations of major equipment. We will continue to focus on supporting the development efforts of new projects like Borrego, Alpine and Avra Valley. 
So in closing, our base business portfolio is well positioned to benefit from higher fundamentals in the market particularly in Texas. All these gave us a glimpse of the potential market prices that we can expect, and as David mentioned, we are all focused in making the necessary adjustments to ensure we deliver the full potential of our integrated wholesale-retail model going forward. With that, combined with our repowering opportunities, solar growth plans and retail expansion, we expect to deliver healthy incremental value in our core regions. 
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."
413857,141930583,184238,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 16. NRG is reporting third quarter and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results of $458 million and $1.43 billion, respectively. Reliant Energy, which contributed $135 million of adjusted EBITD",1685,"Thank you Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 16. NRG is reporting third quarter and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results of $458 million and $1.43 billion, respectively. Reliant Energy, which contributed $135 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, reported its first year-over-year improvement in mass customer since our acquisition. Reliant's customer expansion, however, was partially offset by lower unit margins resulting to some degree from competitive offerings but in larger part as a result of increased energy costs. 
Meanwhile, NRG's wholesale business and $323 million of adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter. $183 million of this adjusted EBITDA came from our Texas region, which benefited from a 1.2 terawatt hour increase in generation versus the third quarter of 2010. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decreased $205 million, however, as increased baseload availability was eclipsed by a combination of lower baseload hedges and the August impact. In the Northeast region, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $47 million. The approximately $58 million decline versus the third quarter of 2010 was driven by lower hedge prices, decreased coal generation and a substantial decline in capacity revenues. These decreases were offset by lower operating costs and favorable equity earnings from GenConn Middletown, which came online in June of this year. 
The West asset had a very strong quarter, contributing $35 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is an increase of $10 million from the prior quarter -- prior year quarter as the region is contributing -- continue to realize increased volumes and favorable capacity prices in California. The South Central region delivered $44 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2011, which is a $5 million increase over the third quarter of 2010. Year-to-date 2011 adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.43 billion, and that was split between $462 million from Reliant and $968 million from wholesale. 
Reliant remains on track to exceed $550 million in EBITDA this year, and meanwhile the wholesale business benefited, growing 10% year-on-year increase in generation sold for 5.8 terawatt hours due in part to the acquired assets, including Cottonwood, South Trent and solar projects, which contributed 3.7 terawatt hours. Results were offset by lower energy prices, higher fuel and transport costs and lower capacity revenues. 
As we turn to capital allocation in 2011, during our second quarter conference call, as an advance on the 2012 capital allocation, we announced the $250 million increase to the 2011 share repurchase program, bringing the total planned 2011 repurchases to $430 million. To date, we have completed share repurchases of $378 million or $17.5 million shares and we anticipate completing the balance of $52 million of authorized share repurchases during the fourth quarter. During the year, we also reduced corporate debt by $577 million, better aligning our prudent balance sheet management objectives with 2011 financial performance. 
Now turning to the 2011 guidance on Slide 17. As David mentioned earlier, we are raising the lower end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $25 million to $1.8 billion, with the upper end of the range remaining at $1.85 billion. This improvement is largely a result of a strong September and healthy expectations for our retail businesses. 
And turning to free cash flow, we have revised our guidance for free cash flow before growth to a range of $800 million to $850 million. The decline in free cash flow guidance is due to an increase in cash collateral postings. 
Turning to 2011 growth investments on Slide 18. We now expect a total of $806 million in growth investments for 2011, which represents a $238 million increase over our August 4, 2011 guidance of $568 million. 
This increase was attributable almost exclusively to an acceleration of the timing of previously identified projects, in particular our solar projects. The $80 million increase in our expected conventional investments was driven by an acceleration of our investment in our El Segundo repowering project by $63 million, and that was in order to remain on schedule with construction despite a delay on the closing of the $540 million facility that I mentioned earlier. This will now result in the project being completed in 2013 without additional contributions from NRG. The $158 million increasing in our solar investments is also the result of an acceleration of spend at our Agua Caliente and CVSR projects. 
We've made significant strides over the last quarter in deploying capital to invest in NRG's future while maintaining a solid liquidity position as our total current liquidity is $1.9 billion, which you will see on Slide 19. As we anticipated the net reduction in our revolver availability is primarily due to the required posting of letters of credit to support our equity commitments to our 3 largest solar projects. As we make these equity investments over time, which I'll review with you shortly, these healthy postings will then be released to us dollar-for-dollar. In essence, as we have now closed on the bulk of our Tier 1 solar portfolio, our liquidity position now reflects the full effect of our equity commitments in these important projects. 
Turning to projected year in cash and cash equivalents, which will form the basis of our 2012 capital allocation program. Our projected year-end cash position is approximately $1.3 billion. Our projected year-end balance of $1.3 billion compares to approximately $1.9 billion, which was projected on our second quarter earnings call. The $600 million reduction in that expected cash is largely due to the $250 million acceleration of conventional on solar investments that I discussed on the prior slide, as well as the acquisition of Energy Plus for $193 million, which was closed on September 30 of this year. As we focus on capital allocation, the currently projected cash balance at the end of 2011 after deducting $700 million minimum cash we target for working capital will then form a key component of our 2012 Capital Allocation Plan. 
Turning to Slide 20. As David mentioned earlier, we're initiating 2012 guidance with a range representing an increase over our 2011 outlook, with consolidated 2012 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.82 billion to $2 billion. We expect an upswing in our wholesale business to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, thanks to the contribution from new assets, some of which include Agua Caliente, CVSR, Alpine, Roadrunner, as well as the anticipated expansion in heat rates in the ERCOT market. Also contributing to the uplift is an improvement in overall hedge prices across the portfolio, which is partially offset by lower natural gas prices and a continuation of lower capacity prices in the Northeast. Our retail outlook, which for 2012 now reflects our 3 distinct platforms, Reliant, Green Mountain Energy and the newly acquired Energy Plus, is for EBITDA in the range of $625 million the $700 million as we look to drive EBITDA growth by leveraging our 3 distinct retail companies. Our 2012 free cash flow before growth, which reflects components of operating cash flow not included in EBITDA, as well as the impact of our expected 2012 maintenance and environmental capital expenditures, remain strong with a range of between $800 million to $1 billion. These details are included in the appendix as part of our Reg G disclosure. 
Our free cash flow yield continues to demonstrate the attractiveness of our share price, which we will take advantage of us we repurchase another $52 million of shares in the fourth quarter. 
I've chosen to devote a separate slide for our 2012 growth investments in order to provide a bit more detail regarding this important component of our capital allocation strategy. On Slide 21, our committed growth investments are broken down into conventional and solar, as I discussed earlier. Importantly, we have termed these committed growth investments to reflect the projects to which we are either contractually committed, which represents the bulk of the items on Slide 21, or strategically committed for 2012. In addition, for those of investments to which we have commitments beyond 2012, I've also provided details regarding our expected investments in these future periods as we move closer to having all of these important projects online and contributing their full EBITDA potential. 
Our total 2012 expected growth investments are $825 million, which consist primarily of the big 3 solar projects. Beyond 2012, we have approximately $380 million of committed investments largely devoted to our Tier 1 solar portfolio. Agua Caliente now represents a significant portion of that amount and that does not reflect the benefit of a cash grant as this project currently requires DOE consent to apply for that grant. These growth investments should be offset by proceeds from our ongoing efforts to monetize a portion of these projects as we are now able to more fully focus attention and shift resources towards this initiative now that the important but time-consuming DOE process is behind us. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 22, our 2017 bond refinancing, which we expect to complete by the first quarter of 2012, represents the final step in creating significantly greater flexibility to allocate capital in an optimal manner. Our expected excess cash at year end is $600 million, which is net of targeted cash for working capital, combined with our 2012 free cash flow guidance of $800 million to $1 billion, implies $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of expected cash available for committed growth in capital allocation in 2012. We expect to allocate $825 million of this cash towards committed growth investments in 2012 as you will recall from the prior slide. And this amount is largely comprised of continued equity funding for our big 3 solar projects. The $575 million to $775 million, which remains is the amount of cash we expect to have available data to allocate among share repurchases, debt pay downs and future growth initiatives, including the potential opportunity to accelerate perhaps a small portion of our currently committed growth investments from 2013 into 2012 if we are able to achieve higher returns and earlier commercial operation results. We expect to provide greater detail regarding the 2012 capital allocation program on our February earnings call. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks."

That's the type of company we are, so we're not walking away from that part of the industry. But what I would say to you is I think for a large, very large utility-sized solar, I'm sure they will come a day when we see another wave of 300-plus megawatt and large solar projects. But these projects are more than $1 billion projects and without federal loan guarantees, there's not that much Wall Street money to provide the debt on that. So I think that the utility-scale solar world is going to sort of drop back to 20 to 100-megawatt size deals, and we're going to pursue that aggressively. But what I'm trying to signal is that I think that, that's not the only solar world. And I think over time the distributed residential is going to end up sort of swapping the big-scale projects. So we'll stay in the utility sized space, but I just what the market to know that we're positioning ourselves hard to take advantage of the opportunity we see on the distributed and the residential side."

I would say that we have this communication internally all the time. Because I end up talking a lot of these new business areas doesn't mean that we're going to ignore the conventional business. In fact, I've said for years and years long before NRG got involved in the renewables business that I thought the natural people to be in the renewables business were people who were actually in the conventional business. So we're not afraid of owning conventional generation. We're very proud of our coal plants, the way they operate environmentally and everything. What I would tell you is just a couple of things. One, is we would definitely like to own more generation in the Northeast. We've said that for years now. We have not been successful to be able to acquire generation at prices that we thought made sense. We would not shy away. I mean, we already own coal plants both in the Northeastern Texas, so whether we own more or not, we don't think that really changes what the company is about. But the main thing I would tell you right now is the economics of coal plants in the Northeast are just phenomenally challenged right now. And I don't know -- we are being as assertive with asset management as one can be with our own coal plants, and it's not a pretty picture. And so if we were to buy coal plants in the Northeast, I'm pretty confident that other people are looking at the same sort of numbers that we're looking at. And to be frank, most of those numbers have parentheticals around them. And so I would say that we would be interested in looking at coal plants in the Northeast, but the price would have to reflect the value. And I think we've referred to it. I mean, it's almost an option value play. So I guess that's what I would tell you."
