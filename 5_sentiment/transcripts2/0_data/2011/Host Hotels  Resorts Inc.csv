Thinking back to our and industry's outlook on 2010 last February, it is hard not to be pleased with how this year played out. We were able to accomplish some exciting transactions during the year, and while the economy presented challenges especially in the first half of the year, we were happy to see the recovery happened faster and stronger than we originally expected. 
However, before I get into the detail of our 2010 operating results, I'd like to highlight several of our accomplishments for the year. We closed approximately $500 million in acquisition by purchasing the W New York Union Square, Westin Chicago River North, the Meridien Piccadilly in London and the JW Marriott Hotel Rio de Janeiro, announced acquisitions in New York, New Zealand and San Diego totaling more than an incremental $1 billion. History has demonstrated that early cycle acquisitions tend to add value, and we're acting on that premise. 
In addition to the investments I just noted, we also reached an agreement to develop seven hotels and three major cities in India through our Asia joint venture. We also purchased the junior tranches with the par value of approximately $64 million of a mortgage loan secured by a 1,900-room portfolio hotel in Europe. The notes were purchased at a meaningful discount. The underlying assets are performing above expectation. 
For the year, we invested a total of $114 million in return on investment capital projects including the development of the new 23,000 square foot ballroom and outdoor venue space at the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa, new meeting space at the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott and new restaurants at the Hyatt Maui, Harbor Beach Marriott, Westin LAX and Ritz-Carlton Hotel. We continue to find construction pricing attractive and expect the investment to yield returns substantially in excess of our cost to capital. 
We also continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet. On that front, the combination of over $400 million of the equity issuance to fund our investment program, the repayment of several debt instruments in preferred stock and the successful placement of $500 million of senior notes bearing interest at 6%, we do our average interest rate by 0.04% to 6.2% and increase our coverage ratio by more than 15%. 
Now let's review the results for the quarter and the year. Fourth quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 6.2% driven by an increase in average room rate of 2.8% and an increase in occupancy of 2.2 percentage points. For the full year, comparable RevPAR increased 5.8% to $120 as a result of a 3.8 percentage point increase in occupancy and a slight increase in average rate. Our average rate for the year for our comparable hotels was $171 per night. Our average occupancy was 70%. Food and beverage revenues on our comparable hotels increased 4.8% for the quarter primarily because banquet revenues increased over 7% as groups upgraded their catering spend. For the year, food and beverage revenue increased 4.5%. 
Comparable hotel-adjusted operating profit margins increased 110 basis points for the fourth quarter and 20 basis points for the year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $286 million for the quarter and $824 million for the full year. Our FFO per diluted share was $0.26 for the fourth quarter and $0.68 for the full year. FFO per diluted share was negatively impacted by $0.02 of the quarter and $0.06 for the full year by debt extinguishment and acquisition cost associated with successful transactions. Since our guidance in October did not foresee these costs in the fourth quarter, adjusting for these items indicate that our FFO results exceeded the high-end of our guidance. 
Consistent with the trends we've been seeing all year, we continue to benefit from positive demand growth in the fourth quarter as our number of rooms sold increased by more than 3%. More importantly, for the second quarter in a row, we recorded a note roll increase in average rate driven by both the shift to higher-rated Transient business segment and actual rate increases. 
Similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, our Transient revenue growth of 6.3% was driven by a nearly 5% increase In Transient rate, as transient room nights was now in pre-2007 levels, increased slightly more than 1%. The improvement in ADR was driven by the Premium and Corporate segments where rates increased by almost 7%. When combined with the demand increase of 6%, these segments saw revenue increase of more than 13%. For the year, the Premium and Corporate segments are all balanced combination of demand in rate growth leading to an 11% revenue improvement. Demand in our Special Corporate segment was significantly up for the year, leading to strong revenue growth of 27%. 
Reflecting our operators efforts to shift business out of lower-rated segments, our discount room nights declined by more than 3% and our revenues in this category fell slightly. This trend accelerated in the second half of the year as our operating environment improves. While our full year transient demand matches 2007 levels, ADR is still more than 15% below the prior peak indicating a meaningful opportunity for additional rate growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Turning to our Group business. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our Group room nights were up more than 6% as increases in our Corporate and other segments more than offset a slight decline in Association business. Average rate was slightly better than the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in an overall Group revenue increase of 6.2%. We experienced the demand increase of over 11% in our higher-rated Corporate Group business and a rate increase of more than 3%. Recovery in the Luxury segment continues to gain momentum as our Luxury Group room nights were up more than 15%. For the full year, our Group bookings were up almost 7% and rate was down 3%, although ADR did increase in the second half of the year. Compared to 2007, our Group room revenues are still down by 19%, and our Corporate room nights are down by 1/3. We would expect to close both of these gaps over the next few years. 
Looking at 2011, we would expect that revenue growth will be driven by a combination of both occupancy and rate increases. It is worth noting that despite the nearly four-point increase in occupancy we experienced this year, we are still four points below our prior occupancy levels at 74%, so we expect to see increases in occupancy in both our Group and Transient segments. However, reflecting the trends we've enjoyed over the last six months, we would expect to see a meaningful portion of our RevPAR growth would be generated from ADR growth due to both actual pricing increases and segment shifts. 
Our booking activity in the fourth quarter was exceptionally strong, and we started the year in a far but better position than 2010 as Group bookings through the first three quarters of the year were up more than 3.5% versus a decline of roughly 6% last year. More importantly, our average rate per existing Group bookings exceeds 2010 in every quarter. We expect we will see booking pace improve as the year progresses and that activity at the higher-rated categories will increase. 
On the investment front, as we announced this morning, we signed an agreement to purchase the 1,625 room Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego Hotel for $570 million. The hotel has a premier waterfront location and is close to the city's central business district and convention center. The hotel is the premier meeting platform in the market, providing approximately 125,000 square foot of meeting space including a 34,000 square foot finished exhibit hall and a 30,000 square foot ballroom. With its location adjacent to our San Diego Mariott Marina Hotel, we expect to see revenue and expect synergies from both of these hotels. 
In January, we announced that we had signed an agreement of 775-room New York Helmsley Hotel for approximately $313 million. The property will be managed by Starwood initially as an unbranded hotel. As part of the comprehensive renovation costing approximately $65 million, the guest rooms and guest beds should be completely renovated, a few rooms will be added to the inventory and a meeting space will be upgraded. When the renovations are complete in early- to mid-2012, the property will be branded as the Westin. This will only be the second Westin in Manhattan, and we believe that the hotel will benefit greatly from both the brand change and from becoming a part of the Starwood system. While the hotel will benefit from Starwood's management and reservation system as an unbranded hotel, the EBITDA generated from this hotel in 2011 prior to its conversion will likely be in the $5 million to $6 million range as results will be negatively impacted during the renovation process. Once the renovations are complete and hotels converted to the Westin brand, we expect to see EBITDA results in the low- to mid-$30 million rage in the first full year of operations as a branded hotel. 
This past quarter, we also finalized our purchase agreement for seven hotels in New Zealand with over 1,200 rooms at a price of $145 million. The hotels are located in the country's main commercial and tourist centers and will be operated by Accor Hotels, one of the largest operators in New Zealand. This is our first acquisition in New Zealand, and we expect the transaction to close in the very near term. 
As you know, attractive acquisition opportunities increased in the second half of 2010, and we expect 2011 will continue to be an active environment. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are in a great position to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. In the U.S. and Europe, our goal is to acquire assets at a discount to replacement cost while achieving investment yields in excess of our cost of capital. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities and expect that we will purchase during 2011. With that being said, recognizing the unpredictability of the timing of completing acquisitions, our guidance today does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. 
In 2011, we expect to spend approximately $290 million to $310 million on ROI and repositioning investments. Some of this year's projects are a continuation of work started in 2010, including the San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina, where we are renovating all the guest rooms, a full fitness center and developing an expanded new meeting space and exhibit hall platform.  
At the Sheridan Hotel New York & Towers, we are continuing construction efforts that we started in December, which include major mechanical AC upgrades, as well as the comprehensive room renovation. This project will be done in two stages with a file completion date of mid-2012. We are also completely renovating and repositioning three hotels, the Chicago O'Hare Marriott, the Sheraton Indianapolis and Atlanta Perimeter Marriott. In each systems, we are completing comprehensive room renovations, materially reconstructing the lobby and food and beverage outlet and reducing the room count with a goal of generating significant improvement and operating results. 
In the case of the Sheridan, we expect to convert a tower of the rooms to rental apartment. And in the case of the Atlanta Perimeter Marriott, the room reduction is necessitated by a condemnation proceeding, which generated more than $11 million and which will be deployed to fund the material part of the renovation. 
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $195 million in 2010 and expect to spend $260 million to $280 million in 2011. 2011 plan includes room renovation of the New York Marriott Marquis, the Philadelphia Marriott and JW Marriott, as well as meeting space renovations at the Hyatt Washington, Sheraton Boston, New York Marquis and New Orleans Marriott. 
While the disposition market has improved, we are seeing challenges for chain especially in the secondary and tertiary markets as lenders are more apt to focus on lending in primary market. 
While we are actively reviewing our portfolio for likely sale candidate, we expect the volume of our asset builds to be late in 2011. However, we will be monitoring the pricing of transactions in the market and hope to accelerate our dispositions later in the year. At this point, our guidance does not assume any dispositions. 
Now let me elaborate on our outlook for 2011. In general, economic indicators present a favorable picture for 2011, especially compared to where we were a year ago. Business investment, a key indicator for our industry, is expected to increase 9% this year, and GDP growth is expected to be over 3% both in 2011 and 2012. These factors, combined with some improvement in employment, bode well for lodging demand. As managers more actively focus on increasing rate and shifting business mix away from the lower-rated segments to higher-rated group and transient demand, RevPAR growth will be increasingly driven by rate growth, which better drops to the bottom line. With all this in mind, we're expecting comparable hotel RevPAR to increase 6% to 8% for the year with adjusted margins increasing 100 to 140 basis points. This operating forecast combined with our recent acquisition activity will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.035 billion and earnings per share reaching $0.87 to $0.92. 
Turning to our dividend. We are forecasting our first quarter common dividend of $0.02 per share. As our operations continue to improve, we expect modest increase to common dividend through the year with the expectation of a full year common dividend of $0.10 to $0.10 per share. I am pleased to say that the lodging recovery is continuing to progress well. We remain in the early stages at this point, and we believe it is possible to gain momentum. The business travelers are returning in greater numbers as supply over the next couple of years will be at historically low levels and well below demand growth. The combination of strong demand and low supply should lead to a solid and sustained recovery. Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Our top-performing market for the fourth quarter was Atlanta with a RevPAR increase of 22.5%. Strong Citywide and Transient business contributed to an occupancy increase of over nine percentage points. The incremental demand and related compression led to a 5% improvement in ADR. We expect RevPAR in Atlanta to underperform our portfolio in 2011 even with an overall improvement in Group, Business and Special Corporate pricing, as well as a mix shift. 
As expected, our San Diego hotels had a great quarter with a RevPAR increase of 16.8%, driven by an occupancy improvement of over nine percentage points as both Transient and Group demand improved significantly and ADR increased slightly. For 2011, we expect our San Diego hotels to outperform the portfolio due to overall improvement in Transient and Group demand and ADR growth. 
The Chicago market continued to perform well with a 12.1% improvement in RevPAR. Although citywide events were flat to last year, the timing of events in 2010 and good business transient demand facilitated a strong RevPAR growth. Occupancy increased over four percentage points and ADR improved over 5% as our hotels benefited from a positive shift in our Transient mix of business. We expect the Chicago market to outperform the portfolio in 2011 due to strong Group and Transient demand, as well as a further positive shift in mix, which will increase ADR. 
Our San Francisco hotels had another excellent quarter with a RevPAR increase of 11.5%, as ADR increased over 7% and occupancy increased nearly three percentage points. Both Group and Transient demand were strong allowing the hotels to yield rate. We expect the San Francisco market to perform in line with our portfolio in 2011 through improvement in Citywide and Corporate Group demand and ADR gains due to the related compression. 
Our San Antonio hotels had a very good quarter with RevPAR increasing 9.8% as rate increased over 5% and occupancy improved 2.5 percentage points. The outperformance was due to strong Citywide and Corporate Group demand. We were expecting even better performance when the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter was undergoing a robust renovation that was more disruptive than anticipated. We expect our San Antonio hotels to outperform the portfolio of 2011 because of improvements in overall demand. 
RevPAR at our Hawaiian hotels increased 5.2%, which was well below our expectation as the renovations at two of our hotels affected operating results, particularly at the Fairmont Kea Lani. Occupancy improved more than nine percentage points, however, ADR fell 9%. The bulk of the demand increase was in Discount, Transient and Group business. Airline capacity continues to increase, and we expect Hawaii to be one of our top-performing markets in 2011 due to improvements in both Group and Transient demand, which should also drive some pricing power. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels only increased 2.3% due to a significant decrease in citywide demand and the renovation that we have in Boston. Occupancy declined nearly two percentage points while rate increased almost 5%. Our Boston hotels are expected to underperform the portfolio in 2011 due to less citywide demand. 
Our Phoenix hotels have struggled since 2007. Fourth quarter RevPAR increased only slightly due to construction of a new ballroom at the Westin Kierland, which was completed in early January. However, we expect our Phoenix hotels to turn the corner in 2011 and outperform our portfolio. Both Group and Transient demand are expected to increase significantly. 
Lastly, our two worst markets for the fourth quarter were Philadelphia and Orlando. Philadelphia's RevPAR fell 7.2% primarily due to a decrease in citywide events and a disruption from the renovation of the ballroom and rooms at the Philadelphia Downtown Marriott. Citywide demand for 2011 is strong, and improvement in ADR is expected, but the renovation will limit available capacity, and as a result, the hotel will underperform the portfolio. RevPAR for the Orlando World Center Marriot fell 2.1% in the quarter primarily due to displacement from the rooms renovation in a difficult comparison to the fourth quarter of 2009. the hotels to significantly outperform the portfolio due to higher levels of Group demand. That hotel is expected to slightly underperform the portfolio in 2011. 
For the year, our top three markets were Boston, with a RevPAR increased 11.6%; New Orleans with a RevPAR improvement of 11.2%; and New York with a RevPAR increase of 9.5%. The Phoenix market where RevPAR declined 3.9% and the Tampa market with a decrease of 1.6% were our weakest performers. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 13.1% for the quarter as eight of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases. For the year, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 8.5%. We expect the European joint venture portfolio will have RevPAR growth of 5% to 7% for 2011. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins from our comparable hotels increased 110 basis points, which were reduced by 50 basis points for incremental property-level bonus expense. Rooms flow-through were strong for the quarter at nearly 76% due to benefits from the ADR increase and productivity improvements, which resulted in a relatively low 1.2% increase in wages and benefits on a pro-occupied room basis. Food and beverage flow-through was excellent at over 53% and much better than expected due to an increase in higher-margin banquet and audiovisual revenues, good cost control and improvements in productivity. 
Unallocated costs increased 4.7% for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster-and-share service allocations. Utility cost increased only 1.4% and property taxes declined 8.4%. 
Looking forward in 2011, we expect the RevPAR increase to be driven more by rate growth in occupancy. The additional rate growth lead the strong rooms flow-through even with growth and wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increasing group demand, as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid F&D flow-through. 
We expect unallocated cost to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, which we expect higher growth due to an increase in rates and volume and as well as sales and marketing cost. We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation. As a result, we expect comparable hotel-adjusted operating profit margins to increase 100 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 140 basis points at the high-end of the range. 
During the quarter, we raised approximately $248 million under our continuous equity offering program to fund future acquisitions. We also issued $500 million of senior notes that bear interest at 6% and have a 10-year maturity. These notes have a lowest coupon of any bond we have ever issued. We used some of the bond proceeds to redeem $250 million of our 7 1/8% Series K senior notes. During the quarter, we repaid $150 million mortgage on the W Union Square to $71 million mortgage on the JW Marriott Desert Springs and $54 million of the $300 million mortgage on the Orlando World Center Marriot, which allowed us to extend the maturity date by two years to July of 2013. Of our 113 consolidated hotels, 102 of them do not have mortgage debt. At this point, we have only one maturity in 2011, the $129 million loan on our four Canadian hotels. 
Our credit facility matures in September this year, but we have the right to extend the facility to September of 2012 as long as our leverage level is below the 7.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. After closing on all of the acquisitions that Ed detailed, we will have an excess of $200 million in cash and $542 million of available capacity on our credit facility. 
I wanted to mention two more items prior to starting the question-and-answer session. The first is the change to our income taxes for 2011. Due to the significance of the downturn, our tax for lease subsidiary incurred a substantial book loss, primarily due to negative lease leakage, which resulted in our recording a $32 million tax benefit in 2010. The anticipated significant improvement in operating results should lead to a substantial improvement in lease leakage and as a result, we are projecting a tax provision for 2011. This translates into roughly $0.04 per share reduction in FFO for 2011. 
Finally, starting in 2011, we are modifying our definition of adjusted EBITDA to no longer deduct acquisition cost for successful transactions. Prior to January 1, 2009, the accounting rules of our company to capitalize such cost and depreciate them over the life of the asset. Under the current accounting rules, these costs might be expensed as incurred. We believe that these costs should not be deducted from adjusted EBITDA because it would not reflect the ongoing performance of our portfolio. For 2010, we incurred $10 million of successful acquisition costs that decreased our adjusted EBITDA to arrive at the $824 million number. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

We certainly think it's always tricky to try to calculating exactly this disruption from this sort of process is going to be. And frankly, we were a little surprised by the level of disruptions that we experienced in the fourth quarter and feel that probably cut our RevPAR growth in Q4 of 2010 by 1 point to 1.5. As we think about it more though in the context of 2011, we've done the best job that we could to anticipate what the impact would be. I think that some of the spending is a little bit more concentrated this year in some of our larger hotels, but we hopefully have it occurring during the times of the year where it would be less impactful."

I guess first thing as it relates to San Diego Hyatt -- I guess as it relates to the color around the transaction there, we have probably looked at this hotel off and on for probably the last three or four years. The price that we've ended up acquiring it for is the lowest price that I think we ever evaluated the hotel, certainly the lowest price we've seen in the last several years. And certainly there were others that have made progress on the transaction but ultimately did not close. I think that there was a pretty active -- despite the size of the transaction, I think it was intriguing that there were a fair amount of people that were interested in buying the hotel because I think they, like us, recognized that it was a great asset, in a great location, in a great market. We see San Diego as one of the great markets of the country going forward. I think they also recognize that at this price, you're probably buying it more than 20% discount to what it would cost to replace the asset. So I think there we were ultimately very happy with the acquisition that we were able to complete. I will tell you that if you watch what happen with the hotel over the course of the year, we did find that while the San Diego market, like several others, have a little bit of a blip in the summer, especially beginning part of the summer and perhaps at one point had fallen short of some of its initial projections and initial hope. The reality is that the asset rallied strongly over the course of the fourth quarter. And so we were pleasantly surprised to see the numbers in the full year coming in better than we what we had originally looked at when we first started to look at the asset."

In general, we feel that the bulk of the demand growth that we're going to see throughout Asia will probably be more in those price points than necessarily in the higher price point. And as a result, that's one of the reasons why the New Zealand acquisition is targeted in the way that it is.

I think Larry gave you a sense in his prepared comments of some of the areas where we thought expenses might trend above inflation. The big focus this year on the whole expense side is going to be tried to minimize expense growth as we work our way through the recovery, and the bulk of that is going to happen by trying to very carefully manage headcount. We want to make certain that when people have started to take on multiple functions and when operators the number of managers that they might have had an individual hotel, that we only restore at the level that it's required to reduce support the additional volume, meaning additional customers and additional room nights, as opposed to just because things got better. So I think generally, we generally see expenses as being in line. There is some places where we're going to run higher than inflation. But overall, I think our margin guidance, frankly, suggest that we feel like we should suffer some of the problems that we had in 2010 where you saw bonus expense coming back in and things like that, where you end up with less production or less benefit out of revenue growth and because expenses are rising faster than they normally would.

Liquidity -- the part of the reason why we maintain a higher amount of cash before was in part because liquidity has become so uncertain in our industry that  just couldn't have the confidence that you can access the debt market to the extent that you need it to raise capital. And frankly, at some points in time over the course of the downturn, I had some concerns about whether or not when it's going to stop falling, and so you couldn't necessarily rely on your credit facility without running the risk of potentially seeing a covenant to fall. Our world right now is a lot different. I mean we can access the capital quite good especially for a company like Host into those markets is certainly an easy source of capital for us as we look to access additional debt capital. And we have our credit facility, as Larry detailed, has another -- we should easily qualify for the extension to take us into 2012. And I think our sense is that while pricing might turn out to be a bit more expensive than the deal we negotiated back in '06 or '07, which where we had inside 100 basis points in terms of our cost of funds under our credit facility, we'll still be able to negotiate a new credit facility going forward. So when you take all of that into play and look at the general significant improvement in the liquidity situation, for us to have $200 million of capital available or $200 million of cash available is more than enough."

The structure of our consideration does include some level, relatively small level, of common and preferred operating partnership units, which are a part of just past structuring Manchester Group is doing, but it doesn't involve any continued ownership in the asset. It ultimately, in our case, came out as a fairly straightforward transaction."

I think some of it -- there are probably scenarios whereby soliciting vendors and presenting that opportunity to very efficiently serve two large hotels, when put these two hotels together, working at 3,000 rooms. There should be some ability to attract some better pricing. In some ways where we see the bigger opportunity will come on the revenue side, not dissimilar for what we've been able to work out in Boston where we owned both the Marriott and the Sheridan at the Hyatt Center. We have found that once you have common ownership, they're still going to run themselves, they're still going to market themselves independently because they're run by different operators. The reality is putting an umbrella of common ownership over two large great hotels like this will allow them to better coordinate some of their activities. And so I think what will get out of that is we'll have the ability to compete -- again, the 3,000 rooms we can compete with anybody including Vegas. So we'll have the ability to compete for business in maybe a more direct manner than we have in the past. And I also think what we get is a higher level of cooperation between the hotels is they're dealing with an opportunity with a group in either side. There's probably a little bit more of willingness to share that, recognizing that ultimately that it's a common owner that's going to benefit from it. I think it is one of the unique opportunities that this asset presented to us. Because as I said before, we really like the market, and we think we significantly strengthened our position in that market."

Thinking back to our and the industry's outlook on 2010 last February, it is hard not to be pleased with how this year played out. We were able to accomplish some exciting transactions during the year. And while the economy presented challenges especially in the first half of the year, we were happy to see this enlarging [ph] recovery happen faster and stronger than we originally expected. 
However, before I get into the detail of our 2010 operating results, I'd like to highlight several of our accomplishments for the year. We closed approximately $500 million in acquisition by purchasing the W New York Union Square, Westin Chicago River North, the Meridien Piccadilly in London and the JW Marriott Hotel Rio de Janeiro, and announced acquisitions in New York, New Zealand and San Diego totaling more than an incremental $1 billion. History has demonstrated that early cycle acquisitions tend to add the best value, and we are acting on that premise. 
In addition to the investments I just noted, we also reached an agreement to develop seven hotels in three major cities in India through our Asia joint venture. We also purchased the junior tranches with a par value of approximately $64 million of a mortgage loan secured by a 1,900-room portfolio of hotels in Europe. The notes were purchased at a meaningful discount. The underlying assets are performing above expectations. 
For the year, we invested a total of $114 million in return on investment capital projects including the development of a new 26,000 square foot ballroom and outdoor venue space with the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa, new meeting space at the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott and new restaurants at the Hyatt Maui, Harbor Beach Marriott, Westin LAX and Tysons Ritz-Carlton Hotel. We continue to find construction pricing attractive and expect these investments to yield returns substantially in excess of our cost to capital. 
We also continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet. On that front, the combination of over $400 million of equity issuance to fund our investment program, the repayment of several debt instruments and preferred stocks and the successful placement of $500 million of senior notes bearing interest at 6%, we do start our average interest rates by 0.04% to 6.2% and increase our coverage ratio by more than 15%. 
Now let's review the results for the quarter and the year. Fourth quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 6.2% driven by an increase in average room rate of 2.8% and an increase in occupancy of 2.2 percentage points. For the full year, comparable RevPAR increased 5.8% to $120 as a result of a 3.8 percentage point increase in occupancy and a slight increase in average rates. Our average rate for the year for our comparable hotels was $171 per night. Our average occupancy was 70%. Food and beverage revenues on our comparable hotels increased 4.8% for the quarter, primarily because banquet revenues increased over 7% as groups upgraded their catering spends. For the year, food and beverage revenues increased 4.5%. 
Comparable hotel-adjusted operating profit margins increased 110 basis points for the fourth quarter and 20 basis points for the year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $286 million for the quarter and $824 million for the full year.
Our FFO per diluted share was $0.26 for the fourth quarter and $0.68 for the full year. FFO per diluted share was negatively impacted by $0.02 for the quarter and $0.06 for the full year by debt extinguishments and acquisition cost associated with the successful transactions. Since our guidance in October did not foresee these costs in the fourth quarter, adjusting for these items indicate that our FFO results exceeded the high end of our guidance. 
Consistent with the trends we've been seeing all year, we continue to benefit from positive demand growth in the fourth quarter as our number of rooms sold increased by more than 3%. More importantly, for the second quarter in a row, we recorded an overall increase in average rate driven by both the shift to higher-rated Transient business segment and actual rate increases. 
Similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, our transient revenue growth of 6.3% was driven by a nearly 5% increase In transient rate, as transient room nights, which now exceed2007 levels, increased slightly more than 1%. The improvement in ADR was driven by the Premium and Corporate segments where rate increased by almost 7%. When combined with the demand increase of 6%, these segments saw a revenue increase of more than 13%. For the year, the Premium and Corporate segments are a balanced combination of demand in rate growth leading to an 11% revenue improvement. Demand in our Special Corporate segment was significantly up for the year, leading to strong revenue growth of 27%. 
Reflecting our operators efforts to shift business out of lower-rated segments, our discount room nights declined by more than 3% and revenues in this category fell slightly. This trend accelerated in the second half of the year as our operating environment improves. While our full year transient demand matches 2007 level, ADR is still more than 16% below the prior peak indicating a meaningful opportunity for additional rate growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Turning to our Group business. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our group room nights were up more than 6% as increases in our Corporate and other segments more than offset the slight decline in Association business. Average rate was slightly better than the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in an overall group revenue increase of 6.2%. We experienced the demand increase of over 11% in our higher-rated Corporate Group business and a rate increase of more than 3%. Recovery in the Luxury segment continues to gain momentum as our Luxury Group room nights were up more than 15%. For the full year, our group bookings were up almost 7% and rate was down 3%, although ADR did increase in the second half of the year. Compared to 2007, our group room revenues are still down by 19%, and our Corporate room nights are down by 1/3. We would expect to close both of these gaps over the next few years. 
Looking at 2011, we would expect that revenue growth will be driven by a combination of both occupancy and rate increases. It is worth noting that despite the nearly four-point increase in occupancy we experienced this year, we are still four points below our prior stabilized occupancy level of 74%, so we expect to see increases in occupancy in both our Group and Transient segments. However, reflecting the trends we've enjoyed over the last six months, we would expect to see a meaningful portion of our RevPAR growth would be generated from ADR growth due to both actual pricing increases and segment shifts. 
Our booking activity in the fourth quarter was exceptionally strong, and we've started the year in a far better position than 2010 as group bookings through the first three quarters of the year were up by more than 3.5% versus a decline of roughly 6% last year. More importantly, our average rate per existing group bookings exceeds 2010 in every quarter. We expect we will see booking pace to improve as the year progresses and that activity in the higher-rated categories will increase. 
On the investment front, as we announced this morning, we signed an agreement to purchase the 1,625-room Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego Hotel for $570 million. The hotel has a premier waterfront location and is close to the city's central business district and Convention Center. The hotel is the premier meeting platform in the market, providing approximately 125,000 square foot of meeting space including a 34,000 square foot finished exhibit hall and a 30,000 square foot ballroom. With its location adjacent to our San Diego Mariott Marina Hotel, we expect to see revenue and expense synergies from both of these hotels. 
In January, we announced that we have signed an agreement to purchase the 775-room New York Helmsley Hotel for approximately $313 million. The property will be managed by Starwood initially as an unbranded hotel. As part of a comprehensive renovation costing approximately $65 million, the guest rooms and guest beds will be completely renovated, a few rooms will be added to the inventory and the meeting space will be upgraded. When the renovations are complete in early to mid-2012, the property will be branded as the Westin. This will only be the second Westin in Manhattan, and we believe that the hotel will benefit greatly from both the brand change and from becoming part of the Starwood system. While the hotel will benefit from Starwood's management and reservation system as an unbranded hotel, the EBITDA generated from this hotel in 2011 prior to its conversion will likely be in the $5 million to $6 million range as results will be negatively impacted during the renovation process. Once the renovations are complete and the hotel is converted to the Westin brand, we expect to see EBITDA results in the low- to mid-$30 million range for the first full year of operations as a branded hotel. 
This past quarter, we also finalized our purchase agreement for seven hotels in New Zealand with over 1,200 rooms at a price of $145 million. The hotels are located in the country's main commercial and tourist centers and will be operated by Accor Hotels, one of the largest operators in New Zealand. This is our first acquisition in New Zealand, and we expect the transaction to close in the very near term. 
As you know, attractive acquisition opportunities increased in the second half of 2010 and we expect 2011 will continue to be an active environment. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are in a great position to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. In the U.S. and Europe, our goal is to acquire assets at a discount to replacement cost while achieving investment yields in excess of our cost of capital. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities and expect that we will purchase additional hotels during 2011. With that being said, recognizing the unpredictability of the timing of completing acquisitions, our guidance today does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. 
In 2011, we expect to spend approximately $290 million to $310 million on ROI and repositioning investments. Some of this year's projects are a continuation of works started in 2010, including the San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina, where we are renovating all the guest rooms, the full fitness center and developing an expanded new meeting space and exhibit hall platform.  
At the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, we are continuing construction efforts that we started in December which include major mechanical AC/HC upgrades, as well as a comprehensive room renovation. This project will be done in two stages with a final completion date of mid-2012. 
We are also completely renovating and repositioning three hotels, the Chicago O'Hare Marriott, the Sheraton Indianapolis and the Atlanta Perimeter Marriott. In each instance, we are completing comprehensive room renovations, materially reconstructing the lobby and food and beverage outlets and reducing the room count with the goal of generating significant improvement in operating results. 
In the case of the Sheraton, we expect to convert a tower of the rooms to rental apartment. And in the case of the Atlanta Perimeter Marriott, the room count reduction is necessitated by a condemnation proceeding which generated more than $11 million and which will be deployed to fund the material part of the renovation. 
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $195 million in 2010 and expect to spend $260 million to $280 million in 2011. 2011 plan includes room renovation at the New York Marriott Marquis, the Philadelphia Marriott and JW Desert Springs Marriott, as well as meeting space renovations at the Hyatt Washington, Sheraton Boston, New York Marquis and New Orleans Marriott. 
While the disposition market has improved, we are seeing challenges for buying or obtaining debt especially in the secondary and tertiary markets as lenders are more apt to focus on lending in primary market. 
While we are actively reviewing our portfolio for likely sale candidates, we expect the volume of our asset builds to be late in 2011. However, we will be monitoring the pricing of transactions in the market and hope to accelerate our dispositions later in the year. At this point, our guidance does not assume any dispositions. 
Now let me elaborate on our outlook for 2011. In general, economic indicators present a favorable picture for 2011, especially compared to where we were a year ago. Business investment, a key indicator for our industry, is expected to increase 9% this year, and GDP growth is expected to be over 3% both in 2011 and 2012. These factors, combined with some improvement in employment, bode well for lodging demand. As managers more actively focus on increasing rate and shifting business mix away from the lower-rated segments to higher-rated group and transient demand, RevPAR growth will be increasingly driven by rate growth, which better drops to the bottom line. With all this in mind, we're expecting comparable hotel RevPAR to increase 6% to 8% for the year with adjusted margins increasing 100 to 140 basis points. This operating forecast combined with our recent acquisition activity will result in adjusted EBIT of $1 billion to $1.035 billion and FFO per share of $0.87 to $0.92. 
Turning to our dividends. We are forecasting our first quarter common dividend to be $0.02 per share. As our operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increase the common dividend through the year with the expectation of a full year common dividend of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. 
I am pleased to say that the lodging recovery is continuing to progress well. We remain in the early stages at this point and believe this positive cycle will continue to gain momentum. The business travelers are returning in greater numbers and supply over the next couple of years will be at historically low level and well below demand growth. The combination of strong demand and low supply should lead to a solid and sustained recovery. 
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Our top-performing market for the fourth quarter was Atlanta with a RevPAR increase of 22.5%. Strong citywide and transient business contributed to an occupancy increase of over nine percentage points. The incremental demand and related compression led to a 5% improvement in ADR. We expect RevPAR in Atlanta to underperform our portfolio in 2011 even with an overall improvement in group, business and special corporate pricing, as well as a positive mix shift. 
As expected, our San Diego hotels had a great quarter with a RevPAR increase of 16.8%, driven by an occupancy improvement of over nine percentage points as both transient and group demand improved significantly and ADR increased slightly. For 2011, we expect our San Diego hotels to outperform the portfolio due to overall improvement in transient and group demand and ADR growth. 
The Chicago market continued to perform well with a 12.1% improvement in RevPAR. Although citywide events were flat to last year, the timing of the events in 2010 and good business transient demand facilitated a strong RevPAR growth. Occupancy increased over four percentage points and ADR improved over 5% as our hotels benefited from a positive shift in our Transient mix of business. We expect the Chicago market to outperform the portfolio in 2011 due to strong group and transient demand, as well as a further positive shift in mix which will increase ADR. 
Our San Francisco hotels had another excellent quarter with a RevPAR increase of 11.5%, as ADR increased over 7% and occupancy increased nearly three percentage points. Both group and transient demand were strong allowing the hotels to yield rate. We expect the San Francisco market to perform in line with our portfolio in 2011 through improvement in citywide and corporate group demand and ADR gains due to the related compression. 
Our San Antonio hotels had a very good quarter with RevPAR increasing 9.8% as rate increased over 5% and occupancy improved 2.5 percentage points. The outperformance was due to strong citywide and corporate group demand. We were expecting even better performance but the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter was undergoing a rooms renovation that was more disruptive than anticipated. We expect our San Antonio hotels to outperform the portfolio in 2011 because of improvements in overall demand. 
RevPAR at our Hawaiian hotels increased 5.2% which was well below our expectation as the renovations at two of our hotels affected operating results, particularly at the Fairmont Kea Lani. Occupancy improved more than nine percentage points, however, ADR fell 9%. The bulk of the demand increase was in Discount, Transient and Group business. Airline capacity continues to increase, and we expect Hawaii to be one of our top-performing markets in 2011 due to improvements in both group and transient demand, which should also drive some pricing power. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels only increased 2.3% due to a significant decrease in citywide demand and the renovation of meeting space at the Sheraton Boston. Occupancy declined nearly two percentage points while rate increased almost 5%. Our Boston hotels are expected to underperform the portfolio in 2011 due to less citywide demand. 
Our Phoenix hotels have struggled since 2007. Fourth quarter RevPAR increased only slightly due to the construction of a new ballroom at the Westin Kierland which was completed in early January. However, we expect our Phoenix hotels to turn the corner in 2011 and outperform our portfolio. Both group and transient demand are expected to increase significantly. 
Lastly, our two worst markets for the fourth quarter were Philadelphia and Orlando. Philadelphia's RevPAR fell 7.2% primarily due to a decrease in citywide events and a disruption from the renovation of the ballroom and rooms at the Philadelphia Downtown Marriott. Citywide demand for 2011 is strong and improvement in ADR is expected, but the renovation will limit available capacity, and as a result, the hotel will underperform the portfolio. RevPAR for the Orlando World Center Marriott fell 2.1% in the quarter primarily due to displacement from the rooms renovation and a difficult comparison to the fourth quarter of 2009 when that hotel significantly outperformed the portfolio due to higher levels of group demand. That hotel is expected to slightly underperform the portfolio in 2011. 
For the year, our top three markets were Boston, with a RevPAR increase of 11.6%; New Orleans with a RevPAR improvement of 11.2%; and New York with a RevPAR increase of 9.5%. The Phoenix market where RevPAR declined 3.9% and the Tampa market with a decrease of 1.6% were our weakest performers. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 13.1% for the quarter as eight of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases. For the year, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 8.5%. We expect the European joint venture portfolio will have RevPAR growth of 5% to 7% for 2011. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 110 basis points which were reduced by 50 basis points for incremental property-level bonus expense. Rooms flow-through was strong for the quarter at nearly 76% due to benefits from the ADR increase and productivity improvements, which resulted in a relatively low 1.2% increase in wages and benefits on a per occupied room basis. Food and beverage flow-through was excellent at over 53% and much better than expected due to an increase in higher-margin banquet and audiovisual revenues, good cost control and improvements in productivity. 
Unallocated cost increased 4.7% for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues including credit card commissions, reward programs and clustering shared service allocations. Utility cost increased only 1.4%, and property taxes declined 8.4%. 
Looking forward to 2011, we expect the RevPAR increase to be driven more by rate growth in occupancy. The additional rate growth should lead the strong room flow-through even with growth in wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increasing group demand, as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid F&B flow-through. 
We expect unallocated cost to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, which we expect higher growth due to increase in rates and volume and as well in sales and marketing cost. We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation. 
As a result, we expect comparable hotel-adjusted operating profit margins to increase 100 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 140 basis points at the high end of the range. 
During the quarter, we raised approximately $248 million under our continuous equity offering program to fund future acquisitions. We also issued $500 million of senior notes that bear interest at 6% and have a 10-year maturity. These notes have the lowest coupon of any bond we have ever issued. We used some of the bond proceeds to redeem $250 million of our 7 1/8% Series K senior notes. 
During the quarter, we repaid the $150 million mortgage on the W Union Square, the $71 million mortgage on the JW Marriott Desert Springs and $54 million of the $300 million mortgage on the Orlando World Center Marriott which allowed us to extend the maturity date by two years to July of 2013. Of our 113 consolidated hotels, 102 of them do not have mortgage debt. At this point, we have only one maturity in 2011, the $129 million mortgage loan on our four Canadian hotels. 
Our credit facility matures in September of this year, but we have the right to extend the facility to September of 2012 as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. After closing on all of the acquisitions that Ed detailed, we will have an excess of $200 million in cash and $542 million of available capacity on our credit facility. 
I wanted to mention two more items prior to starting the question-and-answer session. The first is the change to our income taxes for 2011. Due to the significance of the downturn, our tax for REIT subsidiary incurred a substantial book loss, primarily due to negative lease leakage which resulted in our recording a $32 million tax benefit in 2010. The anticipated significant improvement in operating results should lead to a substantial improvement in lease leakage and as a result, we are projecting a tax provision for 2011. This translates into roughly $0.04 per share reduction in FFO for 2011. 
Finally, starting in 2011, we are modifying our definition of adjusted EBITDA to no longer deduct acquisition cost for successful transactions. Prior to January 1, 2009, the accounting rules of our company to capitalize such cost and depreciate them over the life of the asset. Under the current accounting rules, these costs must be expensed as incurred. We believe that these costs should not be deducted from adjusted EBITDA because it would not reflect the ongoing performance of our portfolio. For 2010, we incurred $10 million of successful acquisition costs that decreased our adjusted EBITDA to arrive at the $824 million number. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

As we think about it more though in the context of 2011, we've done the best job that we could to anticipate what the impact would be. I think that some of the spending is a little bit more concentrated this year in some of our larger hotels, but we hopefully have it occurring during times of the year where it would be less impactful."

The Manchester Grand, obviously, was a property that's been depressed and was rumored to be acquired by some other hotel companies, one of them was a fellow REIT.

And then lastly, and Ed has talked about that the upscale hotels being a larger component of acquisitions going forward.

I guess, the first thing as it relates to San Diego Hyatt, again as it relates to the color around the transaction there, we have probably looked at this hotel off and on for probably the last three or four years. The price that we've ended up acquiring it for is the lowest price that I think we've ever evaluated the hotel, certainly the lowest price that we've seen in the last several years. And certainly there were others that have made progress on the transaction but ultimately did not close. I think that there was a pretty active -- despite the size of the transaction, I think it was intriguing that there were a fair amount of people that were interested in buying the hotel because I think they, like us, recognized that it was a great asset in a great location in a great market. We see San Diego as one of the great markets of the country going forward. I think they also recognized that at this price, you're probably buying it more than the 20% discount to what it would cost to replace the asset. So I think there we were ultimately very happy with the acquisition that we were able to complete. I will tell you that if you watched what happen with the hotel over the course of the year, we did find that while the San Diego market, like several others, have a little bit of a blip in the summer, especially beginning part of the summer and perhaps at one point had fallen short of some of its initial projections and initial hope, the reality is that the asset rallied strongly over the course of the fourth quarter. And so we were pleasantly surprised to see the numbers for the full year coming in better than we what we had originally looked at when we first started to look at the asset. As it relates to our focus on types of assets, I think generally the way we look at the world is that we're probably looking primarily at upper upscale assets and larger assets in Europe and in the U.S. We're also interested in upper upscale assets in some of the Asian markets, but we see a greater opportunity, in general, to look at more mid-market products in the broad Asia Pacific region, which is one of the reasons why you're seeing our New Zealand acquisition. We primarily focus in sort of those upscale and mid-scale price points. In general, we feel that the bulk of the demand growth that we're going to see throughout Asia will probably be more in those price points than necessarily in the higher price points. And as a result, that's one of the reasons why the New Zealand acquisition is targeted in the way that it is. I think you did ask us as it relates to the New Zealand acquisition whether or not that was going to be in the JV or whether that was going to be a consolidated asset, and this will be a consolidated asset for us. This is not going into the JV."

I think Larry gave you a sense in his prepared comments of some of the areas where we thought expenses might trend above inflation. The big focus this year on the whole expense side is going to be trying to minimize expense growth as we work our way through the recovery. And the bulk of that is going to happen by trying to very carefully manage headcount. We want to make certain that when people have started to take on multiple functions or when operators cut the number of managers that they might have had in individual hotel, that we only restore at the level that it's required to support additional volume, meaning additional customers and additional room nights, as opposed to just because things have gotten better. So I think generally, we generally see expenses as being in line. There are some places where we're going to run higher than inflation. But overall, I think our margin guidance frankly suggest that we feel like this where should it. We should suffer some of the problems that we had in 2010 where you saw bonus expense coming back in and things like that, where you end up with less production or less benefit out of revenue growth and because expenses are rising faster than they normally would.

Liquidity, the part of the reason why we maintained higher amounts of cash before was in part because liquidity has become so uncertain in our industry that you just couldn't have the confidence that you could access the debt market to the extent that you need it to raise capital. And frankly, at some points in time over the course of the downturn, I had some concerns about whether or not -- you just didn't know when it's going to stop falling, and so you couldn't necessarily rely on your credit facility without running the risk of potentially seeing a covenant to fall. Our world right now is a lot different. I mean, the access to capital is quite good especially for a company like Host. I think that those markets is certainly an easy source of capital for us as we look to access additional debt capital. And we have our credit facility, as Larry detailed, has another -- we should easily qualify for the extension to take us into 2012. And I think our sense is that while pricing might turn out to be a bit more expensive than the deal we negotiated back in '06 or '07, which we're inside 100 basis points in terms of our cost of funds on the credit facility, we'll still be able to negotiate a new credit facility going forward. So when you take all of that into play and look at the general significant improvement in the liquidity situation, for us to have $200 million of capital available or $200 million of cash available is more than enough."

Ours is relatively straightforward from the standpoint that we bought the asset and we own 100% of the asset. There is no residual interest in the property or in the transaction for Manchester. The structure of our consideration does include some level, relatively small level of common and preferred operating partnership units which are a part of just some tax structuring that the Manchester Group is doing, but it doesn't involve any continued ownership in the asset.

I think some of it -- there are probably scenarios where by soliciting vendors and kind of presenting that opportunity to very efficiently serve two large hotels, when we put these two hotels together, we're working at 3,000 rooms. There should be some ability to attract some better pricing. I think that in some ways where we see the bigger opportunity will come on the revenue side, not dissimilar from what we've been able to work out in Boston where we own both the Marriott and the Sheraton at the Hyatt Center, that sort of block at the Hyatt Center. We have found that once you have common ownership, they're still going to run themselves, they're still going to market themselves independently because they're run by different operators. The reality is that putting an umbrella of common ownership over two large great hotels like this will allow them to better coordinate some of their activities. And so I think what will get out of that is both we'll have that ability to compete. Again, with 3,000 rooms we can compete with anybody including Vegas. So we'll have that ability to compete for business in maybe a more direct manner than we had in the past. And I also think what you just get is a higher level of cooperation between the hotels as they're dealing with an opportunity with a group in either side. There's probably a little bit more of a willingness to share that, recognizing that ultimately that it's a common owner that's going to benefit from it. I think it is one of the unique opportunities that this asset presented to us. Because as I said before, we really like the market and we think we significantly strengthened our position in that market."

I probably would put San Antonio in that same category. So the short answer is, I think you're right. We're not in a rush to sell those hotels. What we'd be looking to do is to try to time it in a way where we thought we were getting appropriate price and appropriate value for, in each case, assets that are in great physical condition or are well-known within their marketplace."

Thinking back to our and the industry's outlook on 2010 last February, it is hard not to be pleased with how this year played out. We were able to accomplish some exciting transactions during the year. And while the economy presented challenges, especially in the first half of the year, we were happy to see that the lodging recovery happened faster and stronger than we originally expected. 
However, before I get into the detail of our 2010 operating results, I'd like to highlight several of our accomplishments for the year. We closed approximately $500 million in acquisitions by purchasing the W New York Union Square, Westin Chicago River North, the Meridien Piccadilly in London and the JW Marriott Hotel Rio de Janeiro, and announced acquisitions in New York, New Zealand and San Diego totaling more than an incremental $1 billion. History has demonstrated that early cycle acquisitions tend to add the best value, and we are acting on that premise. 
In addition to the investments I just noted, we also reached an agreement to develop seven hotels in three major cities in India through our Asia joint venture. We also purchased the junior tranches with a par value of approximately $64 million of a mortgage loan secured by a 1,900-room portfolio of hotels in Europe. The notes were purchased at a meaningful discount. The underlying assets are performing above expectations. 
For the year, we invested a total of $114 million in return on investment capital projects, including the development of a new 26,000 square foot ballroom and outdoor venue space with the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa, new meeting space at the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott and new restaurants at the Hyatt Maui, Harbor Beach Marriott, Westin LAX and Tysons Ritz-Carlton Hotel. We continue to find construction pricing attractive, and expect these investments to yield returns substantially in excess of our cost to capital. 
We also continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet. On that front, the combination of over $400 million of equity issuance to fund our investment program, the repayment of several debt instruments and preferred stock and the successful placement of $500 million of senior notes bearing interest at 6% reduced our average interest rates by 0.04% to 6.2% and increased our coverage ratio by more than 15%. 
Now let's review the results for the quarter and the year. Fourth quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 6.2%, driven by an increase in average room rate of 2.8% and an increase in occupancy of 2.2 percentage points. For the full year, comparable RevPAR increased 5.8% to $120 as a result of a 3.8 percentage point increase in occupancy and a slight increase in average rates. Our average rate for the year for our comparable hotels was $171 per night. Our average occupancy was 70%. Food and beverage revenues in our comparable hotels increased 4.8% for the quarter, primarily because banquet revenues increased over 7% as groups upgraded their catering spends. For the year, food and beverage revenues increased 4.5%. 
Comparable hotel-adjusted operating profit margins increased 110 basis points for the fourth quarter and 20 basis points for the year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $286 million for the quarter and $824 million for the full year.
Our FFO per diluted share was $0.26 for the fourth quarter and $0.68 for the full year. FFO per diluted share was negatively impacted by $0.02 for the quarter and $0.06 for the full year by debt extinguishments and acquisition costs associated with the successful transactions. Since our guidance in October did not foresee these costs in the fourth quarter, adjusting for these items indicate that our FFO results exceeded the high end of our guidance. 
Consistent with the trends we've been seeing all year, we continue to benefit from positive demand growth in the fourth quarter as our number of rooms sold increased by more than 3%. More importantly, for the second quarter in a row, we recorded an overall increase in average rate driven by both the shift to higher-rated Transient business segments and actual rate increases. 
Similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, our transient revenue growth of 6.3% was driven by a nearly 5% increase in transient rate, as transient room nights, which now exceed 2007 levels, increased slightly more than 1%. The improvement in ADR was driven by the Premium and Corporate segments, where rate increased by almost 7%. When combined with the demand increase of 6%, these segments saw a revenue increase of more than 13%. For the year, the Premium and Corporate segments saw a balanced combination of demand in rate growth leading to an 11% revenue improvement. Demand in our Special Corporate segment was significantly up for the year, leading to strong revenue growth of 27%. 
Reflecting our operators' efforts to shift business out of lower-rated segments, our discount room nights declined by more than 3% and revenues in this category fell slightly. This trend accelerated in the second half of the year as our operating environment improves. While our full year transient demand matches 2007 levels, ADR is still more than 16% below the prior peak, indicating a meaningful opportunity for additional rate growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Turning to our Group business. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our group room nights were up more than 6% as increases in our Corporate and other segments more than offset the slight decline in Association business. Average rate was slightly better than the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in an overall group revenue increase of 6.2%. We experienced a demand increase of over 11% in our higher-rated Corporate Group business and a rate increase of more than 3%. Recovery in the Luxury segment continues to gain momentum as our Luxury Group room nights were up more than 15%. For the full year, our group bookings were up almost 7% and rate was down 3%, although ADR did increase in the second half of the year. Compared to 2007, our group room revenues are still down by 19%, and our Corporate room nights are down by 1/3. We would expect to close both of these gaps over the next few years. 
Looking at 2011, we would expect that revenue growth will be driven by a combination of both occupancy and rate increases. It is worth noting that despite the nearly four-point increase in occupancy we experienced this year, we are still four points below our prior stabilized occupancy level of 74%, so we expect to see increases in occupancy in both our Group and Transient segments. However, reflecting the trends we have enjoyed over the last six months, we would expect to see a meaningful portion of our RevPAR growth would be generated from ADR growth due to both actual pricing increases and segment shifts. 
Our booking activity in the fourth quarter was exceptionally strong, and we started the year in a far better position than 2010, as group bookings through the first three quarters of the year were up by more than 3.5% versus a decline of roughly 6% last year. More importantly, our average rate per existing group bookings exceeds 2010 in every quarter. We expect we will see booking pace to improve as the year progresses and that activity in the higher-rated categories will increase. 
On the investment front, as we announced this morning, we signed an agreement to purchase the 1,625-room Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego Hotel for $570 million. The hotel has a premier waterfront location and is close to the city's central business district and Convention Center. The hotel is the premier meeting platform in the market, providing approximately 125,000 square feet of meeting space, including a 34,000 square foot finished exhibit hall and a 30,000 square foot ballroom. With its location adjacent to our San Diego Mariott Marina Hotel, we expect to see revenue and expense synergies from both of these hotels. 
In January, we announced that we have signed an agreement to purchase the 775-room New York Helmsley Hotel for approximately $313 million. The property will be managed by Starwood initially as an unbranded hotel. As part of a comprehensive renovation costing approximately $65 million, the guest rooms and guest baths will be completely renovated, a few rooms will be added to the inventory and the meeting space will be upgraded. When the renovations are complete in early to mid-2012, the property will be branded as the Westin. This will only be the second Westin in Manhattan, and we believe that the hotel will benefit greatly from both the brand change and from becoming part of the Starwood system. While the hotel will benefit from Starwood's management and reservation system as an unbranded hotel, the EBITDA generated from this hotel in 2011 prior to its conversion will likely be in the $5 million to $6 million range, as results will be negatively impacted during the renovation process. Once the renovations are complete and the hotel is converted to the Westin brand, we expect to see EBITDA results in the low- to mid-$30 million range for the first full year of operations as a branded hotel. 
This past quarter, we also finalized our purchase agreement for seven hotels in New Zealand with over 1,200 rooms at a price of $145 million. The hotels are located in the country's main commercial and tourist centers and will be operated by Accor Hotels, one of the largest operators in New Zealand. This is our first acquisition in New Zealand, and we expect the transaction to close in the very near term. 
As you know, attractive acquisition opportunities increased in the second half of 2010, and we expect 2011 will continue to be an active environment. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are in a great position to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. In the U.S. and Europe, our goal is to acquire assets at a discount to replacement cost while achieving investment yields in excess of our cost of capital. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities and expect that we will purchase additional hotels during 2011. With that being said, recognizing the unpredictability of the timing of completing acquisitions, our guidance today does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. 
In 2011, we expect to spend approximately $290 million to $310 million on ROI and repositioning investments. Some of this year's projects are a continuation of works started in 2010, including the San Diego Marriott Hotel & Marina, where we are renovating all the guest rooms, the pool and fitness center and developing an expanded new meeting space and exhibit hall platform.  
At the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, we are continuing construction efforts that we started in December, which include major mechanical AC/HC upgrades, as well as a comprehensive room renovation. This project will be done in two stages with a final completion date of mid-2012. 
We are also completely renovating and repositioning three hotels, the Chicago O'Hare Marriott, the Sheraton Indianapolis and the Atlanta Perimeter Marriott. In each instance, we are completing comprehensive room renovations, materially reconstructing the lobby and food and beverage outlets and reducing the room count with the goal of generating significant improvement in operating results. 
In the case of the Sheraton, we expect to convert a tower of rooms to rental apartments. And in the case of the Atlanta Perimeter Marriott, the room count reduction is necessitated by a condemnation proceeding which generated more than $11 million and which will be deployed to fund the material part of the renovation. 
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $195 million in 2010 and expect to spend $260 million to $280 million in 2011. 2011 plan includes room renovation at the New York Marriott Marquis, the Philadelphia Marriott and JW Desert Springs Marriott, as well as meeting space renovations at the Hyatt Washington, Sheraton Boston, New York Marquis and New Orleans Marriott. 
While the disposition market has improved, we are seeing challenges for buyers obtaining debt, especially in the secondary and tertiary markets, as lenders are more apt to focus on lending in primary market. 
While we are actively reviewing our portfolio for likely sale candidates, we expect the volume of our asset builds to be light in 2011. However, we will be monitoring the pricing of transactions in the market and hope to accelerate our dispositions later in the year. At this point, our guidance does not assume any dispositions. 
Now let me elaborate on our outlook for 2011. In general, economic indicators present a favorable picture for 2011, especially compared to where we were a year ago. Business investment, a key indicator for our industry, is expected to increase 9% this year, and GDP growth is expected to be over 3% both in 2011 and 2012. These factors, combined with some improvement in employment, bode well for lodging demand. As managers more actively focus on increasing rate and shifting business mix away from the lower-rated segments to higher-rated group and transient demand, RevPAR growth will be increasingly driven by rate growth, which better drops to the bottom line. With all this in mind, we're expecting comparable hotel RevPAR to increase 6% to 8% for the year, with adjusted margins increasing 100 to 140 basis points. This operating forecast, combined with our recent acquisition activity, will result in adjusted EBIT of $1 billion to $1.035 billion and FFO per share of $0.87 to $0.92. 
Turning to our dividends. We are forecasting our first quarter common dividend to be $0.02 per share. As our operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increase the common dividend through the year with the expectation of a full year common dividend of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. 
I am pleased to say that the lodging recovery is continuing to progress well. We remain in the early stages at this point and believe this positive cycle will continue to gain momentum. The business travelers are returning in greater numbers and supply over the next couple of years will be at historically low level and well below demand growth. The combination of strong demand and low supplies should lead to a solid and sustained recovery. 
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Our top-performing market for the fourth quarter was Atlanta, with a RevPAR increase of 22.5%. Strong citywide and transient business contributed to an occupancy increase of over nine percentage points. The incremental demand and related compression led to a 5% improvement in ADR. We expect RevPAR in Atlanta to underperform our portfolio in 2011, even with an overall improvement in group, business and special corporate pricing, as well as a positive mix shift. 
As expected, our San Diego hotels had a great quarter, with a RevPAR increase of 16.8%, driven by an occupancy improvement of over nine percentage points, as both transient and group demand improved significantly and ADR increased slightly. For 2011, we expect our San Diego hotels to outperform the portfolio due to overall improvement in transient and group demand and ADR growth. 
The Chicago market continued to perform well with a 12.1% improvement in RevPAR. Although citywide events were flat to last year, the timing of the events in 2010 and good business transient demand facilitated a strong RevPAR growth. Occupancy increased over four percentage points and ADR improved over 5%, as our hotels benefited from a positive shift in our Transient mix of business. We expect the Chicago market to outperform the portfolio in 2011 due to strong group and transient demand, as well as a further positive shift in mix, which will increase ADR. 
Our San Francisco hotels had another excellent quarter with a RevPAR increase of 11.5%, as ADR increased over 7% and occupancy increased nearly three percentage points. Both group and transient demand were strong, allowing the hotels to yield rate. We expect the San Francisco market to perform in line with our portfolio in 2011 through improvements in citywide and corporate group demand and ADR gains due to the related compression. 
Our San Antonio hotels had a very good quarter with RevPAR increasing 9.8%, as rate increased over 5% and occupancy improved 2.5 percentage points. The outperformance was due to strong citywide and corporate group demand. We were expecting even better performance, but the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter was undergoing a rooms renovation that was more disruptive than anticipated. We expect our San Antonio hotels to outperform the portfolio in 2011 because of improvements in overall demand. 
RevPAR at our Hawaiian hotels increased 5.2%, which was well below our expectation as the renovations at two of our hotels affected operating results, particularly at the Fairmont Kea Lani. Occupancy improved more than nine percentage points, however, ADR fell 9%. The bulk of the demand increase was in Discount, Transient and Group business. Airline capacity continues to increase, and we expect Hawaii to be one of our top-performing markets in 2011 due to improvements in both group and transient demand, which should also drive some pricing power. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels only increased 2.3% due to a significant decrease in citywide demand and the renovation of meeting space at the Sheraton Boston. Occupancy declined nearly two percentage points, while rate increased almost 5%. Our Boston hotels are expected to underperform the portfolio in 2011 due to less citywide demand. 
Our Phoenix hotels have struggled since 2007. Fourth quarter RevPAR increased only slightly due to the construction of a new ballroom at the Westin Kierland which was completed in early January. However, we expect our Phoenix hotels to turn the corner in 2011 and outperform our portfolio. Both group and transient demand are expected to increase significantly. 
Lastly, our two worst markets for the fourth quarter were Philadelphia and Orlando. Philadelphia's RevPAR fell 7.2% primarily due to a decrease in citywide events and a disruption from the renovation of the ballroom and rooms at the Philadelphia Downtown Marriott. Citywide demand for 2011 is strong and improvement in ADR is expected, but the renovation will limit available capacity, and as a result, the hotel will underperform the portfolio. RevPAR for the Orlando World Center Marriott fell 2.1% in the quarter primarily due to displacement from the rooms renovation and a difficult comparison to the fourth quarter of 2009, when the hotel significantly outperformed the portfolio due to higher levels of group demand. That hotel is expected to slightly underperform the portfolio in 2011. 
For the year, our top three markets were Boston, with a RevPAR increase of 11.6%; New Orleans, with a RevPAR improvement of 11.2%; and New York, with a RevPAR increase of 9.5%. The Phoenix market, where RevPAR declined 3.9% and the Tampa market, with a decrease of 1.6%, were our weakest performers. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 13.1% for the quarter, as eight of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases. For the year, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 8.5%. We expect the European joint venture portfolio will have RevPAR growth of 5% to 7% for 2011. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 110 basis points, which were reduced by 50 basis points for incremental property-level bonus expense. Rooms flow-through was strong for the quarter at nearly 76% due to benefits from the ADR increase and productivity improvements, which resulted in a relatively low 1.2% increase in wages and benefits on a per occupied room basis. Food and beverage flow-through was excellent at over 53% and much better than expected due to an increase in higher-margin banquet and audiovisual revenues, good cost control and improvements in productivity. 
Unallocated cost increased 4.7% for the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations. Utility cost increased only 1.4%, and property taxes declined 8.4%. 
Looking forward to 2011, we expect the RevPAR increase to be driven more by rate growth in occupancy. The additional rate growth should lead the strong room flow-through, even with growth in wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increasing group demand, as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid F&B flow-through. 
We expect unallocated cost to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, which we expect higher growth due to increase in rates and volume and as well in sales and marketing cost. We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation. 
As a result, we expect comparable hotel-adjusted operating profit margins to increase 100 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 140 basis points at the high end of the range. 
During the quarter, we raised approximately $248 million under our continuous equity offering program to fund future acquisitions. We also issued $500 million of senior notes that bear interest at 6% and have a 10-year maturity. These notes have the lowest coupon of any bond we have ever issued. We used some of the bond proceeds to redeem $250 million of our 7 1/8% Series K senior notes. 
During the quarter, we repaid the $150 million mortgage on the W Union Square, the $71 million mortgage on the JW Marriott Desert Springs and $54 million of the $300 million mortgage on the Orlando World Center Marriott, which allowed us to extend the maturity date by two years to July of 2013. Of our 113 consolidated hotels, 102 of them do not have mortgage debt. At this point, we have only one maturity in 2011, the $129 million mortgage loan on our four Canadian hotels. 
Our credit facility matures in September of this year, but we have the right to extend the facility to September of 2012 as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. After closing on all of the acquisitions that Ed detailed, we will have an excess of $200 million in cash and $542 million of available capacity on our credit facility. 
I wanted to mention two more items prior to starting the question-and-answer session. The first is the change to our income taxes for 2011. Due to the significance of the downturn, our tax for REIT subsidiary incurred a substantial book loss primarily due to negative lease leakage, which resulted in our recording a $32 million tax benefit in 2010. The anticipated significant improvement in operating results should lead to a substantial improvement in lease leakage and as a result, we are projecting a tax provision for 2011. This translates into roughly $0.04 per share reduction in FFO for 2011. 
Finally, starting in 2011, we are modifying our definition of adjusted EBITDA to no longer deduct acquisition cost for successful transactions. Prior to January 1, 2009, the accounting rules allowed companies to capitalize such costs and depreciate them over the life of the asset. Under the current accounting rules, these costs must be expensed as incurred. We believe that these costs should not be deducted from adjusted EBITDA, because it would not reflect the ongoing performance of our portfolio. For 2010, we incurred $10 million of successful acquisition costs that decreased our adjusted EBITDA to arrive at the $824 million number. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

As we think about it more though in the context of 2011, we've done the best job that we could to anticipate what the impact would be. I think that some of the spending is a little bit more concentrated this year in some of our larger hotels, but we hopefully have it occurring during times of the year where it would be less impactful."

I guess what I would probably say as it relates to the Hyatt is that generally we've been able to complete that acquisition at this pricing sort of in line with the deals that we did in 2010, which is right around the 14 EBITDA multiple based on 2010 numbers. This hotel, like many others, did fall meaningfully from its peak operating history in 2006 and 2007. I think that we're below a 10 multiple if you go back to peak EBITDA in terms of our acquisition price."

I guess, the first thing as it relates to San Diego Hyatt, it relates to the color around the transaction there. We have probably looked at this hotel off and on for probably the last three or four years. The price that we've ended up acquiring it for is the lowest price that I think we've ever evaluated the hotel, certainly the lowest price that we've seen in the last several years. And certainly there were others that have made progress on transactions, but ultimately did not close. I think that there was a pretty active -- despite the size of the transaction, I think it was intriguing that there were a fair amount of people that were interested in buying the hotel, because I think they, like us, recognized that it was a great asset and a great location in a great market. We see San Diego as one of the great markets of the country going forward. I think they also recognized that at this price, you're probably buying it at more than the 20% discount to what it would cost to replace the asset. So I think there, we were ultimately very happy with the acquisition that we were able to complete. I will tell you that if you watched what happen with the hotel over the course of the year, we did find that while the San Diego market, like several others, had a little bit of a blip in the summer, especially beginning part of the summer and perhaps at one point had fallen short of some of its initial projections and initial hopes, the reality is that the asset rallied strongly over the course of the fourth quarter. And so we were pleasantly surprised to see the numbers for the full year coming in better than we what we had originally looked at when we first started to look at the asset. As it relates to our focus on types of assets, I think generally the way we look at the world is that we're probably looking primarily at upper upscale assets and luxury assets in Europe and in the U.S. We're also interested in upper upscale assets in some of the Asian markets, but we see a greater opportunity, in general, to look at more mid-market products in the broad Asia Pacific region, which is one of the reasons why you're seeing our New Zealand acquisition be primarily focused in sort of the upscale and mid-scale price points. In general, we feel that the bulk of the demand growth that we're going to see throughout Asia will probably be more in those price points than necessarily in the higher price points. And as a result, that's one of the reasons why the New Zealand acquisition is targeted in the way that it is. I think you did ask as it relates to the New Zealand acquisition whether or not that was going to be in the JV or whether that was going to be a consolidated asset, and this will be a consolidated asset for us. This is not going into the JV."

I think Larry gave you a sense in his prepared comments of some of the areas where we thought expenses might trend above inflation. The big focus this year on the whole expense side is going to be trying to minimize expense growth as we work our way through the recovery. And the bulk of that is going to happen by trying to very carefully manage headcount. We want to make certain that when people have started to take on multiple functions or when operators cut the number of managers that they might have had in individual hotels, that we only restore at the level that's required to support additional volume, meaning additional customers and additional room nights, as opposed to just because things got better. So I think generally, we generally see expenses as being in line. There are some places where we're going to run higher than inflation. But overall, I think our margin guidance frankly suggests that we feel like this should be it.

Liquidity, the part of the reason why we maintained higher amounts of cash before was in part because liquidity has become so uncertain in our industry that you just couldn't have the confidence that you could access the debt market to the extent that you need it to raise capital. And frankly, at some points in time over the course of the downturn, I had some concerns about whether or not -- you just didn't know when it was going to stop falling, and so you couldn't necessarily rely on your credit facility without running the risk of potentially seeing a covenant to fall. Our world right now is a lot different. I mean, the access to capital is quite good, especially for a company like Host. Senior notes market is certainly an easy source of capital for us as we look to access additional debt capital. And our credit facility, as Larry detailed, has another -- we should easily qualify for the extension to take us into 2012. And I think our sense is that while pricing might turn out to be a bit more expensive than the deal we negotiated back in '06 or '07, which where we had inside 100 basis points in terms of our cost of funds on the credit facility, we'll still be able to negotiate a new credit facility going forward. So when you take all of that into play and look at the general significant improvement in the liquidity situation, for us to have $200 million of capital available or $200 million of cash available is more than enough."

That can either be structure of the fees. In some cases, you may look for a ramp up of fees. It obviously can go to where the priority would be above what you might be paying incentive management fees. And then the other issue is the term of the agreement and the ability to terminate that agreement in connection with the sale or convert it to a franchise. So there are a variety of different ways to address the value of the management contract to the value of the management contribution with the deal. I will tell you that while we're always interested in key money, we probably put a greater focus on attractive contract terms, because we tend to view that as a better contributor to overall value in the long run."

I think some of it -- there are probably scenarios where by soliciting vendors and kind of presenting that opportunity to very efficiently serve two large hotels. I mean, when we put these two hotels together, we're looking at 3,000 rooms. There should be some abilities to attract some better pricing. I think that in some ways where we see the bigger opportunity will come on the revenue side, not dissimilar from what we've been able to work out in Boston, where we own both the Marriott and the Sheraton at the Hyatt Center, that sort of brackets the Hyatt Center. We have found that once you have common ownership, they're still going to run themselves, they're still going to market themselves independently because they're run by different operators. The reality is that putting an umbrella of common ownership over two large great hotels like this will allow them to better coordinate some of their activities. And so I think what we'll get out of that is both we'll have that ability to compete. Again, with 3,000 rooms, we can compete with anybody, including Vegas. So we'll have that ability to compete for business in maybe a more direct manner than we had in the past. And I also think what you just get is a higher level of cooperation between the hotels as they're dealing with an opportunity with a group in either side. There's probably a little bit more of a willingness to share that, recognizing that ultimately that it's a common owner that's going to benefit from it. I think it was one of the unique opportunities that this asset presented to us. Because as I said before, we really like the market and we think we significantly strengthened our position in that market."

Increased pricing strength during the quarter resulted in our strongest average rate growth since 2007. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and accordingly, we are reconfirming our RevPAR guidance for the full year and as a result of our acquisition activity, slightly increasing our earnings and adjusted EBITDA guidance. But before I get to our outlook, let's talk specifically about our first quarter results.
First quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 5.4%, driven by an increase in average rate of 4.8% combined with an increased in occupancy of 0.4 percentage points. While these results were in line with our expectations, our reported RevPAR increase was negatively impacted by substantial renovations at both our Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott Hotel, where RevPAR declined approximately 18% for the quarter.
In addition, it is worth noting that due to the timing of our reporting period, our first quarter does not include the operating results for the significant portion of the portfolio for the month of March, which was the strongest month of the quarter. Comparable hotel RevPAR for the calendar quarter omitting the 2 very disruptive renovations, increased 8.4%.
Our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins, which declined by 10 basis points, were meaningfully impacted by year-over-year increases in property levels bonuses, significant increases in payroll taxes, and reduction in consolation fee. Larry will give you more insight to each of the issues in his comments. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $144 million, an increase of 14% over last year. Our first quarter FFO per diluted share of $0.11 was negatively impacted by $0.01 of acquisition costs associated with successful transaction. Overall, we are pleased with our operating results and the progress we're seeing in lodging fundamentals.
First quarter demand displayed the same positive trends we experienced in the second half of last year as gross demand continued to increase and Transient demand shifts to higher price customers. Operating and results in the quarter were negatively affected by poor weather conditions in the Northeast and the strength in government shutdowns. Overall, average rate growth was better than we expected as we continue to narrow the gap from peak great levels of 2007.
Starting with our Transient segment, business trends continue to be positive with an overall average rate increases of 6.2% for the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in our Premium and Corporate segments and a 5-plus percentage increase in our Special Corporate segment, while overall Transient demand split by 0.07%, demand within these more highly rated segments was up more than 5%. Discount room nights fell 6% as hotels rely on lower rate channels and we were able to replace this business with higher rated Corporate demand. And the result was an increase in Transient revenue of 5.4%.
Turning to our Group business, we benefited from the demand increases of 4% at an average rate increase of more than 2%, resulting in an overall Group revenue increase of 6.4%. The main driver for these results was the 24% increase in demand from our higher-rated Corporate Group business as that segment continues to recover ground loss in the downturn. Our Association business, which has longer booking lead times, was off this quarter by 17%, but it is expected to recover significantly over the course of the remainder of the year.
Average segment of our Group business experienced average rate growth and all but the Corporate segment are now exceeding 2007 rate levels. however Given overall Group demand more than 13% behind 2007 levels, we are still expecting to see increased in Group business drive our recovery.
Looking at the remainder of the year, our booking based outlook improved through the course of the quarter, especially in March and exceeds 2010 and our booking pace from last quarter. We expect overall Group revenue to increase meaningfully this year as the increase booking pace is complemented by a progressively increasing average rate growth throughout the remainder of the year.
On the investment front, we are pleased to announce on this call that we literally just signed an agreement to acquire a 75% interest that includes a 12% return on the 364-room Hilton Melbourne Hotel. The total purchase price for the hotel is approximately $150 million, including an $86 million mortgage loan, which leads to a Host equity investment of $49 million. The hotel is a newly built high-quality asset managed by Hilton, it's located in the South section of Melbourne, one of Australia's most important promotional and tourism center speaker. The property is an integral part of the broader complexes of Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Center, which provides direct access over 484,000 square feet of meeting space and which is located in a very rapidly developing area of the city. Australia's natural resource economy benefits from the tremendous growth in the Asia-Pacific region and Melbourne is its most dynamic convention market. As a result, we are very excited about the acquisition and for the potential for outperformance by this hotel.
In addition, as we announced this morning, we signed an agreement with our partners in the existing European venture to form a second with a total equity commitment of EUR 450 million. will own a 1/3 interest in this second fund and will services general partner and asset Manager. Assuming roughly 55% leverage, the new fund will be to acquire approximately EUR 1 billion worth of hotel. As part of the formation of the new venture, Host is contributing the Le Meridien Piccadilly for a transfer price of GBP 64 million, which reflects our cost related to the acquisition of the hotel, including the purchase price transaction cost and other costs related to the acquisition. In addition, the second fund will assume the debt encumbering the hotel.
We are pleased with our acquisition activity so far this year, which including the acquisitions we announced in February, totals more than $1 billion and We continue to believe that we're in a great position to take advantage of the additional investment opportunities as they arrive. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunity and do expect that we will purchase additional hotels during 2011. 
With that being said, recognizing the unpredictability of the timing of completing acquisitions, our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions to be beyond those we announced. So the $150 million acquisition that you see in our forecast is essentially the deal that we just talked about this morning.
During the quarter, we invested approximately $46 million in redevelopment and Return on Investment projects. As a result of the completion of the majority of the extensive renovations at our San Diego Marriott Marquis & Marina hotel, the property earned at the premier Marriott Marquis distinction. The renovations including completely remodeled guestroom, an updated lobby, a state-of-the-art fitness center which overlooked a vibrant and expanded and remodeled old area. We are simply pleased to the result of this renovation and expect the hotel to benefit from this investment over the next several years. 
We are also in the midst of a comprehensive renovation at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers, including a complete rooms renovation and major mechanical and HVAC upgrades. This is the first step in the redevelopment of this hotel which will also include renovating the Food and Beverage outlets. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $230 million to $250 million on these projects types of projects.
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $48 million in the first quarter. The most significant project is the $56 million comprehensive bathroom and renovation at the Philadelphia Marriott Convention Center hotel, which will be completed in May and which will position the property to take full advantage of a strong convention calendar in 2012. Other important projects that were completed this quarter includes ballroom renovations at the Sheraton and the Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, as well as the rooms renovation at the San Antonio Marriot Rivercenter Hotel. 
For the full year, we expect to spend $300 million to $325 million on maintenance capital expenditures.
On the disposition front, we anticipate that our activity will begin to expand beyond just the major markets and we are reviewing our portfolio for like candidates. We expect that our activity will pick up by the second half of 2011 and become even more active in '12 and '13. With that being said, our guidance currently does not assume any dispositions.
Now let me to spend some time on our outlook for 2011. We remain optimistic that the economy will continue to pick up speed this year. As the recovery continues, we expect to manage and remain strong an average rate to keep improving as our business mix shift to higher rated business segment. Given that our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, as that booking pace is continuing to improve, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 6% to 8% for the year with adjusted margins increasing 100 to 140 basis points. 
It is worth noting that we expect the second half of the year will exhibit better relative performance than the first half on both the RevPAR and margin price as we expect to be more significantly affected by renovation work in the first and second quarters. and we anticipate that pricing will be better during the latter stages of the year.
This operating forecast, combined with our recent acquisition activities, and improved projections for our previously announced acquisition, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.01 billion to $1.045 billion and FFO per share of $0.88 to $0.93. 
Turning to our dividends. We increased our first common dividend to $0.02 per share. As our operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increase in the common dividend over the next 3 quarters with an expectation of a full year common dividend of $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
I am pleased to say that the lodging recovery is continuing to gain momentum. Our portfolio is well-positioned to take advantage of these strong operating trends over the next several years and combined with loads we would expect strong earnings growth. 
Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Our top-performing market for the first quarter was San Francisco, with a RevPAR increase of 24.3%. A strong Group and Transient business contributed to an occupancy increase of over 7 percentage points. The incremental demand in related compression led to an improvement of over 12% in ADR. We expect RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the second quarter due to excellent Group and Transient demand and further ADR increases.
Our San Diego hotels had another great quarter, with a RevPAR increase of 22.6%, driven by an ADR increase of nearly 9% and an occupancy improvement over 8 percentage points as both Transient and Group performed well. For the second quarter, we expect our San Diego hotels to underperform the portfolio due to fewer citywide and overall reduced Group demand, only partially offset by improvements in Transient demand and rates.
RevPAR at our Hawaiian hotels increased 18.7% to occupancy improvements of nearly 6 percentage points primarily driven by incremental the demand and nearly 10% increase in ADR. We expect to we'll have an outstanding second quarter due to further improvement in Group and Transient demand as well as increases in ADR.
The New Orleans Marriott performed very well, with a 14.6% improvement in RevPAR. Even with fewer citywide events, group demand increased to 15%. Occupancy increased over 4 percentage points and ADR improved over 8% as the hotel benefited from a positive shift in our Transient mix of business. We expect the New Orleans market to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter due to a decline in Group demand.
Our Phoenix hotels officially turned the corner with a RevPAR increase of 7.6% as ADR improved by over 12%, while occupancy increased roughly 3 percentage points. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and the shift in the mix of business to higher rated segments. We expect to the phoenix market to outperform our portfolio in the second quarter due to strong or per Group demand and ADR gains.
RevPAR for our Boston hotels increased 6.9%, even with the share in Boston's state being renovated and by the weather conditions, which affected both Transient and Group demand. ADR increased nearly 4% and occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points. Our Boston hotels are expected to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter due to reduced citywide demand and the displacement of business as we wrap up our meeting space renovations at the Boston. Due to the reduction in citywide events and Rivercenter, our San Antonio hotels struggled in the quarter with RevPAR improving only 1.3% as rate was essentially flat and occupancy increased roughly 1 percentage point. We expect our San Antonio hotels to have a great second quarter and to outperform the portfolio because of strong group demand, which should drive a significant increase in ADR. 
Due to renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, as well as poor weather and the impact of additional supplies in the city, RevPAR in New York decreased 2.5% as occupancy fell roughly 7 percentage points and rate increased nearly 8%. With the renovations continuing into the second quarter, we expect our New York hotels to continue to underperform our portfolio. However, we do believe that our New York hotels will have a great third and fourth quarter. 
Lastly, our worst-performing market for the first quarter was Philadelphia as RevPAR fell 14.3%, primarily due to the disruption from the renovation of ballroom and guest rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott. The hotel experienced a RevPAR declined of nearly 23% in the quarter. The Philadelphia market will continue to struggle in the second quarter due to the renovation of the hotel, which is expected to be completed in August of this year. However, we expect our Philadelphia hotels to have a strong second half of the year.
We are also very pleased with the performance of our 2010 acquisitions as the 4 hotels experienced average RevPAR growth in excess of 11%. For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 9.9% for the quarter as five of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases led by the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Westin Palace Madrid and the Westin Palace Milan. Occupancy increased 2.7 percentage points and ADR increased 4.9%.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels decreased 10 basis points. The decline was driven by 4 items. The first item is higher state unemployment taxes as several states their taxes to replenish their unemployment funds. The taxes was on the fixed amount of wages and what was anticipated in our forecast, it disproportionately affects the first half the year. 
The second item, is higher hotel level bonuses. in the first quarter of 2010, minimal hotel level bonus accruals were made due to the generally poor prospects at that time. For the first quarter of 202011, bonus accruals were at normal levels. As 2010 improved, bonus expense accelerated, resulting in higher levels of expense in the second half of the year. On a full year basis for 2011, hotel level bonuses are expected to be roughly flat to 2010. 
The third item is lower cancellation and attrition fees. In the first quarter of 2010, we received consolation and attrition fees in excess of a typical year and for the full year 2010, we received fees reflecting a typical year. In the first quarter of 2011, cancellation and attrition fees were well below the levels -- the typical level and that trend is expected to continue throughout 2011. 
The last item is business disruption from our capital program. While we had 18 hotels under various stages of renovation, 2 of those hotels had meaningful highly disruptive renovation activity, the Sheraton New York and the Philadelphia Marriott. Both of which had double-digit RevPAR declines and negative EBITDA, driving margins for our portfolio down 60 basis points for the quarter. In total, these items reduced our margins for the quarter by 145 basis points.
Even with these items, we still expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 100 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 140 basis points at the high end of the range. For the quarter, rooms was good at 73% given the challenges of higher payroll taxes and bonuses as well as the impact of renovations. On unallocated cost increased 6.2%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable to revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations while incremental bonus expense and sales office expenses also contributed to the increase. Utility cost increased 4.2%. 
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the RevPAR increase to continue to be driven more by rate growth in occupancy, which should lead the flow through even with growth in wage and benefit cost over inflation. We expect some increase in Group demand as well as higher-quality groups which would help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid flow-through, particularly in the second half of the year as tax and bonus expense comprises become easier.
We expect unallocated cost to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, where we expect higher growth due to an increase in rates and volumes. And sales and marketing costs where higher revenues in the implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives will increase costs. We also expect property taxes to rise in excess inflation.
In February, shortly after we closed on the acquisition of 7 hotels in New Zealand, the city of Christchurch experienced an earthquake that caused considerable damage to the city. 2 of the hotels in the acquired portfolio if this Novotel in a bit totaling 348 rooms were damaged -- are in the government-declared red zone that has limited access. The 2 properties represent approximately 25% of the value of the portfolio. Based on preliminary assessments, the structural damage appears limited to 39 rooms and the Novotel historic quarter building. We are engaging structural engineers to prepare comprehensive formal assessment and hoping that the properties could be opened later this year or by the mid-2012. 
We believe we have adequate insurance as part of the core New Zealand insurance program to cover the property damage. Our deductible is 3% of the loss of USD $2.4 million or 5% of replacement value of the property if the claim is over the $14.4 million level, which does as deductible at USD $3.2 million. The coverage period for business interruption is 36 months for the Novotel and 24 months for the ibis. Now that some access has been granted, we should have a much better assessment of the situation by the second quarter earnings call.
We ended the quarter with over $115 million in cash and cash equivalents and roughly $440 million of capacity on our credit facility. During the quarter, we raised approximately $100 million under our continuous equity offering program. We also repaid our 2011 debt maturity, the $132 million in mortgage loans on our 4 Canadian properties with $29 million of cash and $103 million drawn on the credit facility. After paying off those mortgage loans, 108 of our 122 consolidated hotels not have mortgage debt. Our credit facility matures in September this year but we have the right to extend the facility to September of 2012 as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x as standard we're more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

In fact we were talking with them a little bit about that before though. What we have found in the past and of course some of this always comes down to the degree of the increase in airfare it is that typically, while the increase in airfare starts may even if at this point I don't know if it's the significant in the cost of the airline portion of the trip, the increase in the fair compared to the overall business trip, which is what's driving most of our activity, tends to be relatively low just because you got a myriad of different elements. And so that in it of itself is not being we've not found in the past that increasing fares are that impactful to us. Where we did see a bigger change it for, was when airline prices went up is that the they did start to see as airlines has a rationalize higher fuel prices, they started to look a little bit more carefully at some of the longer haul trips that they were taking and trying to understand whether or not they were getting effective pricing on those trips. So if you remember back to '08, we had some disruption in Hawaii that we really feel that the economic downturn that we tied to what in our minds was happening with the airline. You may remember that point in time, 2 airlines went out of business at that stage, which accentuated the problem. As you look at what's happening right now, we've heard no signs that there's any reduction in flights into Hawaii. I think pricing is probably creeping up there a bit. But we've actually had very strong I think Larry reported, we've had strong results in Hawaii in the first quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year continues to be very positive. So I'd say it's one of these things that we're watching but at this point we're not feeling any impact."

I am hopeful that, that business wasn't lost but was simply postpone. But I think as we look at Washington for the next year or so, I think in general, the way that I would respond to that is Washington is one of the markets that held up the best in the downturn. so it declined the least. As all these different markets start to work their way back to her they were before and then move beyond that, we generally assume that Washington growth would be find in a historical context. But in the short term will likely be lower than certainly markets like New York, Boston and San Francisco but not because it's not a healthy market but because the overall level of decline there was just lower."

What I will say is that I do think, if you look back over time, a number of these initiatives have ultimately led to, when it's revenue management and things like that, they come up with programs that I think more than on the margins have made a difference in profitability at the hotels. And I think that we're comfortable as the larger brands try to look for ways to become more efficient and how they handle marketing or how they handle customer relationship relations and we're more comfortable in trying to work through those different programs with them to both look for ways that we can save but more importantly, ways we can drive more revenue. None of those programs proceeds without a few bumps along the road and I think that probably a bit what's happening with Marriott with the sales force 1 program. I would tell you that as we look more specifically at that program, we think the fundamental goal of the midsize and smaller customers and the more rational organized way is something that does make sense and we've been working closely with them as they've been implementing the program to make certain that we see both the revenue and benefits and the cost savings that we're supposed to get. And as I sort of alluded in my earlier comments, none of these things proceeds without a few bumps along the road and so we've seen a difference and benefit from the program. Net-net, as we look at our Marriott hotels over the last 3 years, we've seen an improvement in share. But we don't believe that the program, the sales force 1 or other initiatives is dragging down our performance. What we have noticed is that the we have done much better in our larger hotels than we necessarily have to some of our smaller hotels. I think some others have commented on that same phenomenon. and one of the things that we're working with them on is to consider how to refine the program in order to make certain that our smaller hotels also starts to do better. But I would caution everybody that market share is a great statistic in the sense of summarizing activity, there's a lot of different factors that go into that and we all have to be careful about attributing what's going on with market share in any one program."

Shaun, It's a good question because there was one thing that happened in the first quarter that is a little different from what we have seen in some of the prior quarters. How this plays out as we go through the rest of the year. and the thing that's a little bit different is that we did see that in the quarter for the quarter bookings were just a little bit lower than what they had been in the prior year. Now that's not necessarily surprising because last year we start to set records for in the quarter, for the quarter booking, but it's the pace of those bookings in Q1 was moderated compared to what we've seen. I do think that the governmental shutdown comments that I had before may have had some effect on that but I do know that, that is big enough in affect actually change the answer there. conversely, what was encouraging was that our bookings for the next 3 quarters so that would be Q2, Q3 and Q4, were actually far stronger than what we had experienced in 2010. So I don't know as we talked to the operator, I don't know that they would sit down and say, yes the booking cycle is lengthening, which would be a good thing for us, certainly for us. But I think what they are finding is that more people are willing to book a little bit further out than what they we are were before. So as a result, we are looking, for as last year, we continue to this quarter we tended to be 90 days out, we tended to be showing negative room nights compared to the prior year, at's this point for this year, we're selling solid room night growth in Q2 and Q3 and the negative that we started the year in Q4 has declined materially, although we're still the shortfall. I think that I want to reiterate a point that was in my comments because I think we also think this is important is that the rate gross that we're seeing in Q2, Q3 and Q4 is continuing to grow as you work your way through the year. And at this point, on booking pace, is better than the rate of growth that we experienced in Q1. so I think that's a good time. The real driver of this for us and I would suspect for the industry is going to be what's happening in the Corporate Group. To the Association business tends to book longer out there's an attendance issue there but does not been much of what is in the Association business Corporate Group has clearly been improving, the pricing has been improving it fell so far that it has a long way to go to recover. But the trends in that area are pretty good right now."

And so I think we certainly heard that say in New York that the business Transient because the people were weary of getting caught in the city due to the frequency of winter storms that there was a lag effect or an impact because of that. I think there's a couple of other markets that probably felt an impact from that to. So I'm not certain that as you look out for the rest of the year, I would expect to see continued improvement in Group occupancy. Maybe not at the rate that we enjoyed in the first quarter but continue to see growth in that segment and as I mentioned, continue to see growth in rates. On The Transient side, I think it's probably more likely as you look over the full year, that rather than seeing a slight decline in room nights, we'll probably start to see a slight increase. But the bulk of the Transient revenue recovery will be in really rate-driven not occupancy-driven. So the net of all of that is I would say as you look out our overall business mix, that business mix should start to see an increase in contribution from the group side versus the Transient side. And that I think as we commented now for probably over a year, we sort of expecting that and frankly want that because for our portfolio that would be a plus."

So because you're running slightly lower occupancy during the first quarter and when you have a several new hotels open, that probably exaggerates the impact. As we look more broadly in New York through the rest of the year, certainly all of our properties are pretty optimistic about how the rest of the year plays out. Now we will still have some construction impact at the marquis and the Sheraton New York in the second quarter so I'm not necessarily expecting that we're going to have big RevPAR growth in New York for that because those properties are so important to us in Q2. But the second half of the year the outlook is pretty optimistic and I suspect that as New York starts to work its way back to its stronger period, that you'll find that there's less impact from the supply given the high occupancy rate in your traditionally runs that."

We are pleased to report another solid quarter of operating performance. Increased pricing strength during the quarter resulted in our strongest average rate growth since 2007. Our first quarter results were in line w",1746,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another solid quarter of operating performance. Increased pricing strength during the quarter resulted in our strongest average rate growth since 2007. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and accordingly, we are reconfirming our RevPAR guidance for the full year, and as a result of our acquisition activity, slightly increasing our earnings and adjusted EBITDA guidance. But before I get to our outlook, let's talk specifically about our first quarter results.
First quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 5.4%, driven by an increase in average rate of 4.8% combined with an increase in occupancy of 0.4 percentage points. While these results were in line with our expectations, our reported RevPAR increase was negatively affected by substantial renovations at both our Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott hotels, where RevPAR declined approximately 18% for the quarter.
In addition, it is worth noting that due to the timing of our reporting period, our first quarter does not include the operating results for a significant portion of the portfolio for the month of March, which was the strongest month of the quarter. Comparable hotel RevPAR for the calendar quarter omitting the 2 very disruptive renovations, increased 8.4%.
Our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins, which declined by 10 basis points, were meaningfully impacted by year-over-year increases in property levels bonuses, significant increases in state-assessed payroll taxes, and a reduction in cancellation fees. Larry will give you more insights into each set of issues in his comments. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $144 million, an increase of 14% over last year. Our first quarter FFO per diluted share of $0.11 was negatively impacted by $0.01 of acquisition costs associated with successful transactions. Overall, we are pleased with our operating results and the progress we are seeing in lodging fundamentals.
First quarter demand displayed the same positive trends we experienced in the second half of last year, as group demand continued to increase and transient demand shifted higher-price customers. Operating results in the quarter were negatively affected by poor weather conditions in the Northeast and the threatened government shutdown. Overall, average rate growth was better than we expected as we continue to narrow the gap from peak rate levels of 2007.
Starting with our Transient segment, business trends continue to be positive with an overall average rate increase of 6.2% for the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in our Premium and Corporate segments and a 5-plus percentage increase in our Special Corporate segment, while overall transient demand slipped by 0.7%, demand within these more highly rated segments was up more than 5%. Discount room nights fell 6% as hotels relied less on lower-rated channels and we were able to replace this business with higher-rated corporate demand. The net result was an increase in Transient revenue of 5.4%.
Turning to our Group business, we benefited from a demand increase of 4% at an average rate increase of more than 2%, resulting in an overall Group revenue increase of 6.4%. The main driver for these results was the 24% increase in demand from our higher-rated Corporate Group business as that segment continues to recover ground lost in the downturn. Our Association business, which has longer booking lead times, was off this quarter by 17%, but it is expected to recover significantly over the course of the remainder of the year.
Every segment of our Group business experienced average rate growth, and all but the Corporate segment are now exceeding 2007 rate levels. However, given that overall group demand is still more than 13% behind 2007 levels, we are still expecting to see increasing Group business drive our recovery.
Looking at the remainder of the year, our booking pace outlook improved over the course of the quarter, especially in March, and exceeds 2010 and our booking pace from last quarter. We expect overall Group revenues to increase meaningfully this year as the increased booking pace is complemented by progressively increasing average rate growth throughout the remainder of the year.
On the investment front, we are pleased to announce on this call that we literally just signed an agreement to acquire a 75% interest that includes a 12% return on the 364-room Hilton Melbourne South Wharf Hotel. The total purchase price for the hotel is approximately $150 million, including an $86 million mortgage loan, which leads to a Host equity investment of $49 million. The hotel is a newly built high-quality asset managed by Hilton. It's located in the South Wharf section of Melbourne, one of Australia's most important commercial and tourism centers. The property is an integral part of the broader complex of the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, which provides direct access over 484,000 square feet of meeting space, and which is located in a very rapidly developing area of the city. Australia's natural resource economy benefits from the tremendous growth in the Asia-Pacific region, and Melbourne is its most dynamic convention market. As a result, we are very excited about the acquisition and for the potential for outperformance by this hotel.
In addition, as we announced this morning, we signed an agreement with our partners in the existing European venture to form a second fund with a total equity commitment of EUR 450 million. Host will own a 1/3 interest in this second fund and will serve as its general partner and asset manager. Assuming roughly 55% leverage, the new fund will be priority to acquire approximately EUR 1 billion worth of hotels. As part of the formation of the new venture, Host is contributing the Le Meridien Piccadilly for a transfer price of GBP 64 million, which reflects our costs related to the acquisition of the hotel, including the purchase price transaction costs and other costs related to the acquisition. In addition, the second fund will assume the debt encumbering the hotel.
We are pleased with our acquisition activity so far this year, which, including the acquisitions we announced in February, totals more than $1 billion. And We continue to believe that we are in a great position to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as they arrive. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunity and do expect that we will purchase additional hotels during 2011. 
With that being said, recognizing the unpredictability of the timing of completing acquisitions, our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. So the $150 million acquisition that you see in our forecast is essentially the deal that we just talked about this morning.
During the quarter, we invested approximately $46 million in redevelopment and return on investment projects. As a result of the completion of the majority of the extensive renovations at our San Diego Marriott Marquis & Marina hotel, the property earned the premier Marriott Marquis distinction. The renovations included completely remodeled guestrooms, an updated lobby, a state-of-the-art fitness center which overlooks a vibrant and recently expanded and remodeled pool area. We are extremely pleased with the result of this renovation and expect the hotel to benefit from this investment over the next several years. 
We are also in the midst of a comprehensive renovation at the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, including a complete rooms renovation and major mechanical and HVAC upgrade. This is the first step in the redevelopment of this hotel which will also include renovating the meeting space plus the food and beverage outlets. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $230 million to $250 million on these types of projects.
In terms of the maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $48 million in the first quarter. The most significant project is the $56 million comprehensive room, bathroom and meeting space renovation at the Philadelphia Marriott Convention Center Hotel, which will be completed in May, and which will position the property to take full advantage of a strong convention calendar in 2012. Other important projects that were completed this quarter includes ballroom renovations at the Sheraton Boston and the Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, as well as the rooms renovation at the San Antonio Marriot Rivercenter Hotel. For the full year, we expect to spend $300 million to $325 million on maintenance capital expenditures.
On the disposition front, we anticipate that activity will begin to expand beyond just the major market, and we are reviewing our portfolio for likely sale candidates. We expect that our disposition activity will pick up in the second half of 2011 and become even more active in '12 and '13. With that being said, our guidance currently does not assume any dispositions.
Now let me to spend some time on our outlook for 2011. We remain optimistic that the economy will continue to pick up steam this year. As the recovery continues, we expect demand to remain strong and average rates to keep improving as our business mix shifts to higher-rated business segments. Given that our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and that booking pace is continuing to improve, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 6% to 8% for the year, with adjusted margins increasing 100 to 140 basis points. 
It is worth noting that we expect the second half of the year will exhibit better relative performance than the first half on both the RevPAR and margin price, as we expect to be more significantly affected by renovation work in the first and second quarters, and we anticipate that pricing will be better during the latter stages of the year. This operating forecast, combined with our recent acquisition activities and improved projections for our previously announced acquisitions, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.01 billion to $1.045 billion, and FFO per share of $0.88 to $0.93. 
Turning to our dividends. We increased our first quarter common dividend to $0.02 per share. As our operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increase the common dividend over the next 3 quarters, with the expectation of a full year common dividend of $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
I am pleased to say that the lodging recovery is continuing to gain momentum. Our portfolio is well-positioned to take advantage of these strong operating trends over the next several years, and combined with low supply, we would expect strong earnings growth. 
Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Our top-performing market for the first quarter was San Francisco, with a RevPAR increase of 24.3%. A strong Group and Transient business contributed to an occupancy increase of over 7 percentage points. The incremental demand and related compression led to an improvement of over 12% in ADR. We expect RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the second quarter due to excellent group and transient demand and further ADR increases.
Our San Diego hotels had another great quarter with a RevPAR increase of 22.6% driven by an ADR increase of nearly 9% and an occupancy improvement of 8 percentage points, as both Transient and Group performed well. For the second quarter, we expect our San Diego hotels to underperform the portfolio due to fewer citywides and overall reduced group demand, only partially offset by improvements in transient demand and rates.
RevPAR at our Hawaiian hotels increased 18.7% due to occupancy improvements of nearly 6 percentage points, primarily driven by incremental group demand and a nearly 10% increase in ADR. We expect Hawaii to have an outstanding second quarter due to further improvements in group and transient demand, as well as increases in ADR.
The New Orleans Marriott performed very well, with a 14.6% improvement in RevPAR. Even with fewer citywide events, group demand increased 15%. Occupancy increased over 4 percentage points and ADR improved over 8% as the hotel benefited from a positive shift in our transient mix of business. We expect the New Orleans market to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter due to a decline in group demand.
Our Phoenix hotels officially turned the corner with a RevPAR increase of 7.6%, as ADR improved by over 12% while occupancy decreased roughly 3 percentage points. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and the shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. We expect the phoenix market to outperform our portfolio in the second quarter due to strong or corporate group demand and ADR gains.
RevPAR for our Boston hotels increased 6.9%, even with the Sheraton Boston's meeting space being renovated and bad weather conditions which affected both transient and group demand. ADR increased nearly 4%, and occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points. Our Boston hotels are expected to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter due to the reduced citywide demand and the displacement of business as we wrap up our meeting space renovation at the Sheraton Boston. 
Due to a reduction in citywide events and a rooms renovation at the San Antonio Rivercenter, our San Antonio hotels struggled in the quarter with RevPAR improving only 1.3%, as rate was essentially flat and occupancy increased roughly 1 percentage point. We expect our San Antonio hotels to have a great second quarter and to outperform the portfolio because of strong group demand, which should drive a significant increase in ADR.
Due to renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, as well as poor weather and the impact of additional supply in the city, RevPAR in New York decreased 2.5% as occupancy fell roughly 7 percentage points and rate increased nearly 8%. With the renovations continuing into the second quarter, we expect our New York hotels to continue to underperform our portfolio. However, we do believe that our New York hotels will have a great third and fourth quarter. 
Lastly, our worst-performing market for the first quarter was Philadelphia, as RevPAR fell 14.3%, primarily due to the disruption from the renovation of ballroom and guest rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott. The hotel experienced a RevPAR decline of nearly 23% in the quarter. The Philadelphia market will continue to struggle in the second quarter due to the renovation of the hotel, which is expected to be completed in August of this year. However, we expect our Philadelphia hotels to have a strong second half of the year.
We are also very pleased with the performance of our 2010 acquisitions, as the 4 hotels experienced average RevPAR growth in excess of 11%. For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 9.9% for the quarter, as five of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases, led by the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Westin Palace Madrid and the Westin Palace Milan. Occupancy increased 2.7 percentage points and ADR increased 4.9%.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels decreased 10 basis points. The decline was driven by 4 items: The first item is higher state unemployment taxes, as several states raise soda [ph] taxes to replenish their unemployment funds. The tax is on a fixed amount of wages, and while it was anticipated in our forecast, it disproportionately affects the first half the year.
The second item is higher hotel-level bonuses. in the first quarter of 2010, minimal hotel level bonus accruals were made due to the generally poor prospects at that time. For the first quarter of 2011, bonus accruals were at normal levels. As 2010 improved, bonus expense accelerated, resulting in higher levels of expense in the second half of the year. On a full year basis for 2011, hotel-level bonuses are expected to be roughly flat to 2010. 
The third item is lower cancellation and attrition fees. In the first quarter of 2010, we received cancellation and attrition fees in excess of a typical year, and for the full year 2010, we received fees reflecting a typical year. In the first quarter of 2011, cancellation and attrition fees were well below the levels -- the typical level. And that trend is expected to continue throughout 2011. 
The last item is business disruption from our capital program. While we had 18 hotels under various stages of renovation, 2 of those hotels had meaningful highly disruptive renovation activity: The Sheraton New York and the Philadelphia Marriott, both of which had double-digit RevPAR declines and negative EBITDA, driving margins for our portfolio down 60 basis points for the quarter. In total, these items reduced our margins for the quarter by 145 basis points.
Even with these items, we still expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 100 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 140 basis points at the high end of the range. For the quarter, rooms flow-through was good at over 73%, given the challenges of higher payroll taxes and bonuses, as well as the impact of renovations. Unallocated cost increased 6.2%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations, while incremental bonus expense and sales office expenses also contributed to the increase. Utility cost increased 4.2%. 
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the RevPAR increase to continue to be driven more by rate growth in occupancy which should lead to strong rooms flow-through, even with growth in wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increase in group demand as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid F&B [food and beverage] flow-through, particularly in the second half of the year, as payroll tax and bonus expense comparisons become easier.
We expect unallocated cost to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, where we expect higher growth due to an increase in rates and volumes. And sales and marketing costs, where higher revenues and implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives will increase cost. We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation.
In February, shortly after we closed on the acquisition of 7 hotels in New Zealand, the city of Christchurch experienced an earthquake that caused considerable damage to the city. Two of the hotels in the acquired portfolio, a Novotel and Ibis, totaling 348 rooms, were damaged and are in the government-declared red zone that has limited access. The 2 properties represent approximately 25% of the value of the portfolio. Based on preliminary assessments, the structural damage appears limited to 39 rooms in the Novotel's historic Warner building. We are engaging structural engineers to prepare comprehensive formal assessments, and are hoping that the properties could be opened later this year or by the mid-2012. 
We believe we have adequate insurance as part of Accor's New Zealand insurance program to cover the property damage. Our deductible is 3% of the loss up to USD $14.4 million, or 5% of replacement value of that property if the claim is over the $14.4 million level, which does cap the deductible at USD $3.2 million. The coverage period for business interruption is 36 months for the Novotel and 24 months for the Ibis. Now that some access has been granted, we should have a much better assessment of the situation by the second quarter earnings call.
We ended the quarter with over $150 million in cash and cash equivalents and roughly $440 million of capacity on our credit facility. During the quarter, we raised approximately $100 million under our continuous equity offering program. We also repaid our only 2011 debt maturity, the $132 million in mortgage loans on our 4 Canadian properties with $29 million of cash and a $103 million draw on the credit facility. After paying off those mortgage loans, 108 of our 122 consolidated hotels not have mortgage debt. Our credit facility matures in September this year, but we have the right to extend the facility to September of 2012 as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

In fact, we were talking with them a little bit about that before. What -- lo, we have found in the past, and of course some of this always comes down to the degree of the increase in airfare, it is that typically, while the increase in airfare starts may -- even at this point, I don't know that it's necessarily significant in the cost of the airline portion of the trip, the increase in the fare compared to the overall business trip, which is what's driving most of our activity, tends to be relatively low, just because you got a myriad of different elements to any business trip. So that, in and of itself, has not been -- we've not found in the past that increasing fares are that impactful to us. Where we did see a bigger change before when airline prices went up, is that the they did start to see that as airlines had to rationalize higher fuel prices, they started to look a little bit more carefully at some of the longer-haul trips that they were taking and tried to understand whether or not they were getting effective pricing on those trips. So if you remember back to '08, we had some disruption in Hawaii that we really -- we've preed [ph] the economic downturn that we tied to what -- in our minds, was tied to what was happening with the airlines. You may remember at that point in time, 2 airlines went out of business at that stage, which accentuated the problem. As we look at what's happening right now, we've heard no signs that there's any reduction in flights into Hawaii. I think pricing is probably creeping up there a bit. But we've actually had very strong -- I think Larry reported, we've had very strong results in Hawaii in the first quarter, and the outlook for the rest of the year continues to be very positive. So I'd say it's one of these things we're watching, but at this point, we're not feeling any impact."

And I think as we talked with some of the individual properties, our sense was that they were -- this was a market that was affected by the potential government shutdown.

I am hopeful that, that business wasn't lost, but was simply postponed. But I think as we look at Washington for the next year or so, I think in general, the way I'd respond to that is that Washington was one of the markets that held up the best in the downturn, so it declined the least. As all these different markets start to work their way back to where they were before and then move beyond that, we generally assumed that Washington growth would be fine in a historical context, but in the short term would likely be lower than, certainly, markets like New York, Boston and San Francisco.

Some of these systems are fairly expensive and probably only possible because of the scale of their distribution system. How do you view initiatives? And do you think brands with these large distribution systems are going to be developing a competitive advantage that could translate into tangible incremental earnings for you as an owner of both hotels? Is it too early say, or do you just think this is, I guess I'll call it the cost of being a large chain?"

And I don't know that anybody really knows the answer to that yet. What I would say is that I do think if you look back over time, a number of these initiatives have ultimately led to -- when it's revenue management and things like that, they've come up with programs that I think, more than on the margins, have made a difference in profitability at the hotel. And I think that we're comfortable as the larger brands try to look for ways to become more efficient in how they handle marketing or how they handle customer relations. And I think we're more comfortable in trying to work through those different programs with them, to both look for ways that we can save, but more importantly, look for ways where we can drive more revenue. None of those programs proceeds without a few bumps along the road. And I think that's probably a bit what's happening with Marriott with the Sales Force One program. I would tell you that as we look more specifically at that program, we think the fundamental goal of [Audio Gap] through midsized and smaller customers and in a more rational and organized way is something that does make sense. And we've been working closely with them as they've been implementing that program to make certain that we see both the revenue and its benefits and the cost savings that we're supposed to get. As I sort of alluded in my earlier comments, none of these things proceeds without a few bumps along the road, and so we've seen a difference in benefit from the program. Net-net, as we look at our Marriott hotels over the last 3 years, we've seen an improvement in share. So we don't believe that the program, that Sales Force One or other initiatives is dragging down our performance. What we have noticed is that the we have done much better at our larger hotels than we necessarily have with some of our smaller hotels. I think some others have commented on that same phenomenon. And one of the things that we're working with them on is to consider how to refine the program in order to make certain that our smaller hotels also start to do better. But I would caution everybody that market share is a great statistic in the sense of summarizing activity, there's a lot of different factors that go into that. And we all have to be careful about attributing what's going on with market share to any one program."

It's a good question, because there was one thing that happened in the first quarter that was a little different from what we have seen in some of the prior quarters. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out as we work our way through the rest of the year. And the thing that's a little bit different is that we did see that our ""in the quarter for the quarter"" bookings were just a little bit lower than what they had been in the prior year. Now that's not necessarily surprising because last year, we started to set records for ""in the quarter for the quarter"" booking. But the pace of those bookings in Q1 was moderated compared to what we've seen. I do think that the governmental shutdown comments that I had before may have had some effect on that, but I don't know that, that is a big enough an effect to actually change the answer there. Conversely, what was encouraging was that our bookings for the next 3 quarters, so that would be Q2, Q3 and Q4, we're actually far stronger than what we had experienced in 2010. So what I don't know is we talked to the operators, I don't know that they would sit down and say, ""yes, the booking cycle is lengthening,"" which would be a good thing for us, certainly for us. But I think what they are finding at least, is that more people are willing to book a little bit further out than where they were before. And so as a result, we're looking -- whereas last year, we continued to -- each quarter, we tended to be -- at 90 days out, we tended to be showing negative room nights compared to the prior year. At this point for this year, we're showing solid room night growth in Q2 and Q3. And the negative that we started the year in Q4 has declined materially, although we're still showing a shortfall. I think that -- well, I want to reiterate a point, though, that was in my comments, because I think we also think this is important: Is that the rate growth that we're seeing in Q2, Q3 and Q4 is continuing to grow as you work your way through the year. And at this point, on booking pace, is better than the rate of growth that we experienced in Q1. So I think that's a good sign. The real driver of this for us, and I would suspect for the industry, is going to be what's happening in the Corporate Group side. The Association business tends to book longer out. There's an attendance issue there, but there's not that much of an event issue around Association business. Corporate Group has clearly been improving. The pricing has been improving. It fell so far that it has a long way to go to recover, but the trends in that area are pretty good right now."

And so I think we certainly heard that, say, in New York that the business Transient, because the people were leary of getting caught in the city due to the frequency of the winter storms, that there was a lag effect, or an impact because of that. I think there's a couple of other markets that probably felt some impact from that to. So I'm not certain that as you look -- as you look out for the rest of the year, I would expect to see continued improvement in Group occupancy. Maybe not at the rate that we enjoyed in the first quarter, but continue to see growth on that segment, and as I mentioned, continue to see growth in rates. On the Transient side, I think it's probably more likely as you look over to the full year, that rather than seeing a slight decline in room nights, we'll probably start to see a slight increase. But the bulk of the Transient revenue recovery will be in rate-driven, not occupancy-driven. So the net of all of that is that we would -- I would say, as you look at our overall business mix, that business mix should start to see an increase in contribution from the Group side versus the Transient side. And that's -- I think as we've commented now for probably over a year, we sort of are expecting that, and frankly want that, because for our portfolio, that would be a plus."

So because you're running at slightly lower occupancies in the city during the first quarter, when you have as several new hotels open, that probably accentuates the impact. As we look more broadly through New York through the rest of the year, certainly, all of our properties are pretty optimistic about how the rest of the year plays out. Now we will still have some construction impact at the Marquis and the Sheraton New York in the second quarter, so I'm not necessarily expecting that we're going to have big RevPAR growth in New York for the half. Because those properties are so important to us in Q2. But as we look to the second half of the year, the outlook is pretty optimistic. And I suspect that as New York starts to work its way back to its stronger period, that you'll find that there's less impact from the supply given a high occupancy rate that New York traditionally runs at."

Increased pricing strength during the quarter resulted in our strongest average rate growth since 2007. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and accordingly, we are reconfirming our RevPAR guidance for the full year, and as a result of our acquisition activity, slightly increasing our earnings and adjusted EBITDA guidance. But before I get to our outlook, let's talk specifically about our first quarter results.
First quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 5.4%, driven by an increase in average rate of 4.8% combined with an increase in occupancy of 0.4 percentage points. While these results were in line with our expectations, our reported RevPAR increase was negatively affected by substantial renovations at both our Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott hotels, where RevPAR declined approximately 18% for the quarter.
In addition, it is worth noting that due to the timing of our reporting period, our first quarter does not include the operating results for a significant portion of the portfolio for the month of March, which was the strongest month of the quarter. Comparable hotel RevPAR for the calendar quarter, omitting the 2 very disruptive renovations, increased 8.4%.
Our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins, which declined by 10 basis points, were meaningfully impacted by year-over-year increases in property level bonuses, significant increases in state-assessed payroll taxes, and a reduction in cancellation fees. Larry will give you more insight into each of those issues in his comments. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $144 million, an increase of 14% over last year. Our first quarter FFO per diluted share of $0.11 was negatively impacted by $0.01 of acquisition costs associated with successful transactions. Overall, we are pleased with our operating results and the progress we are seeing in lodging fundamentals.
First quarter demand displayed the same positive trends we experienced in the second half of last year, as group demand continued to increase and transient demand shifted to higher-price customers. Operating results in the quarter were negatively affected by poor weather conditions in the Northeast and the threatened government shutdown. Overall, average rate growth was better than we expected, as we continue to narrow the gap from peak rate levels of 2007.
Starting with our Transient segment, business trends continued to be positive with an overall average rate increase of 6.2% for the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in our Premium and Corporate segments and a 5-plus percentage increase in our Special Corporate segment, while overall transient demand slipped by 0.7%. Demand within these more highly rated segments was up more than 5%. Discount room nights fell 6% as hotels relied less on lower-rated channels and we were able to replace this business with higher-rated corporate demand. The net result was an increase in Transient revenue of 5.4%.
Turning to our Group business, we benefited from a demand increase of 4% at an average rate increase of more than 2%, resulting in an overall Group revenue increase of 6.4%. The main driver for these results was a 24% increase in demand from our higher-rated Corporate Group business, as that segment continues to recover ground lost in the downturn. Our Association business, which has longer booking lead times, was off this quarter by 17%, but it is expected to recover significantly over the course of the remainder of the year.
Every segment of our Group business experienced average rate growth, and all but the Corporate segment are now exceeding 2007 rate levels. However, given that overall group demand is still more than 13% behind 2007 level, we are still expecting to see increasing Group business drive our recovery.
Looking at the remainder of the year, our booking pace outlook improved over the course of the quarter, especially in March, and exceeds 2010 and our booking pace from last quarter. We expect overall Group revenues to increase meaningfully this year as the increased booking pace is complemented by progressively increasing average rate growth throughout the remainder of the year.
On the investment front, we are pleased to announce on this call that we literally just signed an agreement to acquire a 75% interest that includes a 12% return on the 364-room Hilton Melbourne South Wharf Hotel. The total purchase price for the hotel is approximately $150 million, including an $86 million mortgage loan, which leads to a Host equity investment of $49 million. The hotel is a newly built high-quality asset managed by Hilton. It's located in the South Wharf section of Melbourne, one of Australia's most important commercial and tourism centers. The property is an integral part of the broader complex of the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, which provides direct access over 484,000 square feet of meeting space, and which is located in a very rapidly developing area of the city. Australia's natural resource economy benefits from the tremendous growth in the Asia-Pacific region, and Melbourne is its most dynamic convention market. As a result, we are very excited about the acquisition and for the potential for outperformance by this hotel.
In addition, as we announced this morning, we signed an agreement with our partners in the existing European venture to form a second fund with a total equity commitment of EUR 450 million. Host will own a 1/3 interest in this second fund and will serve as its general partner and asset manager. Assuming roughly 55% leverage, the new fund will be party to acquire approximately EUR 1 billion worth of hotels. As part of the formation of the new venture, Host is contributing the Le Meridien Piccadilly for a transfer price of GBP 64 million, which reflects our costs related to the acquisition of the hotel, including the purchase price transaction costs and other costs related to the acquisition. In addition, the second fund will assume the debt encumbering the hotel.
We are pleased with our acquisition activity so far this year which, including the acquisitions we announced in February, total more than $1 billion. And we continue to believe that we are in a great position to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as they arrive. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities and do expect that we will purchase additional hotels during 2011. 
With that being said, recognizing the unpredictability of the timing of completing acquisitions, our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. So the $150 million acquisition that you see in our forecast is essentially the deal that we just talked about this morning.
During the quarter, we invested approximately $46 million in redevelopment and return on investment projects. As a result of the completion of the majority of the extensive renovations at our San Diego Marriott Marquis & Marina hotel, the property earned the premier Marriott Marquis distinction. The renovations included completely remodeled guestrooms, an updated lobby, a state-of-the-art fitness center which overlooks the vibrant and recently expanded and remodeled pool area. We are extremely pleased with the result of this renovation and expect the hotel to benefit from this investment over the next several years. 
We are also in the midst of a comprehensive renovation at the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, including a complete rooms renovation and major mechanical and HVAC upgrade. This is the first step in the redevelopment of this hotel, which will also include renovating the meeting space plus the food and beverage outlets. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $230 million to $250 million on these types of projects.
In terms of the maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $48 million in the first quarter. The most significant project is the $56 million comprehensive room, bathroom and meeting space renovation at the Philadelphia Marriott Convention Center Hotel which will be completed in May, and which will position the property to take full advantage of a strong convention calendar in 2012. Other important projects that were completed this quarter include ballroom renovations at the Sheraton Boston and the Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, as well as the rooms renovation at the San Antonio Marriot Rivercenter Hotel. For the full year, we expect to spend $300 million to $325 million on maintenance capital expenditures.
On the disposition front, we anticipate that activity will begin to expand beyond just the major market, and we are reviewing our portfolio for likely sale candidates. We expect that our disposition activity will pick up in the second half of 2011 and become even more active in '12 and '13. With that being said, our guidance currently does not assume any dispositions.
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for 2011. We remain optimistic that the economy will continue to pick up steam this year. As the recovery continues, we expect demand to remain strong and average rates to keep improving as our business mix shifts to higher-rated business segments. Given that our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and that booking pace is continuing to improve, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 6% to 8% for the year, with adjusted margins increasing 100 to 140 basis points. 
It is worth noting that we expect the second half of the year will exhibit better relative performance than the first half on both the RevPAR and margin fronts, as we expect to be more significantly affected by renovation work in the first and second quarters, and we anticipate that pricing will be better during the latter stages of the year. This operating forecast, combined with our recent acquisition activities and improved projections for our previously announced acquisitions, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.01 billion to $1.045 billion, and FFO per share of $0.88 to $0.93. 
Turning to our dividends, we increased our first quarter common dividend to $0.02 per share. As our operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increase the common dividend over the next 3 quarters, with the expectation of a full year common dividend of $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
I am pleased to say that the lodging recovery is continuing to gain momentum. Our portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of these strong operating trends over the next several years and combined with low supply, we would expect strong earnings growth. 
Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."
29574,129579652,120199,"Host Hotels & Resorts Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed.

Our top-performing market for the first quarter was San Francisco, with a RevPAR increase of 24.3%. Strong Group and Transient business contributed to an occupancy increase of over 7 percentage points. The incremental demand and related compression led to improvement of over 12% in ADR. We expect RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the second quarter due to excellent group and transient demand and further ADR increases.
Our San Diego hotels had another great quarter, with a RevPAR increase of 22.6% driven by an ADR increase of nearly 9% and an occupancy improvement of 8 percentage points, as both Transient and Group performed well. For the second quarter, we expect our San Diego hotel to underperform the portfolio due to fewer citywides and overall reduced group demand, only partially offset by improvements in transient demand and rates.
RevPAR at our Hawaiian hotels increased 18.7% due to occupancy improvements of nearly 6 percentage points, primarily driven by incremental group demand and a nearly 10% increase in ADR. We expect Hawaii to have an outstanding second quarter due to further improvements in group and transient demand, as well as increases in ADR.
The New Orleans Marriott performed very well, with a 14.6% improvement in RevPAR. Even with fewer citywide events, group demand increased 15%. Occupancy increased over 4 percentage points and ADR improved over 8%, as the hotel benefited from a positive shift in our transient mix of business. We expect the New Orleans market to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter due to a decline in group demand.
Our Phoenix hotels officially turned the corner with a RevPAR increase of 7.6%, as ADR improved by over 12% while occupancy decreased roughly 3 percentage points. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and the shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. We expect the phoenix market to outperform our portfolio in the second quarter due to strong corporate group demand and ADR gains.
RevPAR for our Boston hotels increased 6.9%, even with the Sheraton Boston's meeting space being renovated and bad weather conditions, which affected both transient and group demand. ADR increased nearly 4%, and occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points. Our Boston hotels are expected to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter due to the reduced citywide demand and the displacement of business as we wrap up our meeting space renovation at the Sheraton Boston. 
Due to a reduction in citywide events and a rooms renovation at the San Antonio Rivercenter, our San Antonio hotels struggled in the quarter with RevPAR improving only 1.3%, as rate was essentially flat and occupancy increased roughly 1 percentage point. We expect our San Antonio hotels to have a great second quarter and to outperform the portfolio because of strong group demand, which should drive a significant increase in ADR.
Due to renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, as well as poor weather and the impact of additional supply in the city, RevPAR in New York decreased 2.5% as occupancy fell roughly 7 percentage points and rate increased nearly 8%. With the renovations continuing into the second quarter, we expect our New York hotels to continue to underperform our portfolio. However, we do believe that our New York hotels will have a great third and fourth quarter. 
Lastly, our worst performing market for the first quarter was Philadelphia, as RevPAR fell 14.3%, primarily due to the disruption from the renovation of ballroom and guest rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott. The hotel experienced a RevPAR decline of nearly 23% in the quarter. The Philadelphia market will continue to struggle in the second quarter due to the renovation of the hotel, which is expected to be completed in August of this year. However, we expect our Philadelphia hotels to have a strong second half of the year.
We are also very pleased with the performance of our 2010 acquisitions, as the 4 hotels experienced average RevPAR growth in excess of 11%. For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 9.9% for the quarter, as 5 of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases, led by the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Westin Palace Madrid and the Westin Palace Milan. Occupancy increased 2.7 percentage points and ADR increased 4.9%.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels decreased 10 basis points. The decline was driven by 4 items: The first item is higher state unemployment taxes, as several states raised SUTA taxes to replenish their unemployment funds. The tax is on a fixed amount of wages and while it was anticipated in our forecast, it disproportionately affects the first half the year.
The second item is higher hotel-level bonuses. In the first quarter of 2010, minimal hotel level bonus accruals were made due to the generally poor prospects at that time. For the first quarter of 2011, bonus accruals were at normal levels. As 2010 improved, bonus expense accelerated, resulting in higher levels of expense in the second half of the year. On a full year basis for 2011, hotel-level bonuses are expected to be roughly flat to 2010. 
The third item is lower cancellation and attrition fees. In the first quarter of 2010, we received cancellation and attrition fees in excess of a typical year, and for the full year 2010, we received fees reflecting a typical year. In the first quarter of 2011, cancellation and attrition fees were well below the levels -- the typical level. And that trend is expected to continue throughout 2011. 
The last item is business disruption from our capital program. While we had 18 hotels under various stages of renovation, 2 of those hotels had meaningful highly disruptive renovation activity: The Sheraton New York and the Philadelphia Marriott, both of which had double-digit RevPAR declines and negative EBITDA, driving margins for our portfolio down 60 basis points for the quarter. In total, these items reduced our margins for the quarter by 145 basis points.
Even with these items, we still expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 100 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 140 basis points at the high end of the range. For the quarter, rooms flow-through was good at over 73%, given the challenges of higher payroll taxes and bonuses, as well as the impact of renovations. Unallocated cost increased 6.2%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations, while incremental bonus expense and sales office expenses also contributed to the increase. Utility costs increased 4.2%. 
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the RevPAR increase to continue to be driven more by rate growth in occupancy, which should lead to strong rooms flow-through, even with growth in wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increase in group demand as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid F&B [food and beverage] flow-through, particularly in the second half of the year, as payroll tax and bonus expense comparisons become easier.
We expect unallocated costs to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, where we expect higher growth due to an increase in rates and volumes. And sales and marketing costs, where higher revenues and the implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives will increase cost. We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation.
In February, shortly after we closed on the acquisition of 7 hotels in New Zealand, the city of Christchurch experienced an earthquake that caused considerable damage to the city. Two of the hotels in the acquired portfolio, a Novotel and Ibis, totaling 348 rooms, were damaged and are in the government-declared red zone that has limited access. The 2 properties represent approximately 25% of the value of the portfolio. Based on preliminary assessments, the structural damage appears limited to 39 rooms in the Novotel's historic Warner building. We are engaging structural engineers to prepare comprehensive formal assessments and are hoping that the properties could be opened later this year or by the mid-2012. 
We believe we have adequate insurance as part of Accor's New Zealand insurance program to cover the property damage. Our deductible is 3% of the loss up to USD $14.4 million, or 5% of replacement value of that property if the claim is over the $14.4 million level, which does cap the deductible at USD $3.2 million. The coverage period for business interruption is 36 months for the Novotel and 24 months for the Ibis. Now that some access has been granted, we should have a much better assessment of the situation by the second quarter earnings call.
We ended the quarter with over $150 million in cash and cash equivalents and roughly $440 million of capacity on our credit facility. During the quarter, we raised approximately $100 million under our continuous equity offering program. We also repaid our only 2011 debt maturity, the $132 million in mortgage loans on our 4 Canadian properties with $29 million of cash and a $103 million draw on the credit facility. After paying off those mortgage loans, 108 of our 122 consolidated hotels do not have mortgage debt. Our credit facility matures in September this year, but we have the right to extend the facility to September of 2012 as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

In fact, we were talking with them a little bit about that before. What we have found in the past, and of course some of this always comes down to the degree of the increase in airfare, is that typically while the increase in airfare starts may -- even at this point, I don't know that it's necessarily significant in the cost of the airline portion of the trip, the increase in the fare compared to the overall business trip, which is what's driving most of our activity, tends to be relatively low, just because you've got a myriad of different elements to any business trip. So that in and of itself has not been -- we've not found in the past that increasing fares are that impactful to us. Where we did see a bigger change before when airline prices went up is that we did start to see that as airlines had to rationalize higher fuel prices, they started to look a little bit more carefully at some of the longer-haul trips that they were taking and trying to understand whether or not they were getting effective pricing on those trips. So if you remember back to '08, we had some disruption in Hawaii that we really -- pre the economic downturn that we tied to what -- in our minds, was tied to what was happening with the airlines. You may remember at that point in time, 2 airlines went out of business at that stage, which accentuated the problem. As we look at what's happening right now, we've heard no signs that there's any reduction in flights into Hawaii. I think pricing is probably creeping up there a bit. But we've actually had very strong -- I think Larry reported, we've had very strong results in Hawaii in the first quarter, and the outlook for the rest of the year continues to be very positive. So I'd say it's one of these things we're watching, but at this point we're not feeling any impact."

And I think as we talked with some of the individual properties, our sense was that they were -- this was a market that was affected by the potential government shutdown. I think it didn't necessarily show itself because people weren't coming in to see the government, but what we were hearing is that some of the agencies that were looking at having group events were sort of in a position where they couldn't sign a contract and they couldn't commit in February and March because they didn't now they had the authority. I am hopeful that, that business wasn't lost, but was simply postponed. But I think as we look at Washington for the next year or so, I think in general the way I'd respond to that is that Washington was one of the markets that held up the best in the downturn, so it declined the least. As all these different markets start to work their way back to where they were before and then move beyond that, we generally assumed that Washington growth would be fine in a historical context, but in the short term would likely be lower than, certainly, markets like New York, Boston and San Francisco. But not because it's not a healthy market, but because the overall level of decline there was just lower."

And at this point in the year, we tend to just use target for a number and then we refine that number as we get later into the year.

Looking ahead, Marriott has been rolling out a new sales force initiative it's been chain-wide. I think Hilton's been looking at doing something with the customer loyalty system. Some of these systems are fairly expensive and probably only possible because of the scale of their distribution system. How do you view these initiatives? Do you think brands with these large distribution systems are going to be developing a competitive advantage that could translate into tangible incremental earnings for you as an owner of both hotels?

And I don't know that anybody really knows the answer to that yet. What I would say is that I do think if you look back over time, a number of these initiatives have ultimately led to -- when it's revenue management and things like that, they've come up with programs that I think, more than on the margins, have made a difference in profitability at the hotel. And I think we're comfortable as the larger brands try to look for ways to become more efficient in how they handle marketing or how they handle customer relations. And I think we're more comfortable in trying to work through those different programs with them, to both look for ways that we can save, but more importantly look for ways where we can drive more revenue. None of those programs proceeds without a few bumps along the road. And I think that's probably a bit what's happening with Marriott with the Sales Force One program. I would tell you that as we look more specifically at that program, we think the fundamental goal of [Audio Gap] through midsized and smaller customers and in a more rational and organized way is something that does make sense. And we've been working closely with them as they've been implementing that program to make certain that we see both the revenue and its benefits and the cost savings that we're supposed to get. As I sort of alluded in my earlier comments, none of these things proceeds without a few bumps along the road, and so we've seen a difference in benefit from the program. Net-net, as we look at our Marriott hotels over the last 3 years, we've seen an improvement in share. So we don't believe that the program, that Sales Force One or other initiatives is dragging down our performance. What we have noticed is that we have done much better at our larger hotels than we necessarily have with some of our smaller hotels. I think some others have commented on that same phenomenon. And one of the things that we're working with them on is to consider how to refine the program in order to make certain that our smaller hotels also start to do better. But I would caution everybody that market share is a great statistic in the sense of summarizing activity, there's a lot of different factors that go into that. And we all have to be careful about attributing what's going on with market share to any one program."

Shaun, it's a good question, because there was one thing that happened in the first quarter that was a little different from what we have seen in some of the prior quarters. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out as we work our way through the rest of the year. And the thing that was a little bit different is that we did see that our ""in the quarter for the quarter"" bookings were just a little bit lower than what they had been in the prior year. Now that's not necessarily surprising because last year we started to set records for ""in the quarter for the quarter"" booking. But the pace of those bookings in Q1 was moderated compared to what we had seen. I do think that the governmental shutdown comments that I had before may have had some effect on that, but I don't know that that's a big enough an effect to actually change the answer there. Conversely, what was encouraging was that our bookings for the next 3 quarters, so that would be Q2, Q3 and Q4, we're actually far stronger than what we had experienced in 2010. So while I don't know is -- we talked to the operators, I don't know that they would sit down and say, ""yes, the booking cycle is lengthening,"" which would be a good thing for us, certainly for us. But I think what they are finding at least is that more people are willing to book a little bit further out than where they were before. And so as a result, we're looking -- whereas last year, we continued to -- each quarter, we tended to be -- at 90 days out, we tended to be showing negative room nights compared to the prior year. At this point for this year, we're showing solid room night growth in Q2 and Q3. And the negative that we started the year in Q4 has declined materially, although we're still showing a shortfall. I think that -- well, I want to reiterate a point, though, that was in my comments, because I think we also think this is important is that the rate growth that we're seeing in Q2, Q3 and Q4 is continuing to grow as you work your way through the year and at this point, on booking pace, is better than the rate of growth that we experienced in Q1. So I think that's a good sign. The real driver of this for us, and I would suspect for the industry, is going to be what's happening on the Corporate Group side. The Association business tends to book longer out. There's an attendance issue there, but there's not that much of an event issue around Association business. Corporate Group has clearly been improving. The pricing has been improving. It fell so far that it has a long way to go to recover, but the trends in that area are pretty good right now."

And so I think we certainly heard that, say, in New York that the business Transient, because the people were leery of getting caught in the city due to the frequency of the winter storms, that there was a lag effect or an impact because of that. I think there's a couple of other markets that probably felt some impact from that, too. So I'm not certain that as you look -- as you look out for the rest of the year, I would expect to see continued improvement in Group occupancy. Maybe not at the rate that we enjoyed in the first quarter, but continue to see growth on that segment, and as I mentioned, continue to see growth in rates. On the Transient side, I think it's probably more likely as you look over the full year, that rather than seeing a slight decline in room nights, we'll probably start to see a slight increase. But the bulk of the Transient revenue recovery will be rate-driven, not occupancy-driven. So the net of all of that is that we would -- I would say, as you look at our overall business mix, that business mix should start to see an increase in contribution from the Group side versus the Transient side. And that's -- I think as we've commented now for probably over a year, we sort of are expecting that and frankly want that because for our portfolio, that would be a plus."

So because you're running at slightly lower occupancies in the city during the first quarter when you have several new hotels open, that probably accentuates the impact. As we look more broadly through New York through the rest of the year, certainly all of our properties are pretty optimistic about how the rest of the year plays out. Now we will still have some construction impact at the Marquis and the Sheraton New York in the second quarter, so I'm not necessarily expecting that we're going to have big RevPAR growth in New York for the half because those properties are so important to us in Q2. But as we look to the second half of the year, the outlook is pretty optimistic. And I suspect that as New York starts to work its way back to its stronger period, that you'll find that there's less impact from the supply given a high occupancy rate that New York traditionally runs at."

I would say that, that is generally probably pretty evenly distributed over both the weekdays and weekends. Now I think that the weekends fell a little bit less during the downturn, and then the weekdays fell more, but the recovery's been a little bit of the reverse.

We are pleased to report another solid quarter of operating performance. Increased pricing strength during the quarter resulted in our strongest average rate growth since 2007. Our first quarter results were in line w",1747,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another solid quarter of operating performance. Increased pricing strength during the quarter resulted in our strongest average rate growth since 2007. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and accordingly, we are reconfirming our RevPAR guidance for the full year, and as a result of our acquisition activity, slightly increasing our earnings and adjusted EBITDA guidance. But before I get to our outlook, let's talk specifically about our first quarter results.
First quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 5.4%, driven by an increase in average rate of 4.8% combined with an increase in occupancy of 0.4 percentage points. While these results were in line with our expectations, our reported RevPAR increase was negatively affected by substantial renovations at both our Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott hotels, where RevPAR declined approximately 18% for the quarter.
In addition, it is worth noting that due to the timing of our reporting period, our first quarter does not include the operating results for a significant portion of the portfolio for the month of March, which was the strongest month of the quarter. Comparable hotel RevPAR for the calendar quarter, omitting the 2 very disruptive renovations, increased 8.4%.
Our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins, which declined by 10 basis points, were meaningfully impacted by year-over-year increases in property level bonuses, significant increases in state-assessed payroll taxes, and a reduction in cancellation fees. Larry will give you more insight into each of those issues in his comments. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $144 million, an increase of 14% over last year. Our first quarter FFO per diluted share of $0.11 was negatively impacted by $0.01 of acquisition costs associated with successful transactions. Overall, we are pleased with our operating results and the progress we are seeing in lodging fundamentals.
First quarter demand displayed the same positive trends we experienced in the second half of last year, as group demand continued to increase and transient demand shifted to higher-price customers. Operating results in the quarter were negatively affected by poor weather conditions in the Northeast and the threatened government shutdown. Overall, average rate growth was better than we expected, as we continue to narrow the gap from peak rate levels of 2007.
Starting with our Transient segment, business trends continued to be positive with an overall average rate increase of 6.2% for the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in our Premium and Corporate segments and a 5-plus percentage increase in our Special Corporate segment, while overall transient demand slipped by 0.7%. Demand within these more highly rated segments was up more than 5%. Discount room nights fell 6% as hotels relied less on lower-rated channels and we were able to replace this business with higher-rated corporate demand. The net result was an increase in Transient revenue of 5.4%.
Turning to our Group business, we benefited from a demand increase of 4% at an average rate increase of more than 2%, resulting in an overall Group revenue increase of 6.4%. The main driver for these results was a 24% increase in demand from our higher-rated Corporate Group business, as that segment continues to recover ground lost in the downturn. Our Association business, which has longer booking lead times, was off this quarter by 17%, but it is expected to recover significantly over the course of the remainder of the year.
Every segment of our Group business experienced average rate growth, and all but the Corporate segment are now exceeding 2007 rate levels. However, given that overall group demand is still more than 13% behind 2007 level, we are still expecting to see increasing Group business drive our recovery.
Looking at the remainder of the year, our booking pace outlook improved over the course of the quarter, especially in March, and exceeds 2010 and our booking pace from last quarter. We expect overall Group revenues to increase meaningfully this year as the increased booking pace is complemented by progressively increasing average rate growth throughout the remainder of the year.
On the investment front, we are pleased to announce on this call that we literally just signed an agreement to acquire a 75% interest that includes a 12% return on the 364-room Hilton Melbourne South Wharf Hotel. The total purchase price for the hotel is approximately $150 million, including an $86 million mortgage loan, which leads to a Host equity investment of $49 million. The hotel is a newly built high-quality asset managed by Hilton. It's located in the South Wharf section of Melbourne, one of Australia's most important commercial and tourism centers. The property is an integral part of the broader complex of the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, which provides direct access over 484,000 square feet of meeting space, and which is located in a very rapidly developing area of the city. Australia's natural resource economy benefits from the tremendous growth in the Asia-Pacific region, and Melbourne is its most dynamic convention market. As a result, we are very excited about the acquisition and for the potential for outperformance by this hotel.
In addition, as we announced this morning, we signed an agreement with our partners in the existing European venture to form a second fund with a total equity commitment of EUR 450 million. Host will own a 1/3 interest in this second fund and will serve as its general partner and asset manager. Assuming roughly 55% leverage, the new fund will be party to acquire approximately EUR 1 billion worth of hotels. As part of the formation of the new venture, Host is contributing the Le Meridien Piccadilly for a transfer price of GBP 64 million, which reflects our costs related to the acquisition of the hotel, including the purchase price transaction costs and other costs related to the acquisition. In addition, the second fund will assume the debt encumbering the hotel.
We are pleased with our acquisition activity so far this year which, including the acquisitions we announced in February, total more than $1 billion. And we continue to believe that we are in a great position to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as they arrive. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities and do expect that we will purchase additional hotels during 2011. 
With that being said, recognizing the unpredictability of the timing of completing acquisitions, our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. So the $150 million acquisition that you see in our forecast is essentially the deal that we just talked about this morning.
During the quarter, we invested approximately $46 million in redevelopment and return on investment projects. As a result of the completion of the majority of the extensive renovations at our San Diego Marriott Marquis & Marina hotel, the property earned the premier Marriott Marquis distinction. The renovations included completely remodeled guestrooms, an updated lobby, a state-of-the-art fitness center which overlooks the vibrant and recently expanded and remodeled pool area. We are extremely pleased with the result of this renovation and expect the hotel to benefit from this investment over the next several years. 
We are also in the midst of a comprehensive renovation at the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, including a complete rooms renovation and major mechanical and HVAC upgrade. This is the first step in the redevelopment of this hotel, which will also include renovating the meeting space plus the food and beverage outlets. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $230 million to $250 million on these types of projects.
In terms of the maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $48 million in the first quarter. The most significant project is the $56 million comprehensive room, bathroom and meeting space renovation at the Philadelphia Marriott Convention Center Hotel which will be completed in May, and which will position the property to take full advantage of a strong convention calendar in 2012. Other important projects that were completed this quarter include ballroom renovations at the Sheraton Boston and the Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, as well as the rooms renovation at the San Antonio Marriot Rivercenter Hotel. For the full year, we expect to spend $300 million to $325 million on maintenance capital expenditures.
On the disposition front, we anticipate that activity will begin to expand beyond just the major market, and we are reviewing our portfolio for likely sale candidates. We expect that our disposition activity will pick up in the second half of 2011 and become even more active in '12 and '13. With that being said, our guidance currently does not assume any dispositions.
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for 2011. We remain optimistic that the economy will continue to pick up steam this year. As the recovery continues, we expect demand to remain strong and average rates to keep improving as our business mix shifts to higher-rated business segments. Given that our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and that booking pace is continuing to improve, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 6% to 8% for the year, with adjusted margins increasing 100 to 140 basis points. 
It is worth noting that we expect the second half of the year will exhibit better relative performance than the first half on both the RevPAR and margin fronts, as we expect to be more significantly affected by renovation work in the first and second quarters, and we anticipate that pricing will be better during the latter stages of the year. This operating forecast, combined with our recent acquisition activities and improved projections for our previously announced acquisitions, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.01 billion to $1.045 billion, and FFO per share of $0.88 to $0.93. 
Turning to our dividends, we increased our first quarter common dividend to $0.02 per share. As our operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increase the common dividend over the next 3 quarters, with the expectation of a full year common dividend of $0.10 to $0.15 per share.
I am pleased to say that the lodging recovery is continuing to gain momentum. Our portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of these strong operating trends over the next several years and combined with low supply, we would expect strong earnings growth. 
Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Our top-performing market for the first quarter was San Francisco, with a RevPAR increase of 24.3%. Strong Group and Transient business contributed to an occupancy increase of over 7 percentage points. The incremental demand and related compression led to improvement of over 12% in ADR. We expect RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the second quarter due to excellent group and transient demand and further ADR increases.
Our San Diego hotels had another great quarter, with a RevPAR increase of 22.6% driven by an ADR increase of nearly 9% and an occupancy improvement of 8 percentage points, as both Transient and Group performed well. For the second quarter, we expect our San Diego hotel to underperform the portfolio due to fewer citywides and overall reduced group demand, only partially offset by improvements in transient demand and rates.
RevPAR at our Hawaiian hotels increased 18.7% due to occupancy improvements of nearly 6 percentage points, primarily driven by incremental group demand and a nearly 10% increase in ADR. We expect Hawaii to have an outstanding second quarter due to further improvements in group and transient demand, as well as increases in ADR.
The New Orleans Marriott performed very well, with a 14.6% improvement in RevPAR. Even with fewer citywide events, group demand increased 15%. Occupancy increased over 4 percentage points and ADR improved over 8%, as the hotel benefited from a positive shift in our transient mix of business. We expect the New Orleans market to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter due to a decline in group demand.
Our Phoenix hotels officially turned the corner with a RevPAR increase of 7.6%, as ADR improved by over 12% while occupancy decreased roughly 3 percentage points. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and the shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. We expect the phoenix market to outperform our portfolio in the second quarter due to strong corporate group demand and ADR gains.
RevPAR for our Boston hotels increased 6.9%, even with the Sheraton Boston's meeting space being renovated and bad weather conditions, which affected both transient and group demand. ADR increased nearly 4%, and occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points. Our Boston hotels are expected to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter due to the reduced citywide demand and the displacement of business as we wrap up our meeting space renovation at the Sheraton Boston. 
Due to a reduction in citywide events and a rooms renovation at the San Antonio Rivercenter, our San Antonio hotels struggled in the quarter with RevPAR improving only 1.3%, as rate was essentially flat and occupancy increased roughly 1 percentage point. We expect our San Antonio hotels to have a great second quarter and to outperform the portfolio because of strong group demand, which should drive a significant increase in ADR.
Due to renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, as well as poor weather and the impact of additional supply in the city, RevPAR in New York decreased 2.5% as occupancy fell roughly 7 percentage points and rate increased nearly 8%. With the renovations continuing into the second quarter, we expect our New York hotels to continue to underperform our portfolio. However, we do believe that our New York hotels will have a great third and fourth quarter. 
Lastly, our worst performing market for the first quarter was Philadelphia, as RevPAR fell 14.3%, primarily due to the disruption from the renovation of ballroom and guest rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott. The hotel experienced a RevPAR decline of nearly 23% in the quarter. The Philadelphia market will continue to struggle in the second quarter due to the renovation of the hotel, which is expected to be completed in August of this year. However, we expect our Philadelphia hotels to have a strong second half of the year.
We are also very pleased with the performance of our 2010 acquisitions, as the 4 hotels experienced average RevPAR growth in excess of 11%. For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 9.9% for the quarter, as 5 of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases, led by the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Westin Palace Madrid and the Westin Palace Milan. Occupancy increased 2.7 percentage points and ADR increased 4.9%.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels decreased 10 basis points. The decline was driven by 4 items: The first item is higher state unemployment taxes, as several states raised SUTA taxes to replenish their unemployment funds. The tax is on a fixed amount of wages and while it was anticipated in our forecast, it disproportionately affects the first half the year.
The second item is higher hotel-level bonuses. In the first quarter of 2010, minimal hotel level bonus accruals were made due to the generally poor prospects at that time. For the first quarter of 2011, bonus accruals were at normal levels. As 2010 improved, bonus expense accelerated, resulting in higher levels of expense in the second half of the year. On a full year basis for 2011, hotel-level bonuses are expected to be roughly flat to 2010. 
The third item is lower cancellation and attrition fees. In the first quarter of 2010, we received cancellation and attrition fees in excess of a typical year, and for the full year 2010, we received fees reflecting a typical year. In the first quarter of 2011, cancellation and attrition fees were well below the levels -- the typical level. And that trend is expected to continue throughout 2011. 
The last item is business disruption from our capital program. While we had 18 hotels under various stages of renovation, 2 of those hotels had meaningful highly disruptive renovation activity: The Sheraton New York and the Philadelphia Marriott, both of which had double-digit RevPAR declines and negative EBITDA, driving margins for our portfolio down 60 basis points for the quarter. In total, these items reduced our margins for the quarter by 145 basis points.
Even with these items, we still expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 100 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 140 basis points at the high end of the range. For the quarter, rooms flow-through was good at over 73%, given the challenges of higher payroll taxes and bonuses, as well as the impact of renovations. Unallocated cost increased 6.2%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations, while incremental bonus expense and sales office expenses also contributed to the increase. Utility costs increased 4.2%. 
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the RevPAR increase to continue to be driven more by rate growth in occupancy, which should lead to strong rooms flow-through, even with growth in wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increase in group demand as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid F&B [food and beverage] flow-through, particularly in the second half of the year, as payroll tax and bonus expense comparisons become easier.
We expect unallocated costs to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, where we expect higher growth due to an increase in rates and volumes. And sales and marketing costs, where higher revenues and the implementation of new sales and marketing initiatives will increase cost. We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation.
In February, shortly after we closed on the acquisition of 7 hotels in New Zealand, the city of Christchurch experienced an earthquake that caused considerable damage to the city. Two of the hotels in the acquired portfolio, a Novotel and Ibis, totaling 348 rooms, were damaged and are in the government-declared red zone that has limited access. The 2 properties represent approximately 25% of the value of the portfolio. Based on preliminary assessments, the structural damage appears limited to 39 rooms in the Novotel's historic Warner building. We are engaging structural engineers to prepare comprehensive formal assessments and are hoping that the properties could be opened later this year or by the mid-2012. 
We believe we have adequate insurance as part of Accor's New Zealand insurance program to cover the property damage. Our deductible is 3% of the loss up to USD $14.4 million, or 5% of replacement value of that property if the claim is over the $14.4 million level, which does cap the deductible at USD $3.2 million. The coverage period for business interruption is 36 months for the Novotel and 24 months for the Ibis. Now that some access has been granted, we should have a much better assessment of the situation by the second quarter earnings call.
We ended the quarter with over $150 million in cash and cash equivalents and roughly $440 million of capacity on our credit facility. During the quarter, we raised approximately $100 million under our continuous equity offering program. We also repaid our only 2011 debt maturity, the $132 million in mortgage loans on our 4 Canadian properties with $29 million of cash and a $103 million draw on the credit facility. After paying off those mortgage loans, 108 of our 122 consolidated hotels do not have mortgage debt. Our credit facility matures in September this year, but we have the right to extend the facility to September of 2012 as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

In fact, we were talking with them a little bit about that before. What we have found in the past, and of course some of this always comes down to the degree of the increase in airfare, is that typically while the increase in airfare starts may -- even at this point, I don't know that it's necessarily significant in the cost of the airline portion of the trip, the increase in the fare compared to the overall business trip, which is what's driving most of our activity, tends to be relatively low, just because you've got a myriad of different elements to any business trip. So that in and of itself has not been -- we've not found in the past that increasing fares are that impactful to us. Where we did see a bigger change before when airline prices went up is that we did start to see that as airlines had to rationalize higher fuel prices, they started to look a little bit more carefully at some of the longer-haul trips that they were taking and trying to understand whether or not they were getting effective pricing on those trips. So if you remember back to '08, we had some disruption in Hawaii that we really -- pre the economic downturn that we tied to what -- in our minds, was tied to what was happening with the airlines. You may remember at that point in time, 2 airlines went out of business at that stage, which accentuated the problem. As we look at what's happening right now, we've heard no signs that there's any reduction in flights into Hawaii. I think pricing is probably creeping up there a bit. But we've actually had very strong -- I think Larry reported, we've had very strong results in Hawaii in the first quarter, and the outlook for the rest of the year continues to be very positive. So I'd say it's one of these things we're watching, but at this point we're not feeling any impact."

But I think as we look at Washington for the next year or so, I think in general the way I'd respond to that is that Washington was one of the markets that held up the best in the downturn, so it declined the least. As all these different markets start to work their way back to where they were before and then move beyond that, we generally assumed that Washington growth would be fine in a historical context, but in the short term would likely be lower than, certainly, markets like New York, Boston and San Francisco. But not because it's not a healthy market, but because the overall level of decline there was just lower."

This new system, which I think has them in session for 3 weeks and then off for a week so that they can go back and visit their constituents, has forced a little bit of a revamping of the meetings calendar in Washington. And so I think the city is probably working through a little bit of that, too.

And I don't know that anybody really knows the answer to that yet. What I would say is that I do think if you look back over time, a number of these initiatives have ultimately led to -- when it's revenue management and things like that, they've come up with programs that I think, more than on the margins, have made a difference in profitability at the hotel. And I think we're comfortable as the larger brands try to look for ways to become more efficient in how they handle marketing or how they handle customer relations. And I think we're more comfortable in trying to work through those different programs with them, to both look for ways that we can save, but more importantly look for ways where we can drive more revenue. None of those programs proceeds without a few bumps along the road. And I think that's probably a bit what's happening with Marriott with the Sales Force One program. I would tell you that as we look more specifically at that program, we think the fundamental goal of [Audio Gap] through midsized and smaller customers and in a more rational and organized way is something that does make sense. And we've been working closely with them as they've been implementing that program to make certain that we see both the revenue and its benefits and the cost savings that we're supposed to get. As I sort of alluded in my earlier comments, none of these things proceeds without a few bumps along the road, and so we've seen a difference in benefit from the program. Net-net, as we look at our Marriott hotels over the last 3 years, we've seen an improvement in share. So we don't believe that the program, that Sales Force One or other initiatives is dragging down our performance. What we have noticed is that we have done much better at our larger hotels than we necessarily have with some of our smaller hotels. I think some others have commented on that same phenomenon. And one of the things that we're working with them on is to consider how to refine the program in order to make certain that our smaller hotels also start to do better. But I would caution everybody that market share is a great statistic in the sense of summarizing activity, there's a lot of different factors that go into that. And we all have to be careful about attributing what's going on with market share to any one program."

Shaun, it's a good question, because there was one thing that happened in the first quarter that was a little different from what we have seen in some of the prior quarters. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out as we work our way through the rest of the year. And the thing that was a little bit different is that we did see that our ""in the quarter for the quarter"" bookings were just a little bit lower than what they had been in the prior year. Now that's not necessarily surprising because last year we started to set records for ""in the quarter for the quarter"" booking. But the pace of those bookings in Q1 was moderated compared to what we had seen. I do think that the governmental shutdown comments that I had before may have had some effect on that, but I don't know that that's a big enough an effect to actually change the answer there. Conversely, what was encouraging was that our bookings for the next 3 quarters, so that would be Q2, Q3 and Q4, we're actually far stronger than what we had experienced in 2010. So while I don't know is -- we talked to the operators, I don't know that they would sit down and say, ""yes, the booking cycle is lengthening,"" which would be a good thing for us, certainly for us. But I think what they are finding at least is that more people are willing to book a little bit further out than where they were before. And so as a result, we're looking -- whereas last year, we continued to -- each quarter, we tended to be -- at 90 days out, we tended to be showing negative room nights compared to the prior year. At this point for this year, we're showing solid room night growth in Q2 and Q3. And the negative that we started the year in Q4 has declined materially, although we're still showing a shortfall. I think that -- well, I want to reiterate a point, though, that was in my comments, because I think we also think this is important is that the rate growth that we're seeing in Q2, Q3 and Q4 is continuing to grow as you work your way through the year and at this point, on booking pace, is better than the rate of growth that we experienced in Q1. So I think that's a good sign. The real driver of this for us, and I would suspect for the industry, is going to be what's happening on the Corporate Group side. The Association business tends to book longer out. There's an attendance issue there, but there's not that much of an event issue around Association business. Corporate Group has clearly been improving. The pricing has been improving. It fell so far that it has a long way to go to recover, but the trends in that area are pretty good right now."

And so I think we certainly heard that, say, in New York that the business Transient, because the people were leery of getting caught in the city due to the frequency of the winter storms, that there was a lag effect or an impact because of that. I think there's a couple of other markets that probably felt some impact from that, too. So I'm not certain that as you look -- as you look out for the rest of the year, I would expect to see continued improvement in Group occupancy. Maybe not at the rate that we enjoyed in the first quarter, but continue to see growth on that segment, and as I mentioned, continue to see growth in rates. On the Transient side, I think it's probably more likely as you look over the full year, that rather than seeing a slight decline in room nights, we'll probably start to see a slight increase. But the bulk of the Transient revenue recovery will be rate-driven, not occupancy-driven. So the net of all of that is that we would -- I would say, as you look at our overall business mix, that business mix should start to see an increase in contribution from the Group side versus the Transient side. And that's -- I think as we've commented now for probably over a year, we sort of are expecting that and frankly want that because for our portfolio, that would be a plus."

So because you're running at slightly lower occupancies in the city during the first quarter when you have several new hotels open, that probably accentuates the impact. As we look more broadly through New York through the rest of the year, certainly all of our properties are pretty optimistic about how the rest of the year plays out. Now we will still have some construction impact at the Marquis and the Sheraton New York in the second quarter, so I'm not necessarily expecting that we're going to have big RevPAR growth in New York for the half because those properties are so important to us in Q2. But as we look to the second half of the year, the outlook is pretty optimistic. And I suspect that as New York starts to work its way back to its stronger period, that you'll find that there's less impact from the supply given a high occupancy rate that New York traditionally runs at."

Let me -- I guess what I'd tell you though is across the board, we're still fairly short. I mean, if you look at us compared to '07 right now, in this quarter, we're down about 6% in room nights and about 9% in rates and so overall, I think what that works out to is about 14% to 15% in terms of revenues. I would say that, that is generally probably pretty evenly distributed over both the weekdays and weekends. Now I think that the weekends fell a little bit less during the downturn, and then the weekdays fell more, but the recovery's been a little bit of the reverse. So I suspect in general across the portfolio is we're feeling that impact fairly evenly. Certainly in some of the markets like New York that run very high occupancies, my guess is that it's still more of a rate question than an occupancy question. But other than that, it's fairly evenly distributed."

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results, which were driven by improvements in transient demand and substantial average rate growth. We have also been successful in placing 2 great hotels located in very desirable markets under contract, one in our consolidated portfolio and one in our European joint venture fund. 
First, let's talk about our second quarter results. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 6.7%, driven by an improvement in our average rate of 5%, combined with and occupancy increase of 1.1 percentage points. Our average rate was $184, and our average occupancy was 75.2%. As we discussed last quarter, we expected our operating results to be significantly impacted by substantial renovations at our Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott hotels in the second quarter. Excluding results from these hotels, our RevPAR increase for the quarter would have been 7.6%. In addition, it is worth noting that our comparable hotel results do not include the performance of the $1.7 billion of acquisitions we have completed over the last 12 months, which are performing exceptionally well and have generated an average RevPAR increase of over 18% for the quarter.
Comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of 4.4% contributed to overall revenue growth of 5.6%. This increase when combined with our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increase of 115 basis points and our acquisition activity resulted in a 25% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $313 million for the second quarter and a 30% increase in FFO per diluted share of $0.30. FFO for this quarter was negatively impacted by a $0.01 per share for acquisition and debt repayment costs, as well as a noncash impairment charge. Our year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.1% driven primarily by rate improvement. Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 5.2% combined with operating profit margins that increased 65 basis points resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $457 million, representing an increase of 22% and FFO per diluted share of $0.41. Year-to-date, FFO per diluted share was negatively affected by $0.02 for acquisitions, debt repayments and impairment costs.
Our business mix trends for the quarter were quite favorable as we saw strong demand increases from our higher-rated customer segment and solid rate growth across the board. Rate growth in Q2, driven by exceptional growth in transient demand, was the best we had seen since 2007. Overall, transient room nights for the quarter increased more than 3% led by a nearly 7.5% increase in Special Corporate demand and a more than 3% increase in our Premium Corporate segment.
Reflecting the changes in our mix, discount room nights increased just over 1%. On the rate side, Special Corporate rate increases of more than 6% helped to improve our average transient rate by more than 5% leading to overall transient revenue growth of more than 8.5%. Group demand for the quarter was essentially flat with last year as increases in Corporate and association business were essentially offset by reductions in discount group. The growth on these higher-priced segments was even more pronounced in our luxury hotel where they grew by more than 60%, leading to a luxury group room night increase of more than 8%. The combination of positive mix shift and rate increases in all 3 segments drove group rates up by 4.7%, which represents more than twice the rate of increase in Q1. Overall, group revenues were up by almost 4.5%. 
Looking at the remainder of the year, our group booking pace continues to be positive as third quarter takes up more than 3% and fourth quarter up nearly 2%. And average rates are higher in both quarters. While not recurring at last year's accelerated pace, short-term bookings are still quite strong by historical standards, and we are seeing signs that the booking window is starting to lengthen as our pace for 2012 is well ahead to last year's level. In addition, our transient booking pace is quite strong. It reflects an average demand increase of more than 7% for the next 4 months. Stronger advance bookings, especially at our larger hotels, is certainly a positive sign and will be very helpful in our hotel manager's efforts to push transient rates higher in the future. 
On the investment front, we have 2 new transactions to discuss. First, as we reported this morning, we signed an agreement to acquire the 888-room Grand Hyatt Washington for $442 million. The hotel is located at the heart of downtown Washington, D.C., just 2 blocks from the city's Convention Center and convenient to over 40 million square feet of office space, the Verizon Center, the National Mall and the Smithsonian Museum. In addition, the hotel is located off the city's old Convention Center site, which is being redeveloped into over 300,000 square feet of retail space, more than 1 million square feet of office space and 700 residential units. The hotel includes over 43,000 square feet of meeting space, including a 17,000 square foot ballroom and an 8,500 square foot junior ballroom. We are pleased to acquire another hotel in D.C., which is a historically top-performing market with a diversified demand base.
Turning to our European joint venture. As we discussed last quarter, we completed an expansion of our joint venture through the establishment of a new fund with approximately EUR 1 billion in investment capacity. As part of the expansion, we transferred the Le Meridien Piccadilly to this new fund in June. In addition, the joint venture signed an agreement to acquire its first acquisition in France, the 396-room Pullman Bercy hotel for EUR 96 million. The hotel is located in Paris near the banks of the Seine River in a newly redeveloped neighborhood that includes high-end office buildings, one of Paris' large railway stations and the French Ministry of Finance. The hotel has 17 media rooms totaling more than 19,000 square feet. We will continue to look for acquisitions that meet our investment criteria and believe we are in a great position to take advantage of additional investment properties as they arise. 
With that being said, given the unpredictability of the timing of these transactions, our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. On the disposition front, our forecast assumes only the sales of South Marriott in the third quarter, a non-core asset, which required significant capital investment. 
During the quarter, we invested $75 million in return on investment projects, including the completion of the first phase of our redevelopment project at the Sheraton New York and Sheraton Indianapolis hotels, as well as an updated and expanded media platform at the St. Regis in Houston. For the full year, we expect to spend $220 million to $240 million on these types of projects. 
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $71 million in the second quarter, which included a completion of the Phase 1 renovation of 991 rooms at the New York Marriott Marquis. We also concluded the renovation of the meeting space and main tower rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott downtown. For the year, we expect to spend approximately $320 million to $345 million on maintenance capital expenditures. 
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and we are expecting improved performance in the second half of the year due to less disruption from renovation of our hotels, an improving macroeconomic outlook relative to the first half of the year and solid group bookings for the third and fourth quarters. With that in mind and given that we are past the midpoint of the year, we have decided to tighten our forecast estimates. 
For the full year, we expect comparable hotel RevPARs to increase 6% to 7.5% with adjusted operating profit margin increasing 90 to 120 basis points. This operating forecast, combined with our acquisition activity, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.20 billion to $1.50 billion. The midpoint of this guidance is $7.5 million higher than our first quarter estimate. We project FFO per diluted share of $0.87 to $0.91, which has been reduced by $0.03 per share for acquisitions, debt repayments and impairment costs. 
Turning to our dividend. We increased our second quarter common dividend to $0.03 per share. As operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increased the dividend over the next 2 quarters, resulting in a full year common dividend of approximately $0.14 to $0.15 per share. 
In closing, while the overhang of uncertainty regarding national and international debt issues continues to cloud the economic outlook, the fundamentals of our business remain attractive. Transient demand has recovered to prior peak levels, and group demand continues to improve. As RevPAR is increasingly driven by improvements in average rate, margin growth and flow-through will accelerate. Additions to supply has been restrained and will likely remain well below historical levels for at least the next 3 years. Construction costs are beginning to increase again, which will further help limit new supply. A combination of firming construction pricing and changes in our portfolio lead us to estimate the replacement cost for our portfolio at over $400,000 per key. Given that our current market valuation is roughly $260,000 per key, this suggests that there is a very solid upside for our market valuation over the next 2 years. We will continue to be aggressive but disciplined as we evaluate new investments to further enhance the value of our company. 
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Consistent with the first quarter, our top-performing market for the second quarter was San Francisco with a RevPAR increase of 17%. Strong transient demand contributed to an occupancy increase of nearly 6 percentage points, which led to an improvement of 8.5% in ADR. The ADR growth was driven by both Corporate and Special Corporate rate increases. We expect RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the third quarter due to excellent group and transient demand and further ADR increases.
As expected, our hotels in Hawaii continue to perform exceptionally well with a RevPAR increase of 16.5%. ADR increased nearly 15% due to a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated transient and group business. We expect to slightly underperformed the portfolio in the third quarter due to some disruption from renovation activity. Our Tampa hotels also had an excellent quarter as RevPAR increased to 15.7%, driven by more than an 8% improvement in ADR and a 5 percentage point improvement in occupancy. Transient demand was exceptional. We expect our Tampa hotels to perform very well in the third quarter due to strong group bookings.
Our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels had a great quarter with RevPAR up 14.9%. ADR improved 5.6%, and occupancy increased nearly 7 percentage points as transient demand was very strong allowing the hotel to increase ADR. We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to have a great third quarter and to outperform the portfolio because of strong group demand, which should drive a significant increase in ADR. 
The Phoenix market continues to recover. RevPAR increased 11.3% as ADR improved nearly 10%, and occupancy increased 1 percentage point. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. We expect the Phoenix market to significantly outperform our portfolio in the third quarter due to strong group demand and growth in both group and transient rates, particularly at the Western Kierland, which will benefit from the new ballroom. 
Our San Diego hotels had another good quarter with a RevPAR increase of 9.2%, which was much better than our expectations. The outperformance was driven by an occupancy improvement of nearly 7 percentage points as both transient and group demand increased. For the third quarter, we expect our San Diego hotels to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of group business, which will result in weak transient pricing through the summer months. 
RevPAR for our Chicago hotels increased by 6.7%, driven solely by improvements in average rate. Higher transient demand offset lower levels of group business, and our hotels benefited from a shift in the mix of transient business to higher-rated category. We expect the Chicago market to perform very well in the third quarter.
Due to the continuing renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers, as well as the impact of additional supply in the city, RevPAR for our New York hotels increased only 2.9% as ADR improved over 11%, while occupancy fell roughly 7 percentage points. We expect RevPAR for our New York hotels to improve significantly for the rest of the year. 
RevPAR for our Washington, D.C. hotels increased 2.5%. ADR increased nearly 4%, and occupancy fell roughly 1 percentage point. Results were affected by Congress' implementation of the district and continuing concerns surrounding the budget and debt ceiling, which led to less government and government-related group and transient business. Our urban hotels performed much better than the suburbs with a RevPAR increase in excess of 5%. We expect the DC market to continue to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter. However, our urban hotels will continue to significantly outperform the suburban hotels. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels decreased 0.4% with a slight increase in occupancy and a 1.2% drop in ADR. Results were negatively affected by the overall lack of citywide and group demand. Our Boston hotels are expected to continue to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to lower levels of group demand.
Lastly, our worst performing market for the second quarter was Philadelphia as RevPAR fell 2.4%, primarily due to the disruption from the renovation of the ballroom and guestrooms at the Philadelphia Marriott. RevPAR fell as occupancy declined over 8 percentage points, while ADR increased nearly 9%. We expect the Philadelphia market to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter as the renovation wraps up and group demand increases.
Year-to-date, San Francisco has been our best performing market with a RevPAR increase of 20.2%, followed by Hawaii with a RevPAR increase of 17.4%, San Diego with a 14.9% increase and Houston with an 11.6% increase. Our worst performing markets have been Philadelphia with a RevPAR decrease of 7.5% and New York City with a 0.9% increase. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant Euros increased 10.1% for the quarter as 7 of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases led by the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Western in Regina and the Brussels Marriott. Occupancy increased 3.5 percentage points, and ADR increased over 5%. Group demand was quite strong as it increased over 14% primarily to improvements in Tours and travel group demand. Group ADR increased 4.1%, resulting in roughly a 19% increase in group revenues. Transient demand was up 1%, and average rates were up over 6%, leading to a 7.4% increase in transient revenues. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant Euros improved 10%.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 115 basis points. The business disruption from our capital program continues to have a negative impact on our margins. The renovations of the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers and the Philadelphia Marriott reduced our margin growth for the quarter by 40 basis points. 
Food and beverage flow-through was roughly 24% for the quarter. The renovation at the Sheraton and Philadelphia Marriott also had a significant negative impact on food and beverage flow-through, which would have been 10 percentage points higher, excluding those 2 hotels. Unallocated cost increased 4%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses at our variable revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocation. Utility costs increased 5%. 
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the RevPAR increase to continue to be driven more by rate growth and occupancy, which should lead to strong rooms flow through even with growth in wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increasing group demand, as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth and bank with an audiovisual revenues and solid F&B flow-through. We expect unallocated cost to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities where we expect higher growth due to an increase in both rates and volume and sales and marketing costs where higher revenues will increase costs. 
We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation, and property insurance to increase well in excess of inflation due to increase in insurable values and Premium increases in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 90 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 120 basis points at the high end of the range.
In February, shortly after we close on the acquisition of 7 hotels in New Zealand, the City of Christchurch experienced an earthquake that caused considerable damage. Two of the hotels in the acquired portfolio, Novotel and, totaling 348 rooms were damaged and are in the government-declared red zone that has limited access. The 2 properties represent less than 25% of the value of the portfolio. We have engaged structural engineers to prepare comprehensive formal assessments. Progress in the government-declared red zone is slow. We are hoping that our properties will reopen in mid to late 2012. We believe we have adequate insurance as part of the New Zealand's insurance program to cover the property damage, and we recorded an expense in the second quarter of USD $3.2 million, which is the maximum amount of the deductible. 
Coverage period for business interruption is 36 months for the Novotel and 24 months for the. While we ultimately expect to be compensated for the business interruption loss, we have not included any such proceeds in our results of operations in our guidance. 
During the quarter, we raised approximately $190 million under our continuous equity offering program to fund acquisitions. We also issued $500 million of senior notes that bear interest at 5 7/8% and have an 8-year maturity. These notes have the lowest coupon of any bond we have ever issued. In the second quarter, we used some of the bond proceeds to redeem the remaining $250 million of 7 1/8% Series K senior notes and repay the $50 million draw on our credit facility. We also called $150 million of our 2004 exchangeable debentures, $134 million of which were exchanged for approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock and approximately $60 million of which were redeemed for cash after the end of the second quarter. We currently have $175 million of the 2004 exchangeable debentures outstanding. 
Lastly, subsequent to quarter end, we transferred the Le Meridien Piccadilly and related property level debt to our European Joint Venture Fund II. When combined with the exchangeable debentures transaction and an additional $41 million credit facility repayment, our outstanding debt balance dropped approximately $300 million to $5.6 billion subsequent to quarter end. We ended the quarter with over $630 million in cash and cash equivalents, and we have over $475 million of capacity on our credit facility, which matures in September of this year. But we have the right to extend the facility to September 2012 as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
There is one last item worth noting related to the accounting for deferred tax liabilities for our Euro JV Fund I. In conjunction with the establishment of the Euro JV Fund II, we extended the life of Fund I. The 5-year extension of the fund requires us to record an additional deferred tax liability in the third quarter. This additional liability is a noncash charge that reduces FFO by $5 million for our pro-rata portion of the JV's tax expense. 
Similar to all income statement items related to the JV, the charge will be reflected in the equity and earnings of affiliates, not an income tax expense in our statement of operations. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

I mean, there's no doubt that the downtown area has outperformed the suburbs this year. I think as you Larry may have commented in his comments that our RevPAR growth in the city was about twice the level that we had for the market overall. As we look at D.C. this year, there is obviously clear that DC's sees underperforming a bit. I think that there's a variety of reasons for that. I think one, fundamentally is that the DC market did not fall as much as the number of other markets or there's less of a rebound effect there. I think this year we've seen we have seen and felt pain from all of the disarray in the federal government around both the budget issues that related to this year's budget, as well as the current concerns relating to extending the debt amount, the debt ceiling as well as what that may mean going forward. The consequence of that uncertainty has been that government, which represents call it 15% to 20% of our business in the Washington area, government has not booked rooms, especially group rooms, at the level that they had in the past. And so as a result, we've seen a little bit of a group decline in Washington and in most other markets, we've seen a little bit of a group increase. So I think that accounts for a large amount of the decline. I think there is a weakness rather, and I think the other point to pick up, which as some of you have already commented on is that this is, as I already described, it's a little bit higher government market than what we normally experience. And with government per diem rate down this year compared to last year, that's also been a little bit of a wind that D.C. is fighting against. Leaving out the problems for this year, we firmly believe that Washington is a great market to invest in. If you look at Washington over the course of call it the 10 years ending in '08 before we went into the downturn or the severe part of the downturn, Washington was really one of the best markets in the country to be invested in. Working its way through the downturn, it fell far less than any of the other markets across the country. It has recovered quickly. It is generally, at least for our portfolio, we are back to '07 levels. And as we look forward and look at Washington, while it is true that this year is a bit weaker, we see the outlook in a very positive fashion. The Convention Center that Washington has is one of the best on the Eastern Coast of the United States. It is the projected bookings for that Convention Center especially as you look out to '15, '16 and '17 are very attractive. Just as importantly, there's a lot of activity happening in downtown Washington that is some of that what I referenced my comments is happening immediately across the street from our new asset. There's a lot going on that's making Washington a more exciting city and more of a 24-hour city, all of which we think is only going to drive better results at our hotels over the course of the next decade. So at the end, clearly, Washington's going through a little bit of a soft patch. I think next year, election years are actually tend to be decent in Washington, but I think the current next year that we'll be fighting is a little bit weaker convention business. But I think once you get past '12, we are very optimistic about the outlook for the future beyond that. Speaking specifically about the hotel, we think we've got a great hotel in one of the best locations in Washington. From our perspective looking at owning that much of simple property in the heart of D.C., we think that we're buying this at probably at 10% discount to replacement cost. And that's a little bit richer than where some of the other transactions we have done have been completed at. But now the other thing I would point out with this particular acquisition is you may remember that we also own the Capitol Hill Hyatt. And one of the benefits we think we see of owning the 2 hotels is as we've been able to do another markets, we think there will be an opportunity especially because it's the same brand to take advantage of some synergies, combine some positions and enhance cooperation between the hotels, which will not only help this hotel but will also help our other Hyatt overall in New Jersey Avenue."

So that's actually been stronger performance in Europe than what we had seen in the United States. So despite the fact that those issues have been out there for quite some time, the performance in Europe both in the souther markets, Spain and Italy, which are some of the countries that get talked about, as well as the Northern markets has been quite strong. I would say in general that one of the reasons why we're seeing that is in the Northern European countries, I think the results are driven a little bit more by stronger economic growth. In the Southern European countries, despite their economic concerns that those countries have and the fact that they are caught up in some of the same issues that Greece is facing although not yet quite to the same degree, those markets, the lodging industry is also driven by, to a great degree, by tourism. And as a result, we've seen a big increase in tour groups throughout Europe this year. I think that a better economy in the rest of the world has ultimately contributed to better results in Europe. So I think we may see that can moderate a little bit for the second half of the year only as we start to move out of the tourist season. But the bottom line is that so far, we've got our fingers crossed on this. Europe seems to be holding up relatively well."

And then our bookings in that last 90 days before our quarter was going to begin were incredibly robust, and that usually you what was driving that subsequent quarter to turn out to be better than the prior year. This year, what we have found is that we're coming into every quarter ahead of where we have been. But the bookings in that quarter while they're still well ahead of what we would have had in '06 and '07 and the magnitude of 40% to 50% better than what we would have had in those prior years were not quite as robust as last year. But the bookings looking further out say, looking 2 quarters out, 3 and 4 quarters out have been stronger. And so I think while you'll still get if you talk to an individual GM, they will all tell you that it's still a short bookings cycle. And they're right because they're all booking more than the normal amount of business in a relatively near-term time period when the event happened. The reality is that as you look at the data, more and more rooms are being booked 6 months, 9 months, 12 months out as we start slowly work our way to back to a more normal bookings cycle."

The first is if you leave out the renovation impacts on the 2 hotels that we've been commenting on, the Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott, and you look at our performance in the first half of the year, we are running at a RevPAR rate in the first half that was over 7%. So as we think about the second half of the year and we recognize that our renovation disruption should go down a bit, we think it's just to run at the same level as the first half would suggest that the second half of the year is going to run over 7%. I think as we also feel that as we look at the group booking pace as it carries into the second half of the year, it does seem to be a little bit stronger. The rate does seem to be growing. So that gives us a fair amount of confidence that things should be a little bit better. Now the trickiest part of this whole process is to try to assess the economy. If you look at the blue-chip consensus and use that as at least a measure of how folks are looking at the economy, they're essentially calling for better than 3% GDP growth in the second half of the year compared to about 2% in the first half of the year. So if that's true, that should clearly help us in general because, of course, our industry is dependent on economic growth. As we look at business investment, while the outlook for business investment is a bit more conservative than where it was at the beginning of the year, it is still quite robust. That, in our mind, has been one of the factors behind a strong transient demand and rate growth that we've seen. Now we don't see any reason why that's going to slow a little bit. So I think at the end of the day, if you put all those factors together and especially as you look at the fourth quarter, which is where our forecasts are showing the most strength, we generally think that we're going to be in much better shape than the second half than the first."

So I think all in all, as we look out over the next 3 years, we're looking at spending somewhere between $10 million and $12 million. So there's nothing material that's associated with that acquisition that we feel we need to do. One of our opportunities, which is the one place where this could get more expensive is that we would do want to carefully think through the food and beverage platform of that hotel. And some of the changes that are happening in the immediate neighborhood offer us some opportunities that perhaps generate higher profit to put in restaurants or other activities that might be better profit-generating to what we have today.

But my recollection is that the revenue number came in relatively close to where the revenues were ahead at the beginning of the quarter. I think what we've found is that we ended up with a little bit fewer room nights than what we saw. I think we were positive on the room night side coming into the quarter, and we booked less in the quarter for the quarter than we had the prior year. So that declined a bit. But the good news is as the business all shifted around, the overall rate improvement that we experienced in the second quarter was better than we have forecasted. So we ended up in a roughly 4.5% revenue improvement that we had. I should note too is I don't want to overdo the commentary regarding shares in New York and Philadelphia. But as I have found trying to understand how we're doing is that sometimes pulling those assets out just because of the level of distribution there gives me better insight as to how the company is doing. If you look at the group side and you take those 2 assets out, what you find is the group demand was up over a point. Leaving out those 2 assets and the overall revenue growth was higher than what I described, in part because both of those hotels are big group hotels, especially Philadelphia. And they just weren't able to do the level of group business that they normally would have done. So as you think about your question, which I think is a really good way to think about it for the third and fourth quarter, what I would probably be expecting is that we might find that in the third quarter, our group room nights is a little less than the 3% we're running ahead right now. Although we have healthy rate growth in the third quarter. So I think bottom line is that the overall results for the third quarter for group should be fairly positive. The fourth quarter I would still expect to see continuing a trend that we've seen all year. I would like to expect that we will find that there'll be more rooms booked going into the fourth quarter when we are talking to you in October than what we have right now because the pace sort of a quarter out or so has still been pretty good. So I would expect to see some additional strength in the fourth quarter."

And then I guess the only other thing was just as you think about the renovation that obviously you guys are doing this in anticipation of getting some kind of additional or incremental performance. But getting those hotels back in kind of into the overall mix should boost your RevPAR at least in the New York and Philadelphia area. So I guess what I'm wondering is have you kind of implicit in your forecast, is there additional improvement coming out of those hotels because of the renovations or is it simply that they go back to market averages and that if there was additional upside based on what you spend that, that wouldn't really be contemplated in what you're guiding to today?"

So we are looking at -- we expect to see good RevPAR growth from that hotel for the rest of that year. Some of that is New York. Some of that is the fact that new rooms that we've done in that hotel spectacular especially compared to the rooms that we had before. So there I think we are probably getting some of the work we're doing. In the case of Philadelphia, one point I want to clarify is that we finished the main tower, the main building, which is the bulk of the hotel rooms there. But we still have the expansion that we did in that hotel about a decade ago called the head. We still have the rooms to do there. So Philadelphia will not be completely done until the fourth quarter. I think the combination of the new rooms and the new meeting space is clearly going to make that hotel that much more attractive, and so we'll see some good lift. It's unfortunate in some way that the timing of this renovation, we've been doing the Philadelphia renovation to be ready for the expansion at the Convention Center, and a tremendous amount of group business is going to hit next year. This year has also turned out to be a very solid year in Philadelphia. And I think Larry had told me that if you hold Philadelphia, our Philadelphia Hotel out of our Philadelphia results, our Philadelphia RevPAR would be up 9% this past quarter. So it gives you a sense of the pain we're feeling to have a construction going on at this point in time. But at the end of the day, it's better to be ready for next year than it was to delay the renovation and then hurt herself what we think will be a very strong group year especially when we have the best situated group hotel in the market for convention business."

But I think you've correctly analyzed it that we would expect the fourth quarter to be stronger than the third quarter. I think that there's probably I would have 2 basic reasons for that. One is that I think that the current issues that are floating around out there probably have a little bit more effect on Q3 than Q4. And I think the economic outlook for Q4 for most people seems to be a bit more positive. The other point that I would make on that is that not only do we expect the renovations that we've been doing this year to moderate a bit at least in terms of the 2 significant projects that we've been identifying. But as you circle back to last year, you may or may not remember that our investment spend, our capital spending in Q4 of last year was considerably larger than what we had done in Q1, 2, 3. And so as we think about overlapping that year with the fourth quarter of 2011, we sort of view that there was construction disruption last year that was one of the reasons why our fourth quarter was a little bit weaker than you might have anticipated, given the way the rest of the year had played out. We will get the benefit of that sort of relative weakness as we come into the fourth quarter this year. So for both of those reasons, we would expect the fourth quarter to be stronger, and I think the big question's going to be how much."

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results, which were driven by improvements in transient demand and substantial average rate growth. We have also been successful in placing 2 great hotels located in very desirable markets under contract, one in our consolidated portfolio and one in our European joint venture fund. 
First, let's talk about our second quarter results. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 6.7%, driven by an improvement in our average rate of 5%, combined with an occupancy increase of 1.1 percentage points. Our average rate was $184, and our average occupancy was 75.2%. 
As we discussed last quarter, we expected our operating results to be significantly impacted by substantial renovations at our Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott hotels in the second quarter. Excluding results from these hotels, our RevPAR increase for the quarter would have been 7.6%. In addition, it is worth noting that our comparable hotel results do not include the performance of the $1.7 billion of acquisitions we have completed over the last 12 months, which are performing exceptionally well and have generated an average RevPAR increase of over 18% for the quarter. 
Comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of 4.4% contributed to overall revenue growth of 5.6%. This increase, when combined with our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increase of 115 basis points and our acquisition activity, resulted in a 25% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $313 million for the second quarter and a 30% increase in FFO per diluted share of $0.30. FFO for this quarter was negatively impacted by a $0.01 per share for acquisition and debt repayment costs, as well as a noncash impairment charge. 
On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.1% driven primarily by rate improvement. Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 5.2%, combined with operating profit margins that increased 65 basis points, resulted in a year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $457 million, representing an increase of 22% and FFO per diluted share of $0.41. Year-to-date, FFO per diluted share was negatively affected by $0.02, for acquisitions, debt repayment and impairment costs.
Our business mix trends for the quarter were quite favorable as we saw strong demand increases from our higher-rated customer segment and solid rate growth across the board. Rate growth in Q2, driven by exceptional growth in transient demand, was the best we had seen since 2007. Overall, transient room nights for the quarter increased more than 3%, led by a nearly 7.5% increase in Special Corporate demand and a more than 3% increase in our Premium Corporate segment. 
Reflecting the changes in our mix, discount room nights increased just over 1%. On the rate side, Special Corporate rate increases of more than 6% helped to improve our average transient rate by more than 5% leading to overall transient revenue growth of more than 8.5%. 
Group demand for the quarter was essentially flat with last year, as increases in Corporate and association business were essentially offset by reductions in discount group. The growth on these higher-priced segments was even more pronounced in our luxury hotel, where they grew by more than 16%, leading to a luxury group room night increase of more than 8%. The combination of positive mix shift and rate increases in all 3 segments drove group rates up by 4.7%, which represents more than twice the rate of increase in Q1. Overall, group revenues were up by almost 4.5%. 
Looking at the remainder of the year, our group booking pace continues to be positive with third quarter takes up more than 3% and fourth quarter up nearly 2%, and average rates are higher in both quarters. While not recurring at last year's accelerated pace, short-term bookings are still quite strong by historical standards, and we are seeing signs that the booking window is starting to lengthen, as our pace for 2012 is well ahead of last year's level. 
In addition, our transient booking pace is quite strong. It reflects an average demand increase of more than 7% for the next 4 months. Stronger advance booking, especially at our larger hotels, is certainly a positive sign and will be very helpful at our -- in our hotel manager's efforts to push transient rates higher in the future. 
On the investment front, we have 2 new transactions to discuss. First, as we reported this morning, we signed an agreement to acquire the 888-room Grand Hyatt Washington for $442 million. The hotel is located at the heart of downtown Washington, D.C., just 2 blocks from the city's Convention Center and convenient to over 40 million square feet of office space, the Verizon Center, the National Mall and the Smithsonian museums. 
In addition, the hotel is located opposite of the city's old Convention Center site, which is being redeveloped into over 300,000 square feet of retail space, more than a 1 million square feet of office space and 700 residential units. The hotel includes over 43,000 square feet of meeting space, including a 17,000-square-foot ballroom and an 8,500-square-foot junior ballroom. We are pleased to acquire another hotel in D.C., which is a historically top-performing market with a diversified demand base.
Turning to our European joint venture. As we discussed last quarter, we completed an expansion of our joint venture through the establishment of a new fund, with approximately €1 billion in investment capacity. As part of the expansion, we transferred the Le Méridien Piccadilly to this new fund in June. 
In addition, the joint venture signed an agreement to acquire its first acquisition in France, the 396-room Pullman Bercy hotel for €96 million. The hotel is located in Paris, near the banks of the Seine River, in a newly redeveloped neighborhood that includes high-end office buildings and one of Paris' largest railway stations and the French Ministry of Finance. The hotel has 17 media rooms, totaling more than 19,000 square feet. We will continue to look for acquisitions that meet our investment criteria and believe we are in a great position to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as they arise. 
With that being said, given the unpredictability of the timing of these transactions, our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. On the disposition front, our forecast assumes only the sales of South Bend Marriott in the third quarter, a non-core asset which required significant capital investment. 
During the quarter, we invested $75 million in return-on-investment projects, including the completion of the first phase of our redevelopment project at the Sheraton New York and Sheraton Indianapolis hotels, as well as an updated and expanded meeting platform at the St. Regis in Houston. For the full year, we expect to spend $220 million to $240 million on these types of projects. 
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $71 million in the second quarter, which included a completion of the phase-one renovation of 991 rooms at the New York Marriott Marquis. We also concluded the renovation of the meeting space and main tower rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown. For the year, we expect to spend approximately $320 million to $345 million on maintenance capital expenditures. 
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and we are expecting improved performance in the second half of the year, due to less disruption from renovation at our hotels, an improving macroeconomic outlook relative to the first half of the year and solid group bookings for the third and fourth quarters. With that in mind and given that we are past the midpoint of the year, we have decided to tighten our forecast estimates. 
For the full year, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR to increase 6% to 7.5% with adjusted operating profit margins increasing 90 to 120 basis points. This operating forecast, combined with our acquisition activity, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.020 billion to $1.050 billion. The midpoint of this guidance is $7.5 million higher than our first quarter estimate. We project FFO per diluted share of $0.87 to $0.91, which has been reduced by $0.03 per share for acquisitions, debt repayment and impairment costs. 
Turning to our dividend. We increased our second quarter common dividend to $0.03 per share. As operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increased the dividend over the next 2 quarters, resulting in a full year common dividend of approximately $0.14 to $0.15 per share. 
In closing, while the overhang of uncertainty regarding national and international debt issues continues to cloud the economic outlook, the fundamentals of our business remain attractive. Transient demand has recovered to prior peak levels, and group demand continues to improve. As RevPAR is increasingly driven by improvements in average rate, margin growth and flow-through will accelerate. Additions to supply has been restrained and will likely remain well below historical levels for at least the next 3 years. Construction costs are beginning to increase again, which will further help limit new supply. 
The combination of firming construction pricing and changes in our portfolio lead us to estimate the replacement cost for our portfolio at over $400,000 per key. Given that our current market valuation is roughly $260,000 per key, this suggests that there is a very solid upside for our market valuation over the next 2 years. We will continue to be aggressive but disciplined as we evaluate new investments to further enhance the value of our company. 
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Consistent with the first quarter, our top-performing market for the second quarter was San Francisco, with a RevPAR increase of 17%. Strong transient demand contributed to an occupancy increase of nearly 6 percentage points, which led to an improvement of 8.5% in ADR. The ADR growth was driven by both Corporate and Special Corporate rate increases. We expect RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the third quarter, due to excellent group and transient demand and further ADR increases.
As expected, our hotels in Hawaii continued to perform exceptionally well, with a RevPAR increase of 16.5%. ADR increased nearly 15% due to a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated transient and group business. We expect Hawaii to slightly underperform the portfolio in the third quarter, due to some disruption from renovation activity. 
Our Tampa hotels also had an excellent quarter, as RevPAR increased 15.7%, driven by more than an 8% improvement in ADR and a 5-percentage-point improvement in occupancy. Transient demand was exceptional. We expect our Tampa hotels to perform very well in the third quarter due to strong group bookings.
Our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels had a great quarter, with RevPAR up 14.9%. ADR improved 5.6%, and occupancy increased nearly 7 percentage points as transient demand was very strong, allowing the hotels to increase ADR. We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to have a great third quarter and to outperform the portfolio because of strong group demand, which should drive a significant increase in ADR. 
The Phoenix market continues to recover. RevPAR increased 11.3% as ADR improved nearly 10%, and occupancy increased 1 percentage point. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. We expect the Phoenix market to significantly outperform our portfolio in the third quarter, due to strong group demand and growth in both group and transient rates, particularly at the Westin Kierland, which will benefit from the new ballroom. 
Our San Diego hotels had another good quarter with a RevPAR increase of 9.2%, which was much better than our expectations. The outperformance was driven by an occupancy improvement of nearly 7 percentage points as both transient and group demand increased. For the third quarter, we expect our San Diego hotels to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of group business, which will result in weak transient pricing due the summer months. 
RevPAR for our Chicago hotels increased by 6.7%, driven solely by improvements in average rate. Higher transient demand offset lower levels of group business, and our hotels benefited from a shift in the mix of transient business to higher-rated category. We expect the Chicago market to perform very well in the third quarter.
Due to the continuing renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, as well as the impact of additional supply in the city, RevPAR for our New York hotels increased only 2.9%, as ADR improved over 11% while occupancy fell roughly 7 percentage points. We expect RevPAR for our New York hotels to improve significantly for the rest of the year. 
RevPAR for our Washington, D.C. hotels increased 2.5%. ADR increased nearly 4%, and occupancy fell roughly 1 percentage point. Results were affected by Congress' implementation of district weeks and continuing concerns surrounding the budget and debt ceiling, which led to less government and government-related group and transient business. Our urban hotels performed much better than the suburbs, with a RevPAR increase in excess of 5%. We expect the D.C. market to continue to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter. However, our urban hotels will continue to significantly outperform the suburban hotels. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels decreased 0.4%, with a slight increase in occupancy and a 1.2% drop in ADR. Results were negatively affected by the overall lack of citywide and group demand. Our Boston hotels are expected to continue to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to lower levels of group demand.
Lastly, our worst-performing market for the second quarter was Philadelphia as RevPAR fell 2.4%, primarily due to the disruption from the renovation of ballroom and guestrooms at the Philadelphia Marriott. RevPAR fell as occupancy declined over 8 percentage points, while ADR increased nearly 9%. We expect the Philadelphia market to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter as the renovation wraps up and group demand increases.
Year-to-date, San Francisco has been our best-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 20.2%, followed by Hawaii with a RevPAR increase of 17.4%, San Diego with a 14.9% increase and Houston with an 11.6% increase. Our worst-performing markets have been Philadelphia with a RevPAR decrease of 7.5% and New York City with a 0.9% increase. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR, calculated in constant euros, increased 10.1% for the quarter as 7 of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases, led by the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Western Europa & Regina and the Brussels Marriott. Occupancy increased 3.5 percentage points, and ADR increased over 5%. Group demand was quite strong as it increased over 14%, primarily to improvements in tour and travel group demand. Group ADR increased 4.1%, resulting in roughly a 19% increase in group revenues. Transient demand was up 1% and average rates were up over 6%, leading to a 7.4% increase in transient revenues. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros improved 10%.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 115 basis points. The business disruption from our capital program continued to have a negative impact on our margins. The renovations of the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers and the Philadelphia Marriott reduced our margin growth for the quarter by 40 basis points. 
Food and beverage flow-through was roughly 24% for the quarter. The renovation at the Sheraton and Philadelphia Marriott also had a significant negative impact on food and beverage flow-through, which would have been 10 percentage points higher, excluding those 2 hotels. Unallocated costs increased 4%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that our variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared-service allocation. Utility costs increased 5%. 
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the RevPAR increase to continue to be driven more by rate growth and occupancy, which should lead to strong rooms flow-through even with growth in wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increasing group demand, as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid F&B flow-through. We expect unallocated costs to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, where we expect higher growth due to an increase in both rates and volume, and sales and marketing costs, where higher revenues will increase costs. 
We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation and property insurance to increase well in excess of inflation, due to increase in insurable values and premium increases in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 90 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 120 basis points at the high end of the range.
In February, shortly after we closed on the acquisition of 7 hotels in New Zealand, the city of Christchurch experienced an earthquake that caused considerable damage. Two of the hotels in the acquired portfolio, a Novotel and an ibis, totaling 348 rooms, were damaged and are in the government-declared red zone that has limited access. The 2 properties represent less than 25% of the value of the portfolio. We have engaged structural engineers to prepare comprehensive formal assessments. Progress in the government-declared red zone is slow. 
We are hoping that our properties will reopen in mid to late 2012. We believe we have adequate insurance as part of Accor's New Zealand insurance program to cover the property damage, and we recorded an expense in the second quarter of USD $3.2 million, which is the maximum amount of the deductible. Coverage period for business interruption is 36 months for the Novotel and 24 months for the ibis. While we ultimately expect to be compensated for the business interruption loss, we have not included any such proceeds in our results of operations or in our guidance. 
During the quarter, we raised approximately $190 million under our continuous equity offering program to fund acquisitions. We also issued $500 million of senior notes that bear interest at 5 7/8% and have an 8-year maturity. These notes have the lowest coupon of any bond we have ever issued. In the second quarter, we used some of the bond proceeds to redeem the remaining $250 million of 7 1/8% Series K senior notes and repaid a $50 million drawn on our credit facility. 
We also called $150 million of our 2004 exchangeable debentures, $134 million of which were exchanged for approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock and approximately $16 million of which were redeemed for cash after the end of the second quarter. We currently have $175 million of the 2004 exchangeable debentures outstanding. 
Lastly, subsequent to quarter end, we transferred the Le Méridien Piccadilly and related property level debt to our European Joint Venture Fund II. When combined with the exchangeable debenture transaction and an additional $41 million credit facility repayment, our outstanding debt balance dropped approximately $300 million to $5.6 billion subsequent to quarter end. 
We ended the quarter with over $630 million in cash and cash equivalents, and we have over $475 million of capacity on our credit facility, which matures in the September of this year. But we have the right to extend the facility to September 2012, as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
There is one last item worth noting related to the accounting for our deferred tax liabilities for our Euro JV Fund I. In conjunction with the establishment of the Euro JV Fund II, we extended the life of Fund I. The 5-year extension of the fund requires us to record an additional deferred tax liability in the third quarter. This additional liability is a noncash charge that reduces FFO by $5 million for our pro-rata portion of the JV's tax expense. Similar to all income statement items related to the JV, the charge will be reflected in the equity and earnings of affiliates, not in income tax expense in our statement of operations. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

I mean, there's no doubt that the downtown area has outperformed the suburbs this year. I think as you -- I think Larry may have commented in his comments that our RevPAR growth in the city was about twice the level that we had for the market overall. As we look at D.C. this year, there is obviously clear that D.C. is underperforming a bit. I think that there's a variety of reasons for that. I think, one, fundamentally, is that the D.C. market did not fall as much as the number of other markets, so there is less of a rebound effect there. I think that this year we've seen -- we have seen and felt the pain from all of the disarray in the federal government around both the budget issues that related to this year's budget, as well as the current concerns relating to extending the debt amount, that -- the debt ceiling, as well as what that may mean going forward. And the consequence of that uncertainty has been that government, which represents, call it, 15% to 20% of our business in the Washington area, government has not booked rooms, especially group rooms, at the level that they had in the past. And so as a result, we've seen a little bit of a group decline in Washington, and in most other markets, we've seen a little bit of a group increase. So I think that accounts for a large amount of the decline. But I think there is a weakness rather. And I think the other point to pick up, which some of you have already commented on is that this is as I already described, it's a little bit higher-government market than what we normally experience. And with government per diem rate down this year compared to last year, that's also been a little bit of a wind that D.C. is fighting against. Leaving out the problems for this year, we firmly believe that Washington is a great market to invest in. If you look at Washington over the course of, call it, the 10 years ending in '08, before we went into the downturn or the severe part of the downturn, Washington was really one of the best markets in the country to be invested in. Working its way through the downturn, it fell at -- it fell far less than any of the other markets across the country. It has recovered quickly. It is generally, at least for our portfolio, we are back to '07 levels. And as we look forward and look at Washington, while it is true that this year is a bit weaker, we see the outlook in a very positive fashion. The Convention Center that Washington has is one of the best on the eastern coast of the United States. It is the -- the projected bookings for that Convention Center, especially as you look out to '15, '16 and '17, are very attractive. Just as importantly, there's a lot of activity happening in downtown Washington that is make -- and some of that, who I referenced in my comments, is happening immediately across the street from our new asset. There's a lot going on that's making Washington a more exciting city and more of a 24-hour city, all of which we think is only going to drive better results at our hotels over the course of the next decade. So at the end, that clearly Washington's going through a little bit of a soft patch. I think next year -- election years are actually tend to be decent in Washington, but I think the current next year that we'll be fighting is a little bit weaker convention business. But I think once you get past '12, we are very optimistic about the outlook for the future beyond that. Speaking specifically about the hotel, we think we've got a great hotel in one of the best locations in Washington. From our perspective, looking at owning that much of fee-simple property in the heart of D.C., we think that we're buying this at probably at 10% discount to replacement cost, and that's a little bit richer than is where some of the other transactions we have done have been completed at. But now the other thing I would point out with this particular acquisition is, you may remember, that we also own the Capitol Hill Hyatt. And one of the benefits, we think, we see of owning the 2 hotels is as we've been able to do in other markets, we think there will be an opportunity, especially because it's the same brand, to take advantage of some synergies, combine some positions and enhance cooperation between the hotels, which will not only help this hotel but will also help our other Hyatt over on New Jersey Avenue."

So that's actually been stronger performance in Europe than what we have seen in the United States. So despite the fact that those talks -- those issues have been out there for quite some time, the performance in Europe, both in the southern markets, Spain and Italy, which are some of the countries that get talked about, as well as the northern markets, has been quite strong. I would say, in general, that one of the reasons why we're seeing that is that in the northern European countries, I think the results are driven a little bit more by stronger economic growth. In the southern European countries, despite their economic concerns that those countries have and the fact that they are caught up in some of the same issues that Greece is facing, although not yet quite to the same degree, those markets, the lodging industry, is also driven by, to a great degree, by tourism. And as a result, we've seen a big increase in tour groups throughout Europe this year. I think that a better economy in the rest of the world has ultimately contributed to better results in Europe. So I think we may see that trend moderate a little bit for the second half of the year, only as we start to move out of the tourist seasons. But the bottom line is that, so far, we got our fingers crossed on this, Europe seems to be holding up relatively well."

And that usually what was driving that subsequent quarter to turn out to be better than the prior year. This year, what we have found is that we are -- that we're coming into every quarter ahead of where we have been. But the bookings in that quarter, while they're still well ahead of what we would have had in '06 and '07 and a magnitude of 40% to 50% better than what we would have had in those prior years, well, they not quite as robust as last year. But the bookings, looking further out, say, looking 2 quarters out, 3 and 4 quarters out, have been stronger. And so I think while you'll still get -- if you talk to an individual GM, they will all tell you that it's still a short booking cycle. And they're right because they're all booking more than the normal amount of business in a relatively near-term time period to when the event happened. The reality is that as you look at the data, more and more rooms are being booked 6 months, 9 months, 12 months out as we start slowly to work our way to back to a more normal booking cycle."

The first is if you leave out the renovation impacts on the 2 hotels that we've been commenting on, the Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott, and you look at our performance in the first half of the year, we were running at a RevPAR rate in the first half that was over 7%. So as we think about the second half of the year and we recognize that our renovation disruption should go down a bit, we think it's -- just as -- just to run at the same level as the first half would suggest that the second half of the year is going to run over 7%. I think as we also feel that as we look at the group booking pace as it carries into the second half of the year, it does seem to be a little bit stronger. The rate does seem to be growing. So that gives us a fair amount of confidence that things should be a little bit better. The trickiest part of this whole process is to try to assess the economy. If you look at the blue-chip consensus and use that as, at least, a measure of how folks are looking at the economy, they're essentially calling for better than 3% GDP growth in the second half of the year compared to about 2% in the first half of the year. So if that's true, that should clearly help us in general because, of course, our industry is dependent on economic growth. As we look at business investment, while that -- while the outlook for business investment is a bit more conservative than where it was at the beginning of the year, it is still quite robust. That, in our mind, has been one of the factors behind a strong transient demand and rate growth that we've seen. Now we don't see any reason why that's going to slow a little bit. So I think at the end of the day, you put all those factors together and especially as you look at the fourth quarter, which is where our forecast are showing the most strength, we generally think that we're going to be in much better shape in the second half of the year than the first."

But my recollection is that the revenue number came in relatively close to where -- if the revenues were ahead at the beginning of the quarter. I think what we've found is that we ended up with a little bit fewer room nights than what we saw. I think we were positive on the room night side coming into the quarter, and we booked less in the quarter for the quarter than we had the prior year. So that declined a bit. But the good news is that as the business all shifted around, the overall rate improvement that we experienced in the second quarter was better than we had forecasted. So we ended up with -- in roughly 4.5% revenue improvement that we had. I should note, too, is I don't want to overdo the commentary regarding Sheraton in New York and Philadelphia. But as I have found in trying to understand how we're doing is that sometimes pulling those assets out, just because of the level of disruption there, gives me better insight as to how the company is doing. If you look at the group side and you take those 2 assets out, what you find is the group demand was up over a point. Leaving out those 2 assets, then the overall revenue growth was higher than what I described, in part, because both of those hotels are big group hotels, especially Philadelphia. And they just weren't able to do the level of group business that they normally would have done. So as you think about the -- your question, which I think is a really good one to think about it for the third and fourth quarter, what I would probably be expecting is that we might find that, in the third quarter, our group room nights is a little less than the 3% we're running ahead right now, although we have healthy rates -- rate growth in the third quarter. So I think bottom line is that the overall results for the third quarter for group should be fairly positive. The fourth quarter I would still expect to see continuing a trend that we've seen all year. I would like to expect that we will find that there'll be more rooms booked going into the fourth quarter when we're talking to you in October than what we have right now, because the pace sort of that quarter out or so has still been pretty good. So I would expect to see some additional strength in the fourth quarter."

But just getting those hotels back in kind of into the overall mix should boost your RevPAR, at least, in the New York and Philadelphia area. So I guess what I'm wondering is have you -- kind of implicit in your forecast, is there additional improvement coming out of those hotels because of the renovations? Or is it simply that they go back to market averages, and that if there was additional upside based on what you spend that, that wouldn't really be contemplated in what you're guiding to today?"

As it relates to Sheraton in New York, we're sort of -- we're only about halfway through the process there. So we are looking at -- we expect to see good RevPAR growth from that hotel for the rest of the year. Some of that is New York. Some of that is the fact that new rooms that we've done in that hotel is spectacular, especially compared to the rooms that we had before. So there I think we are probably getting some of the lift out of the work we're doing. In the case of Philadelphia, one point I want to clarify is that we finished the main tower, the main building, which is the bulk of the hotel rooms there. But we still have the expansion that we did in that hotel about a decade ago called the head office. We still have the rooms to do there. So Philadelphia will not be completely done until the fourth quarter. I think the combination of the new rooms and the new meeting space is clearly going to make that hotel that much more attractive, and so we'll see some good lift. It's unfortunate, in some ways, that the timing of this renovation -- we've been doing the Philadelphia renovation to be ready for the of the Convention Center, and a tremendous amount of group business is going to hit next year. This year has also turned out to be a very solid year in Philadelphia. And I think Larry had told me that if you pulled Philadelphia, our Philadelphia hotel out of our Philadelphia results, our Philadelphia RevPAR would be up 9% in this past quarter. So it gives you a sense of the pain we're feeling to have the construction going on at this point in time. But at the end of the day, it was better to be ready for next year than it was to delay the renovation and then hurt yourself from what we think will be a very strong group year, especially when we have the best situated group hotel in the market for convention business."

But I think you've correctly analyzed it, that we would expect the fourth quarter to be stronger than the third quarter. I think that there's -- probably, I would have 2 basic reasons for that. One is that I think that the current issues that are floating around out there probably have a little bit more effect on Q3 than Q4, and I think the economic outlook for Q4, for most people, seems to be a bit more positive. The other point that I would make on that is that not only do we expect the renovations that we've been doing this year to moderate a bit, at least in terms of the 2 significant projects that we've been identifying, but as you circle back to last year, you may or may not remember that our investment spend, our capital spending in Q4 of last year was considerably larger than what we had done in Qs 1, 2, 3. And so as we think about overlapping that year with the fourth quarter of 2011, we sort of view it that there was construction disruption last year. That was one of the reasons why our fourth quarter was a little bit weaker than you might have anticipated, given the way the rest of the year had played out. We will get the benefit of that sort of relative weakness as we come into the fourth quarter of this year. So for both of those reasons, we would expect the fourth quarter to be stronger, and I think the big question is going to be how much."

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results, which were driven by improvements in transient demand and substantial average rate growth. We have also been successful in placing 2 great hotels located in very desirable markets under contract, one in our consolidated portfolio and one in our European joint venture fund. 
First, let's talk about our second quarter results. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 6.7%, driven by an improvement in our average rate of 5%, combined with an occupancy increase of 1.1 percentage points. Our average rate was $184, and our average occupancy was 75.2%. 
As we discussed last quarter, we expected our operating results to be significantly impacted by substantial renovations at our Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott hotels in the second quarter. Excluding results from these hotels, our RevPAR increase for the quarter would have been 7.6%. In addition, it is worth noting that our comparable hotel results do not include the performance of the $1.7 billion of acquisitions we have completed over the last 12 months, which are performing exceptionally well and have generated an average RevPAR increase of over 18% for the quarter. 
Comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of 4.4% contributed to overall revenue growth of 5.6%. This increase, when combined with our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increase of 115 basis points and our acquisition activity, resulted in a 25% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $313 million for the second quarter and a 30% increase in FFO per diluted share of $0.30. FFO for this quarter was negatively impacted by a $0.01 per share for acquisition and debt repayment costs, as well as a noncash impairment charge. 
On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.1% driven primarily by rate improvement. Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 5.2%, combined with operating profit margins that increased 65 basis points, resulted in a year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $457 million, representing an increase of 22% and FFO per diluted share of $0.41. Year-to-date, FFO per diluted share was negatively affected by $0.02, for acquisitions, debt repayment and impairment costs.
Our business mix trends for the quarter were quite favorable as we saw strong demand increases from our higher-rated customer segment and solid rate growth across the board. Rate growth in Q2, driven by exceptional growth in transient demand, was the best we had seen since 2007. Overall, transient room nights for the quarter increased more than 3%, led by a nearly 7.5% increase in Special Corporate demand and a more than 3% increase in our Premium Corporate segment. 
Reflecting the changes in our mix, discount room nights increased just over 1%. On the rate side, Special Corporate rate increases of more than 6% helped to improve our average transient rate by more than 5% leading to overall transient revenue growth of more than 8.5%. 
Group demand for the quarter was essentially flat with last year, as increases in Corporate and association business were essentially offset by reductions in discount group. The growth on these higher-priced segments was even more pronounced in our luxury hotels, where they grew by more than 16%, leading to a luxury group room night increase of more than 8%. The combination of positive mix shift and rate increases in all 3 segments drove group rates up by 4.7%, which represents more than twice the rate of increase in Q1. Overall, group revenues were up by almost 4.5%. 
Looking at the remainder of the year, our group booking pace continues to be positive with third quarter takes up more than 3% and fourth quarter up nearly 2%, and average rates are higher in both quarters. While not occurring at last year's accelerated pace, short-term bookings are still quite strong by historical standards, and we are seeing signs that the booking window is starting to lengthen, as our pace for 2012 is well ahead of last year's level. 
In addition, our transient booking pace is quite strong. It reflects an average demand increase of more than 7% for the next 4 months. Stronger advanced bookings, especially at our larger hotels, is certainly a positive sign and will be very helpful at our -- in our hotel manager's efforts to push transient rates higher in the future. 
On the investment front, we have 2 new transactions to discuss. First, as we reported this morning, we signed an agreement to acquire the 888-room Grand Hyatt Washington for $442 million. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Washington, D.C., just 2 blocks from the city's Convention Center and convenient to over 40 million square feet of office space, the Verizon Center, the National Mall and the Smithsonian museums. 
In addition, the hotel is located opposite of the city's old Convention Center site, which is being redeveloped into over 300,000 square feet of retail space, more than a 1 million square feet of office space and 700 residential units. The hotel includes over 43,000 square feet of meeting space, including a 17,000-square-foot ballroom and an 8,500-square-foot junior ballroom. We are pleased to acquire another hotel in D.C., which is a historically top-performing market with a diversified demand base.
Turning to our European joint venture. As we discussed last quarter, we completed an expansion of our joint venture through the establishment of a new fund, with approximately EUR 1 billion in investment capacity. As part of the expansion, we transferred the Le Méridien Piccadilly to this new fund in June. 
In addition, the joint venture signed an agreement to acquire its first acquisition in France, the 396-room Pullman Bercy hotel for EUR 96 million. The hotel is located in Paris, near the banks of the Seine River, in a newly redeveloped neighborhood that includes high-end office buildings and one of Paris' largest railway stations and the French Ministry of Finance. The hotel has 17 media rooms, totaling more than 19,000 square feet. We will continue to look for acquisitions that meet our investment criteria and believe we are in a great position to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as they arise. 
With that being said, given the unpredictability of the timing of these transactions, our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. On the disposition front, our forecast assumes only the sale of South Bend Marriott in the third quarter, a noncore asset which required significant capital investment. 
During the quarter, we invested $75 million in return-on-investment projects, including the completion of the first phase of our redevelopment project at the Sheraton New York and Sheraton Indianapolis hotels, as well as an updated and expanded meeting platform at the St. Regis in Houston. For the full year, we expect to spend $220 million to $240 million on these types of projects. 
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $71 million in the second quarter, which included a completion of the phase-one renovation of 991 rooms at the New York Marriott Marquis. We also concluded the renovation of the meeting space and main tower rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown. For the year, we expect to spend approximately $320 million to $345 million on maintenance capital expenditures. 
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and we are expecting improved performance in the second half of the year, due to less disruption from renovation at our hotels, an improving macroeconomic outlook relative to the first half of the year and solid group bookings for the third and fourth quarters. With that in mind and given that we are past the midpoint of the year, we have decided to tighten our forecast estimates. 
For the full year, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR to increase 6% to 7.5% with adjusted operating profit margins increasing 90 to 120 basis points. This operating forecast, combined with our acquisition activity, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.020 billion to $1.050 billion. The midpoint of this guidance is $7.5 million higher than our first quarter estimate. We project FFO per diluted share of $0.87 to $0.91, which has been reduced by $0.03 per share for acquisitions, debt repayment and impairment costs. 
Turning to our dividend. We increased our second quarter common dividend to $0.03 per share. As operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increased the dividend over the next 2 quarters, resulting in a full year common dividend of approximately $0.14 to $0.15 per share. 
In closing, while the overhang of uncertainty regarding national and international debt issues continues to cloud the economic outlook, the fundamentals of our business remain attractive. Transient demand has recovered to prior peak levels, and group demand continues to improve. As RevPAR is increasingly driven by improvements in average rate, margin growth and flow-through will accelerate. Additions to supply have been restrained and will likely remain well below historical levels for at least the next 3 years. Construction costs are beginning to increase again, which will further help limit new supply. 
The combination of firming construction pricing and changes in our portfolio lead us to estimate the replacement cost for our portfolio at over $400,000 per key. Given that our current market valuation is roughly $260,000 per key, this suggests that there is a very solid upside for our market valuation over the next 2 years. We will continue to be aggressive but disciplined as we evaluate new investments to further enhance the value of our company. 
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Consistent with the first quarter, our top-performing market for the second quarter was San Francisco, with a RevPAR increase of 17%. Strong transient demand contributed to an occupancy increase of nearly 6 percentage points, which led to an improvement of 8.5% in ADR. The ADR growth was driven by both Corporate and Special Corporate rate increases. We expect RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the third quarter, due to excellent group and transient demand and further ADR increases.
As expected, our hotels in Hawaii continued to perform exceptionally well, with a RevPAR increase of 16.5%. ADR increased nearly 15% due to a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated transient and group business. We expect Hawaii to slightly underperform the portfolio in the third quarter, due to some disruption from renovation activity. 
Our Tampa hotels also had an excellent quarter, as RevPAR increased 15.7%, driven by more than an 8% improvement in ADR and a 5-percentage-point improvement in occupancy. Transient demand was exceptional. We expect our Tampa hotels to perform very well in the third quarter due to strong group bookings.
Our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels had a great quarter, with RevPAR up 14.9%. ADR improved 5.6%, and occupancy increased nearly 7 percentage points as transient demand was very strong, allowing the hotels to increase ADR. We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to have a great third quarter and to outperform the portfolio because of strong group demand, which should drive a significant increase in ADR. 
The Phoenix market continues to recover. RevPAR increased 11.3% as ADR improved nearly 10%, and occupancy increased 1 percentage point. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. We expect the Phoenix market to significantly outperform our portfolio in the third quarter, due to strong group demand and growth in both group and transient rates, particularly at the Westin Kierland, which will benefit from the new ballroom. 
Our San Diego hotels had another good quarter with a RevPAR increase of 9.2%, which was much better than our expectations. The outperformance was driven by an occupancy improvement of nearly 7 percentage points as both transient and group demand increased. For the third quarter, we expect our San Diego hotels to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of group business, which will result in weak transient pricing through the summer months. 
RevPAR for our Chicago hotels increased by 6.7%, driven solely by improvements in average rate. Higher transient demand offset lower levels of group business, and our hotels benefited from a shift in the mix of transient business to higher-rated category. We expect the Chicago market to perform very well in the third quarter.
Due to the continuing renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, as well as the impact of additional supply in the city, RevPAR for our New York hotels increased only 2.9%, as ADR improved over 11% while occupancy fell roughly 7 percentage points. We expect RevPAR for our New York hotels to improve significantly for the rest of the year. 
RevPAR for our Washington, D.C. hotels increased 2.5%. ADR increased nearly 4%, and occupancy fell roughly 1 percentage point. Results were affected by Congress' implementation of district weeks and continuing concerns surrounding the budget and debt ceiling, which led to less government and government-related group and transient business. Our urban hotels performed much better than the suburbs, with a RevPAR increase in excess of 5%. We expect the D.C. market to continue to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter. However, our urban hotels will continue to significantly outperform the suburban hotels. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels decreased 0.4%, with a slight increase in occupancy and a 1.2% drop in ADR. Results were negatively affected by the overall lack of citywide and group demand. Our Boston hotels are expected to continue to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to lower levels of group demand.
Lastly, our worst-performing market for the second quarter was Philadelphia as RevPAR fell 2.4%, primarily due to the disruption from the renovation of the ballroom and guestrooms at the Philadelphia Marriott. RevPAR fell as occupancy declined over 8 percentage points, while ADR increased nearly 9%. We expect the Philadelphia market to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter as the renovation wraps up and group demand increases.
Year-to-date, San Francisco has been our best-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 20.2%, followed by Hawaii with a RevPAR increase of 17.4%, San Diego with a 14.9% increase and Houston with an 11.6% increase. Our worst-performing markets have been Philadelphia with a RevPAR decrease of 7.5% and New York City with a 0.9% increase. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR, calculated in constant euros, increased 10.1% for the quarter as 7 of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases, led by the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Westin Europa & Regina and the Brussels Marriott. Occupancy increased 3.5 percentage points, and ADR increased over 5%. Group demand was quite strong as it increased over 14%, primarily to improvements in tour and travel group demand. Group ADR increased 4.1%, resulting in roughly a 19% increase in group revenues. Transient demand was up 1% and average rates were up over 6%, leading to a 7.4% increase in transient revenues. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros improved 10%.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 115 basis points. The business disruption from our capital program continued to have a negative impact on our margins. The renovations of the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers and the Philadelphia Marriott reduced our margin growth for the quarter by 40 basis points. 
Food and beverage flow-through was roughly 24% for the quarter. The renovation at the Sheraton and Philadelphia Marriott also had a significant negative impact on food and beverage flow-through, which would have been 10 percentage points higher, excluding those 2 hotels. Unallocated costs increased 4%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared-service allocation. Utility costs increased 5%. 
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the RevPAR increase to continue to be driven more by rate growth and occupancy, which should lead to strong rooms flow-through even with growth in wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increase in group demand, as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid F&B flow-through. We expect unallocated costs to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, where we expect higher growth due to an increase in both rates and volume, and sales and marketing costs, where higher revenues will increase costs. 
We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation and property insurance to increase well in excess of inflation, due to increase in insurable values and premium increases in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 90 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 120 basis points at the high end of the range.
In February, shortly after we closed on the acquisition of 7 hotels in New Zealand, the city of Christchurch experienced an earthquake that caused considerable damage. Two of the hotels in the acquired portfolio, a Novotel and an ibis, totaling 348 rooms, were damaged and are in the government-declared red zone that has limited access. The 2 properties represent less than 25% of the value of the portfolio. We have engaged structural engineers to prepare comprehensive formal assessments. Progress in the government-declared red zone is slow. 
We are hoping that our properties will reopen in mid to late 2012. We believe we have adequate insurance as part of Accor's New Zealand insurance program to cover the property damage, and we recorded an expense in the second quarter of USD $3.2 million, which is the maximum amount of the deductible. Coverage period for business interruption is 36 months for the Novotel and 24 months for the ibis. While we ultimately expect to be compensated for the business interruption loss, we have not included any such proceeds in our result of operations or in our guidance. 
During the quarter, we raised approximately $190 million under our continuous equity offering program to fund acquisitions. We also issued $500 million of senior notes that bear interest at 5 7/8% and have an 8-year maturity. These notes have the lowest coupon of any bond we have ever issued. In the second quarter, we used some of the bond proceeds to redeem the remaining $250 million of 7 1/8% Series K senior notes and repaid a $50 million draw on our credit facility. 
We also called $150 million of our 2004 exchangeable debentures, $134 million of which were exchanged for approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock and approximately $16 million of which were redeemed for cash after the end of the second quarter. We currently have $175 million of the 2004 exchangeable debentures outstanding. 
Lastly, subsequent to quarter end, we transferred the Le Méridien Piccadilly and related property level debt to our European Joint Venture Fund II. When combined with the exchangeable debenture transaction and an additional $41 million credit facility repayment, our outstanding debt balance dropped approximately $300 million to $5.6 billion subsequent to quarter end. 
We ended the quarter with over $630 million in cash and cash equivalents, and we have over $475 million of capacity on our credit facility, which matures in September of this year. But we have the right to extend the facility to September of 2012, as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
There is one last item worth noting related to the accounting for our deferred tax liabilities for our Euro JV Fund I. In conjunction with the establishment of the Euro JV Fund II, we extended the life of Fund I. The 5-year extension of the fund requires us to record an additional deferred tax liability in the third quarter. This additional liability is a noncash charge that reduces FFO by $5 million for our pro-rata portion of the JV's tax expense. Similar to all income statement items related to the JV, the charge will be reflected in the equity and earnings of affiliates, not in income tax expense in our statement of operations. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

I mean, there's no doubt that the downtown area has outperformed the suburbs this year. I think as you -- I think Larry had made a comment in his comments that our RevPAR growth in the city was about twice the level that we had for the market overall. As we look at D.C. this year, it is obviously clear that D.C. is underperforming a bit. I think that there's a variety of reasons for that. I think, one, fundamentally, is that the D.C. market did not fall as much as a number of other markets, so there is less of a rebound effect there. I think that this year we've seen -- we have seen and felt some pain from all of the disarray in the federal government around both the budget issues that related to this year's budget, as well as the current concerns relating to extending the debt amount, that -- the debt ceiling, as well as what that may mean going forward. And the consequence of that uncertainty has been that government, which represents, call it, 15% to 20% of our business in the Washington area, government has not booked rooms, especially group rooms, at the level that they had in the past. And so as a result, we've seen a little bit of a group decline in Washington, and in most other markets, we've seen a little bit of a group increase. So I think that accounts for a large amount of the decline. But I think there is a weakness rather. And I think the other point to pick up, which some of you have already commented on is that this is as I already described, it's a little bit higher-government market than what we normally experience. And with government per diem rate down this year compared to last year, that's also been a little bit of a wind that D.C. is fighting against. Leaving out the problems for this year, we firmly believe that Washington is a great market to invest in. If you look at Washington over the course of, call it, the 10 years ending in '08, before we went into the downturn or the severe part of the downturn, Washington was really one of the best markets in the country to be invested in. Working its way through the downturn, it fell at -- it fell far less than any of the other markets across the country. It has recovered quickly. It is generally, at least for our portfolio, we are back to '07 levels. And as we look forward and look at Washington, while it is true that this year is a bit weaker, we see the outlook in a very positive fashion. The Convention Center that Washington has is one of the best on the eastern coast of the United States. It is the -- the projected bookings for that Convention Center, especially as you look out to '15, '16 and '17, are very attractive. Just as importantly, there's a lot of activity happening in downtown Washington that is make -- and some of that, I referenced in my comments, is happening immediately across the street from our new asset. There's a lot going on that's making Washington a more exciting city and more of a 24-hour city, all of which we think is only going to drive better results in our hotels over the course of the next decade. So at the end, that clearly Washington's going through a little bit of a soft patch. I think next year -- election years are actually tend to be decent in Washington, but I think the current next year that we'll be fighting is a little bit weaker convention business. But I think once you get past '12, we are very optimistic about the outlook for the future beyond that. Speaking specifically about the hotel, we think we've got a great hotel in one of the best locations in Washington. From our perspective, looking at owning that much of fee-simple property in the heart of D.C., we think that we're buying this at probably a 10% discount to replacement cost, and that's a little bit richer than where some of the other transactions we have done have been completed at. But now the other thing I would point out with this particular acquisition is, you may remember, that we also own the Capitol Hill Hyatt. And one of the benefits, we think, we see of owning the 2 hotels is as we've been able to do in other markets, we think there will be an opportunity, especially because it's the same brand, to take advantage of some synergies, combine some positions and enhance cooperation between the hotels, which will not only help this hotel but will also help our other Hyatt over on New Jersey Avenue."

So that's actually been stronger performance in Europe than what we have seen in the United States. So despite the fact that those talks -- those issues have been out there for quite some time, the performance in Europe, both in the southern markets, Spain and Italy, which are some of the countries that get talked about, as well as the northern markets, has been quite strong. I would say, in general, that one of the reasons why we're seeing that is that in the northern European countries, I think the results are driven a little bit more by stronger economic growth. In the southern European countries, despite the economic concerns that those countries have and the fact that they are caught up in some of the same issues that Greece is facing, although not yet quite to the same degree, those markets, the lodging industry, is also driven by, to a great degree, by tourism. And as a result, we've seen a big increase in tour groups throughout Europe this year. I think that a better economy in the rest of the world has ultimately contributed to better results in Europe. So I think we may see that trend moderate a little bit for the second half of the year, only as we start to move out of the tourist seasons. But the bottom line is that, so far, we got our fingers crossed on this, Europe seems to be holding up relatively well."

And that usually what was driving that subsequent quarter to turn out to be better than the prior year. This year, what we have found is that we are -- that we're coming into every quarter ahead of where we have been. But the bookings in that quarter, while they're still well ahead of what we would have had in '06 and '07 and a magnitude of 40% to 50% better than what we would have had in those prior years, well, they not quite as robust as last year. But the bookings, looking further out, say, looking 2 quarters out, 3 and 4 quarters out, have been stronger. And so I think while you'll still get -- if you talk to an individual GM, they will all tell you that it's still a short booking cycle. And they're right because they're all booking more than the normal amount of business in a relatively near-term time period to when the event happened. The reality is that as you look at the data, more and more rooms are being booked 6 months, 9 months, 12 months out as we start slowly to work our way to back to a more normal booking cycle."

The first is if you leave out the renovation impacts on the 2 hotels that we've been commenting on, the Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott, and you look at our performance in the first half of the year, we were running at a RevPAR rate in the first half that was over 7%. So as we think about the second half of the year and we recognize that our renovation disruption should go down a bit, we think it's -- just as -- just to run at the same level as the first half would suggest that the second half of the year is going to run over 7%. I think as we also feel that as we look at the group booking pace as it carries into the second half of the year, it does seem to be a little bit stronger. The rate does seem to be growing. So that gives us a fair amount of confidence that things should be a little bit better. The trickiest part of this whole process is to try to assess the economy. If you look at the blue-chip consensus and use that as, at least, a measure of how folks are looking at the economy, they're essentially calling for better than 3% GDP growth in the second half of the year compared to about 2% in the first half of the year. So if that's true, that should clearly help us in general because, of course, our industry is dependent on economic growth. As we look at business investment, while that -- while the outlook for business investment is a bit more conservative than where it was at the beginning of the year, it is still quite robust. That, in our mind, has been one of the factors behind a strong transient demand and rate growth that we've seen. Now we don't see any reason why that's going to slow a little bit. So I think at the end of the day, you put all those factors together and especially as you look at the fourth quarter, which is where our forecast are showing the most strength, we generally think that we're going to be in much better shape in the second half of the year than in the first."

I think some of that depends a little bit also -- I think that effect was probably a little heavier at the beginning of the year than it was in the second and third quarter, as occupancies start to pick up and are naturally stronger in the city and carry into the fourth quarter, where a lot of our hotels are full all year long. I think the effect of the supply becomes less important. In the first quarter, where occupancies are traditionally the lowest in New York, I think the supply increase was a bit more impactful."

But my recollection is that the revenue number came in relatively close to where -- if the revenues were ahead at the beginning of the quarter. I think what we've found is that we ended up with a little bit fewer room nights than what we saw. I think we were positive on the room night side coming into the quarter, and we booked less in the quarter for the quarter than we had the prior year. So that declined a bit. But the good news is that as the business all shifted around, the overall rate improvement that we experienced in the second quarter was better than we had forecasted. So we ended up with -- in roughly 4.5% revenue improvement that we had. I should note, too, is I don't want to overdo the commentary regarding Sheraton in New York and Philadelphia. But as I have found in trying to understand how we're doing is that sometimes pulling those assets out, just because of the level of disruption there, gives me better insight as to how the company is doing. If you look at the group side and you take those 2 assets out, what you find is the group demand was up over a point. Leaving out those 2 assets, then the overall revenue growth was higher than what I described, in part, because both of those hotels are big group hotels, especially Philadelphia. And they just weren't able to do the level of group business that they normally would have done. So as you think about the -- your question, which I think is a really good one to think about it for the third and fourth quarter, what I would probably be expecting is that we might find that, in the third quarter, our group room nights is a little less than the 3% we're running ahead right now, although we have healthy rate growth in the third quarter. So I think bottom line is that the overall results for the third quarter for group should be fairly positive. The fourth quarter I would still expect to see continuing a trend that we've seen all year. I would like to expect that we will find that there'll be more rooms booked going into the fourth quarter when we're talking to you in October than what we have right now, because the pace sort of that quarter out or so has still been pretty good. So I would expect to see some additional strength in the fourth quarter."

And then I guess the only other thing was just as you think about the renovation that obviously you guys are doing these in anticipation of probably getting some kind of additional or incremental performance. But just getting those hotels back in kind of into the overall mix should boost your RevPAR, at least, in the New York and Philadelphia area. So I guess what I'm wondering is have you -- kind of implicit in your forecast, is there additional improvement coming out of those hotels because of the renovations? Or is it simply that they go back to market averages, and that if there was additional upside based on what you spend that, that wouldn't really be contemplated in what you're guiding to today?"

So we are looking at -- we expect to see good RevPAR growth from that hotel for the rest of the year. Some of that is New York. Some of that is the fact that the new rooms that we've done at that hotel is spectacular, especially compared to the rooms that we've had before. So there I think we are probably getting some of the lift out of the work we're doing. In the case of Philadelphia, one point I want to clarify is that we finished the main tower, the main building, which is the bulk of the hotel rooms there. But we still have the expansion that we did in that hotel about a decade ago called The Headhouse. We still have the rooms to do there. So Philadelphia will not be completely done until the fourth quarter. I think the combination of the new rooms and the new meeting space is clearly going to make that hotel that much more attractive, and so we'll see some good lift. It's unfortunate, in some ways, that the timing of this renovation -- we've been doing the Philadelphia renovation to be ready for the expansion of the Convention Center, and a tremendous amount of group business is going to hit next year. This year has also turned out to be a very solid year in Philadelphia. And I think Larry had told me that if you pulled Philadelphia, our Philadelphia hotel out of our Philadelphia result, our Philadelphia RevPAR would be up 9% in this past quarter. So it gives you a sense of the pain we're feeling to have the construction going on at this point in time. But at the end of the day, it was better to be ready for next year than it was to delay the renovation and then hurt yourself from what we think will be a very strong group year, especially when we have the best situated group hotel in the market for convention business."

But I think you've correctly analyzed it, that we would expect the fourth quarter to be stronger than the third quarter. I think that there's -- probably, I would have 2 basic reasons for that. One is that I think that the current issues that are floating around out there probably have a little bit more effect on Q3 than Q4, and I think the economic outlook for Q4, for most people, seems to be a bit more positive. The other point that I would make on that is that not only do we expect the renovations that we've been doing this year to moderate a bit, at least in terms of the 2 significant projects that we've been identifying, but as you circle back to last year, you may or may not remember that our investment spend, our capital spend in Q4 of last year was considerably larger than what we had done in Qs 1 through 3. And so as we think about overlapping that year with the fourth quarter of 2011, we sort of view it that there was construction disruption last year. That was one of the reasons why our fourth quarter was a little bit weaker than you might have anticipated, given the way the rest of the year had played out. We will get the benefit of that sort of relative weakness as we come into the fourth quarter of this year. So for both of those reasons, we would expect the fourth quarter to be stronger, and I think the big question is going to be how much."

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results, which were driven by improvements in transient demand and substantial average rate growth. We have also been successful in placing 2 great hotels located in very desirable markets under contract, one in our consolidated portfolio and one in our European joint venture fund. 
First, let's talk about our second quarter results. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 6.7%, driven by an improvement in our average rate of 5%, combined with an occupancy increase of 1.1 percentage points. Our average rate was $184, and our average occupancy was 75.2%. 
As we discussed last quarter, we expected our operating results to be significantly impacted by substantial renovations at our Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott hotels in the second quarter. Excluding results from these hotels, our RevPAR increase for the quarter would have been 7.6%. In addition, it is worth noting that our comparable hotel results do not include the performance of the $1.7 billion of acquisitions we have completed over the last 12 months, which are performing exceptionally well and have generated an average RevPAR increase of over 18% for the quarter. 
Comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of 4.4% contributed to overall revenue growth of 5.6%. This increase, when combined with our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increase of 115 basis points and our acquisition activity, resulted in a 25% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $313 million for the second quarter and a 30% increase in FFO per diluted share of $0.30. FFO for this quarter was negatively impacted by a $0.01 per share for acquisition and debt repayment costs, as well as a noncash impairment charge. 
On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.1% driven primarily by rate improvement. Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 5.2%, combined with operating profit margins that increased 65 basis points, resulted in a year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $457 million, representing an increase of 22% and FFO per diluted share of $0.41. Year-to-date, FFO per diluted share was negatively affected by $0.02, for acquisitions, debt repayment and impairment costs.
Our business mix trends for the quarter were quite favorable as we saw strong demand increases from our higher-rated customer segment and solid rate growth across the board. Rate growth in Q2, driven by exceptional growth in transient demand, was the best we had seen since 2007. Overall, transient room nights for the quarter increased more than 3%, led by a nearly 7.5% increase in Special Corporate demand and a more than 3% increase in our Premium Corporate segment. 
Reflecting the changes in our mix, discount room nights increased just over 1%. On the rate side, Special Corporate rate increases of more than 6% helped to improve our average transient rate by more than 5% leading to overall transient revenue growth of more than 8.5%. 
Group demand for the quarter was essentially flat with last year, as increases in Corporate and association business were essentially offset by reductions in discount group. The growth on these higher-priced segments was even more pronounced in our luxury hotels, where they grew by more than 16%, leading to a luxury group room night increase of more than 8%. The combination of positive mix shift and rate increases in all 3 segments drove group rates up by 4.7%, which represents more than twice the rate of increase in Q1. Overall, group revenues were up by almost 4.5%. 
Looking at the remainder of the year, our group booking pace continues to be positive with third quarter takes up more than 3% and fourth quarter up nearly 2%, and average rates are higher in both quarters. While not occurring at last year's accelerated pace, short-term bookings are still quite strong by historical standards, and we are seeing signs that the booking window is starting to lengthen, as our pace for 2012 is well ahead of last year's level. 
In addition, our transient booking pace is quite strong. It reflects an average demand increase of more than 7% for the next 4 months. Stronger advanced bookings, especially at our larger hotels, is certainly a positive sign and will be very helpful at our -- in our hotel manager's efforts to push transient rates higher in the future. 
On the investment front, we have 2 new transactions to discuss. First, as we reported this morning, we signed an agreement to acquire the 888-room Grand Hyatt Washington for $442 million. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Washington, D.C., just 2 blocks from the city's Convention Center and convenient to over 40 million square feet of office space, the Verizon Center, the National Mall and the Smithsonian museums. 
In addition, the hotel is located opposite of the city's old Convention Center site, which is being redeveloped into over 300,000 square feet of retail space, more than 1 million square feet of office space and 700 residential units. The hotel includes over 43,000 square feet of meeting space, including a 17,000-square-foot ballroom and an 8,500-square-foot junior ballroom. We are pleased to acquire another hotel in D.C., which is a historically top-performing market with a diversified demand base.
Turning to our European joint venture. As we discussed last quarter, we completed an expansion of our joint venture through the establishment of a new fund, with approximately EUR 1 billion in investment capacity. As part of the expansion, we transferred the Le Méridien Piccadilly to this new fund in June. 
In addition, the joint venture signed an agreement to acquire its first acquisition in France, the 396-room Pullman Bercy hotel for EUR 96 million. The hotel is located in Paris, near the banks of the Seine River, in a newly redeveloped neighborhood that includes high-end office buildings and one of Paris' largest railway stations and the French Ministry of Finance. The hotel has 17 media rooms, totaling more than 19,000 square feet. We will continue to look for acquisitions that meet our investment criteria and believe we are in a great position to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as they arise. 
With that being said, given the unpredictability of the timing of these transactions, our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions beyond those we announced. On the disposition front, our forecast assumes only the sale of South Bend Marriott in the third quarter, a noncore asset which required significant capital investment. 
During the quarter, we invested $75 million in return-on-investment projects, including the completion of the first phase of our redevelopment project at the Sheraton New York and Sheraton Indianapolis hotels, as well as an updated and expanded meeting platform at the St. Regis in Houston. For the full year, we expect to spend $220 million to $240 million on these types of projects. 
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $71 million in the second quarter, which included a completion of the phase-one renovation of 991 rooms at the New York Marriott Marquis. We also concluded the renovation of the meeting space and main tower rooms at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown. For the year, we expect to spend approximately $320 million to $345 million on maintenance capital expenditures. 
Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and we are expecting improved performance in the second half of the year, due to less disruption from renovation at our hotels, an improving macroeconomic outlook relative to the first half of the year and solid group bookings for the third and fourth quarters. With that in mind and given that we are past the midpoint of the year, we have decided to tighten our forecast estimates. 
For the full year, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR to increase 6% to 7.5% with adjusted operating profit margins increasing 90 to 120 basis points. This operating forecast, combined with our acquisition activity, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.020 billion to $1.050 billion. The midpoint of this guidance is $7.5 million higher than our first quarter estimate. We project FFO per diluted share of $0.87 to $0.91, which has been reduced by $0.03 per share for acquisitions, debt repayment and impairment costs. 
Turning to our dividend. We increased our second quarter common dividend to $0.03 per share. As operations continue to improve, we expect to modestly increased the dividend over the next 2 quarters, resulting in a full year common dividend of approximately $0.14 to $0.15 per share. 
In closing, while the overhang of uncertainty regarding national and international debt issues continues to cloud the economic outlook, the fundamentals of our business remain attractive. Transient demand has recovered to prior peak levels, and group demand continues to improve. As RevPAR is increasingly driven by improvements in average rate, margin growth and flow-through will accelerate. Additions to supply have been restrained and will likely remain well below historical levels for at least the next 3 years. Construction costs are beginning to increase again, which will further help limit new supply. 
The combination of firming construction pricing and changes in our portfolio lead us to estimate the replacement cost for our portfolio at over $400,000 per key. Given that our current market valuation is roughly $260,000 per key, this suggests that there is a very solid upside for our market valuation over the next 2 years. We will continue to be aggressive but disciplined as we evaluate new investments to further enhance the value of our company. 
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Consistent with the first quarter, our top-performing market for the second quarter was San Francisco, with a RevPAR increase of 17%. Strong transient demand contributed to an occupancy increase of nearly 6 percentage points, which led to an improvement of 8.5% in ADR. The ADR growth was driven by both Corporate and Special Corporate rate increases. We expect RevPAR for our San Francisco hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the third quarter, due to excellent group and transient demand and further ADR increases.
As expected, our hotels in Hawaii continued to perform exceptionally well, with a RevPAR increase of 16.5%. ADR increased nearly 15% due to a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated transient and group business. We expect Hawaii to slightly underperform the portfolio in the third quarter, due to some disruption from renovation activity. 
Our Tampa hotels also had an excellent quarter, as RevPAR increased 15.7%, driven by more than an 8% improvement in ADR and a 5-percentage-point improvement in occupancy. Transient demand was exceptional. We expect our Tampa hotels to perform very well in the third quarter due to strong group bookings.
Our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels had a great quarter, with RevPAR up 14.9%. ADR improved 5.6%, and occupancy increased nearly 7 percentage points as transient demand was very strong, allowing the hotels to increase ADR. We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to have a great third quarter and to outperform the portfolio because of strong group demand, which should drive a significant increase in ADR. 
The Phoenix market continues to recover. RevPAR increased 11.3% as ADR improved nearly 10%, and occupancy increased 1 percentage point. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. We expect the Phoenix market to significantly outperform our portfolio in the third quarter, due to strong group demand and growth in both group and transient rates, particularly at the Westin Kierland, which will benefit from the new ballroom. 
Our San Diego hotels had another good quarter with a RevPAR increase of 9.2%, which was much better than our expectations. The outperformance was driven by an occupancy improvement of nearly 7 percentage points as both transient and group demand increased. For the third quarter, we expect our San Diego hotels to underperform the portfolio due to lower levels of group business, which will result in weak transient pricing through the summer months. 
RevPAR for our Chicago hotels increased by 6.7%, driven solely by improvements in average rate. Higher transient demand offset lower levels of group business, and our hotels benefited from a shift in the mix of transient business to higher-rated category. We expect the Chicago market to perform very well in the third quarter.
Due to the continuing renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, as well as the impact of additional supply in the city, RevPAR for our New York hotels increased only 2.9%, as ADR improved over 11% while occupancy fell roughly 7 percentage points. We expect RevPAR for our New York hotels to improve significantly for the rest of the year. 
RevPAR for our Washington, D.C. hotels increased 2.5%. ADR increased nearly 4%, and occupancy fell roughly 1 percentage point. Results were affected by Congress' implementation of district weeks and continuing concerns surrounding the budget and debt ceiling, which led to less government and government-related group and transient business. Our urban hotels performed much better than the suburbs, with a RevPAR increase in excess of 5%. We expect the D.C. market to continue to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter. However, our urban hotels will continue to significantly outperform the suburban hotels. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels decreased 0.4%, with a slight increase in occupancy and a 1.2% drop in ADR. Results were negatively affected by the overall lack of citywide and group demand. Our Boston hotels are expected to continue to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter due to lower levels of group demand.
Lastly, our worst-performing market for the second quarter was Philadelphia as RevPAR fell 2.4%, primarily due to the disruption from the renovation of the ballroom and guestrooms at the Philadelphia Marriott. RevPAR fell as occupancy declined over 8 percentage points, while ADR increased nearly 9%. We expect the Philadelphia market to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter as the renovation wraps up and group demand increases.
Year-to-date, San Francisco has been our best-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 20.2%, followed by Hawaii with a RevPAR increase of 17.4%, San Diego with a 14.9% increase and Houston with an 11.6% increase. Our worst-performing markets have been Philadelphia with a RevPAR decrease of 7.5% and New York City with a 0.9% increase. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR, calculated in constant euros, increased 10.1% for the quarter as 7 of the 11 hotels had double-digit RevPAR increases, led by the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, the Westin Europa & Regina and the Brussels Marriott. Occupancy increased 3.5 percentage points, and ADR increased over 5%. Group demand was quite strong as it increased over 14%, primarily to improvements in tour and travel group demand. Group ADR increased 4.1%, resulting in roughly a 19% increase in group revenues. Transient demand was up 1% and average rates were up over 6%, leading to a 7.4% increase in transient revenues. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros improved 10%.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 115 basis points. The business disruption from our capital program continued to have a negative impact on our margins. The renovations of the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers and the Philadelphia Marriott reduced our margin growth for the quarter by 40 basis points. 
Food and beverage flow-through was roughly 24% for the quarter. The renovation at the Sheraton and Philadelphia Marriott also had a significant negative impact on food and beverage flow-through, which would have been 10 percentage points higher, excluding those 2 hotels. Unallocated costs increased 4%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared-service allocation. Utility costs increased 5%. 
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the RevPAR increase to continue to be driven more by rate growth and occupancy, which should lead to strong rooms flow-through even with growth in wage and benefit cost above inflation. We expect some increase in group demand, as well as higher-quality groups, which should help to drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and solid F&B flow-through. We expect unallocated costs to increase more than inflation, particularly for utilities, where we expect higher growth due to an increase in both rates and volume, and sales and marketing costs, where higher revenues will increase costs. 
We also expect property taxes to rise in excess of inflation and property insurance to increase well in excess of inflation, due to increase in insurable values and premium increases in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 90 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 120 basis points at the high end of the range.
In February, shortly after we closed on the acquisition of 7 hotels in New Zealand, the city of Christchurch experienced an earthquake that caused considerable damage. Two of the hotels in the acquired portfolio, a Novotel and an ibis, totaling 348 rooms, were damaged and are in the government-declared red zone that has limited access. The 2 properties represent less than 25% of the value of the portfolio. We have engaged structural engineers to prepare comprehensive formal assessments. Progress in the government-declared red zone is slow. 
We are hoping that our properties will reopen in mid to late 2012. We believe we have adequate insurance as part of Accor's New Zealand insurance program to cover the property damage, and we recorded an expense in the second quarter of USD $3.2 million, which is the maximum amount of the deductible. Coverage period for business interruption is 36 months for the Novotel and 24 months for the ibis. While we ultimately expect to be compensated for the business interruption loss, we have not included any such proceeds in our result of operations or in our guidance. 
During the quarter, we raised approximately $190 million under our continuous equity offering program to fund acquisitions. We also issued $500 million of senior notes that bear interest at 5 7/8% and have an 8-year maturity. These notes have the lowest coupon of any bond we have ever issued. In the second quarter, we used some of the bond proceeds to redeem the remaining $250 million of 7 1/8% Series K senior notes and repaid a $50 million draw on our credit facility. 
We also called $150 million of our 2004 exchangeable debentures, $134 million of which were exchanged for approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock and approximately $16 million of which were redeemed for cash after the end of the second quarter. We currently have $175 million of the 2004 exchangeable debentures outstanding. 
Lastly, subsequent to quarter end, we transferred the Le Méridien Piccadilly and related property level debt to our European Joint Venture Fund II. When combined with the exchangeable debenture transaction and an additional $41 million credit facility repayment, our outstanding debt balance dropped approximately $300 million to $5.6 billion subsequent to quarter end. 
We ended the quarter with over $630 million in cash and cash equivalents, and we have over $475 million of capacity on our credit facility, which matures in September of this year. But we have the right to extend the facility to September of 2012, as long as our leverage level is below 6.75x, a standard we are more than comfortable that we will achieve. 
There is one last item worth noting related to the accounting for our deferred tax liabilities for our Euro JV Fund I. In conjunction with the establishment of the Euro JV Fund II, we extended the life of Fund I. The 5-year extension of the fund requires us to record an additional deferred tax liability in the third quarter. This additional liability is a noncash charge that reduces FFO by $5 million for our pro-rata portion of the JV's tax expense. Similar to all income statement items related to the JV, the charge will be reflected in the equity and earnings of affiliates, not in income tax expense in our statement of operations. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

I mean, there's no doubt that the downtown area has outperformed the suburbs this year. I think as you -- I think Larry had made a comment in his comments that our RevPAR growth in the city was about twice the level that we had for the market overall. As we look at D.C. this year, it is obviously clear that D.C. is underperforming a bit. I think that there's a variety of reasons for that. I think, one, fundamentally, is that the D.C. market did not fall as much as a number of other markets, so there is less of a rebound effect there. I think that this year we've seen -- we have seen and felt the pain from all of the disarray in the federal government around both the budget issues that related to this year's budget, as well as the current concerns relating to extending the debt amount, that -- the debt ceiling, as well as what that may mean going forward. And the consequence of that uncertainty has been that government, which represents, call it, 15% to 20% of our business in the Washington area, government has not booked rooms, especially group rooms, at the level that they had in the past. And so as a result, we've seen a little bit of a group decline in Washington, and in most other markets, we've seen a little bit of a group increase. So I think that accounts for a large amount of the decline. But I think there is a weakness rather. And I think the other point to pick up, which some of you have already commented on is that this is as I already described, it's a little bit higher-government market than what we normally experience. And with government per diem rate down this year compared to last year, that's also been a little bit of a wind that D.C. is fighting against. Leaving out the problems for this year, we firmly believe that Washington is a great market to invest in. If you look at Washington over the course of, call it, the 10 years ending in '08, before we went into the downturn or the severe part of the downturn, Washington was really one of the best markets in the country to be invested in. Working its way through the downturn, it fell at -- it fell far less than any of the other markets across the country. It has recovered quickly. It is generally, at least for our portfolio, we are back to '07 levels. And as we look forward and look at Washington, while it is true that this year is a bit weaker, we see the outlook in a very positive fashion. The Convention Center that Washington has is one of the best on the eastern coast of the United States. It is the -- the projected bookings for that Convention Center, especially as you look out to '15, '16 and '17, are very attractive. Just as importantly, there's a lot of activity happening in downtown Washington that is make -- and some of that, I referenced in my comments, is happening immediately across the street from our new asset. There's a lot going on that's making Washington a more exciting city and more of a 24-hour city, all of which we think is only going to drive better results in our hotels over the course of the next decade. So at the end, that clearly Washington's going through a little bit of a soft patch. I think next year -- election years are actually tend to be decent in Washington, but I think the current next year that we'll be fighting is a little bit weaker convention business. But I think once you get past '12, we are very optimistic about the outlook for the future beyond that. Speaking specifically about the hotel, we think we've got a great hotel in one of the best locations in Washington. From our perspective, looking at owning that much of fee-simple property in the heart of D.C., we think that we're buying this at probably a 10% discount to replacement cost, and that's a little bit richer than where some of the other transactions we have done have been completed at. But now the other thing I would point out with this particular acquisition is, you may remember, that we also own the Capitol Hill Hyatt. And one of the benefits, we think, we see of owning the 2 hotels is as we've been able to do in other markets, we think there will be an opportunity, especially because it's the same brand, to take advantage of some synergies, combine some positions and enhance cooperation between the hotels, which will not only help this hotel but will also help our other Hyatt over on New Jersey Avenue."

So that's actually been stronger performance in Europe than what we have seen in the United States. So despite the fact that those talks -- those issues have been out there for quite some time, the performance in Europe, both in the southern markets, Spain and Italy, which are some of the countries that get talked about, as well as the northern markets, has been quite strong. I would say, in general, that one of the reasons why we're seeing that is that in the northern European countries, I think the results are driven a little bit more by stronger economic growth. In the southern European countries, despite the economic concerns that those countries have and the fact that they are caught up in some of the same issues that Greece is facing, although not yet quite to the same degree, those markets, the lodging industry, is also driven by, to a great degree, by tourism. And as a result, we've seen a big increase in tour groups throughout Europe this year. I think that a better economy in the rest of the world has ultimately contributed to better results in Europe. So I think we may see that trend moderate a little bit for the second half of the year, only as we start to move out of the tourist seasons. But the bottom line is that, so far, we got our fingers crossed on this, Europe seems to be holding up relatively well."

And that usually what was driving that subsequent quarter to turn out to be better than the prior year. This year, what we have found is that we are -- that we're coming into every quarter ahead of where we have been. But the bookings in that quarter, while they're still well ahead of what we would have had in '06 and '07 and a magnitude of 40% to 50% better than what we would have had in those prior years, well, they not quite as robust as last year. But the bookings, looking further out, say, looking 2 quarters out, 3 and 4 quarters out, have been stronger. And so I think while you'll still get -- if you talk to an individual GM, they will all tell you that it's still a short booking cycle. And they're right because they're all booking more than the normal amount of business in a relatively near-term time period to when the event happened. The reality is that as you look at the data, more and more rooms are being booked 6 months, 9 months, 12 months out as we start slowly to work our way to back to a more normal booking cycle."

The first is if you leave out the renovation impacts on the 2 hotels that we've been commenting on, the Sheraton New York and Philadelphia Marriott, and you look at our performance in the first half of the year, we were running at a RevPAR rate in the first half that was over 7%. So as we think about the second half of the year and we recognize that our renovation disruption should go down a bit, we think it's -- just as -- just to run at the same level as the first half would suggest that the second half of the year is going to run over 7%. I think as we also feel that as we look at the group booking pace as it carries into the second half of the year, it does seem to be a little bit stronger. The rate does seem to be growing. So that gives us a fair amount of confidence that things should be a little bit better. The trickiest part of this whole process is to try to assess the economy. If you look at the blue-chip consensus and use that as, at least, a measure of how folks are looking at the economy, they're essentially calling for better than 3% GDP growth in the second half of the year compared to about 2% in the first half of the year. So if that's true, that should clearly help us in general because, of course, our industry is dependent on economic growth. As we look at business investment, while that -- while the outlook for business investment is a bit more conservative than where it was at the beginning of the year, it is still quite robust. That, in our mind, has been one of the factors behind a strong transient demand and rate growth that we've seen. Now we don't see any reason why that's going to slow a little bit. So I think at the end of the day, you put all those factors together and especially as you look at the fourth quarter, which is where our forecast are showing the most strength, we generally think that we're going to be in much better shape in the second half of the year than in the first."

But my recollection is that the revenue number came in relatively close to where -- if the revenues were ahead at the beginning of the quarter. I think what we've found is that we ended up with a little bit fewer room nights than what we saw. I think we were positive on the room night side coming into the quarter, and we booked less in the quarter for the quarter than we had the prior year. So that declined a bit. But the good news is that as the business all shifted around, the overall rate improvement that we experienced in the second quarter was better than we had forecasted. So we ended up with -- in roughly 4.5% revenue improvement that we had. I should note, too, is I don't want to overdo the commentary regarding Sheraton in New York and Philadelphia. But as I have found in trying to understand how we're doing is that sometimes pulling those assets out, just because of the level of disruption there, gives me better insight as to how the company is doing. If you look at the group side and you take those 2 assets out, what you find is the group demand was up over a point. Leaving out those 2 assets, then the overall revenue growth was higher than what I described, in part, because both of those hotels are big group hotels, especially Philadelphia. And they just weren't able to do the level of group business that they normally would have done. So as you think about the -- your question, which I think is a really good one to think about it for the third and fourth quarter, what I would probably be expecting is that we might find that, in the third quarter, our group room nights is a little less than the 3% we're running ahead right now, although we have healthy rates -- rate growth in the third quarter. So I think bottom line is that the overall results for the third quarter for group should be fairly positive. The fourth quarter I would still expect to see continuing a trend that we've seen all year. I would like to expect that we will find that there'll be more rooms booked going into the fourth quarter when we're talking to you in October than what we have right now, because the pace sort of that quarter out or so has still been pretty good. So I would expect to see some additional strength in the fourth quarter."

Or is it simply that they go back to market averages, and that if there was additional upside based on what you spend that, that wouldn't really be contemplated in what you're guiding to today?"

As it relates to Sheraton in New York, we're sort of -- we're only about halfway through the process there. So we are looking at -- we expect to see good RevPAR growth from that hotel for the rest of the year. Some of that is New York. Some of that is the fact that the new rooms that we've done at that hotel is spectacular, especially compared to the rooms that we've had before. So there I think we are probably getting some of the lift out of the work we're doing. In the case of Philadelphia, one point I want to clarify is that we finished the main tower, the main building, which is the bulk of the hotel rooms there. But we still have the expansion that we did in that hotel about a decade ago called The Headhouse. We still have the rooms to do there. So Philadelphia will not be completely done until the fourth quarter. I think the combination of the new rooms and the new meeting space is clearly going to make that hotel that much more attractive, and so we'll see some good lift. It's unfortunate, in some ways, that the timing of this renovation -- we've been doing the Philadelphia renovation to be ready for the expansion of the Convention Center, and a tremendous amount of group business is going to hit next year. This year has also turned out to be a very solid year in Philadelphia. And I think Larry had told me that if you pulled Philadelphia, our Philadelphia hotel out of our Philadelphia result, our Philadelphia RevPAR would be up 9% in this past quarter. So it gives you a sense of the pain we're feeling to have the construction going on at this point in time. But at the end of the day, it was better to be ready for next year than it was to delay the renovation and then hurt yourself from what we think will be a very strong group year, especially when we have the best situated group hotel in the market for convention business."

But I think you've correctly analyzed it, that we would expect the fourth quarter to be stronger than the third quarter. I think that there's -- probably, I would have 2 basic reasons for that. One is that I think that the current issues that are floating around out there probably have a little bit more effect on Q3 than Q4, and I think the economic outlook for Q4, for most people, seems to be a bit more positive. The other point that I would make on that is that not only do we expect the renovations that we've been doing this year to moderate a bit, at least in terms of the 2 significant projects that we've been identifying, but as you circle back to last year, you may or may not remember that our investment spend, our capital spend in Q4 of last year was considerably larger than what we had done in Qs 1 through 3. And so as we think about overlapping that year with the fourth quarter of 2011, we sort of view it that there was construction disruption last year. That was one of the reasons why our fourth quarter was a little bit weaker than you might have anticipated, given the way the rest of the year had played out. We will get the benefit of that sort of relative weakness as we come into the fourth quarter of this year. So for both of those reasons, we would expect the fourth quarter to be stronger, and I think the big question is going to be how much."

Good morning, everyone. we are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results despite the impact of hurricane Irene on our East Coast hotels, and the headwinds from global economic concerns over the last several months. Let'",1602,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. we are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results despite the impact of hurricane Irene on our East Coast hotels, and the headwinds from global economic concerns over the last several months. 
Let's start by reviewing the quarter and then we'll offer some insights into the rest of 2011 and next year. 
Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the third quarter increased 6.4%, driven by an improvement in our average rate of 3.7% combined with an occupancy increase of 1.9 percentage points. Our average rate for the quarter was $169 and our average occupancy was nearly 76%, which is only 1.3 points shy of 2007 levels. 
This performance fell slightly short of our expectations because of the arrival of hurricane Irene in late August, which resulted in group cancellations in Washington and Philadelphia as the complete evacuation of the Marriott New York Downtown Hotel. 
Altogether, the storm costs an approximately 60 basis points hit to our RevPAR for the quarter. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, our comparable hotel results do not include the performance of the $1.7 billion of acquisitions we have completed over the last 15 months, which averaged better than 14% growth in the quarter. 
Comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of 4% contributed to an overall revenue growth of 5.3% for the quarter. This increase, when combined with our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increase of 110 basis points and the performance of our acquisition, resulted in a 28% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $212 million, an FFO per diluted share of $0.16.
On the year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.3% driven primarily by rate improvement. Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 5.3%, combined with profit margins that increased 80 basis points, resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $669 million, which represents an increase of over 23%, an FFO per diluted share of $0.57. 
Year-to-date, FFO per diluted share was negatively affected by $0.03, for acquisition, debt repayment and impairment costs.
Business mix trends were generally favorable this quarter, as we realized demand and rate increases in both our transient and group business. As in the past quarter, transient demand and rate was a primary drivers of RevPAR growth. 
Overall, transient room nights for the quarter increased 3%, led by a 5.5% increase in Special Corporate demand. While retail rated room nights were down slightly, the segment still reported solid revenue growth driven by a 6.5% increase in average rate. 
The strong rate performance in this segment, combined with rate increases in all other transient segments, contributed to an overall, rate increase of more than 4%. The increase in both transient demand and average rate produced transient revenue growth of more than 7%. 
Turning to our group business. We were pleased to see a 1.3% improvement in demand, despite the weather-related cancellations. The increase was driven entirely by a nearly 15% increase in demand in our higher-rated corporate business, as the discount segments declined 6%. 
The combination of average rate increases in our higher-priced segments and positive mix shift resulted in an overall increase in group rate of more than 3%. This increase in rate, combined with the demand improvement, resulted in a nearly 4.5% increase in group revenue for the quarter.
Despite the upheaval of the equity market, created by headlines about legislative gridlock and slow employment group of growth in the U.S. and sovereign debt rates in the EU, our outlook for the remainder of the remains quite positive. Our fourth quarter group booking pace is quite solid compared with last year with bookings up over 2% and revenues ahead by almost 5%. 
In addition, our transient bookings are up over 6% with very strong rate growth. While our realistic appraisal of the impact of weaker economic data suggest that we will not experience significant outperformance in the fourth quarter, we do expect that fourth quarter RevPAR growth will generally be in line or slightly better than what we experienced in the last 2 quarters, leading to fully RevPAR growth of between 6 in the quarter and 6 and 3 quarters percent. Assuming that adjusted margins -- profit margins expand between 80 and 90 basis points, we would project that adjusted EBITDA will range between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion, which will reflect full year growth of 23% over 2010. We project FFO per diluted share of between $0.86 and $0.88, which has been reduced by $0.03 per share for acquisitions, debt repayment and impairment costs.
While we are not prepared to offer any specific guidance relative to RevPAR or revenue growth for 2012, and we fully appreciate the event risk that may threaten overall economic growth for next year, we would reconfirm the sentiments offered by others at the industry that the fundamental for our business continue to be attractive. 
We would start by noting that supply growth in 2012 is projected to be roughly 0.5%, which is a small fraction of the long term industry average. This would suggest that occupancy rates should continue to grow even if economic growth is more modest and expected early in the year. The group booking pace for next year is strong with room nights up over 4% at higher rates. Especially in the important second and fourth quarters were room nights are ahead by more than 9%. The recently issued government per diem rates which increased an average of 5% across our major markets plus expectations for successful Special Corporate negotiations, all point to our higher transient rates. 
Given a significant recovery in occupancy rates over the last 2 years, who should be starting the year in a position of strength, which suggest that we should benefit from both mix shift and absolute rate increases across most segments. 
In short, there's a clear opportunity for a very solid RevPAR growth for next year. On the investment front, we had a relatively quiet last couple of months. As we noted in the press release, on behalf of our joint venture, we recently completed the previously announced acquisition of the Pullman Bercy for EUR 96 million. This is the venture's first hotel in Paris and the property is located in the growing business district of Bercy. 
Despite the financial issues in the EU, RevPAR in the overall paris market has increased 17% year-to-date, and we would expect those market and the hotel to perform well over the next several years. We also noted in the release that we had negotiated an extension of the closing date at no additional costs for our previously announced acquisition of the Grand Hyatt Washington, D.C. 
Given the recent volatility in global equity markets and general uncertainty in the Eurozone of the U.S., we determined that extending the closing date would allow us to remain flexible and to further monitor economic trends, global developments and capital markets, while establishing a clear understanding of their impact on 2012 operations. 
Should we choose not to close at the end of the extension period, we will forefeet our initial deposit and record a onetime charge of $15 million. We still believe that this hotel is a terrific asset centrally located in one of the world's top markets with good long-term potential. 
While we are continuing to review potential acquisitions, at this point it appears unlikely that any other transactions we closed before year end so the guidance we provided does not assume an incremental investment. 
On the disposition front, we are marketing a few selective properties for sale, but would expect that these transactions would most likely not close until the first quarter of next year. 
We remain confident that investing in our existing portfolio provides very attractive returns. Continuing our pattern throughout 2011, capital spending in the quarter continue to increase, as we totally invested $95 million this quarter compared to $49 million in 2010. 
Redevelopment and return on investment projects spending totaled $32 million this quarter, and included a redevelopment project of the Chicago Marriott O'Hare, the Sheraton Indianapolis and the Atlanta Perimeter Center. 
For the full year, we expect to spend $220 million to $240 million on these types of projects. In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we expect $63 million in the third quarter, which included the renovation of the 45,000 square foot Broadway Ballroom at the New York Marriott Marquis. 
During the quarter, we have began work on extensive room renovations of the JW Marriott Buckhead, and the JW Marriott, Desert Springs Resort & Spa. 
For the year, we expect to spend approximately $300 million to $320 million on maintenance capital expenditures. Overall, given the overhang of uncertainty regarding the U.S. economy and international sovereign debt issues, we were very pleased with our results this quarter. 
While we can, at some level, appreciate the sentiment that has cost equity valuations in the sector to the client, we suspect that only the risk and the risk-benefit equation are being noticed. 
As we highlighted, the fundamentals of our business remain attractive. Transient demand is strong and good demand continues to improve. As RevPAR is increasingly driven by improvements in average rate, margin growth and flow-through will accelerate. Additions to supply have been restrained and will likely remain well below historical levels for at least the next 3 years. 
Finally, we note that our current equity valuations suggest the value of roughly 200k per hotel room, which is about half of what it would cost to replace our portfolio. 
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Our top-performing markets for the third quarter was Phoenix with a RevPAR increase of 24.4%. Strong group demand resulted in an occupancy increase of over 7 percentage points. 
Some of the group demand improvement was due to meeting space renovations at the Westin Kierland and the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix in the third quarter of 2010. The ADR growth of 8% was driven by increases in both group and transient rates. We expect our Phoenix hotels have an outstanding fourth quarter due to excellent group and transient demand and further ADR growth. 
Our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels had another great quarter with RevPAR up 20.6%. Occupancy increased over 12 percentage points, as group demand was very strong and ADR improved nearly 2%. 
The renovation of the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriot in the third quarter of 2010 contributed to the strong RevPAR growth. We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to have a great fourth quarter because of strong group and transient demand, as well as some improvements in average rates. 
Despite these results in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, our Florida region was affected by significant renovations at the Ritz-Carlton Island and the Hilton sinker Island. 
Our San Francisco hotels continue their exceptional performance. RevPAR increased 17% as ADR improved over 11% and occupancy increased 4 percentage points. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and the shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. 
Both group and transient demand were strong. We expect the San Francisco market to continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. Our Houston hotels had another strong quarter with a RevPAR up 12.6%, as occupancy increased over 6 percentage points while ADR increased 2%. 
The occupancy increase was driven by strong corporate transient demand. We expect the Houston market to continue to perform very well in the fourth quarter. RevPAR for Hawaii hotels increased 6.8%. Occupancy improved 5 percentage points to nearly 85%, driven by wholesale and leisure promotions, as well as increased airline capacity. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect Hawaii to significantly outperform the portfolio due to improvements in transient demand, a shift in mix to higher-rated business and the benefit from the renovation of hotels in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
RevPAR for our Chicago hotels increased by 6.7%, driven by an increase in occupancy over 3 percentage points and an improvement in average rate of over 2%. As higher transient demand offset lower levels of group business. We expect our Chicago hotels to have a good fourth quarter due to strong group bookings. 
RevPAR for our New York hotels increased 6.7% due to an ADR improvement of nearly 8%, while occupancy fell 1 percentage points. RevPAR growth would have exceeded 8% without the negative effect of evacuation and cancellations related to hurricane Irene. 
We expect our New York hotels to have an excellent fourth quarter. RevPAR for our Washington D.C. hotels increased 2.1% with ADR increasing nearly 2% and a slight occupancy increase. Operations were affected by concerns surrounding the budget and debt ceiling which led to less government and government related group and transient business. We expect the D.C. market to perform better in the fourth quarter, as government per diem rates have increased in the market. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels decreased 1.4% with a slight decrease in both occupancy and ADR. Results were affected by the lack of group demand and rate particularly the Sheraton Boston. While we expect strong transient demand in the fourth quarter, group demand is expected to continue to be weak. 
Lastly, our worst-performing market for the third quarter was in New Orleans. RevPAR fell 10.5% primarily due to the substantial amount of DP contract room nights generated by the golf oil spill in the third quarter of last year, and a decline in government-related group business. RevPAR fell as occupancy declined over 12 percentage points. However, ADR did increase over 6%. 
We expect the New Orleans market to have a rough fourth quarter due to the reopening of the 1,200-room Hyatt, year-over-year reduction demand generated by the Gulf oil spill and the renovation of the meeting space at our hotel in the fourth quarter. 
Year-to-date, San Francisco has been our best-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 19% followed by Hawaii with a RevPAR increase of 13%. Phoenix with a 12.2% increase and Houston with 11.9% increase. 
Our worst performing markets have been Philadelphia with a RevPAR decrease of 4.5% and Boston with a 0.3% increase. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 5.2% for the quarter, as ADR increased 6.2% and occupancy fell roughly 1%. Group demand was weak due to 3 of the JV hotels having their meeting space under renovation in the quarter. In particular, the Sheraton Roma had a significant negative impact on RevPAR due to its meeting space renovations. 
Excluding the Sheraton Roma, RevPAR would have increased over 8% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros improved 8%, as average rates improved 5.5% and occupancy increased 1.7 percentage points. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 110 basis points. Margins for the quarter benefited from better productivity as wages and benefits on a pro-occupied room basis was essentially flat plate. Rooms flow-through was good at roughly 75%. Food and beverage revenues increased 4.1% for the quarter. F&B flow-through was approximately 26%, which was better than the first half of the year but profits were still lower than expected. 
There were 2 primary reasons: The first is that we had a number of restaurants in some meeting space under renovation in the quarter, where the negative impact on F&B profits was higher than anticipated. In addition, the hotels had lower group spent, only a portion of which was anticipated. Unallocated costs increased approximately 3%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses at our variable revenues included credit card commissions, reward programs and cluster and shared service allocations. 
Utility costs increased 3.7%. Insurance costs increased significantly due to an increase in replacement costs and premium increases as part of our June 1st renewal of our property insurance programs. 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect margins to generally perform in line with what we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year. We should get some benefit from a RevPAR increase driven more by rate growth than occupancy and the potential for improvement in F&B flow-through. 
We do, however, expect unallocated costs increased more than inflation particularly for rewards and sales and marketing costs, where higher revenues will increase costs. And we expect property taxes to rise well in excess inflation due to refunds received in the fourth quarter of 2010 that will not recur in the fourth quarter of this year. 
As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the full year to increase 80 basis points at the low end of the range and increased 90 basis points at the high end of the RevPAR range. 
One last item, the full-year guidance that we gave on the second quarter earnings call assumed that we close on the acquisition of the Grand Hyatt in Washington D.C. in mid-September. That guidance included $9 million of projected EBITDA on 2011 from the hotel during our anticipated period of ownership. 
With the extension of the closing until mid-December, our current guidance assumes that there would be minimal EBITDA from the acquisition in 2011. If we do not acquire the hotel, we would forefeet our $50 million deposit and reduce our 2011 adjusted EBITDA by $15 million. 
From NAREIT FFO per share purposes, it's a little more complicated. Our second quarter earnings call guidance had very little FFO for the Hyatt because of interest expense related to the assumed debt and the assumed payment of a $7 million transfer tax for the acquisition. Which together, roughly offset the property level EBITDA of $9 million. 
The transfer tax is considered an acquisition costs under GAAP and deducted from NAREIT FFO. Accordingly, our current guidance includes a loss of approximately $0.01 per share for FFO primarily due to the payment of these transport taxes. 
If we do not close the acquisition, NAREIT FFO would be an additional $8 million or roughly $0.01 per share lower than our current guidance. This amount represents the loss of the deposit partially offset by the transfer taxes and interest expense that we would not have to pay. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

That number does tend to vary a bit from period to period, but it's roughly up about 1 point right now. Going back to the deal market, I guess what I would say is, we're trying to assess that right now. Sellers have clearly not dropped their prices yet. The cost of capital for most buyers has gone up a bit, which probably suggest that buyers are looking to pay a little bit less. There's not been a whole lot of activity over the course of the last 90 days into the equity markets started to move. We are seeing good activity on the properties that we are marketing. I would say that generally, we're seeing less activity from the other REITs and I think everybody would understand that with weak share prices lower, that REITs are going to be a little bit careful and how to expand whatever cash our liquidity that they have recognizing that they probably are not comfortable are returning to the equity market right now given were equity market prices are. So I think that I would suspect overall, that the pace of activity in the second half of the year will fall short of what folks expect it to be back in June partly because of the reduction in share prices. But having said that, and kind of looking at the response that we're getting for some of the properties that have on the market, there are still an active market out there. But I would also agree with your point that pricing could get a little bit more attractive as sellers begin to accept the new reality and that's one of the reasons why we continue to be interested in completing acquisitions."

We've seen a consistent trend throughout the year that -- the fourth quarter was the only quarter that back in January was significantly negative in terms of both room nights and revenues. The other quarters were generally positive especially from a revenue perspective. As we have worked our way through the year, we have seen continued improvement in the fourth quarter probably more importantly, as we look at what is actually happened over the course of the last 60 to 90 days, our bookings for the fourth quarter were stronger than they had been in 2010. So we booked more room nights in the last 60 days for the fourth quarter than we did last year. And those bookings were also ahead of the pace that we had seen in 2007. So net-net, while there was a bit of a hole that needed to be filled in the fourth quarter, we have been pleased with the progress throughout the year. But we certainly have been pleased with the progress that we've seen at the end of the summer despite all the noise that was out there at the time of that, that was happening."

There were a big group in Philadelphia that canceled. We had a shutdown the financial center Marriott for the entire weekend. So you never want to see that happening in New York. And in Washington, D.C., we were expecting a fair amount of business, both group and transient, related to the celebration of the I guess the presentation, the opening of the Martin Luther King's Memorial. All of which, were arraigned out by hurricane Irene so the net effect of that was that was about 60 basis points in the quarter.

But I'm comfortable that, that value is going to be there are ultimately in '12 and in '13 and in '14 and it's only going to be higher. What I need to make certain of is that we don't make any steps now that may force us to do something stupid later, which might be selling an asset at a bad price or borrowing at a very expensive rate. So that's -- it's an issue that we're talking about regularly here. It's an issue that I'm talking about with the board. But I think right now, the prudent call is to wait till you get the asset sales done and then reevaluate the opportunity. And the good news is, the stock prices is a lot higher."

If you go back to another period in time, which even there was probably a little bit better because of the events of 911, what we saw and that downturn is that group activity actually decline more slowly than transient but overall, the room night decline was really pretty equal in our portfolio, both group and transient, were down about 9% in the 01 to '03 timeframe. So when I look at that and we look at the issue look at what happened in the last downturn, we tend to still think that in the long run, it's good to have a portfolio that is a little bit over represented in the group sector because we ultimately think that the normal cycle, without the political rhetoric, the group will tend to hold up a bit better than transient well. Now as we look at next year, I think you're quite cities is a very good 1. Clearly, we this year, we have been expense embedded revenue growth and the transient side. Our transient activity and our transient demand is already had of where we were in '07. So it's like you could argue using that as a peak transient activities back to where it was before. I would point out that at least in our portfolio, transient activities not quite back to where it was in 2000. So I do think there's still room for growth, on transient side. But I do think the opportunity for next year is on the books I. I may vary out is, as we have been seeing solid demand growth in the corporate segment, that's the most volatile segment of our overall, group business and so I think seeing continued growth there is important to try to drive an ultimately recovering the. On the group side, we still have percent to 10% below where we were in '07. We're not that far below in rate but we we're way below in terms of room, guys. So when I think about '12, I think that's an area where we have an opportunity for our performance is group activity continues to improve."

The fact that they were comfortable about the level of group activity that they have on the books. All of that I think rates a better foundation for our side at this discussion to happen on because while we want Special Corporate business, we probably don't need it a desperately as we did back when we were having these discussions in 2009.

I don't know that I would necessarily -- I would suggest though that we could make the same level of cost that we made in 2008 and 2009 because we have certainly been working hard with each of our operators to make certain that where we thought best where we thought they had cut fat last time we don't want that certain.

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results despite the impact of Hurricane Irene on our East Coast hotels and the headwinds emanating from global economic concerns over the last several month",1598,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results despite the impact of Hurricane Irene on our East Coast hotels and the headwinds emanating from global economic concerns over the last several months. 
Let's start by reviewing the quarter and then we will offer some insights into the rest of 2011 and next year. 
Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the third quarter increased 6.4%, driven by an improvement in our average rate of 3.7% combined with an occupancy increase of 1.9 percentage points. Our average rate for the quarter was at $169 and our average occupancy was nearly 76%, which is only 1.3 points shy of 2007 levels. 
This performance fell slightly short of our expectations because of the arrival of Hurricane Irene in late August, which resulted in group cancellations in Washington and Philadelphia and the complete evacuation of the Marriott New York Downtown Hotel. 
Altogether, the storm caused an approximately 60 basis point hit to our RevPAR for the quarter. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, our comparable hotel results do not include the performance of the $1.7 billion of acquisitions we have completed over the last 15 months, which averaged better than 14% growth in the quarter. 
Comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of 4% contributed to an overall revenue growth of 5.3% for the quarter. This increase, when combined with our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increase of 110 basis points and the performance of our acquisition, resulted in a 28% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $212 million, an FFO per diluted share of $0.16.
On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.3% driven primarily by rate improvement. Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 5.3%, combined with profit margins that increased 80 basis points, resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $669 million, which represents an increase of over 23%, an FFO per diluted share of $0.57. 
Year-to-date, FFO per diluted share was negatively affected by $0.03 for acquisition, debt repayment and impairment costs.
Business mix trends were generally favorable this quarter as we realized demand and rate increases in both our transient and group business. As in the past quarter, transient demand and rate were the primary drivers of RevPAR growth. 
Overall, transient room nights for the quarter increased 3%, led by a 5.5% increase in Special Corporate demand. While retail rated room nights were down slightly, the segment still recorded solid revenue growth driven by a 6.5% increase in average rate. 
The strong rate performance in this segment, combined with the rate increases in all other transient segments, contributed to an overall rate increase of more than 4%. The increase in both transient demand and average rate produced transient revenue growth of more than 7%. 
Turning to our group business. We were pleased to see a 1.3% improvement in demand despite the weather-related cancellations. The increase was driven entirely by a nearly 15% increase in demand in our higher-rated corporate business, as the discount segments declined 6%. 
The combination of average rate increases in our higher-priced segments and positive mix shift resulted in an overall increase in group rate of more than 3%. This increase in rate, combined with the demand improvement, resulted in a nearly 4.5% increase in group revenue for the quarter.
Despite the upheaval in the equity markets created by headlines about legislative gridlock and slow employment growth in the U.S. and sovereign debt risks in the EU, our outlook for the remainder of the year remains quite positive. Our fourth quarter group booking pace is quite solid compared with last year with bookings up over 2% and revenues ahead by almost 5%. 
In addition, our transient bookings are up over 6% with very strong rate growth. While our realistic appraisal of the impact of weaker economic data suggests that we will not experience significant outperformance in the fourth quarter, we do expect that fourth quarter RevPAR growth will generally be in line or slightly better than what we experienced in the last 2 quarters, leading to full year RevPAR growth of between 6% in the quarter and 6.75%. 
Assuming that adjusted margins -- profit margins expand between 80 and 90 basis points, we would project that adjusted EBITDA will range between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion, which will reflect full year growth of 23% over 2010. We project FFO per diluted share of between $0.86 and $0.88, which has been reduced by $0.03 per share for acquisition, debt repayment and impairment costs.
While we are not prepared to offer any specific guidance relative to RevPAR or revenue growth for 2012, and we fully appreciate the event risk that may threaten overall economic growth for next year, we would reconfirm the sentiments offered by others in the industry that the fundamentals for our business continue to be attractive. 
We would start by noting that supply growth in 2012 is projected to be roughly 0.5%, which is a small fraction of the long-term industry average. This would suggest that occupancy rates should continue to grow even if economic growth is more modest and expected earlier in the year. The group booking pace for next year is strong with room nights up over 4% at higher rates, especially, in the important second and fourth quarters where room nights are ahead by more than 9%. The recently issued government per diem rates, which increased an average of 5% across our major markets plus expectations for successful Special Corporate negotiations, all point towards higher transient rates. 
Given the significant recovery in occupancy rates over the last 2 years, we should be starting the year in a position of strength, which suggests that we should benefit from both mix shift and absolute rate increases across most segments. In short, there is a clear opportunity for very solid RevPAR growth for next year. 
On the investment front, we had a relatively quiet last couple of months. As we noted in the press release, on behalf of our joint venture, we recently completed the previously announced acquisition of the Pullman Bercy for EUR 96 million. This is the venture's first hotel in Paris, and the property is located in the growing business district of Bercy. 
Despite the financial issues in the EU, RevPAR in the overall Paris market has increased 17% year-to-date, and we would expect the market and the hotel to perform well over the next several years. We also noted in the release that we had negotiated an extension of the closing date at no additional costs for our previously announced acquisition of the Grand Hyatt Washington, D.C. 
Given the recent volatility in global equity markets and general uncertainty in the eurozone and the U.S., we determined that extending the closing date would allow us to remain flexible and to further monitor economic trends, global developments and capital markets while establishing a clear understanding of their impact on 2012 operations. 
Should we choose not to close at the end of the extension period, we will forefeet our initial deposit and record a onetime charge of $15 million. We still believe that this hotel is a terrific asset centrally located in one of the world's top markets with good long-term potential. 
While we are continuing to review potential acquisitions, at this point it appears unlikely that any other transactions would close before year end so the guidance we provided does not assume any incremental investment. 
On the disposition front, we are marketing a few selective properties for sale, but would expect that these transactions would most likely not close until the first quarter of next year. 
We remain confident that investing in our existing portfolio provides very attractive returns. Continuing our pattern throughout 2011, capital spending in the quarter continued to increase, as in total we invested $95 million this quarter compared to $49 million in 2010. 
Redevelopment and return on investment project spending totaled $32 million this quarter and include the redevelopment projects at the Chicago Marriott O'Hare, the Sheraton Indianapolis and the Atlanta Perimeter Center. For the full year, we expect to spend $220 million to $240 million on these types of projects. 
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $63 million in the third quarter, which included the renovation of the 45,000-square foot Broadway Ballroom at the New York Marriott Marquis. 
During the quarter, we began work on extensive room renovations of the JW Marriott Buckhead, and the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa. For the year, we expect to spend approximately $300 million to $320 million on maintenance capital expenditures. 
Overall, given the overhang of uncertainty regarding the U.S. economy and international sovereign debt issues, we were very pleased with our results this quarter. 
While we can, at some level, appreciate the sentiment that has caused equity valuations in the sector to decline, we suspect that only the risks and the risk-benefit equation are being noticed. 
As we highlighted, the fundamentals of our business remain attractive. Transient demand is strong and group demand continues to improve. As RevPAR is increasingly driven by improvements in average rate, margin growth and flow-through will accelerate. Additions to supply have been restrained and will likely remain well below historical levels for at least the next 3 years. 
Finally, we note that our current equity valuations suggest a value of roughly 200k per hotel room, which is about half of what it would cost to replace our portfolio. 
Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Our top-performing markets for the third quarter was Phoenix with a RevPAR increase of 24.4%. Strong group demand resulted in an occupancy increase of over 7 percentage points. 
Some of the group demand improvement was due to meeting space renovations at the Westin Kierland and the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix in the third quarter of 2010. The ADR growth of 8% was driven by increases in both group and transient rates. We expect our Phoenix hotels to have an outstanding fourth quarter due to an excellent group and transient demand and further ADR growth. 
Our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels had another great quarter with RevPAR up 20.6%. Occupancy increased over 12 percentage points, as group demand was very strong and ADR improved nearly 2%. 
The renovation of the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott in the third quarter of 2010 contributed to the strong RevPAR growth. We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to have a great fourth quarter because of strong group and transient demand, as well as some improvement in average rates. 
Despite these results in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, our Florida region was affected by significant renovations at the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and the Hilton Singer Island. 
Our San Francisco hotels continue their exceptional performance. RevPAR increased 17% as ADR improved over 11% and occupancy increased 4 percentage points. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and the shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. 
Both group and transient demand were strong. We expect the San Francisco market to continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. Our Houston hotels had another strong quarter with RevPAR up 12.6% as occupancy increased over 6 percentage points while ADR increased 2%. The occupancy increase was driven by strong corporate transient demand. We expect the Houston market to continue to perform very well in the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR for Hawaii hotels increased 6.8%. Occupancy improved 5 percentage points to nearly 85%, driven by wholesale and leisure promotions, as well as increased airline capacity. For the fourth quarter, we expect Hawaii to significantly outperform the portfolio due to improvements in transient demand, a shift in mix to higher-rated business and the benefit from the renovation of the hotels in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
RevPAR for our Chicago hotels increased by 6.7%, driven by an increase in occupancy of over 3 percentage points and an improvement in average rate of over 2% as higher transient demand offset lower levels of group business. We expect our Chicago hotels to have a good fourth quarter due to strong group bookings. 
RevPAR for our New York hotels increased 6.7% due to an ADR improvement of nearly 8%, while occupancy fell 1 percentage point. RevPAR growth would have exceeded 8% without the negative effect of evacuations and cancellations related to Hurricane Irene. We expect our New York hotels to have an excellent fourth quarter. 
RevPAR for our Washington D.C. hotels increased 2.1% with ADR increasing nearly 2% and a slight occupancy increase. Operations were affected by concerns surrounding the budget and debt ceiling, which led to less government and government-related group and transient business. We expect the D.C. market to perform better in the fourth quarter, as government per diem rates have increased in the market. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels decreased 1.4% with a slight decrease in both occupancy and ADR. Results were affected by the lack of group demand and rate particularly at the Sheraton Boston. While we expect strong transient demand in the fourth quarter, group demand is expected to continue to be weak. 
Lastly, our worst-performing market for the third quarter was New Orleans. RevPAR fell 10.5% primarily due to the substantial amount of BP contract room nights generated by the Gulf oil spill in the third quarter of last year and a decline in government-related group business. RevPAR fell as occupancy declined over 12 percentage points. However, ADR did increase over 6%. We expect the New Orleans market to have a rough fourth quarter due to the reopening of the 1,200-room Hyatt, year-over-year reduction in demand generated by the Gulf oil spill and the renovation of the meeting space at our hotel in the fourth quarter. 
Year-to-date, San Francisco has been our best-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 19% followed by Hawaii with a RevPAR increase of 13%, phoenix with a 12.2% increase and Houston with 11.9% increase. 
Our worst-performing markets have been Philadelphia with a RevPAR decrease of 4.5% and Boston with a 0.3% increase. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 5.2% for the quarter, as ADR increased 6.2% and occupancy fell roughly 1%. Group demand was weak due to 3 of the JV hotels having their meeting space under renovation in the quarter. In particular, the Sheraton Roma had a significant negative impact on RevPAR due to its meeting space renovations. 
Excluding the Sheraton Roma, RevPAR would have increased over 8% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros improved 8%, as average rates improved 5.5% and occupancy increased 1.7 percentage points. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 110 basis points. Margins for the quarter benefited from better productivity as wages and benefits on a pro-occupied room basis was essentially flat plate. Rooms flow-through was good at roughly 75%. Food and beverage revenues increased 4.1% for the quarter. F&B flow-through was approximately 26%, which was better than the first half of the year, but profits were still lower than expected. There were 2 primary reasons: The first is that we had a number of restaurants in some meeting space under renovation in the quarter, where the negative impact on F&B profits was higher than anticipated. In addition, a few hotels had lower group spend, only a portion of which was anticipated. 
Unallocated costs increased approximately 3%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs, and cluster and shared service allocations. 
Utility costs increased 3.7%. Insurance costs increased significantly due to an increase in replacement costs and premium increases as part of our June 1 renewal of our property insurance program. 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect margins to generally perform in line with what we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year. We should get some benefit from a RevPAR increase driven more by rate growth than occupancy and the potential for improvement in F&B flow-through. 
We do, however, expect unallocated costs to increase more than inflation particularly for rewards and sales and marketing costs, where higher revenues will increase cost. And we expect property taxes to rise well in excess inflation due to refunds received in the fourth quarter of 2010 that will not recur in the fourth quarter of this year. 
As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the full year to increase 80 basis points at the low end of the range and increase 90 basis points at the high end of the RevPAR range. 
One last item, the full year guidance that we gave on the second quarter earnings call assumed that we close on the acquisition of the Grand Hyatt in Washington D.C. in mid-September. That guidance included $9 million of projected EBITDA in 2011 from the hotel during our anticipated period of ownership. 
With the extension of the closing until mid-December, our current guidance assumes that there would be minimal EBITDA from the acquisition in 2011. If we do not acquire the hotel, we would forefeet our $50 million deposit and reduce our 2011 adjusted EBITDA by $15 million. 
From NAREIT FFO per share purposes, it's a little more complicated. Our second quarter earnings call guidance had very little FFO for the Hyatt because of interest expense related to the assumed debt and the assumed payment of a $7 million transfer tax for the acquisition which, together, roughly offset the property level EBITDA of $9 million. 
The transfer tax is considered an acquisition cost under GAAP and deducted from NAREIT FFO. Accordingly, our current guidance includes a loss of approximately $0.01 per share for FFO primarily due to the payment of these transport taxes. 
If we do not close the acquisition, NAREIT FFO would be an additional $8 million or roughly $0.01 per share lower than our current guidance. This amount represents the loss of the deposit partially offset by the transfer taxes and interest expense that we would not have to pay. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

Going back to the deal market, I guess what I would say is that it's -- we're trying to assess that right now. I would -- sellers have clearly not dropped their prices yet. The cost of capital for most buyers has gone up a bit, which probably suggests that buyers are looking to pay a little bit less. There has not been a whole lot of activity over the course of the last 90 days since the equity markets started to move. We are seeing good activity on the properties that we are marketing. I would say that generally, we're seeing less activity from the other REITs, and I think everybody would understand that with REIT share prices lower, that REITs are going to be a little bit more careful in how to expand whatever cash or liquidity that they have recognizing that they probably are not comfortable on returning to the equity market right now given where equity market prices are. So I think that I would suspect, overall, that the pace of activity in the second half of the year will fall short of what folks expected it to be back in June primarily because of the reduction in share prices. But having said that, and kind of looking at the response that we're getting for some of the properties that we have on the market, there's still an active market out there. But I would also agree with your point that pricing could get a little bit more attractive as sellers begin to accept the new reality, and that's one of the reasons why we continue to be interested in completing the acquisitions."

One was what we -- what I talked about in my comments which is the fact that we did lose some group activity and some fairly strong bookings in the East Coast that because of Hurricane Irene. We had a big group in Philadelphia that canceled. We had to shut down the Financial Center Marriott for the entire weekend. So you never want to see that happen in New York. And in Washington, D.C., we were expecting a fair amount of business, both group and transient, related to the celebration of the, I guess, the presentation, the opening of the Martin Luther King's Memorial, all of which were rained out by Hurricane Irene. So the net effect of that was that we lost 60 basis points in the quarter. And if we had that, we obviously would have been at the 7% level, maybe slightly above that for the quarter. So I think that's the first thing that changed. I think that the other part of it as we looked at the fourth quarter is that overall we continue to feel that the quarter is going to be good. Our property level forecasts are, frankly, stronger than the guidance that we're giving. I think the properties are a bit more optimistic that we are, but I think we felt like it would make sense to dial back a little bit on that. And I think that's why I made the point about the fact that we -- we're not going to outperform in the fourth quarter, but we still expect to perform in line in Q4."

But I think, if you -- as we also listen to what economic forecasters are predicting and you look at the fact that there are risks that suggest that there could be some problems out there. And I think, frankly, those risks are what are reflected in our stock price right now, that why it's so low. At the end of the day, I think the more prudent step for us to take is to be a little bit more cautious and a little bit more conservative with what we do with our capital. At least, until we have started to generate and completed some of asset sales that I think ultimately are the best way to fund the stock buyback. And in fact, what you're suggesting is have confidence that you get sales done and then use those proceeds now to buy at a lower price. There's a lot of logic to that. But ultimately, at the end of the day, what has served us well over the last decade when we approached some of these times of uncertainty is to be, maybe a little bit more cautious in how we used some of that incremental capital, be a little less quick to pull the trigger on some sort of -- on financial transactions similar to buying stock and just make certain that you kind of are comfortable that the world is headed in the right direction because liquidity can make a difference at different times in the cycle. And so I think ultimately, I would wholeheartedly agree with you about the value that's there. But I'm comfortable that, that value is going to be there ultimately in '12 and in '13 and in '14 and it's only going to be going higher. What I need to make certain of is that we don't take any steps now that may force us to do something stupid later, which might be selling an asset at a bad price or borrowing at a very expensive rate. So that's -- it's an issue that we're talking about regularly here. It's an issue that I'm talking about with the board. But I think right now, the prudent call is to wait till you get the asset sales done and then reevaluate the opportunity.

If you go back to another period in time, which even there was probably a little bit irregular because of the events of 9/11, what we saw on that downturn is that group activity actually declined more slowly than transient but overall, the room night decline was really pretty equal in our portfolio, both group and transient were down about 9% in the '01 to '03 timeframe. So when I look at that and when I look at the issue of -- and look at what happened in the last downturn, we tend to still think that in the long run, it's good to have a portfolio that is a little bit over represented in the group sector because we ultimately think that through a normal cycle, without the political rhetoric, the group will tend to hold up a bit better than transient well. Now as we look at next year, I think your question is a very good one. Clearly, this year, we've been experiencing better revenue growth on the transient side. Our transient activity and our transient demand is already ahead of where we were in '07. So in effect, you could argue using that as a peak, transient activity is back to where it was before. I would point out that at least in our portfolio, transient activity is not quite back to where it was in 2000. So there's -- I do think there's still room for growth on transient side. But I do think the opportunity for next year is on the group side. I mean, the reality is, as we've been seeing solid demand growth in the corporate segment, that's the most volatile segment of our group -- of our overall group business. And so I think seeing continued growth there is important to trying to drive an ultimately recovery in group. On the group side, we're still 9% to 10% below where we were in '07. We're not that far below in rate, but we're way behind in terms of room nights. So when I think about '12, I think that's the area where we have an opportunity for outperformance is group activity continues to improve."

I think it's still fairly early to understand how that's going to play out. I think that the fact that we already have much stronger occupancy in the industry is a big plus relative to the whole negotiated rate discussions because as our properties either on an individual basis or through each operator are more and more comfortable about the level of occupancy that they have. The fact that they were comfortable about the level of group activity that they have on the books. All of that I think creates a better foundation for our side of this discussion to happen on because while we want Special Corporate business, we probably don't need it desperately as we did back when we were having these discussions in 2009. So I think that creates the right sort of atmosphere for these discussions to happen. Now where exactly they're going to play out. I think Arnie gave some color in his comments. I'm sure that Starwood and Hyatt will in the next few weeks. And they're one step closer to that process. So I mean, really what at this point we're watching, we're monitoring.

And I think if it happens, that's the way it's going to show up. Then I think that there would be reductions that we could achieve at the properties that would be related to that demand. So at some level, if you start to see a meaningful falloff in occupancy, then you're going to see that you're going to go back and cut the hours that F&B outlets are open. You're going to end up with few housekeepers and you're going to end up with fewer managers than where we have right now. So I do think there's an opportunity to make additional cut. I don't know that I would necessarily -- I would suggest, though, that we could make the same level of cuts that we made in 2008 and 2009 because we have certainly been working hard with each of our operators to make certain that where we thought that -- where we thought they had cut fat last time, we haven't wanted that to return. So I think at the end of today, there is an opportunity to make reductions. Most of them would be demand related, but it's probably not to the same degree that we had last time."

My guess is that we would probably be a bit more cautious about '12. But as we would look out to the long term in terms of what we were expecting to see in individual markets, as we have looked at deals, we have continued to be comfortable that sort of the right type of dynamics are in place, to support long-term revenue and profitability growth consistent with what we would have seen before. So I really don't look at what's happened in the near term is changing that. Now I think the other thing that has happened is probably relates to that 5% to 7% price reduction that you're describing is that, I suspect that a fair amount of that's on the buyer side, not the seller side because I'm not certain sellers have gotten there quite yet, relates to the fact that everybody's cost of capital has crept up a little bit.

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results despite the impact of Hurricane Irene on our East Coast hotels, and the headwinds emanating from global economic concerns over the last several mont",1598,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results despite the impact of Hurricane Irene on our East Coast hotels, and the headwinds emanating from global economic concerns over the last several months. 
Let's start by reviewing the quarter and then we will offer some insights into the rest of 2011 and next year. 
Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the third quarter increased 6.4%, driven by an improvement in our average rate of 3.7% combined with an occupancy increase of 1.9 percentage points. Our average rate for the quarter was at $169 and our average occupancy was nearly 76%, which is only 1.3 points shy of 2007 levels. 
This performance fell slightly short of our expectations because of the arrival of Hurricane Irene in late August, which resulted in group cancellations in Washington and Philadelphia and the complete evacuation of the Marriott New York Downtown Hotel. 
Altogether, the storm caused an approximately 60 basis point hit to our RevPAR for the quarter. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, our comparable hotel results do not include the performance of the $1.7 billion of acquisitions we have completed over the last 15 months, which averaged better than 14% growth in the quarter. 
Comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of 4% contributed to an overall revenue growth of 5.3% for the quarter. This increase, when combined with our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increase of 110 basis points and the performance of our acquisition, resulted in a 28% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $212 million, an FFO per diluted share of $0.16.
On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.3% driven primarily by rate improvement. Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 5.3%, combined with profit margins that increased 80 basis points, resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $669 million, which represents an increase of over 23%, an FFO per diluted share of $0.57. 
Year-to-date, FFO per diluted share was negatively affected by $0.03 for acquisition, debt repayment and impairment costs.
Business mix trends were generally favorable this quarter as we realized demand and rate increases in both our transient and group business. As in the past quarter, transient demand and rate were the primary drivers of RevPAR growth. 
Overall, transient room nights for the quarter increased 3%, led by a 5.5% increase in Special Corporate demand. While retail rated room nights were down slightly, the segment still recorded solid revenue growth driven by a 6.5% increase in average rate. 
The strong rate performance in this segment, combined with the rate increases in all other transient segments, contributed to an overall rate increase of more than 4%. The increase in both transient demand and average rate produced transient revenue growth of more than 7%. 
Turning to our group business. We were pleased to see a 1.3% improvement in demand despite the weather-related cancellations. The increase was driven entirely by a nearly 15% increase in demand in our higher-rated corporate business, as the discount segments declined 6%. 
The combination of average rate increases in our higher-priced segments and positive mix shift resulted in an overall increase in group rate of more than 3%. This increase in rate, combined with the demand improvement, resulted in a nearly 4.5% increase in group revenue for the quarter.
Despite the upheaval in the equity markets created by headlines about legislative gridlock and slow employment growth in the U.S. and sovereign debt risks in the EU, our outlook for the remainder of the year remains quite positive. Our fourth quarter group booking pace is quite solid compared with last year with bookings up over 2% and revenues ahead by almost 5%. 
In addition, our transient bookings are up over 6% with very strong rate growth. While our realistic appraisal of the impact of weaker economic data suggests that we will not experience significant outperformance in the fourth quarter, we do expect that fourth quarter RevPAR growth will generally be in line or slightly better than what we experienced in the last 2 quarters, leading to full year RevPAR growth of between 6% in the quarter and 6.75%. 
Assuming that adjusted margins -- profit margins expand between 80 and 90 basis points, we would project that adjusted EBITDA will range between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion, which will reflect full year growth of 23% over 2010. We project FFO per diluted share of between $0.86 and $0.88, which has been reduced by $0.03 per share for acquisition, debt repayment and impairment costs.
While we are not prepared to offer any specific guidance relative to RevPAR or revenue growth for 2012, and we fully appreciate the event risk that may threaten overall economic growth for next year, we would reconfirm the sentiments offered by others in the industry that the fundamentals for our business continue to be attractive. 
We would start by noting that supply growth in 2012 is projected to be roughly 0.5%, which is a small fraction of the long-term industry average. This would suggest that occupancy rates should continue to grow even if economic growth is more modest and expected earlier in the year. The group booking pace for next year is strong with room nights up over 4% at higher rates, especially, in the important second and fourth quarters where room nights are ahead by more than 9%. The recently issued government per diem rates, which increased an average of 5% across our major markets plus expectations for successful Special Corporate negotiations, all point towards higher transient rates. 
Given the significant recovery in occupancy rates over the last 2 years, we should be starting the year in a position of strength, which suggests that we should benefit from both mix shift and absolute rate increases across most segments. In short, there is a clear opportunity for very solid RevPAR growth for next year. 
On the investment front, we had a relatively quiet last couple of months. As we noted in the press release, on behalf of our joint venture, we recently completed the previously announced acquisition of the Pullman Bercy for EUR 96 million. This is the venture's first hotel in Paris, and the property is located in the growing business district of Bercy. 
Despite the financial issues in the EU, RevPAR in the overall Paris market has increased 17% year-to-date, and we would expect the market and the hotel to perform well over the next several years. We also noted in the release that we had negotiated an extension of the closing date at no additional costs for our previously announced acquisition of the Grand Hyatt Washington, D.C. 
Given the recent volatility in global equity markets and general uncertainty in the eurozone and the U.S., we determined that extending the closing date would allow us to remain flexible and to further monitor economic trends, global developments and capital markets, while establishing a clear understanding of their impact on 2012 operations. 
Should we choose not to close at the end of the extension period, we will forfeit our initial deposit and record a onetime charge of $15 million. We still believe that this hotel is a terrific asset centrally located in one of the world's top markets with good long-term potential. 
While we are continuing to review potential acquisitions, at this point it appears unlikely that any other transactions would close before year end, so the guidance we provided does not assume any incremental investment. 
On the disposition front, we are marketing a few selective properties for sale, but would expect that these transactions would most likely not close until the first quarter of next year. 
We remain confident that investing in our existing portfolio provides very attractive returns. Continuing our pattern throughout 2011, capital spending in the quarter continued to increase, as in total we invested $95 million this quarter compared to $49 million in 2010. 
Redevelopment and return on investment project spending totaled $32 million this quarter and include the redevelopment projects at the Chicago Marriott O'Hare, the Sheraton Indianapolis and the Atlanta Perimeter Center. For the full year, we expect to spend $220 million to $240 million on these types of projects. 
In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $63 million in the third quarter, which included the renovation of the 45,000-square foot Broadway Ballroom at the New York Marriott Marquis. 
During the quarter, we began work on extensive room renovations of the JW Marriott Buckhead, and the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa. For the year, we expect to spend approximately $300 million to $320 million on maintenance capital expenditures. 
Overall, given the overhang of uncertainty regarding the U.S. economy and international sovereign debt issues, we were very pleased with our results this quarter. 
While we can, at some level, appreciate the sentiment that has caused equity valuations in the sector to decline, we suspect that only the risks and the risk-benefit equation are being noticed. 
As we highlighted, the fundamentals of our business remain attractive. Transient demand is strong and group demand continues to improve. As RevPAR is increasingly driven by improvements in average rate, margin growth and flow-through will accelerate. Additions to supply have been restrained and will likely remain well below historical levels for at least the next 3 years. 
Finally, we note that our current equity valuations suggest a value of roughly 200k per hotel room, which is about half of what it would cost to replace our portfolio. 
Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Our top-performing markets for the third quarter was Phoenix with a RevPAR increase of 24.4%. Strong group demand resulted in an occupancy increase of over 7 percentage points. 
Some of the group demand improvement was due to meeting space renovations at the Westin Kierland and the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix in the third quarter of 2010. The ADR growth of 8% was driven by increases in both group and transient rates. We expect our Phoenix hotels to have an outstanding fourth quarter due to an excellent group and transient demand and further ADR growth. 
Our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels had another great quarter with RevPAR up 20.6%. Occupancy increased over 12 percentage points, as group demand was very strong and ADR improved nearly 2%. 
The renovation of the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott in the third quarter of 2010 contributed to the strong RevPAR growth. We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to have a great fourth quarter because of strong group and transient demand, as well as some improvement in average rates. 
Despite these results in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, our Florida region was affected by significant renovations at the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and the Hilton Singer Island. 
Our San Francisco hotels continue their exceptional performance. RevPAR increased 17% as ADR improved over 11% and occupancy increased 4 percentage points. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and the shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments. 
Both group and transient demand were strong. We expect the San Francisco market to continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. Our Houston hotels had another strong quarter with RevPAR up 12.6% as occupancy increased over 6 percentage points while ADR increased 2%. The occupancy increase was driven by strong corporate transient demand. We expect the Houston market to continue to perform very well in the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR for Hawaii hotels increased 6.8%. Occupancy improved 5 percentage points to nearly 85%, driven by wholesale and leisure promotions, as well as increased airline capacity. For the fourth quarter, we expect Hawaii to significantly outperform the portfolio due to improvements in transient demand, a shift in mix to higher-rated business and the benefit from the renovation of the hotels in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
RevPAR for our Chicago hotels increased by 6.7%, driven by an increase in occupancy of over 3 percentage points and an improvement in average rate of over 2% as higher transient demand offset lower levels of group business. We expect our Chicago hotels to have a good fourth quarter due to strong group bookings. 
RevPAR for our New York hotels increased 6.7% due to an ADR improvement of nearly 8%, while occupancy fell 1 percentage point. RevPAR growth would have exceeded 8% without the negative effect of evacuations and cancellations related to Hurricane Irene. We expect our New York hotels to have an excellent fourth quarter. 
RevPAR for our Washington D.C. hotels increased 2.1% with ADR increasing nearly 2% and a slight occupancy increase. Operations were affected by concerns surrounding the budget and debt ceiling, which led to less government and government-related group and transient business. We expect the D.C. market to perform better in the fourth quarter, as government per diem rates have increased in the market. 
RevPAR for our Boston hotels decreased 1.4% with a slight decrease in both occupancy and ADR. Results were affected by the lack of group demand and rate, particularly at the Sheraton Boston. While we expect strong transient demand in the fourth quarter, group demand is expected to continue to be weak. 
Lastly, our worst-performing market for the third quarter was New Orleans. RevPAR fell 10.5% primarily due to the substantial amount of BP contract room nights generated by the Gulf oil spill in the third quarter of last year and a decline in government-related group business. RevPAR fell as occupancy declined over 12 percentage points. However, ADR did increase over 6%. We expect the New Orleans market to have a rough fourth quarter due to the reopening of the 1,200-room Hyatt, year-over-year reduction in demand generated by the Gulf oil spill and the renovation of the meeting space at our hotel in the fourth quarter. 
Year-to-date, San Francisco has been our best-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 19% followed by Hawaii with a RevPAR increase of 13%, phoenix with a 12.2% increase and Houston with 11.9% increase. 
Our worst-performing markets have been Philadelphia with a RevPAR decrease of 4.5% and Boston with a 0.3% increase. 
For our European joint venture, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 5.2% for the quarter, as ADR increased 6.2% and occupancy fell roughly 1%. Group demand was weak due to 3 of the JV hotels having their meeting space under renovation in the quarter. In particular, the Sheraton Roma had a significant negative impact on RevPAR due to its meeting space renovations. 
Excluding the Sheraton Roma, RevPAR would have increased over 8% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, RevPAR calculated in constant euros improved 8%, as average rates improved 5.5% and occupancy increased 1.7 percentage points. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 110 basis points. Margins for the quarter benefited from better productivity as wages and benefits on a pro-occupied room basis was essentially flat plate. Rooms flow-through was good at roughly 75%. Food and beverage revenues increased 4.1% for the quarter. F&B flow-through was approximately 26%, which was better than the first half of the year, but profits were still lower than expected. There were 2 primary reasons: The first is that we had a number of restaurants and some meeting space under renovation in the quarter, where the negative impact on F&B profits was higher than anticipated. In addition, a few hotels had lower group spend, only a portion of which was anticipated. 
Unallocated costs increased approximately 3%. This increase was primarily driven by expenses that are variable revenues, including credit card commissions, reward programs, and cluster and shared service allocations. 
Utility costs increased 3.7%. Insurance costs increased significantly due to an increase in replacement costs and premium increases as part of our June 1 renewal of our property insurance program. 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect margins to generally perform in line with what we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year. We should get some benefit from a RevPAR increase driven more by rate growth than occupancy and the potential for improvement in F&B flow-through. 
We do, however, expect unallocated costs to increase more than inflation particularly for rewards and sales and marketing costs, where higher revenues will increase cost. And we expect property taxes to rise well in excess inflation due to refunds received in the fourth quarter of 2010 that will not recur in the fourth quarter of this year. 
As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the full year to increase 80 basis points at the low end of the range and increase 90 basis points at the high end of the RevPAR range. 
One last item, the full year guidance that we gave on the second quarter earnings call assumed that we close on the acquisition of the Grand Hyatt in Washington D.C. in mid-September. That guidance included $9 million of projected EBITDA in 2011 from the hotel during our anticipated period of ownership. 
With the extension of the closing until mid-December, our current guidance assumes that there would be minimal EBITDA from the acquisition in 2011. If we do not acquire the hotel, we would forefeet our $50 million deposit and reduce our 2011 adjusted EBITDA by $15 million. 
From NAREIT FFO per share purposes, it's a little more complicated. Our second quarter earnings call guidance had very little FFO for the Hyatt because of interest expense related to the assumed debt and the assumed payment of a $7 million transfer tax for the acquisition which, together, roughly offset the property level EBITDA of $9 million. 
The transfer tax is considered an acquisition cost under GAAP and deducted from NAREIT FFO. Accordingly, our current guidance includes a loss of approximately $0.01 per share for FFO primarily due to the payment of these transport taxes. 
If we do not close the acquisition, NAREIT FFO would be an additional $8 million or roughly $0.01 per share lower than our current guidance. This amount represents the loss of the deposit partially offset by the transfer taxes and interest expense that we would not have to pay. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

Going back to the deal market, I guess what I would say is that it's -- we're trying to assess that right now. I would -- sellers have clearly not dropped their prices yet. The cost of capital for most buyers has gone up a bit, which probably suggests that buyers are looking to pay a little bit less. There has not been a whole lot of activity over the course of the last 90 days since the equity markets started to move. We are seeing good activity on the properties that we are marketing. I would say that generally, we're seeing less activity from the other REITs, and I think everybody would understand that with REIT share prices lower, that REITs are going to be a little bit more careful in how to expand whatever cash or liquidity that they have, recognizing that they probably are not comfortable on returning to the equity market right now given where equity market prices are. So I think that I would suspect, overall, that the pace of activity in the second half of the year will fall short of what folks expected it to be back in June primarily because of the reduction in share prices. But having said that, and kind of looking at the response that we're getting for some of the properties that we have on the market, there's still an active market out there. But I would also agree with your point that pricing could get a little bit more attractive as sellers begin to accept the new reality, and that's one of the reasons why we continue to be interested in completing the acquisitions."

We've seen a consistent trend throughout the year that -- the fourth quarter was the only quarter that, back in January, was significantly negative in terms of both room nights and revenues. The other quarters were generally positive especially from a revenue perspective. As we've worked our way through the year, we've seen continued improvement in the fourth quarter. Probably more importantly, as we look at what has actually happened over the course of the last 60 to 90 days, our bookings for the fourth quarter were stronger than they had been in 2010. So we booked more room nights in the last 60 days for the fourth quarter than we did last year. And those bookings were also ahead of the pace that we had seen in 2007. So net-net, we -- while there was a bit of a hole that needed to be filled in the fourth quarter, we have been pleased with the progress throughout the year.

One was what we -- what I talked about in my comments which is the fact that we did lose some group activity and some fairly strong bookings in the East Coast that because of Hurricane Irene. We had a big group in Philadelphia that canceled. We had to shut down the Financial Center Marriott for the entire weekend. So you never want to see that happen in New York. And in Washington, D.C., we were expecting a fair amount of business, both group and transient, related to the celebration of the, I guess, the presentation, the opening of the Martin Luther King Memorial, all of which were rained out by Hurricane Irene. So the net effect of that was that we lost about 60 basis points in the quarter. And if we had that, we obviously would have been at the 7% level, maybe slightly above that for the quarter. So I think that's the first thing that changed. I think that the other part of it, as we looked at the fourth quarter, is that overall we continue to feel that the quarter is going to be good. Our property level forecasts are, frankly, stronger than the guidance that we're giving. I think the properties are a bit more optimistic that we are, but I think we felt like it would make sense to dial back a little bit on that. And I think that's why I made the point about the fact that we -- we're not going to outperform in the fourth quarter, but we still expect to perform in line in Q4."

But I think that ultimately what the answer is right now is that while we are -- as we look at the world today and if we assume that we don't have a problem, a real -- that the problem in Europe doesn't get worse and we assume that we could -- that the blue chip for the industry consensus, the economic consensus on next year plays out, we feel very good about 2012. But I think, if you -- as we also listen to what economic forecasters are predicting and you look at the fact that there are risks that suggest that there could be some problems out there. And I think, frankly, those risks are what are reflected in our stock price right now, that's why it's so low. At the end of the day, I think the more prudent step for us to take is to be a little bit more cautious and a little bit more conservative with what we do with our capital. At least, until we have started to generate and completed some of asset sales that I think ultimately are the best way to fund the stock buyback. And in fact, what you're suggesting is have confidence that you get sales done and then use those proceeds now to buy at a lower price. There's a lot of logic to that. But ultimately, at the end of the day, what has served us well over the last decade when we approached some of these times of uncertainty is to be, maybe a little bit more cautious in how we used some of that incremental capital, be a little less quick to pull the trigger on some sort of -- on financial transactions similar to buying stock and just make certain that you kind of are comfortable that the world is headed in the right direction because liquidity can make a difference at different times in the cycle. And so I think ultimately, I would wholeheartedly agree with you about the value that's there. But I'm comfortable that, that value is going to be there ultimately in '12 and in '13 and in '14 and it's only going to be going higher. What I need to make certain of is that we don't take any steps now that may force us to do something stupid later, which might be selling an asset at a bad price or borrowing at a very expensive rate. So that's -- it's an issue that we're talking about regularly here. It's an issue that I'm talking about with the board. But I think right now, the prudent call is to wait till you get the asset sales done and then reevaluate the opportunity. And if we missed it -- and the good news is the stock price is a lot higher."

If you go back to another period in time, which even there was probably a little bit irregular because of the events of 9/11, what we saw on that downturn is that group activity actually declined more slowly than transient but overall, the room night decline was really pretty equal in our portfolio, both group and transient were down about 9% in the '01 to '03 timeframe. So when I look at that and when I look at the issue of -- and look at what happened in the last downturn, we tend to still think that in the long run, it's good to have a portfolio that is a little bit over represented in the group sector because we ultimately think that through a normal cycle, without the political rhetoric, the group will tend to hold up a bit better than transient well. Now as we look at next year, I think your question is a very good one. Clearly, this year, we've been experiencing better revenue growth on the transient side. Our transient activity and our transient demand is already ahead of where we were in '07. So in effect, you could argue using that as a peak, transient activity is back to where it was before. I would point out that at least in our portfolio, transient activity is not quite back to where it was in 2000. So there's -- I do think there's still room for growth on transient side. But I do think the opportunity for next year is on the group side. I mean, the reality is, as we've been seeing solid demand growth in the corporate segment, that's the most volatile segment of our group -- of our overall group business. And so I think seeing continued growth there is important to trying to drive an ultimately recovery in group. On the group side, we're still 9% to 10% below where we were in '07. We're not that far below in rate, but we're way behind in terms of room nights. So when I think about '12, I think that's the area where we have an opportunity for outperformance is group activity continues to improve."

I think it's still fairly early to understand how that's going to play out. I think that the fact that we already have much stronger occupancy in the industry is a big plus relative to the whole negotiated rate discussions because as our properties either on an individual basis or through each operator are more and more comfortable about the level of occupancy that they have. The fact that they were comfortable about the level of group activity that they have on the books. All of that I think creates a better foundation for our side of this discussion to happen on because while we want Special Corporate business, we probably don't need it desperately as we did back when we were having these discussions in 2009. So I think that creates the right sort of atmosphere for these discussions to happen. Now where exactly they're going to play out. I think Arnie gave some color in his comments. I'm sure that Starwood and Hyatt will in the next few weeks. And they're one step closer to that process. So I mean, really what at this point we're watching, we're monitoring. We're cheering them on as they push for higher rates and we hope that they're able to achieve the higher rates. I think we've got the right sort of environment right now to be able to do get that.

And I think if it happens, that's the way it's going to show up. Then I think that there would be reductions that we could achieve at the properties that would be related to that demand. So at some level, if you start to see a meaningful falloff in occupancy, then you're going to see that you're going to go back and cut the hours that F&B outlets are open. You're going to end up with few housekeepers and you're going to end up with fewer managers than where we have right now. So I do think there's an opportunity to make additional cut. I don't know that I would necessarily -- I would suggest, though, that we could make the same level of cuts that we made in 2008 and 2009 because we have certainly been working hard with each of our operators to make certain that where we thought that -- where we thought they had cut fat last time, we haven't wanted that to return.
