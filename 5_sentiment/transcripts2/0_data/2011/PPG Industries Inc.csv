This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's fourth quarter 2010 financial teleconference.
Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Dellinger, Senior Vice President finance and Chief Financial Officer; and David Navikas, Vice President and Controller. 
Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, January 20, 2011. As a reminder to everyone, and as we communicated last quarter, we have modified our quarterly earnings call process. Approximately one hour ago, we posted detailed commentary in the company presentation slides on our investor center at www.ppg.com. Slides are also in view available on the website for this call. We will not read those compared remarks during this call.
During the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the company's results for the fourth quarter and full year and then we will move directly to Q&A. The modified process will allow substantially more time for Q&A.
Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials which are also available under our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.
Lastly before we begin, I will remind you that we held a detailed capital markets analyst day in mid-december 2010. The presentation slides for that event contain further details about our industry, businesses and used markets. And those slides are again available on our website. 
Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch."
294639,118142414,93131,"PPG Industries Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2011",2011-01-20,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record sales and earnings per share this quarter, capping off an excellent 2010 full year performance. We achieved record fourth quarter sales on strong price and volume gains and despite continued curren",1029,"Thank you, Vince and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record sales and earnings per share this quarter, capping off an excellent 2010 full year performance. We achieved record fourth quarter sales on strong price and volume gains and despite continued currency headwinds. Our sales in local currencies grew by 10% year-over-year. Our broadening businesses and emerge in emerging regions once again delivered double-digit sales growth including in Asia where our sales this quarter grew by more than 15%.
Also, for the full year, I'm very pleased to report that our Asia Pacific region surpassed $2 billion in sales, up nearly 25% with strong earnings growth approaching 50%. We leveraged the higher sales, delivering record fourth quarter earnings per share. The global economic recovery began to take gain traction during the fourth quarter of 2009, making this quarter's year-over-year comparison more relevant. So our 50% year-over-year earnings per share increased is meaningful.
In addition to the volume gains, another factor in the fourth quarter was higher selling prices. In the quarter, every one of our segments delivered higher pricing versus last year. In looking at the year in total, the company's pricing has increased in each quarter during the year. 
In our Coatings business is, these higher prices offset or minimize margin oppression compression from inflating raw materials cost. Coatings raw material inflation began to escalate in the middle of 2010 and remained at persistently high levels through the fourth quarter.
In our Commodity Chemicals and Glass segments, pricing gains were a contributor to the segment earnings recovery trends and were driven by higher demand as the end-used markets continue to recover.
Also, despite the ongoing recovery, we have continued aggressive management of our operations and overall cost structure. In 2010, our operating segments reduced cost by $100 million from our prior restructuring actions, plus an additional $50 million plus from other manufacturing and cost management initiatives. This $150 million of savings is an in addition to the $350 million we delivered in 2009, resulting in over $500 million of lower cost in comparison with 2008.
Looking at our performance on a segment basis, we posted record fourth quarter segment earnings, easily eclipsing our prior record by more than 15%. Our combined Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments also delivered both record sales and earnings in the quarter.
Our broad geographic Coatings footprint enabled us to take advantage of continuing improvements in overall global industrial activity and continued expansion in aftermarket activity levels.
In Optical and Specialty Materials, we once again drove excellent topline growth and maintained our trend this year of expanding year-over-year margins. In what is typically a seasonally slow period, weak construction and maintenance markets continue to weigh on our Architectural Coatings business in Europe, although our Architectural Coatings volumes in our U.S. and Canada business were essentially flat with the prior year.
Our performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments, both top margin performers for PPG, also delivered fourth quarter earnings records and have continued future growth prospects.
Architectural Coatings EMEA earnings declined due to weakness in market demand. Also, our Industrial Coatings segment results were lower as price, volumes and costs improved, but not sufficiently enough to fully offset inflation.
As a benchmark, in past inflationary cycles in Coatings, it has taken two to three quarters for our pricing initiatives to fully calendar inflationary impacts. We have additional pricing increases being implemented in 2011, and I am confident we are on pace to fully counteract inflation in our Coatings businesses in the first half of 2011. Also, as in the past, our Commodity Chemicals segment is once again serving as a hedge to inflationary pressures impacting our Coatings businesses. Segment margins grew to over 19% this quarter as the earnings improvement trend continued due to higher pricing. In addition, our last segment earnings also improved substantially, driven by higher end-use market activity coupled with our continued cost management actions.
In 2011, these businesses should continue to benefit from tight market conditions and lower natural gas cost as our prior year's higher cost hedges will roll off.
Fourth quarter earnings for the Commodity Chemicals and Glass segments combined improved by over $90 million versus last year. This performance, along with the combined record Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segment earnings were key factors in our record fourth quarter earnings per share. This is the second consecutive quarter that we delivered record earnings.
Overall for 2010, I was very satisfied with our performance. We fully capitalized on the partial economic recovery, maintained our sharp focus on cost management, and leveraged our global breadth and global leadership position in our businesses.
Also, we extended our legacy of returning cash to shareholders by returning about 75% of our cash from operations, or nearly $1 billion to shareholders in the form of an increased annual dividend payout and share repurchases. Our record second-half earnings performance and near-record full year earnings demonstrate how strongly we are emerging from the recession. This performance is despite full year volumes that were still $1.2 billion below pre-recession 2008 levels, including continued anemic activity levels in construction markets in the mature regions.
We are only now beginning to see the full earnings power of the company and we are carrying this momentum forward into 2011 when we anticipate recovery in the global economy to strengthen and broaden. This should drive volume increases for PPG, which we expect to leverage at high margins as we continue to manage our costs. We anticipate that our strong emerging regions penetration and several of our leading businesses like Optical products and Aerospace will continue to serve as significant growth drivers.
Also, as I mentioned previously at the outset of the year, we are implementing a variety of selling price increases throughout our portfolio with the objective of offsetting Coatings margin compression and furthering our commodity chemicals earnings improvement trend.
Finally, we are working on initiatives to deploy the nearly $2 billion we have in cash and short-term investments with a focus on growing earnings and increasing shareholder returns. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

But obviously, that built so we were ending the fourth quarter year in 2010, those were in a the higher single-digits and we, in terms of percentage increases -- and we saw it across a broad range of products. And we didn't see quite as many, although there were still some supply disruptions, but you had it on both the organic and inorganic sides, the TI2 being one of them, other pigments, we had some of the medals play a role in our formulations in Protective & Marine Coatings. There were also up. Now starting here in 2011, we're seeing a little additional raw material pressure, I would say at this point, this would be low-single-digit increases, but on top of where we finished at the end of 2010. So we are still facing some headwinds here on the raw material inflation for Coatings. We have started raising our prices starting in midyear of last year, working through some of them, but actually the inflationary numbers have continued to move. So in every one of our businesses today, we have additional pricing actions. In some, we have some formal price increases out in others we are actively negotiating with customers to pass these price increases on. And as I have mentioned in the remarks, typically it does take two to three quarters to fully capture all of these inflationary price increases. I think the fact that we have a little bit of a moving target means that we're still in price increase mode in our businesses. But we're looking, as we go through 2011, to fully capture those price increases. And we don't, in terms of the current forecast, we don't think things are going to accelerate as aggressively as they did last year. But we are seeing the same trends that you mentioned. Oil prices are up. And we've seen recent increases in commodities like TiO2 or propylene. But on the other hand, we haven't seen as much recent increases in natural gas, in ethylene as an example. So right now, we are expecting more inflation for our Coatings raw materials, but not quite at the pace we saw in the second half last year."

But in the short term, it's going to be in the more industrial markets, plus those Performance Coatings like Aerospace which is, I think, ramping up now; refinish which experienced quite as sharp decline in 2009, it's bouncing back. This winter whether that we are all experiencing this last six weeks should help us in terms of accident rates in the near future. So those are terms that give me confidence that we have plenty of opportunities, even here in 2011 to recapture some of this lost volume over the last three years."

Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Dellinger, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Navikas, Vice President and Controller. 
Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, January 20, 2011. As a reminder to everyone, and as we communicated last quarter, we have modified our quarterly earnings call process. Approximately one hour ago, we posted detailed commentary in the company presentation slides on our Investor Center at ppg.com. Slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We will not read those prepared remarks during this call.
During the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the company's results for the fourth quarter and full year and then we will move directly to Q&A. The modified process will allow substantially more time for Q&A.
Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are also available under our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly-comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.
Lastly before we begin, I will remind you that we held a detailed Capital Markets Analyst Day in mid-December 2010. The presentation slides for that event contain further details about our industry, businesses and then news [ph] markets. And those slides again, are available on our website. 
Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman CEO, Chuck Bunch."
294639,118142414,93422,"PPG Industries Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2011",2011-01-20,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record sales and earnings per share this quarter, capping off an excellent 2010 full-year performance. We achieved record fourth quarter sales on strong price and volume gains. And despite continued curr",1020,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record sales and earnings per share this quarter, capping off an excellent 2010 full-year performance. We achieved record fourth quarter sales on strong price and volume gains. And despite continued currency headwinds, our sales in local currencies grew by 10% year-over-year. Our broadening businesses in emerging regions once again delivered double-digit sales growth including in Asia, where our sales this quarter grew by more than 15%.
Also, for the full year, I am very pleased to report that our Asia-Pacific region surpassed $2 billion in sales, up nearly 25% with strong earnings growth approaching 50%. We leveraged the higher sales, delivering record fourth quarter earnings per share. The global economic recovery began to gain traction during the fourth quarter of 2009, making this quarter's year-over-year comparison more relevant. So our 50% year-over-year earnings per share increase is meaningful.
In addition to the volume gains, another factor in the fourth quarter was higher selling prices. In the quarter, every one of our segments delivered higher pricing versus last year. In looking at the year in total, the company's pricing has increased in each quarter during the year. 
In our Coatings businesses, these higher prices offset or minimized margin compression from inflating raw material cost. Coatings' raw material inflation began to escalate in the middle of 2010 and remained at persistently high levels through the fourth quarter.
In our Commodity Chemicals and Glass segments, pricing gains were a contributor to the segment earnings recovery trends and were driven by higher demand as the end-use markets continued to recover.
Also, despite the ongoing recovery, we have continued aggressive management of our operations and overall cost structure. In 2010, our operating segments reduced cost by $100 million from our prior restructuring actions, plus an additional $50 million plus from other manufacturing and cost management initiatives. This $150 million of savings is in addition to the $350 million we delivered in 2009, resulting in over $500 million of lower cost in comparison with 2008.
Looking at our performance on a segment basis, we posted record fourth quarter segment earnings, easily eclipsing our prior record by more than 15%. Our combined Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments also delivered both record sales and earnings in the quarter. Our broad geographic Coatings footprint enabled us to take advantage of continuing improvements in overall global industrial activity and continued expansion in aftermarket activity levels. 
In Optical and Specialty Materials, we once again drove excellent topline growth and maintained our trend this year of expanding year-over-year margins. In what is typically a seasonally slow period, weak construction and maintenance markets continued to weigh on our Architectural Coatings business in Europe, although our Architectural Coatings volumes in our U.S. and Canada business were essentially flat with the prior year. Our performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments, both top margin performers for PPG, also delivered fourth quarter earnings records and have continued future growth prospects. Architectural Coatings' EMEA earnings declined due to weakness in market demand. Also, our Industrial Coatings segment results were lower as price, volumes and costs improved, but not sufficiently enough to fully offset inflation.
As a benchmark in past inflationary cycles in Coatings, it has taken two to three quarters for our pricing initiatives to fully counter inflationary impacts. We have additional pricing increases being implemented in 2011, and I am confident we are on pace to fully counteract inflation in our Coatings businesses in the first half of 2011. Also, as in the past, our Commodity Chemicals segment is once again serving as a hedge to inflationary pressures impacting our Coatings businesses. Segment margins grew to over 19% this quarter as the earnings improvement trend continued due to higher pricing. In addition, our Glass segment earnings also improved substantially, driven by higher end-use market activity coupled with our continued cost management actions. In 2011, these businesses should continue to benefit from tight market conditions and lower natural gas cost as our prior year's higher cost hedges will roll off.
Fourth quarter earnings for the Commodity Chemicals and Glass segments combined, improved by over $90 million versus last year. This performance, along with the combined record Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segment earnings were key factors in our record fourth quarter earnings per share. This is the second consecutive quarter that we delivered record earnings.
Overall for 2010, I was very satisfied with our performance. We fully capitalized on the partial economic recovery, maintained our sharp focus on cost management, and leveraged our global breadth and leadership positions in our businesses. Also, we extended our legacy of returning cash to shareholders by returning about 75% of our cash from operations, or nearly $1 billion, to shareholders in the form of an increased annual dividend payout and share repurchases. Our record second-half earnings performance and near-record full year earnings demonstrate how strongly we are emerging from the recession. This performance is despite full-year volumes that were still $1.2 billion below pre-recession 2008 levels, including continued anemic activity levels in construction markets in the mature regions.
We are only now beginning to see the full earnings power of the company and we are carrying this momentum forward into 2011, when we anticipate recovery in the global economy to strengthen and broaden. This should drive volume increases for PPG, which we expect to leverage at high margins as we continue to manage our costs. We anticipate that our strong emerging regions penetration and several of our leading businesses, like Optical products and Aerospace, will continue to serve as significant growth drivers. Also, as I mentioned previously at the outset of the year, we are implementing a variety of selling price increases throughout our portfolio with the objective of offsetting Coatings margin compression and furthering our Commodity Chemicals earnings improvement trend. Finally, we are working on initiatives to deploy the nearly $2 billion we have in cash and short-term investments with a focus on growing earnings and increasing shareholder returns.

But obviously, that built, so that as we were ending the fourth quarter here in 2010, those were in the higher single-digits and we, in terms of percentage increases -- then we saw it across a broad range of products. And we didn't see quite as many, although there were still some supply disruptions, but you had it on both the organic and inorganic sides, TiO2 being one of them. Other pigments, we had some of the metals which play a role in our formulations in Protective & Marine Coatings, they were also up. Now starting here in 2011, we're seeing a little additional raw material pressure. I would say at this point, this would be low-single-digit increases, but on top of where we finished at the end of 2010. So we are still facing some headwinds here on the raw material inflation for Coatings. We have started raising our prices starting in mid-year of last year, working through some of them, but actually the inflationary numbers have continued to move. So in every one of our businesses today, we have additional pricing actions. In some we have some formal price increase announcements out, in others we are actively negotiating with customers to pass these price increases on. And as I have mentioned in the remarks, typically it does take two to three quarters to fully capture all of these inflationary price increases. I think the fact that we have a little bit of a moving target means that we're still in price increase mode in our businesses. But we're looking, as we go through 2011, to fully capture those price increases. And we don't, in terms of the current forecast, we don't think things are going to accelerate as aggressively as they did last year, but we are seeing the same trends that you mentioned. Oil prices are up. And we've seen recent increases in commodities like TiO2 or propylene. But on the other hand, we haven't seen as much recent increases in natural gas, in ethylene as an example. So right now, we are expecting more inflation for our Coatings' raw materials, but not quite at the pace that we saw in the second half of the last year."

Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, January 20, 2011. As a reminder to everyone, and as we communicated last quarter, we have modified our quarterly earnings call process. Approximately one hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We will not read those prepared remarks during this call.
During the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the company's results for the fourth quarter and full year, and then we will move directly to Q&A. The modified process will allow substantially more time for Q&A.
Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are also available under our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly-comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.
Lastly before we begin, I will remind you that we held a detailed Capital Markets Analyst Day in mid-December 2010. The presentation slides for that event contain further details about our industry, businesses and then news [ph] markets. And those slides again, are available on our website. 
Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch."
294639,118142414,94030,"PPG Industries Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2011",2011-01-20,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record sales and earnings per share this quarter, capping off an excellent 2010 full year performance. We achieved record fourth quarter sales on strong price and volume gains. And despite continued curr",1021,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record sales and earnings per share this quarter, capping off an excellent 2010 full year performance. We achieved record fourth quarter sales on strong price and volume gains. And despite continued currency headwinds, our sales in local currencies grew by 10% year-over-year. Our broadening businesses in emerging regions once again delivered double-digit sales growth including in Asia, where our sales this quarter grew by more than 15%.
Also, for the full year, I am very pleased to report that our Asia-Pacific region surpassed $2 billion in sales, up nearly 25% with strong earnings growth approaching 50%. We leveraged the higher sales, delivering record fourth quarter earnings per share. The global economic recovery began to gain traction during the fourth quarter of 2009, making this quarter's year-over-year comparison more relevant. So our 50% year-over-year earnings per share increase is meaningful.
In addition to the volume gains, another factor in the fourth quarter was higher selling prices. In the quarter, every one of our segments delivered higher pricing versus last year. In looking at the year in total, the company's pricing has increased in each quarter during the year. 
In our Coatings businesses, these higher prices offset or minimized margin compression from inflating raw material cost. Coatings' raw material inflation began to escalate in the middle of 2010 and remained at persistently high levels through the fourth quarter.
In our Commodity Chemicals and Glass segments, pricing gains were a contributor to the segment earnings recovery trends and were driven by higher demand as the end-use markets continue to recover.
Also, despite the ongoing recovery, we have continued aggressive management of our operations and overall cost structure. In 2010, our operating segments reduced cost by $100 million from our prior restructuring actions, plus an additional $50 million-plus from other manufacturing and cost management initiatives. This $150 million of savings is in addition to the $350 million we delivered in 2009, resulting in over $500 million of lower cost in comparison with 2008.
Looking at our performance on a segment basis, we posted record fourth quarter segment earnings, easily eclipsing our prior record by more than 15%. Our combined Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments also delivered both record sales and earnings in the quarter. Our broad geographic Coatings footprint enabled us to take advantage of continuing improvements in overall global industrial activity and continued expansion in aftermarket activity levels. 
In Optical and Specialty Materials, we once again drove excellent top line growth and maintained our trend this year of expanding year-over-year margins. In what is typically a seasonally slow period, weak construction and maintenance markets continued to weigh on our Architectural Coatings business in Europe, although our Architectural Coatings volumes in our U.S. and Canada business were essentially flat with the prior year. Our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments, both top margin performers for PPG, also delivered fourth quarter earnings records and have continued future growth prospects. Architectural Coatings' EMEA earnings declined due to weakness in market demand. Also, our Industrial Coatings segment results were lower as price, volumes and costs improved, but not sufficiently enough to fully offset inflation.
As a benchmark in past inflationary cycles in Coatings, it has taken two to three quarters for our pricing initiatives to fully counter inflationary impacts. We have additional pricing increases being implemented in 2011, and I am confident we are on pace to fully counteract inflation in our Coatings businesses in the first half of 2011. Also, as in the past, our Commodity Chemicals segment is once again serving as a hedge to inflationary pressures impacting our Coatings businesses. Segment margins grew to over 19% this quarter as the earnings improvement trend continued due to higher pricing. In addition, our Glass segment earnings also improved substantially, driven by higher end-use market activity coupled with our continued cost management actions. In 2011, these businesses should continue to benefit from tight market conditions and lower natural gas cost as our prior year's higher cost hedges will roll off.
Fourth quarter earnings for the Commodity Chemicals and Glass segments combined, improved by over $90 million versus last year. This performance, along with the combined record Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segment earnings were key factors in our record fourth quarter earnings per share. This is the second consecutive quarter that we delivered record earnings.
Overall for 2010, I was very satisfied with our performance. We fully capitalized on the partial economic recovery, maintained our sharp focus on cost management and leveraged our global breadth and leadership positions in our businesses. Also, we extended our legacy of returning cash to shareholders by returning about 75% of our cash from operations, or nearly $1 billion, to shareholders in the form of an increased annual dividend payout and share repurchases. Our record second-half earnings performance and near-record full year earnings demonstrate how strongly we are emerging from the recession. This performance is despite full-year volumes that were still $1.2 billion below pre-recession 2008 levels, including continued anemic activity levels in construction markets in the mature regions.
We are only now beginning to see the full earnings power of the company and we are carrying this momentum forward into 2011, when we anticipate recovery in the global economy to strengthen and broaden. This should drive volume increases for PPG, which we expect to leverage at high margins as we continue to manage our costs. We anticipate that our strong emerging regions penetration and several of our leading businesses, like Optical products and Aerospace, will continue to serve as significant growth drivers. Also, as I mentioned previously, at the outset of the year we are implementing a variety of selling price increases throughout our portfolio with the objective of offsetting Coatings margin compression and furthering our Commodity Chemicals earnings improvement trend. Finally, we are working on initiatives to deploy the nearly $2 billion we have in cash and short-term investments with a focus on growing earnings and increasing shareholder returns. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

And we didn't see quite as many, although there were still some supply disruptions, but you had it on both the organic and inorganic sides, TiO2 being one of them. Other pigments, we had some of the metals which play a role in our formulations in Protective & Marine Coatings, they were also up. Now starting here in 2011, we're seeing a little additional raw material pressure. I would say at this point, this would be low-single digit increases, but on top of where we finished at the end of 2010. So we are still facing some headwinds here on the raw material inflation for Coatings. We have started raising our prices starting in mid-year of last year, working through some of them, but actually the inflationary numbers have continued to move. So in every one of our businesses today, we have additional pricing actions. In some we have formal price increase announcements out, in others we are actively negotiating with customers to pass these price increases on. And as I have mentioned in the remarks, typically it does take two to three quarters to fully capture all of these inflationary price increases. I think the fact that we have a little bit of a moving target means that we're still in price increase mode in our businesses. But we're looking, as we go through 2011, to fully capture those price increases. And we don't, in terms of the current forecast, we don't think things are going to accelerate as aggressively as they did last year, but we are seeing the same trends that you mentioned. Oil prices are up. And we've seen recent increases in commodities like TiO2 or propylene. But on the other hand, we haven't seen as much recent increases in natural gas, in ethylene as an example. So right now, we are expecting more inflation for our Coatings' raw materials, but not quite at the pace that we saw in the second half of last year."

Similarly, in Europe, we didn't go quite as low there, but there is Automotive growth potential there, although we're not as optimistic in Europe in Automotive as we are here in North America. The other big sets of businesses would be those related to the construction markets. Obviously, we have exposure both here and in North America in both residential and commercial construction. And also in the, let's call it the residential repaint, or the aftermarkets for maintenance and repair, we're still below the volumes that we experienced just three years ago. So that would be another opportunity where we see the volumes improving. But in the short term, it's going to be in the more industrial markets, plus those Performance Coatings like Aerospace which is, I think, ramping up now; refinish, which experienced quite a sharp decline in 2009, is bouncing back. This winter weather that we're all experiencing these last six weeks should help us in terms of accident rates in the near term.

The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We will not read those prepared remarks during the call.
During the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the company's results in the quarter and then we will move directly to Q&A. This modified process allows substantially more time for Q&A. We're providing a similar amount of data compared to our prior approach.
Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are all available on our website. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.
Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch."

PPG posted record earnings per share this quarter, marking the third consecutive quarterly record for the company. We have built on the strong performance and momentum from the second half of 2010. Our year-over-yea",600,"Thank you Vince. And welcome, everyone. PPG posted record earnings per share this quarter, marking the third consecutive quarterly record for the company. We have built on the strong performance and momentum from the second half of 2010. Our year-over-year sales improved 13% to $3.5 billion with each major region posting double-digit percentage sales increases and higher sales in every PPG reporting segment. 
Higher volumes accounted for about 1/2 of our sales growth, led once again by stronger global industrial activity, which aided many of our businesses. The global industrial recovery continues with solid growth in emerging regions and North America and with strengthening conditions in Europe.
The higher European activity level outpaced our expectations of a few months ago. Excellent volume growth was also a key factor in the record earnings performance by our optical and Specialty Materials segment. In construction and used markets, activity levels for main low in the developed regions as these markets have not demonstrated any convincing signs of imminent improvement. 
Despite the market weakness, our volumes in businesses serving these markets were modestly positive in comparison with an already low prior-year base. Improved selling prices accounted for the majority of the company's remaining sales gains in the quarter.
Every reporting segment posted higher year-over-year pricing with the most significant percentage gains in Commodity Chemicals and Glass, resulting in substantial earnings recovery in these segments versus the recession-impacted first quarter of last year.
In our coatings businesses, higher selling prices partially offset persistent raw material cost inflation. Despite inflationary cost pressures, operating margins in each Coatings segment were essentially flat with the prior year, and our total Coatings operating earnings improved by nearly 12%. Volume and pricing gains were supplemented by continued aggressive cost management actions. 
We also expanded our product reformulation activities in an effort to utilize lower cost raw materials to limit inflationary impacts on our customers. Lastly, another growth lever for us is the continued deployment of our cash for earnings accretion. While our recent acquisition activity has been minimal, we repurchased about $275 million of PPG stock during the quarter, bringing our total repurchases over the past 9 months to about $700 million at an average share price of $81.
As a result, our share count has dropped nearly 3% versus last year's first quarter. In summary, our performance in the quarter was excellent. Despite persistent inflationary pressures, our overall segment margins improved by more than 300 basis points in comparison with last year and 150 basis points sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
We posted double-digit sales growth on strong volumes and higher pricing and achieved record first quarter earnings per share. We also returned about $375 million of cash to shareholders, including $90 million of dividend. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic as we anticipate similar economic trends in the second quarter, which is seasonally our strongest sales quarter. We remain focused on offsetting inflationary pressures with expected additional price gains in the second quarter in all our businesses. 
Also, our aggressive cost management and execution focus remains. Finally, we continue to work on accretive initiatives to deploy our cash. We are applying our disciplined approach toward evaluating acquisitions and anticipate several small- to medium-sized bolt-on acquisitions over the next 6 to 9 months. 
Lastly, as a reflection of our outlook and our continued strong cash prospects, we raised our quarterly dividend another $0.02 today to $0.57 per share, which is our second increase in the past 9 months. That concludes our prepared remarks. And now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions."

So I think inflation is a concern for any business, but in terms of where we see economic growth or the macroeconomic conditions, we think it's still solid. Now we're going to have probably more inflation, I think as you the companies that are in the middle of the supply chain like we are in many of our products as we push through the inflation that we're receiving on a lot of these raw materials or metals and we push them through to our customers, it will lead to more inflation at the consumer level where you really haven't seen it as much here in this country. But we have a weak dollar and you have strong growth outside. So I think the risk here is that inflation heightens, especially in the U.S. and that crimps the buying power of the consumers and threatens some of the nice recovery we've had in end-use markets like automotive."

Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 21, 2011. As a reminder, to everyone, we have modified our quarterly earnings call process. Approximately one hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We will not read those prepared remarks during the call.
During the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the company's results in the quarter, and then we'll move directly to Q&A. This modified process allows substantially more time for Q&A. We're providing a similar amount of data compared to our prior approach.
Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.
Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch."
294639,129588987,116722,"PPG Industries Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record earnings per share this quarter, marking the third consecutive quarterly record for the company. We have built on the strong performance and momentum from the second half of 2010. Our year-over-ye",597,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record earnings per share this quarter, marking the third consecutive quarterly record for the company. We have built on the strong performance and momentum from the second half of 2010. Our year-over-year sales improved 13% to $3.5 billion, with each major region posting double-digit percentage sales increases and higher sales in every PPG reporting segment. 
Higher volumes accounted for about 1/2 of our sales growth, led once again by stronger global industrial activity, which aided many of our businesses. The global industrial recovery continues with solid growth in emerging regions and North America, and with strengthening conditions in Europe.
The higher European activity levels outpaced our expectations of a few months ago. Excellent volume growth was also a key factor in the record earnings performance by our Optical and Specialty Materials segment. In construction end-used markets, activity levels remained low in the developed regions, as these markets have not demonstrated any convincing signs of imminent improvement. 
Despite the market weakness, our volumes in businesses serving these markets were modestly positive in comparison with an already low prior-year base. Improved selling prices accounted for the majority of the company's remaining sales gains in the quarter.
Every reporting segment posted higher year-over-year pricing, with the most significant percentage gains in Commodity Chemicals and Glass, resulting in substantial earnings recovery in these segments versus the recession-impacted first quarter of last year.
In our coatings businesses, higher selling prices partially offset persistent raw material cost inflation. Despite inflationary cost pressures, operating margins in each Coatings segment were essentially flat with the prior year, and our total Coatings operating earnings improved by nearly 12%. Volume and pricing gains were supplemented by continued aggressive cost management actions. We also expanded our product reformulation activities in an effort to utilize lower cost raw materials to limit inflationary impacts on our customers. 
Lastly, another growth lever for us is the continued deployment of our cash for earnings accretion. While our recent acquisition activity has been minimal, we repurchased about $275 million of PPG stock during the quarter, bringing our total repurchases over the past 9 months to about $700 million at an average share price of $81. As a result, our share count has dropped nearly 3% versus last year's first quarter. In summary, our performance in the quarter was excellent. Despite persistent inflationary pressures, our overall segment margins improved by more than 300 basis points in comparison with last year, and 150 basis points sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
We posted double-digit sales growth on strong volumes and higher pricing and achieved record first quarter earnings per share. We also returned about $375 million of cash to shareholders, including $90 million of dividend. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic as we anticipate similar economic trends in the second quarter, which is seasonally our strongest sales quarter. We remain focused on offsetting inflationary pressures with expected additional price gains in the second quarter in all our businesses. 
Also, our aggressive cost management and execution focus remains. Finally, we continue to work on accretive initiatives to deploy our cash. We are applying our disciplined approach toward evaluating acquisitions and anticipate several small- to medium-sized bolt-on acquisitions over the next 6 to 9 months. 
Lastly, as a reflection of our outlook and our continued strong cash prospects, we raised our quarterly dividend another $0.02 today to $0.57 per share, which is our second increase in the past 9 months. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions."

We do not participate directly in any automotive sales in Japan, but we do supply those customers outside of Japan, especially here in North America and in Europe. But our overall forecast, if we say we're going to -- it'll impact the total company to the order of maybe 1% of sales in the second quarter, we would anticipate making up those sales from an industry standpoint by the end of the year.

Of the supply demand for caustic soda and for chlor-alkali more broadly has tightened up with the -- in light of the events in Japan they were a large exporter of air production to other areas of Asia Pacific. So we have now -- we haven't seen and we didn't see an impact on the first quarter. Second quarter demand will remain high. Pricing has solidified. We have, on the chlorine side, we have a $60 increase that is currently being implemented here at the beginning of the second quarter. We have, on the caustic side, a $40-a-ton increase that has already been implemented at the end of the first quarter. And an additional $60-a-ton increase that is being, has been announced and is in the process of being implemented here in the second quarter. So the pricing environment has strengthened in chlor-alkali, and we see that continuing now for certainly through the next couple of quarters. On the force majeure declaration at our Natrium plant a couple of days ago, that was at the end of a scheduled outage. And as we started up the plant, we ran into a couple of equipment issues. We are making good progress now in bringing that equipment back, and now we're talking, let's say on the order of days for this force majeure and the outage rather than any additional outage, let's say a rather than weeks or something more serious. So there was no catastrophic event, but we just did have some equipment issues as we started back up from that outage, but we're confident that this thing is -- it's positive here and we should have some good news in the coming days."

Approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We will not read those prepared remarks during the call.
During the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the company's results in the quarter, and then we'll move directly to Q&A. This modified process allows substantially more time for Q&A, while providing a similar amount of data compared to our prior approach.
Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.
Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch."
294639,129588987,116745,"PPG Industries Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record earnings per share this quarter, marking the third consecutive quarterly record for the company. We have built on the strong performance and momentum from the second half of 2010. Our year-over-ye",597,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record earnings per share this quarter, marking the third consecutive quarterly record for the company. We have built on the strong performance and momentum from the second half of 2010. Our year-over-year sales improved 13% to $3.5 billion, with each major region posting double-digit percentage sales increases and higher sales in every PPG reporting segment. 
Higher volumes accounted for about 1/2 of our sales growth, led once again by stronger global industrial activity, which aided many of our businesses. The global industrial recovery continues with solid growth in emerging regions and North America, and with strengthening conditions in Europe.
The higher European activity levels outpaced our expectations of a few months ago. Excellent volume growth was also a key factor in the record earnings performance by our Optical and Specialty Materials segment. In construction end-used markets, activity levels remained low in the developed regions, as these markets have not demonstrated any convincing signs of imminent improvement. 
Despite the market weakness, our volumes in businesses serving these markets were modestly positive in comparison with an already low prior-year base. Improved selling prices accounted for the majority of the company's remaining sales gains in the quarter.
Every reporting segment posted higher year-over-year pricing, with the most significant percentage gains in Commodity Chemicals and Glass, resulting in substantial earnings recovery in these segments versus the recession-impacted first quarter of last year.
In our Coatings businesses, higher selling prices partially offset persistent raw material cost inflation. Despite inflationary cost pressures, operating margins in each Coatings segment were essentially flat with the prior year, and our total Coatings operating earnings improved by nearly 12%. Volume and pricing gains were supplemented by continued aggressive cost management actions. We also expanded our product reformulation activities in an effort to utilize lower cost raw materials to limit inflationary impacts on our customers. 
Lastly, another growth lever for us is the continued deployment of our cash for earnings accretion. While our recent acquisition activity has been minimal, we repurchased about $275 million of PPG stock during the quarter, bringing our total repurchases over the past 9 months to about $700 million at an average share price of $81. As a result, our share count has dropped nearly 3% versus last year's first quarter. In summary, our performance in the quarter was excellent. Despite persistent inflationary pressures, our overall segment margins improved by more than 300 basis points in comparison with last year, and 150 basis points sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
We posted double-digit sales growth on strong volumes and higher pricing and achieved record first quarter earnings per share. We also returned about $375 million of cash to shareholders, including $90 million of dividend. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic as we anticipate similar economic trends in the second quarter, which is seasonally our strongest sales quarter. We remain focused on offsetting inflationary pressures with expected additional price gains in the second quarter in all our businesses. 
Also, our aggressive cost management and execution focus remains. Finally, we continue to work on accretive initiatives to deploy our cash. We are applying our disciplined approach toward evaluating acquisitions and anticipate several small- to medium-sized bolt-on acquisitions over the next 6 to 9 months. 
Lastly, as a reflection of our outlook and our continued strong cash prospects, we raised our quarterly dividend another $0.02 today to $0.57 per share, which is our second increase in the past 9 months. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions."

And we're obviously facing lots of raw material initiatives there. So we had some modest volume improvements. And I would say that it was, from a channel perspective, I would say it was about even. We have a slightly different quarter here, Easter is later this year, the weather has been a little slower. So there are a few little offsets, so I think the real trends will probably be more evident after the end of the second quarter. But we certainly think we've come up slightly off the bottom. And most of the things that I've seen out there in terms of some of the commentary around commercial construction or even residential is that maybe were going to have modest improvement and that was the case in Europe as well. So a little bit of volume, mostly more price and I would say I'm not -- I haven't seen other announcements and I think it's too early to say there'll be any significant share change for PPG right now."

During the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the company's results for the quarter, and then we'll move directly to Q&A. This modified process allows substantially more time for Q&A, while providing a similar amount of data compared to our prior approach.
Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.
Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch."
294639,134172372,144016,"PPG Industries Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and welcome everyone. Today PPG announced earnings per share, which are up 30% versus the prior year and a record for any quarter in the company's history.

Today PPG announced earnings per share, which are up 30% versus the prior year and a record for any quarter in the company's history. This represents 4 consecutive quarters in which we delivered record earnings, underscoring the benefits of our broad end-use market reached and the global business portfolio we have built. 
Perhaps more importantly, our solid execution and operational excellence played a key role toward a strong performance of the quarter. We delivered higher pricing in every segment and continued our hallmark of aggressive cost management. This allowed us to overcome several transitory factors that impacted volumes in several of our businesses, including the full brunt of the Automotive OEM industry production curtailments due to supplier disruptions related to the Japan crisis, scheduled and unscheduled production downtime in our Commodity Chemicals segment and 4 weather conditions for Architectural Painting in the United States early in the quarter.
The month of April was most heavily impacted by these factors and our year-over-year volumes were negative in that month. Our volumes rebounded soundly in the remainder of the quarter to a growth rate comparable to the past several quarters. We posted positive volume growth in all regions, with Asia Pacific delivering the highest growth rate once again, driven by solid industrial gains in China. 
Our Coatings segment delivered excellent results. The Performance Coatings segment established a new earnings record and the Industrial Coatings segment matched their second quarter earnings record. This was done despite operating margins for these segments that dropped modestly versus last year as a result of the weakened April volumes and the European Architectural home center customer bankcruptcy charge. Our Coatings margin in the months of May and June were consistent with the prior year as volume growth resumed in all 8 of our Coatings businesses delivered higher pricing.
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment also achieved record quarterly sales and earnings. This performance was despite increased optical advertising costs as we broadened our geographic exposure by capitalizing on high growth opportunities in the emerging regions where we have delivered sales growth of 30% this quarter. Commodity Chemicals sales grew due to higher pricing and earnings doubled despite increased maintenance costs and lower facility utilization due to extended downtime.
Glass results also improved on strong fiberglass pricing. Lastly, we have continued to deploy cash on earnings accretive initiatives. In doing so, we have remained mindful of our tradition of returning cash to our shareholders. Fully illustrating that tradition is that over the past 12 months, we generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations, and have returned 100% of that cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
This past quarter, we also finalized a few acquisitions and pre-paid $400 million of debt that was not due until 2012. In summary, I'm pleased that we were able to deliver record results despite some uncommon events this past quarter. We relied heavily on our strong execution, a PPG heritage, and were aided by our portfolio balance.
Looking ahead, we anticipate the global economic recovery will continue, although at its current uneven pace. The resumption of Automotive OEM production in the second half of the year and our strong position in high-growth businesses and regions, such as Aerospace and Asia Pacific, will supplement our growth. 
Also, although inflation pressures are moderating somewhat, we intend to secure additional pricing in businesses where we have not fully offset the inflated raw material costs.
Finally, we intend to deploy between $500 million and $1 billion of cash in the second half of the year, with a focus on earnings accretion. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

I'd say in this case, we continue to report excellent results. I think maybe there was some weakness out there because of some other announcements in the space that companies that may be weren't as confident about their performance. But we feel that there's excellent value in the share price. In the second half of the year, we have, as we discussed plenty of cash that we intended to deploy. As you look at our cash flow through the year, it usually builds in our company through the second half of the year. So we will have additional opportunities for what we call value accreting cash transactions including more aggressive share buybacks. I think the second half of the year also from a raw materials standpoint, I see some moderation. If you look more specifically at the organic raw materials side, we've seen some price declines. You've seen overall lower prices in Asia and here in the propylene molecule and some of the residence. So I think that's going to help moderate the price increases in the second half. We're still looking at inorganic raw materials specifically the pigment and TiO2. We don't see the same price declines. But we think overall, we're going to see a flattening as we've been as we've been talking about in raw material prices that should allow us to recapture some of the margin that we've lost in the supply or value chain. And I think it will be a good opportunity for our Coatings businesses to demonstrate the earnings in margin power that we've been talking about for the last several years."

Now in terms of bending the demand curve, let's call it for TiO2 and any of the paint formulations, I would say that some of the numbers you were talking about are probably on the high end of 20% change in TiO2 loading or usage in our paint formulations is probably on the high end. I think traditionally we've said it's going to be in the near term, somewhere in the order of mid-single digits, if we're all successful in some of these initiatives taken. And so I would you be targeting that over the near term, 3 or 4 years out. I think you could see some bigger changes.

In North America I think you have a situation where there was a lot of restructuring in the industry. There were some tariffs that were put up, and so the North American tire industry as an example is working full out. But the biggest reason behind this demand growth in silica is, that silica is a specialty chemical additive in the tire manufacturing process, and it improves rolling resistance in tire performance. So what you're seeing today is the effect of what we would call the green tires. So you improve your miles per gallon performance with these higher silica loaded tires. So I would say this is not necessarily a share play. I think all the silica manufacturers are enjoying this improved volume. So it's more about the performance attributes of silicas, and the increased sensitivity for consumers both at the OEM and the replacement market plus some of the café standards and the other mileage standards that are being promulgated now. It is really requiring higher miles per gallon per vehicle and one of the least expensive ways to get that better mileage is incorporate more silica into the tire formulation."

This represents 4 consecutive quarters in which we delivered record earnings, u",623,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today, PPG announced earnings per share, which are up 30% versus the prior year and a record for any quarter in the company's history. This represents 4 consecutive quarters in which we delivered record earnings, underscoring the benefits of our broad end-use market reach and the global business portfolio we have built. 
Perhaps more importantly, our solid execution and operational excellence played a key role toward a strong performance in the quarter. We delivered higher pricing in every segment and continued our hallmark of aggressive cost management. This allowed us to overcome several transitory factors that impacted volumes in several of our businesses, including the full brunt of the automotive OEM industry production curtailments due to supplier disruptions related to the Japan crisis, scheduled and unscheduled production downtime in our Commodity Chemicals segment and poor weather conditions for architectural painting in the United States early in the quarter.
The month of April was most heavily impacted by these factors, and our year-over-year volumes were negative in that month. Our volumes rebounded soundly in the remainder of the quarter to a growth rate comparable to the past several quarters. We posted positive volume growth in all regions, with Asia Pacific delivering the highest growth rate once again, driven by solid industrial gains in China. 
Our coatings segment delivered excellent results. The Performance Coatings segment established a new earnings record, and the Industrial Coatings segment matched their second quarter earnings record. This was done despite operating margins for these segments that dropped modestly versus last year as a result of the weakened April volumes and a European architectural home center customer bankruptcy charge. Our coatings margins in the months of May and June were consistent with the prior year as volume growth resumed, and all 8 of our coatings businesses delivered higher pricing.
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment also achieved record quarterly sales and earnings. This performance was despite increased optical advertising costs as we broadened our geographic exposure by capitalizing on high growth opportunities in the emerging regions where we have delivered sales growth of 30% this quarter. Commodity Chemicals sales grew due to higher pricing, and earnings doubled despite increased maintenance costs and lower facility utilization due to extended downtime.
Glass results also improved on strong fiberglass pricing. Lastly, we have continued to deploy cash on earnings-accretive initiatives. In doing so, we have remained mindful of our tradition of returning cash to our shareholders. Fully illustrating that tradition is that over the past 12 months, we generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations and have returned 100% of that cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
This past quarter, we also finalized a few acquisitions and pre-paid $400 million of debt that was not due until 2012. In summary, I'm pleased that we were able to deliver record results despite some uncommon events this past quarter. We relied heavily on our strong execution, a PPG heritage and were aided by our portfolio balance.
Looking ahead, we anticipate the global economic recovery will continue, although at its current uneven pace. The resumption of automotive OEM production in the second half of the year and our strong position in high-growth businesses and regions, such as Aerospace and Asia Pacific, will supplement our growth. 
Also, although inflation pressures are moderating somewhat, we intend to secure additional pricing in businesses where we have not fully offset the inflated raw material costs.
Finally, we intend to deploy between $500 million and $1 billion of cash in the second half of the year, with a focus on earnings accretion. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

I think maybe there was some weakness out there because of some other announcements in the space that companies that may be weren't as confident about their performance.

This is -- a you look at our cash flow through the year, it usually builds in our company through the second half of the year. So we will have additional opportunities for what we call value-accreting cash transactions concluding. I think more aggressive share buybacks. I think the second half of the year, also, from a raw materials standpoint, I see some moderation. If you look more specifically at the organic raw materials side, we've seen some price declines. You've seen overall lower prices in Asia and here in the propylene molecule and in some of the resins. So I think that's going to help moderate the price increases in the second half. We're still looking at inorganic raw materials, specifically the pigment and TiO2. We don't see the same price declines, but we think overall, we're going to see a flattening as we've been talking about in raw material prices that should allow us to recapture some of the margin that we've lost in the supply or value chain. And I think it will be a good opportunity for our Coatings businesses to demonstrate the earnings and margin power that we've been talking about for the last several years."

So in North America, I think you have a situation where there was a lot of restructuring in the industry. There were some tariffs that were put up, and so the North American tire industry as an example is working full out. But the biggest reason behind this demand growth in Silicas is that Silicas is a specialty chemical additive in the tire manufacturing process, and it improves rolling resistance in tire performance. So what you're seeing today is the effect of what we would call the green tires. So you improve your miles per gallon performance with these higher silica-loaded tires. So I would say this is not a -- necessarily a share play. I think all the silica manufacturers are enjoying this improved volume.

Today, PPG announced earnings per share, which are up 30% versus the prior year and a record for any quarter in the company's history. This represents 4 consecutive quarters in which we delivered record earnings, u",623,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today, PPG announced earnings per share, which are up 30% versus the prior year and a record for any quarter in the company's history. This represents 4 consecutive quarters in which we delivered record earnings, underscoring the benefits of our broad end-use market reach and the global business portfolio we have built. 
Perhaps more importantly, our solid execution and operational excellence played a key role toward a strong performance in the quarter. We delivered higher pricing in every segment and continued our hallmark of aggressive cost management. This allowed us to overcome several transitory factors that impacted volumes in several of our businesses, including the full brunt of the automotive OEM industry production curtailments due to supplier disruptions related to the Japan crisis, scheduled and unscheduled production downtime in our Commodity Chemicals segment and poor weather conditions for architectural painting in the United States early in the quarter.
The month of April was most heavily impacted by these factors, and our year-over-year volumes were negative in that month. Our volumes rebounded soundly in the remainder of the quarter to a growth rate comparable to the past several quarters. We posted positive volume growth in all regions, with Asia Pacific delivering the highest growth rate once again, driven by solid industrial gains in China. 
Our coatings segments delivered excellent results. The Performance Coatings segment established a new earnings record, and the Industrial Coatings segment matched their second quarter earnings record. This was done despite operating margins for these segments that dropped modestly versus last year as a result of the weakened April volumes and a European architectural home center customer bankruptcy charge. Our coatings margins in the months of May and June were consistent with the prior year as volume growth resumed, and all 8 of our coatings businesses delivered higher pricing.
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment also achieved record quarterly sales and earnings. This performance was despite increased optical advertising costs as we broadened our geographic exposure by capitalizing on high growth opportunities in the emerging regions where we have delivered sales growth of 30% this quarter. Commodity Chemicals sales grew due to higher pricing, and earnings doubled despite increased maintenance costs and lower facility utilization due to extended downtime.
Glass results also improved on strong fiberglass pricing. Lastly, we have continued to deploy cash on earnings-accretive initiatives. In doing so, we have remained mindful of our tradition of returning cash to our shareholders. Fully illustrating that tradition is that over the past 12 months, we generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations and have returned 100% of that cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
This past quarter, we also finalized a few acquisitions and pre-paid $400 million of debt that was not due until 2012. In summary, I'm pleased that we were able to deliver record results despite some uncommon events this past quarter. We relied heavily on our strong execution, a PPG heritage and were aided by our portfolio balance.
Looking ahead, we anticipate the global economic recovery will continue, although at its current uneven pace. The resumption of automotive OEM production in the second half of the year and our strong position in high-growth businesses and regions, such as Aerospace and Asia Pacific, will supplement our growth. 
Also, although inflation pressures are moderating somewhat, we intend to secure additional pricing in businesses where we have not fully offset the inflated raw material costs.
Finally, we intend to deploy between $500 million and $1 billion of cash in the second half of the year, with a focus on earnings accretion. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

So clearly, something's happened to value the stock. And I'm just curious on 2 fronts. One, does that seem unreasonable to you, and we can expect maybe a little bit more aggressive share repurchase? It looks like it curtailed a bit in the second quarter. And then two, as we look into the second half of '11 into '12, do you think we'll see a little bit more of the weight pulled by the coatings businesses to show some growth there as you get those prices and maybe some moderating of raw materials?"

I'd say in this case, we continue to report excellent results. I think maybe there was some weakness out there because of some other announcements in the space that companies that may be weren't as confident about their performance. But we feel that there's excellent value in the share price. In the second half of the year, we have, as we discussed, plenty of cash that we intend to deploy. This is -- as you look at our cash flow through the year, it usually builds in our company through the second half of the year. So we will have additional opportunities for what we call value-accreting cash transactions concluding. I think more aggressive share buybacks. I think the second half of the year, also, from a raw materials standpoint, I see some moderation. If you look more specifically at the organic raw materials side, we've seen some price declines. You've seen overall lower prices in Asia and here in the propylene molecule and in some of the resins. So I think that's going to help moderate the price increases in the second half. We're still looking at inorganic raw materials, specifically the pigment and TiO2. We don't see the same price declines, but we think overall, we're going to see a flattening as we've been talking about in raw material prices that should allow us to recapture some of the margin that we've lost in the supply or value chain. And I think it will be a good opportunity for our Coatings businesses to demonstrate the earnings and margin power that we've been talking about for the last several years."

Now in terms of bending the demand curve, let's call it for TiO2 in any of the paint formulations, I would say that some of the numbers you were talking about are probably on the high end of 20% change in TiO2 loading or usage in our paint formulations is probably on the high end. I think traditionally, we've said it's going to be in the near term, somewhere in the order of mid-single digits, if we're all successful in some of these initiatives. And so I would still be targeting that over the near term, 3 or 4 years out. I think you should -- you could see some bigger changes.

So in North America, I think you have a situation where there was a lot of restructuring in the industry. There were some tariffs that were put up, and so the North American tire industry as an example is working full out. But the biggest reason behind this demand growth in Silicas is that Silicas is a specialty chemical additive in the tire manufacturing process, and it improves rolling resistance in tire performance. So what you're seeing today is the effect of what we would call the green tires. So you improve your miles per gallon performance with these higher silica-loaded tires. So I would say this is not a -- necessarily a share play. I think all the silica manufacturers are enjoying this improved volume. So it's more of a -- the performance attributes of silicas and the increased sensitivity for consumers, both at the OEM and the replacement market. Plus some of the CAFE standards and the other mileage standards that are being promulgated now, it is really requiring higher miles per gallon per vehicle. And one of the least expensive ways to get that better mileage is incorporate more silica into the tire formulation."

This represents 4 consecutive quarters in which we delivered record earnings, u",623,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today, PPG announced earnings per share, which are up 30% versus the prior year and a record for any quarter in the company's history. This represents 4 consecutive quarters in which we delivered record earnings, underscoring the benefits of our broad end-use market reach and the global business portfolio we have built. 
Perhaps more importantly, our solid execution and operational excellence played a key role toward a strong performance in the quarter. We delivered higher pricing in every segment and continued our hallmark of aggressive cost management. This allowed us to overcome several transitory factors that impacted volumes in several of our businesses, including the full brunt of the automotive OEM industry production curtailments due to supplier disruptions related to the Japan crisis, scheduled and unscheduled production downtime in our Commodity Chemicals segment and poor weather conditions for architectural painting in the United States early in the quarter.
The month of April was most heavily impacted by these factors, and our year-over-year volumes were negative in that month. Our volumes rebounded soundly in the remainder of the quarter to a growth rate comparable to the past several quarters. We posted positive volume growth in all regions, with Asia Pacific delivering the highest growth rate once again, driven by solid industrial gains in China. 
Our coatings segments delivered excellent results. The Performance Coatings segment established a new earnings record, and the Industrial Coatings segment matched their second quarter earnings record. This was done despite operating margins for these segments that dropped modestly versus last year as a result of the weakened April volumes and a European architectural home center customer bankruptcy charge. Our coatings margins in the months of May and June were consistent with the prior year as volume growth resumed, and all 8 of our coatings businesses delivered higher pricing.
Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment also achieved record quarterly sales and earnings. This performance was despite increased optical advertising costs as we broadened our geographic exposure by capitalizing on high growth opportunities in the emerging regions where we have delivered sales growth of 30% this quarter. Commodity Chemicals sales grew due to higher pricing, and earnings doubled despite increased maintenance costs and lower facility utilization due to extended downtime.
Glass results also improved on strong fiberglass pricing. Lastly, we have continued to deploy cash on earnings-accretive initiatives. In doing so, we have remained mindful of our tradition of returning cash to our shareholders. Fully illustrating that tradition is that over the past 12 months, we generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations and have returned 100% of that cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
This past quarter, we also finalized a few acquisitions and pre-paid $400 million of debt that was not due until 2012. In summary, I'm pleased that we were able to deliver record results despite some uncommon events this past quarter. We relied heavily on our strong execution, a PPG heritage and were aided by our portfolio balance.
Looking ahead, we anticipate the global economic recovery will continue, although at its current uneven pace. The resumption of automotive OEM production in the second half of the year and our strong position in high-growth businesses and regions, such as Aerospace and Asia Pacific, will supplement our growth. 
Also, although inflation pressures are moderating somewhat, we intend to secure additional pricing in businesses where we have not fully offset the inflated raw material costs.
Finally, we intend to deploy between $500 million and $1 billion of cash in the second half of the year, with a focus on earnings accretion. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

I think maybe there was some weakness out there because of some other announcements in the space that companies that may be weren't as confident about their performance. But we feel that there's excellent value in the share price. In the second half of the year, we have, as we discussed, plenty of cash that we intend to deploy. This is -- as you look at our cash flow through the year, it usually builds in our company through the second half of the year. So we will have additional opportunities for what we call value-accreting cash transactions concluding. I think more aggressive share buybacks. I think the second half of the year, also, from a raw materials standpoint, I see some moderation. If you look more specifically at the organic raw materials side, we've seen some price declines. You've seen overall lower prices in Asia and here in the propylene molecule and in some of the resins. So I think that's going to help moderate the price increases in the second half. We're still looking at inorganic raw materials, specifically the pigment and TiO2. We don't see the same price declines, but we think overall, we're going to see a flattening as we've been talking about in raw material prices that should allow us to recapture some of the margin that we've lost in the supply or value chain. And I think it will be a good opportunity for our Coatings businesses to demonstrate the earnings and margin power that we've been talking about for the last several years."

So in North America, I think you have a situation where there was a lot of restructuring in the industry. There were some tariffs that were put up, and so the North American tire industry as an example is working full out. But the biggest reason behind this demand growth in Silicas is that Silicas is a specialty chemical additive in the tire manufacturing process, and it improves rolling resistance in tire performance. So what you're seeing today is the effect of what we would call the green tires. So you improve your miles per gallon performance with these higher silica-loaded tires. So I would say this is not a -- necessarily a share play. I think all the silica manufacturers are enjoying this improved volume.

Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch."
294639,141283571,174711,"PPG Industries Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today we announced third quarter sales of $3.8 billion, up 11% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our third quarter earnings per share of $1.96 were a record for any quarter in the company's history and up 24% versu",616,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today we announced third quarter sales of $3.8 billion, up 11% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our third quarter earnings per share of $1.96 were a record for any quarter in the company's history and up 24% versus the prior year. This represents 5 consecutive quarters in which we have eclipsed our prior quarterly earnings record, including last quarter where our earnings were also up more than 20%.
This consistent improvement in performance, especially in light of today's economic backdrop, demonstrates our management's aggressive focus on operations and the continuing benefit of structural changes that we have made to the company the past few years, including a lower cost base and expansion in emerging regions.
In addition, these results reflect the continuing benefits of our disciplined deployment of our strong cash position. Our third quarter sales improved by about $400 million versus the prior year. Year-over-year volumes for the company were flat for the quarter, differing results by region and end use market. Demand in North America was up about 1% versus last year, consistent with our second quarter volume change. However, these results included a large negative volume impact from several unplanned production outages in our commodity chemical business early in the quarter, which reduced the North American percentage volume change for the company by a few hundred basis points.
Emerging region volume growth continued, driven by higher industrial and Automotive OEM activity levels. These results were tempered by expected declines in shipbuilding activity as the lower production reflects a smaller marine original equipment order backlog. Most other emerging region and market growth remained consistent with the prior quarter.
The higher emerging region results offset declines in European volumes, principally due to lower activity levels in several consumer-oriented businesses, including optical products and Architectural Coatings. Aiding our sales and record earnings performance was higher pricing in all 13 of our businesses, led by our Commodity Chemical business. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter where the company has delivered higher pricing, reflecting our efforts to recover inflation we have already absorbed and counter flattening raw material to inflation rate. Earnings were also assisted by the benefit from higher global industry activity, including improving global auto production, along with continued strong performance in some of our top performing businesses such as Aerospace and Automotive Refinish as we continue to benefit from our leading technologies.
Lastly, cash generation remains a key accountability and we have lowered our working capital as a percentage of sales versus last year's third quarter by over 100 basis points. Our year-to-date cash from operations is up 10% versus 2010, driven by gains in the third quarter. Also, we have continued our legacy of returning cash to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases combined have totaled over $900 million year-to-date, including $350 million this past quarter.
Looking ahead, we anticipate current macro and regional economic trends to continue, supported to date by our October activity levels in most of our businesses. The fourth quarter is traditionally our slowest quarter seasonally for several of our businesses and, in general, we anticipate normal seasonal fourth quarter patterns to occur. Raw material inflation rates are flattening, and we are in the process of implementing additional pricing in several businesses to counter the prior inflation impacts we have absorbed. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and intend to continue to deploy our cash with a focus on driving earnings growth. 
Finally, we are keeping a watchful eye on the global economy and are prepared to adapt to changing conditions. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

If it comes there, the labor force, the cost structure in Asia is very flexible, so that, typically, we can react quickly. It's not as costly a process as it is in Europe or here in North America. So I would say that we are not overly concerned with one, a moderation of the growth rates to the level that we've seen now. And if it happens, at least in Asia, we think we'll be able to respond quickly. I think what you see, however, in a market like you Europe, where there is a lot of concern, especially with the sovereign debt crisis and will that spill over into some of the consumer markets in the rest of Europe. And there, it does restructuring actions or costs reductions in Europe, in particular, take a little longer to develop or more costly to implement. And that's where I think we're being most vigilant right now in making sure that our businesses and the end-use markets for our products are staying up. Typically, for us, the automotive market is one of the first places where we see weakness. Historically, that's when we saw that at the end of '08 and '09.

Is that the case in terms of what you're seeing and how you have to react to maybe what your customer or what your competitors are doing?

And I think",406,"Well, I think the frustration level is -- traditionally in our industry, we have had pricing that was more stable, annual pricing or pricing for the paint season. And I think this is how traditionally the industry operated with our customers. And I think in this environment, where we've had to go out multiple times to our customers across all end use markets and say, we're sorry, but there's so much cost inflation in our raw material chain that we're going to have to go out of step with our historical practices and ask for additional pricing kind of in-season or after they've said some of their annual pricing. So I think this is the frustration that many of us feel. And our customers, I think they're seeing in many markets that demand is still relatively weak volumes are low as we've been talking about. And so there is, I would say, frustration on the part of the customer, saying well, if the market's so week, why are we getting additional pricing requests? So I think that's the frustration that we feel and that our customers feel. Obviously, in some of the commodities that we've talked about on this call, we're doing everything we can to improve our productivity to better utilize those products in our formulation so that we limit any increases in consumption for our products, and we're working hard. And now instead of working on a lot of new product developments or new technologies that will help our markets stimulate demand, help our customers, we're working on formulations that will just minimize the impact of some of these price increases on the raw material side. So I think that's the frustration that I think that certainly I feel and that the people in our company and I am assuming that others in the paint industry would feel as well. Demand destruction, hard to say at this point. That's a longer-term issue, but they are probably for any product in today's world, including paints and coatings, they are product substitutions, and you can do things differently. And then we don't want to see our products, obviously, substituted in the marketplace. Or people trading down to a lower price or cheaper products because that will reflect on the image and the value that we historically or typically create for our customers. So I think that's the level of frustration that certainly we feel right now."

Now right now, what we're seeing is somewhat different in the sense that we're still, as an industry, recovering from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. We see a little out of traditional seasonal patterns here in North America with the improvement in production levels for the Japanese-based manufacturers. Overall demand and sales have been good I think in part because the market was so weak 3 years ago. And if you really get into some of the discussion about what happened in the leasing market when some of the financing dried up areas, now a little more strength than you would assume with the overall, let's say, dampened demand overall in the consumer economy. The car market here in North America is pretty good, and in China, it's still been good. Even though the sales levels have come down, it's still solid. And in Europe, volumes have been relatively flat, but we have not seen any declines. So I think overall, we're encouraged by what we've seen in the automotive market, but it is typically one that will react if things, if the consumer sentiment turns negative so we're very watchful here. But right now, in the near term, we're encouraged that we do get some visibility. And typically, if they do start cutting back on production levels, they don't do it immediately next week. It will be at the time of a traditional shutdown. But you usually have a couple of months to see that, and you'll see probably the impact before that in sales levels and the like."

On SG&A, just looking at the ramp-up in SG&A costs, it looks like it's going to be out person 8% higher year-over-year in 2011 versus 2012, which is not as high as your revenue growth, which looks like it's going to be about 12%. But most of that or at least half of that is pricing. So it looks like if you exclude pricing and foreign exchange that your SG&A is growing significantly faster than your revenue. Is that in building out some kind of investing ahead of the market recoveries in some markets? Or maybe becoming a little bit less restrictive as far as travel or show attendance or anything like that? Or kind of what's behind the faster ramp-up in SG&A costs, almost back to 2008 levels?"

So if we were to use more TiO2 from the non-Western sources, most of this is sulfate technology that requires differences in processing, qualification, testing. So that's the reason why these things are not -- from month-to-month, you can't change the suppliers to these new products, new technologies, new suppliers. So that's why you haven't seen as much substitution short term in the industry. Plus, when things tightened up in the first half, there wasn't a financial incentive to utilize these products more broadly.

294639,141283571,174945,"PPG Industries Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today we announced third quarter sales of $3.8 billion, up 11% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our third quarter earnings per share of $1.96 were a record for any quarter in the company's history and up 24% versu",614,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today we announced third quarter sales of $3.8 billion, up 11% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our third quarter earnings per share of $1.96 were a record for any quarter in the company's history and up 24% versus the prior year. This represents 5 consecutive quarters in which we have eclipsed our prior quarterly earnings record, including last quarter where our earnings were also up more than 20%.
This consistent improvement in performance, especially in light of today's economic backdrop, demonstrates our management's aggressive focus on operations and the continuing benefit of structural changes that we have made to the company the past few years, including a lower cost base and expansion in emerging regions.
In addition, these results reflect the continuing benefits of our disciplined deployment of our strong cash position. Our third quarter sales improved by about $400 million versus the prior year. Year-over-year volumes for the company were flat for the quarter, with differing results by region and end-use market. Demand in North America was up about 1% versus last year, consistent with our second quarter volume change. However, these results included a large negative volume impact from several unplanned production outages in our Commodity Chemical business early in the quarter, which reduced the North American percentage volume change for the company by a few hundred basis points.
Emerging region volume growth continued, driven by higher industrial and automotive OEM activity levels. These results were tempered by expected declines in shipbuilding activity as the lower production reflects a smaller marine original equipment order backlog. Most other emerging region and market growth remained consistent with the prior quarter.
The higher emerging region results offset declines in European volumes, principally due to lower activity levels in several consumer-oriented businesses, including Optical products and Architectural Coatings. Aiding our sales and record earnings performance was higher pricing in all 13 of our businesses, led by our Commodity Chemical business. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter where the company has delivered higher pricing, reflecting our efforts to recover inflation we have already absorbed and counter flattening raw material inflation rates.
Earnings were also assisted by the benefit from higher global industry activity, including improving global auto production, along with continued strong performance in some of our top performing businesses such as Aerospace and Automotive Refinish as we continue to benefit from our leading technologies.
Lastly, cash generation remains a key accountability, and we have lowered our working capital as a percentage of sales versus last year's third quarter by over 100 basis points. Our year-to-date cash from operations is up 10% versus 2010, driven by gains in the third quarter. Also, we have continued our legacy of returning cash to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases combined have totaled over $900 million year-to-date, including $350 million this past quarter.
Looking ahead, we anticipate current macro and regional economic trends to continue, supported to date by October activity levels in most of our businesses. The fourth quarter is traditionally our slowest quarter seasonally for several of our businesses and, in general, we anticipate normal seasonal fourth quarter patterns to occur. Raw material inflation rates are flattening, and we are in the process of implementing additional pricing in several businesses to counter the prior inflation impacts we have absorbed. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and intend to continue to deploy our cash with a focus on driving earnings growth.
Finally, we are keeping a watchful eye on the global economy and are prepared to adapt to changing conditions. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

But for us, one, we don't see that moderation of growth rates in Asia triggering a, let's say, an aggressive cost response from our standpoint. If it comes there, the labor force, the cost structure in Asia is very flexible, so that, typically, we can react quickly. It's not as costly a process as it is in Europe or here in North America. So I would say that we are not overly concerned with one, a moderation of the growth rates to the level that we've seen now. And if it happens, at least in Asia, we think we'll be able to respond quickly. I think what you see, however, in a market like Europe, where there is a lot of concern especially with the sovereign debt crisis, and will that spill over into some of the consumer markets in the rest of Europe, and there it does restructuring actions or cost reductions in Europe in particular, take a little longer to develop or more costly to implement, and that's where I think we're being most vigilant right now in making sure that our businesses and the end-use markets for our products are staying up. Typically, for us, the automotive market is one of the first places where we see weakness. Historically, that's when we saw it at the end of '08 and '09. But right now, the automotive market here and in Europe has stayed up. We haven't seen any pronounced weaknesses, but this is one where we are watching, and I think we will react quickly in Europe when we see signs developing that this crisis is really affecting end-use markets."

And I think this is how traditionally the industry operated with our customers. And I think in this environment, where we've had to go out multiple times to our customers across all end-use markets and say, ""We're sorry, but there's so much cost inflation in our raw material chain that we're going to have to go out of step with our historical practices and ask for additional pricing kind of in-season or after they've set some of their annual pricing."" So I think this is the frustration that many of us feel. And our customers, I think they're seeing in many markets that demand is still relatively weak, volumes are low as we've been talking about. And so there is, I would say, frustration on the part of the customer saying, ""Well, wait, if the market's so week, why are we getting additional pricing requests?"" So I think that's the frustration that we feel and that our customers feel. Obviously, in some of the commodities that we've talked about on this call, we're doing everything we can to improve our productivity to better utilize those products in our formulation so that we limit any increases in consumption for our products, and we're working hard. And now instead of working on a lot of new product developments or new technologies that will help our markets stimulate demand, help our customers, we're working on formulations that will just minimize the impact of some of these price increases on the raw material side. So I think that's the frustration that I think -- that certainly I feel and that people in our company and I am assuming that others in the paint industry would feel as well. Demand destruction, hard to say at this point. That's a longer-term issue, but they are probably for any product in today's world, including paints and coatings. They are product substitutions, and you can do things differently. And we don't want to see our products, obviously, substituted in the marketplace, or people trading down to lower-priced or cheaper products because that will reflect on the image and the value that we historically or typically create for our customers. So I think that's the level of frustration that certainly we feel right now."

And certainly, I think what we saw this time 3 years ago, we saw the impact of the recession and the credit crisis first in the automotive market, especially here in North America. Now right now, what we're seeing is somewhat different in the sense that we're still, as an industry, recovering from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. We see a little out of traditional seasonal patterns here in North America with the improvement in production levels for the Japanese-based manufacturers. Overall, demand and sales have been good I think, in part because the market was so weak 3 years ago. And if you really get into some of the discussion about what happened in the leasing market when some of the financing dried up, there is now a little more strength than you would assume with the overall, let's say, dampened demand overall in the consumer economy. The car market here in North America is pretty good. And in China, it's still been good. Even though the sales levels have come down, it's still solid. And in Europe, volumes have been relatively flat, but we have not seen any declines. So I think, overall, we're encouraged by what we've seen in the automotive market. But it is typically one that will react if things get -- if the consumer sentiment turns negative. So we're very watchful here. But right now, in the near term, we're encouraged. We do get some visibility and typically, if they do start cutting back on production levels, they don't do it immediately next week. It will be at the time of a traditional shutdown. But you usually have a couple of months to see that, and you'll see probably the impact before that in sales levels and the like."

I mean, you guys delivered 4 good quarters in a row of kind of double-digit operating margins in that business, and then they slipped back down to about a little bit over 8% in the September quarter. Was that entirely due to kind of volume declines and the maintenance shutdowns that you have and we should expect you to return to double-digit operating profitability? Or has something changed in the industry, either from a demand side or a cost side where we should be looking at third quarter run rate as more typical?"

We incur additional maintenance costs as well as loss production. So we had 2 of those in the third quarter that had more of an impact. So I would expect that we would improve seasonally in the fourth quarter versus what we saw seasonally in the third quarter of 2011. But I would say, overall, the volumes are probably not quite as strong either in the fiberglass market and more or less stable at a low level in the flat glass market. So I would say we're not going to -- we don't expect any volume improvements. We'll have better costs, but that necessarily won't -- that will mean that things are going to fall somewhere between what we have seasonally in the fourth quarter and some of the weakness that you saw in the third quarter, if that's clear."

But most of that, or at least half of that, is pricing. So it looks like if you exclude kind of pricing and foreign exchange, that your SG&A is growing significantly faster than your revenue. Is that in building out some kind of investing ahead of the market recoveries in some markets? Or maybe becoming a little bit less restrictive as far as travel or show attendance or anything like that? Or kind of what's behind the faster ramp-up in SG&A costs, almost back to 2008 levels?"

So if we were to use more TiO2 from the non-Western sources, most of this is sulfate technology that requires differences in processing, qualification, testing. So that's the reason why these things are not -- from month-to-month, you can't change the suppliers to these new products, new technologies, new suppliers. So that's why you haven't seen as much substitution short term in the industry. Plus, when things tightened up in the first half, there wasn't a financial incentive to utilize these products more broadly. Now I think you're going to -- that's opened up, the opportunity, but it will still take some time in our formulations, in processing, in working with the customers where we do need broader discussions or approvals to change raw materials.

But right now, I would say we haven't seen a lot of acquisition activity in the industry. And we didn't see it as much in '08 and '09 either, because the industry actually held up fairly well. So it's unclear to me whether these moderating growth rates will cause a lot more M&A activity.

294639,141283571,175010,"PPG Industries Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","PPG Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today we announced third quarter sales of $3.8 billion, up 11% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our third quarter earnings per share of $1.96 were a record for any quarter in the company's history and up 24% versu",614,"Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today we announced third quarter sales of $3.8 billion, up 11% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our third quarter earnings per share of $1.96 were a record for any quarter in the company's history and up 24% versus the prior year. This represents 5 consecutive quarters in which we have eclipsed our prior quarterly earnings record, including last quarter where our earnings were also up more than 20%.
This consistent improvement in performance, especially in light of today's economic backdrop, demonstrates our management's aggressive focus on operations and the continuing benefit of structural changes that we have made to the company the past few years, including a lower cost base and expansion in emerging regions.
In addition, these results reflect the continuing benefits of our disciplined deployment of our strong cash position. Our third quarter sales improved by about $400 million versus the prior year. Year-over-year volumes for the company were flat for the quarter, with differing results by region and end-use market. Demand in North America was up about 1% versus last year, consistent with our second quarter volume change. However, these results included a large negative volume impact from several unplanned production outages in our Commodity Chemical business early in the quarter, which reduced the North American percentage volume change for the company by a few hundred basis points.
Emerging region volume growth continued, driven by higher industrial and automotive OEM activity levels. These results were tempered by expected declines in shipbuilding activity as the lower production reflects a smaller marine original equipment order backlog. Most other emerging region and market growth remained consistent with the prior quarter.
The higher emerging region results offset declines in European volumes, principally due to lower activity levels in several consumer-oriented businesses, including Optical products and Architectural Coatings. Aiding our sales and record earnings performance was higher pricing in all 13 of our businesses, led by our Commodity Chemical business. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter where the company has delivered higher pricing, reflecting our efforts to recover inflation we have already absorbed and counter flattening raw material inflation rates.
Earnings were also assisted by the benefit from higher global industry activity, including improving global auto production, along with continued strong performance in some of our top performing businesses such as Aerospace and Automotive Refinish as we continue to benefit from our leading technologies.
Lastly, cash generation remains a key accountability, and we have lowered our working capital as a percentage of sales versus last year's third quarter by over 100 basis points. Our year-to-date cash from operations is up 10% versus 2010, driven by gains in the third quarter. Also, we have continued our legacy of returning cash to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases combined have totaled over $900 million year-to-date, including $350 million this past quarter.
Looking ahead, we anticipate current macro and regional economic trends to continue, supported to date by October activity levels in most of our businesses. The fourth quarter is traditionally our slowest quarter seasonally for several of our businesses and, in general, we anticipate normal seasonal fourth quarter patterns to occur. Raw material inflation rates are flattening, and we are in the process of implementing additional pricing in several businesses to counter the prior inflation impacts we have absorbed. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and intend to continue to deploy our cash with a focus on driving earnings growth.
Finally, we are keeping a watchful eye on the global economy and are prepared to adapt to changing conditions. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?"

So I think sometimes now when we look at growth rates that may be now in the kind of 6% to 9% kind of range that people say, ""Well, this is going to really require a lot of retrenchment."" But for us, one, we don't see that moderation of growth rates in Asia triggering a, let's say, an aggressive cost response from our standpoint. If it comes there, the labor force, the cost structure in Asia is very flexible, so that, typically, we can react quickly. It's not as costly a process as it is in Europe or here in North America. So I would say that we are not overly concerned with one, a moderation of the growth rates to the level that we've seen now. And if it happens, at least in Asia, we think we'll be able to respond quickly. I think what you see, however, in a market like Europe, where there is a lot of concern especially with the sovereign debt crisis, and will that spill over into some of the consumer markets in the rest of Europe, and there it does, restructuring actions or cost reductions in Europe in particular, take a little longer to develop or more costly to implement, and that's where I think we're being most vigilant right now in making sure that our businesses and the end-use markets for our products are staying up. Typically, for us, the automotive market is one of the first places where we see weakness. Historically, that's when we saw it at the end of '08 and '09. But right now, the automotive market here and in Europe has stayed up. We haven't seen any pronounced weaknesses, but this is one where we are watching, and I think we will react quickly in Europe when we see signs developing that this crisis is really affecting end-use markets."

And I think this is how traditionally the industry operated with our customers. And I think in this environment, where we've had to go out multiple times to our customers across all end-use markets and say, ""We're sorry, but there's so much cost inflation in our raw material chain that we're going to have to go out of step with our historical practices and ask for additional pricing kind of in-season or after they've set some of their annual pricing."" So I think this is the frustration that many of us feel. And our customers, I think they're seeing in many markets that demand is still relatively weak, volumes are low as we've been talking about. And so there is, I would say, frustration on the part of the customer saying, ""Well, wait, if the market's so weak, why are we getting additional pricing requests?"" So I think that's the frustration that we feel and that our customers feel. Obviously, in some of the commodities that we've talked about on this call, we're doing everything we can to improve our productivity to better utilize those products in our formulation so that we limit any increases in consumption for our products, and we're working hard. And now instead of working on a lot of new product developments or new technologies that will help our markets stimulate demand, help our customers, we're working on formulations that will just minimize the impact of some of these price increases on the raw material side. So I think that's the frustration that I think -- that certainly I feel and that people in our company and I am assuming that others in the paint industry would feel as well. Demand destruction, hard to say at this point. That's a longer-term issue, but they are probably for any product in today's world, including paints and coatings, there are product substitutions, and you can do things differently. And we don't want to see our products, obviously, substituted in the marketplace, or people trading down to lower-priced or cheaper products because that will reflect on the image and the value that we historically or typically create for our customers. So I think that's the level of frustration that certainly we feel right now."

And certainly, I think what we saw at this time 3 years ago, we saw the impact of the recession and the credit crisis first in the automotive market, especially here in North America. Now right now, what we're seeing is somewhat different in the sense that we're still, as an industry, recovering from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. We see a little out of traditional seasonal patterns here in North America with the improvement in production levels for the Japanese-based manufacturers. Overall, demand and sales have been good I think, in part because the market was so weak 3 years ago. And if you really get into some of the discussion about what happened in the leasing market when some of the financing dried up, there is now a little more strength than you would assume with the overall, let's say, dampened demand overall in the consumer economy. The car market here in North America is pretty good. And in China, it's still been good. Even though the sales levels have come down, it's still solid. And in Europe, volumes have been relatively flat, but we have not seen any declines. So I think, overall, we're encouraged by what we've seen in the automotive market. But it is typically one that will react if things get -- if the consumer sentiment turns negative. So we're very watchful here. But right now, in the near term, we're encouraged. We do get some visibility and typically, if they do start cutting back on production levels, they don't do it immediately next week. It will be at the time of a traditional shutdown. But you usually have a couple of months to see that, and you'll see probably the impact before that in sales levels and the like."

I mean, you guys delivered 4 good quarters in a row of kind of double-digit operating margins in that business, and then they slipped back down to about a little bit over 8% in the September quarter. Was that entirely due to kind of volume declines and maintenance shutdowns that you have and we should expect you to return to double-digit operating profitability? Or has something changed in the industry, either from a demand side or the cost side where we should be looking at third quarter run rate as more typical?"

We incur additional maintenance costs as well as loss production. So we had 2 of those in the third quarter that had more of an impact. So I would expect that we would improve seasonally in the fourth quarter versus what we saw seasonally in the third quarter of 2011. But I would say, overall, the volumes are probably not quite as strong either in the fiberglass market and more or less stable at a low level in the flat glass market. So I would say we're not going to -- we don't expect any volume improvements. We'll have better costs, but that necessarily won't -- that will mean that things are going to fall somewhere between what we have seasonally in the fourth quarter and some of the weakness that you saw in the third quarter, if that's clear."

But most of that, or at least half of that, is pricing. So it looks like if you exclude kind of pricing and foreign exchange, that your SG&A is growing significantly faster than your revenue. Is that in building out some kind of investing ahead of the market recoveries in some markets? Or maybe becoming a little bit less restrictive as far as travel or show attendance or anything like that? Or kind of what's behind the faster ramp-up in SG&A costs, almost back to 2008 levels?"

And so in these cases, we have been working for the past several years across a broad array of suppliers, not only in TiO2, but in a lot of commodities in Asia because we've been experienced, up until the last quarter or so, inflation across the board. So if we were to use more TiO2 from the non-Western sources, most of this is sulfate technology that requires differences in processing, qualification, testing. So that's the reasons why these things are not -- from month-to-month, you can't change the suppliers to these new products, new technologies, new suppliers. So that's why you haven't seen as much substitution short term in the industry. Plus, when things tightened up in the first half, there wasn't a financial incentive to utilize these products more broadly. Now I think you're going to -- that's opened up the opportunity, but it will still take some time in our formulations, in processing, in working with the customers where we do need broader discussions or approvals to change raw materials.

Now we're hopeful that if the growth rates do moderate, or if some of the opportunities for these smaller companies to go to the IPO or secondary exchanges at high valuations, we hope that this will open things up, and we'll have more attractive valuations in these markets. But right now, I would say we haven't seen a lot of acquisition activity in the industry. And we didn't see it as much in '08 and '09 either, because the industry actually held up fairly well. So it's unclear to me whether these moderating growth rates will cause a lot more M&A activity. I think you just have to work all of the possibilities and the companies and find situations where the owners feel that their longer-term are better off in part of a bigger company than going independently.
