Harris’s second quarter results were excellent with contributions from all of operating segments. RF communications posted strong international growth.
Government communication systems showed continued stability with better than industry average margins. And we saw good improvement in Broadcast Communication results.
I am please to report that the previously announced Schlumberger’s Global Connectivity Services acquisition is still expected to close in our third fiscal quarter. 
GCS-add scale to our global managed satellite communications services business, expands our global footprint and further diversifies the company into faster-growing markets.  When combined with the previous acquired CapRock Communications business, this merger will create exciting new channels to provide Harris Assured Communications solutions to both government and commercial customers alike.”
Our consolidated revenue in the second quarter was $1.44 billion. That was 18% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis when we adjust for the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased by a strong 9%.
Non-GAAP income, which exclude acquisition related costs was a $155 million in the second quarter or $1.20 per diluted share, that was a 12% compared with the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and also excluding acquisition related costs was $296 million in the quarter and a 11% increase compared to the prior year.
Consolidated orders in the second quarter were $1.41 billion, about even with the very strong $1.42 billion in the prior year quarter. Off course the prior year benefited significantly from tactical radio orders for MRAPs and M-ATVs for the U.S. Department of Defense. 
Second quarter revenue for the RF Communication segment was $545 million, 18% higher compared to the prior year. Operating income was $189 million and operating margin for the segment continued very strong at 35% due to favorable product mix and continuing operating efficiencies.
Second quarter orders for the RF segment were $391 million, segment backlog of $1.52 billion at the end of the quarter remains high and is expected to rise in the second half of our fiscal year thanks to several large multiyear contract wins that were awarded during and following the close of the quarter. These wins included the greater than $300 million international tactical radio contract. The province wide Alberta, Canada first responder program and the statewide Oregon Wireless interoperability network contract.
Tactical communications revenue was $426 million in the quarter; increasing 20% compared to the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong international deliveries on multiyear modernization programs for Pakistan, Australia and Iraq.
As well as an uptick in the U.S Department of Defense adoption of the company’s new line of Falcon III radios. These increases were partially offset by fewer radio deliveries for the military’s MRAP vehicles program. The remaining $80 million of the fiscal 2010 MRAP backlog was shipped during this quarter. And that compares to a $195 million in MRAP shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.
The positive note however is that even with this significant decline in MRAP deliveries we were able top more than take up the slack through higher shipments of our Falcon III radios such that the total US DoD revenue in the quarter actually increased year over year by 4%
Orders for tactical communications were $300 million in the quarter. The corresponding book to bill of 0.70 and compared to orders in the prior year of $554 million. Tactical communications backlog was a healthy $1.06 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect year end Tactical Commutations backlog to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range. So our U.S. Tactical Radio business remains healthy and is benefiting from strong customer demand for our next generation Falcon III Radios. These are being procured to address a wide range of applications for both ongoing operations as well communications modernization.
Our second quarter closed with a healthy U.S. opportunity pipeline of $1.2 billion. Orders in the U.S. market during the quarter included $24.5 million from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III handheld and vehicular tactical systems. $16 million from a DoD customer for development of a new waveform incorporated into the Harris Falcon III radios. $11 million for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. DoD for Falcon III hand held and vehicular tactical radio systems. $10.5 million from the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III wide band manpack radios. $5.5 million from the U.S. Marine Corp for Falcon III wide band vehicular radio systems and finally $5.5 million from the U.S. DoD for Falcon II tactical radios for use in MRAP vehicles.
Turning to international markets, orders in the second quarter increased significantly, driven by initial of over $100 million as part of our multiyear contract that exceeds $300 million for an unidentified international government customer.
Other international orders in the quarter included a $9 million order from Brazil to provide HF radio equipment and an $8 million order from Mexico for both, Falcon II and Falcon III radios.
A pipeline of international opportunities even with this order activity remained strong at $2 billion. We see tremendous future opportunities in the countries where we are already selling radios, including Iraq, Australia, Pakistan, Mexico and our latest, undisclosed international customer.
In the longer term, opportunities in these countries alone are about $1.5 billion, with about half of that value falling outside of our 15-month opportunity pipeline.
Our competitive position is as strong as ever. We continue to invest to meet the evolving needs of the war fighter at an affordable cost.Our Falcon III Handheld continues to be the most widely deployed JTRS approved radio.
Our Falcon III 117G manpac is being deployed in increasing numbers by all branches of the U.S. armed forces (Inaudible) secured wide band networking connectivity. This connectivity is enabling a host of new applications, including biometrics, tactical trap, and the broader dissemination of live ISR video to greatly enhance the mission effectiveness of our forces on the battlefield.
Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $119 million in the second quarter. That was a 10% increase over the prior year. Although the constrained state and local spending environment is not recovering as fast as we had previously expected, we continue to see modest growth in both, revenue and earnings this year in a flat-to-declining market.
Recent major awards and the eventual pickup of the state and local market as a result of an improving economy should help drive faster growth next fiscal year in the Public Safety business.
Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the second quarter were $91 million. And they included a $15 million order from Monterey County, California to design and deploy a new public safety radio system. The new system will improve coverage, reliability and communication interoperability between local, county, state and federal First Responders and a $7 million order from Dayton Power & Light Company for M22 OpenSky communication system to manage both voice and data traffic.
In addition, this communication system will include our new SG5300 data-only radio, which is used in smart grid data applications. It’s important to note that after the close of the quarter, Harris was selected by the State of Oregon as the radio system and service provider for the Oregon Wireless Interoperability Network, also known as OWIN.
The state of Oregon awarded Harris this 10-year price agreement requirements contract. The contract vehicle will be used by State and local agencies to purchase public safety, communication systems, radios and related equipment and is expected to have a total value of more than $100 million.
So to summarize the RF segment; a strong backlog, the announced new business wins, a robust opportunity pipeline and our continued excellent progress in fielding the Falcon III family radios are all expected in to contribute and result in a strong fiscal 2011 and to support sustained earnings in fiscal 2012.
Revenue in the Government Communication System segment was $776 million in the second quarter. That was 20% higher compared with the prior year. Organic revenue growth excluding acquisitions was about 3% in the quarter. 
Revenue growth was driven by contributions from the July 2010 acquisition of CapRock Communications, by the GOES-R Ground segment program, the expansion of the GOES-R program to include the Ground antenna component and our Healthcare solutions and IT Services businesses.
The segment experienced revenue decline on several classified programs and as expected a $20 million year-over-year revenue decline related to the wide down of the 2010 census program. This program will be completely finished by the end of our fiscal year.
Non GAAP segment operation income in the second quarter was $86 million; and operating margin was strong at 11%. This compares with non GAAP operating income of $88 million in the prior year quarter.
In the second quarter we achieved several significant program wins in this core business including a nine year potential $273 million Canadian follow-on contract from the government of Canada for the CF-18 optimized OWSS weapon system support program. Harris will provide engineering services to support fighter-aircraft avionic systems
Also a six year $80 million contract from a classified customer, a 30 month $42 million from Sierra Nevada Corporation to supply radar electronics for satellite that will provide military commanders in the field with timely, high-resolution radar imagery of the earth’s surface.
We also were awarded a four-year $19 million contract from the State of Florida, Agency for Healthcare Administration to implement a statewide health information exchange or HIE. They will improve the delivery and coordination of healthcare across the state.
And finally, $11 million contract from the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Authority to provide network security upgrades and expansion for the third busiest airport in the world.
Harris CapRock Communications contributed $96 million of revenue in the second quarter and was essentially flat with their prior year quarter. Revenue was higher in their Maritime, International Energy and U.S. government markets that was offset by lower indirect government revenue in the Middle East and the weaker U.S. energy market.
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and its impact on new drilling is now expected to result in more modest year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings at CapRock than originally forecasted. We believe however these headwinds will be short-lived. 
Significant new wins at CapRock in the quarter included an $80 million option year extension on the Defense Information Systems Network Access Transport Services contracts known as DATS with the Defense Information Systems Agency.
Also three contracts totaling $7 million from Intelligence Agency customers to provide satellite bandwidth logistics and related communication services, and a five year $6 million contract with Shahin, Brazil to provide data voice and internet service to three drilling ships operating in the Campos basin. 
Harris CapRock Communications was also named as one of the first government contractors added to the new sections of the General Service Administration’s, Federal Supply Schedule 70 IDIQ contract vehicle. This move provides government customers with additional access to our subscription services and least bandwidth.
Before leaving the Government Communication Systems segment, let me take a few minutes to talk about two of our key organic growth initiatives going forward.Healthcare Solutions and Cyber Integrated Solutions. 
Our Healthcare Solutions business continues to grow and is expected to now reach over $100 million in revenue this year at about 10% operating margins. We continue to win new government contracts, such as the previously mentioned $19 million project for the State of Florida. We've also been working on some key partnerships to assist us in pursuing additional commercial healthcare opportunities. We’ll talk to you more about those partnerships and our strategy at our Investor Day in March.
We’ll also talk a lot about our new Cyber Integrated Solutions business at the upcoming Investor Day. We will complete the initial build out of our Cyber Integrations Center located in Harrisonburg, Virginia around the end of this quarter and we will begin to offer our trusted Enterprise Cloud Hosting Services. We’ve accelerated our investments in this business in fiscal 2011 to take advantage of our proprietary security technology and systems architecture as well as to take advantage of the accelerated depreciation tax credits.
Fiscal 2011 capital expenditures for the Cyber Integration Center are now expected to be about $120 million and we are absorbing about $20 million in operating losses for this business within the segment P&L.
We are currently finalizing a multi-million dollar service contract with a blue chip launch customer which will extend over multiple years. We’ll talk more about that at the Investor Day. We remain very confident that our cyber business will be a significant contributor to revenue and earnings growth in the future as we offer a differentiated trusted cloud computing environment to host customer data and their applications.
In the Broadcast Communications segment, revenue in the second quarter grew 11% to $130 million compared with the prior-year quarter of $117 million. The segment operating loss was $1 million compared with $5 million in the prior year and including $1 million of charges in both quarters for cost-reduction actions. Orders in the quarter $134 million, compared with the prior year of $139 million and $135 million in the first quarter. We saw a number of encouraging signs in our business. We accomplished year-over-year revenue growth , a book-to-bill of greater than one for the second quarter in a row and operating results nearing breakeven.
Major order in the quarter broadcast included a $4 million order from Mustafa Sultan Security company following a competitive procurement for the built-out of a video distribution network in the country of Oman. This represents the first order for a new Selenio [ph] baseband and IP networking product line.
We also received a $4 million order from CTV Television in Canada for television transmitters. This is the first major purchase of Harris transmitters by CTV and represents a significant commitment and validation of our new UHF and VHF product platforms. And finally a $3 million order from Vitatech SA in Argentina for transmitters, encoders, multiplexers and our navigator software to support their role of DTV services throughout the country.
With that let me now ask Harris CFO Garry McArthur to comment on our financial results in the quarter.

We continue to operate from a very solid financial base. As of quarter end we had $741 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility and all of our $300 million 364",449,"Thank you Howard. We continue to operate from a very solid financial base. As of quarter end we had $741 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility and all of our $300 million 364 day revolving credit facility available.
In the second quarter we generated $94 million of operating cash flow bringing our cash flow from operations for the first sis months of this fiscal year to $389 million; well ahead of the cash flow operation for the first six months of last year of $321 million. All three operating segments generated positive cash flow in the quarter.
Based on our strong first half results, we are increasing our guidance for cash flow from operation from a range of $775 million to $825 million to an new range of $800 million to $850 million. 
During the quarter we issued $400 million of 10 year term debt at the coupon of 4.4%, $300 million of 30 year term debt at a coupon of 6.15% and paid-off substantially all of the commercial paper issued in conjunction with the acquisition of CapRock Communications.
Our current plan is to use available cash on hand for the acquisition of Schlumberger GCS which is expected to close in the third quarter. By the way none of our guidance as provided in the earnings release or this call includes the expected financial results of Schlumberger GCS. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $49 million as compared to the $39 million in the second quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2011 are unchanged to $205 million to $215 million.
Capital expenditures were $67 million for the second quarter as compared to $22 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. We have increased our fiscal year 2011 CapEx guidance from our previous range of $250 million to $275 million to a new range of $320 million to $340 million. The increase is primarily related to accelerating the build out of our cyber integration center and other growth initiatives.
During the second quarter, Congress extended the R&D tax credit with its catch-up effect impacting the quarter favorably by $0.05 per diluted share. Though not in the second quarter guidance we provided as we chose not to guess when Congress would enact this legislation, it was included in our annual guidance and has no impact on our expected full year effective tax rate that remains at 33.5%.
Finally, we bought back $50 million of outstanding common stock at an average price $4.13 and we have 350 million remaining in authorization under our share repurchase program. Back to you Howard.

As we turn to outlook we are maintaining our previous financial guidance for fiscal 2011 with some ups and downs in the individual segments as compared to our previous outlook. Consolidated revenue is still expected to be at the high end",616,"Thank you, Gary. As we turn to outlook we are maintaining our previous financial guidance for fiscal 2011 with some ups and downs in the individual segments as compared to our previous outlook. Consolidated revenue is still expected to be at the high end of the range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 15% above fiscal 2010.
Non-GAAP income excluding acquisition related cost is still expected to be in a range from $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%.
Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; again excluding acquisition related costs, is now expected to be in a range of $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion, representing an EBITDA increase of 11% to 13% above fiscal 2010 and $10 million above our previous guidance range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion.
For RF Communication segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is now expected to be 9% to 10% higher than fiscal 2010, and this is slightly lower as a result of slower growth in Public Safety and Professional Communications, partially offset by stronger than expected Tactical Communications revenue.
However, segment operating margin for the year is now expected to be higher, at about 32% in the back half of the year and between 34% and 35% for the full-year as a result of product mix and operating efficiency.
For the Government Communications Systems segment, we now expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 21% higher in fiscal 2010.
The core government systems and services revenue is still expected to be very strong at 6% to 8%, even in the face of the U.S. budget continuing resolution.
We have reduced expected revenue contribution from the CapRock Communications acquisition, to a range of $360 million to $370 million.
Overall segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 10.5% for the fiscal year, as a result of slightly lower CapRock revenue and the accelerated investment in our Cyber Integrated Solutions business.
And for the Broadcast Communication segment, we now expect revenue in a range of $520 million to $540 million, that’s 7% to 11% higher than fiscal 2010 results with breakeven operating results.
I remain optimistic about our ability to achieve revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012 and we will discuss our strategy in more detail at our March Investor Day, which I hope you can all join.
But for now, let me take a minute and give you some takeaways. We believe our core government systems and services business should continue to outperform its peers. As a result in past program wins and strong program execution.
Our core RF Tactical Communication business is seeing strong international demand and the increasing adoption of our commercial business model with the U.S. Department of Defense versus the JTRS programs in record.
We’re seeing improving economy that will provide healthier state and local budgets and along with our recently announced major program wins contract revenue and profit growth in our Public Safety & Professional Communications business.
Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to resume and international energy markets are very robust. Our international position will be further enhanced by the pending acquisition of Schlumberger’s Global Connectivity Services business where we’ll create a global leader in managed satellite services for the energy, maritime and government markets.
Our broadcast communications business performance has improved and offers the opportunity to contribute to future earnings growth and lastly our continued investments in attractive adjacent growth markets including healthcare and cyber integrated solutions should provide a robust funnel of new opportunities for revenue and profit growth going forward.

First of all, remember we've got three businesses. Two of them make up what we call the Core Tactical Communications business, the DoD part and the International part, and then the third piece being our Public Safety and Professional Communications business. So, let me just talk very briefly to each one of those, recognizing that we’re very early and we are not giving any specific guidance. 
In the DoD part, we certainly expect that sequentially, revenue in '12 will be lower than '11 and that’s based on the wind down of the MRAP program. We are very pleased with the growth that we had outside of MRAP. But we don’t see another big MRAP program coming there. We expect that’s going to be lower but still very, very significant. 
Offsetting that decline, though, will be continued growth we believe based on the orders and the opportunity pipeline in international. So, we expect international to drive higher revenue than '11 and offset decline in the DoD piece. And then we certainly expect a significant growth in the public safety business and profit increase as a result of the higher revenue.
So, net net, when I add all of that together, we would say, our current perspective, given that we are long away from fiscal year 2012, is that we can see a path to higher revenue in the segment and sustainable earnings in the segment, assuming everything that we assume plays out as advertised. So, we think that’s a very good prognosis for the RF segment. We certainly don’t see any kind of a major drop-off in that segment in profitability in fiscal year ‘12 based on the current assumptions we’re using.

I think the pricing for that very, very complex and expensive radio system has caused DoD to want to go in a different direction and to field more affordable radios that can be distributed down ashalone [ph].
Clearly Harris is participating in that decision and I see us as benefiting as a result of what our Falcon III is doing in the field. With regard to any other specifics to the HMS program, I don’t really know anything new. Again, none of those radios for the programs of record are in any kind of limited production. There’s still in the engineering and test phase to the best of my knowledge.
We are still the only ones that are fielding radios that are doing what the troops needed to do today which is take advantage of the wide band networking. As you know, we are incorporating the SRW waveform into the Falcon Radios. We are augmenting that with our existing ANW II Harris waveform for wideband networking.
We continue to offer that waveform to the DoD, should they want to establish it in the library [ph] as a standard. And just, bottom line, we continue to gain momentum and credibility as each quarter goes by and we are seeing that in the orders. I think the other thing on Falcon III to note is the up tick in the international.
We’re now up to something like I think it’s 20 or more international countries have taken their initial deliveries of Falcon III and as you’ve heard this talk before to me, this is the beginning of a wave that will not only continue in the U.S. but then will be picked up and adopted in these international countries and Falcon III is not involved in all of those international contracts and programs that I'm talking about. It is in Australia for example that was one of the reasons I think we won that one but again many of the other countries will still be deploying Falcon II radios and we’ll have the opportunity down range for Falcon III upgrades.
We also continue to have a lot of success with our secure personal radios, this is the smaller-form-factor radio we’re marketing internationally and I think now we’re up to over 35 international countries that have taken additional initial deliveries on the SPR. So lots of momentum in both Falcon III adoption in domestically as well as internationally with Falcon III and the SPR.

I will tell that we’ll talk about this certainly in March as we cover strategy at the investor meeting.

And our RF segment, international Tactical radios and the systems they are part of as well as Public Safety I think have excellent growth prospects.
DoD as I already have said we expect to be lower in ‘12 than ‘11, but that’s a lower as in zero; its lower, still a very healthy level and one that I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be able to sustain for the go forward.

So it’s not a new investments but it’s doing it this fiscal year rather than next fiscal year.
We believe we have a significantly differentiated solution as relates the security, how we handle that and how we manage the architecture, the system to really make this a trusted cloud computing environment. And as a result we made the decision to invest sooner, both in capital as well as in operating expense and people to get organized, to ramp up that business and that has created a larger CapEx in fiscal 2011. Garry included in his guidance now the total, the largest amount of that delta was the acceleration of about $50 million from next year into this year for the cyber center.
The second element is acceleration to people and yes in what I said about $20 million of operating loss in this fiscal year, in our current guidance buried within the overall segment and that number is larger than we would have expected a couple of quarters ago because we’re pulling in the people and we’ll start taking some depreciation and amortization on the CapEx. So we think this is a great business opportunity and we believe it was prudent to make those investments now rather than to wait six months and that’s kind of the story.

Your first question was around products versus services. Clearly, our business model in the CapRock and Schlumberger GCS is to offer managed service and that is a certain commitment to a service level agreement, certain commitment to bandwidth connectivity, a certain lists of services for a fixed price on a monthly and annual basis in contracts. There are some product sales that are a part of that but our preference is to really deploy the whole thing and give the customer one-price tag on a monthly or annual basis for the services they want and let us worry about all of the equipment and details required to provide that.
That also gives us the ability then with that fixed price. We’ve locked in the cost of the space segment. We have an opportunity to our efficiencies and scale economies to improve margins. So that’s our preferred model. Do we sometimes sell products? Yes. But the predominant is the services and that’s true both in the government and the energy and the maritime pieces that make up their business.
With regard to your second question, certainly it’s a very fragmented market, we made two major acquisitions, there maybe opportunities down the road to do others, but you shouldn’t look for us to be doing anything major in this segment of the kind of scale we’ve just done for a while. We want to integrate what we have, this really is a merger if you think about it. Harris had a maritime communications business, we’ve now acquired back in July the CapRock communications business and now we are acquiring Schlumberger’s GCS business.
So, Peter Shaper who leaves this group is really focused on putting all of these together with the right organization, the right global footprint and the most efficient operating processes. So we won’t let that get done before we would bring any more into the mix, so I suspect that’s a couple of years down the road, Mark.

Harris' second quarter results were excellent, with contributions from our all of our operating segments. RF Communications posted strong international growt",2385,"Thank you, Pam, and I want to welcome all of you to our Second Quarter Fiscal 2011 Earnings Call. Harris' second quarter results were excellent, with contributions from our all of our operating segments. RF Communications posted strong international growth. Government Communications Systems showed continued stability with better-than-industry average margins, and we saw good improvement in Broadcast Communications results. 
  
  I'm pleased to report that the previously announced Schlumberger's Global Connectivity Services acquisition is still expected to close on our third fiscal quarter. GCS adds scaled to our global managed satellite communication services business, expands our global footprint and further diversifies the company in the faster-growing markets. When combined with the previously acquired CapRock communications business, this merger will create exciting new channels to provide Harris assured communications solutions to both government and commercial customers alike. 
  
  Our consolidated revenue in the second quarter was $1.44 billion. That was 18% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis, when we adjust for the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased by a strong 9%. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related cost, was $155 million in the second quarter or $1.20 per diluted share. That was an increase of 12% compared with the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and also excluding acquisition-related cost was $296 million in the quarter, an 11% increase compared to the prior year.
  
  Consolidated orders in the second quarter were $1.41 billion, about even with a very strong $1.42 billion in the prior year quarter. Of course, the prior year benefited significantly from tactical radio orders for MRAPs and M-ATVs for the U.S. Department of Defense. 
  
  Second quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $545 million, 18% higher compared to the prior year. Operating income was $189 million, and operating margin for the segment continued very strong at 35% due to favorable product mix and continuing operating efficiencies. 
  
  Second quarter orders for the RF segment were $391 million. Segment backlog of $1.52 billion at the end of the quarter remains high and is expected to rise in the second half of our fiscal year. Thanks to several large multi-year contract wins that were awarded during and following the close of the quarter. These wins included the greater than $300 million international Tactical Radio contract, the province-wide Alberta, Canada first responder program and the statewide Oregon Wireless Interoperability Network contract. 
  
  Tactical Communications revenue was $426 million in the quarter, increasing 20% compared to the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong international deliveries on multi-year modernization programs for Pakistan, Australia and Iraq, as well as an uptick in the U.S. Department of Defense adoption of the company's new line of Falcon III radios. These increases were partially offset by fewer radio deliveries for the military's MRAP vehicles program. The remaining $80 million of the fiscal 2010 MRAP backlog was shipped during this quarter, and that compares to $195 million in MRAP shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The positive note, however, is that even with this significant decline in MRAP deliveries, we were able to more than take up the slack through higher shipments of our Falcon III radios such that the total U.S. DoD revenue in the quarter actually increased year-over-year by 4%.
  
  Orders for Tactical Communications were $300 million in the quarter, with the corresponding book to bill of 0.70 and compared to the orders are prior year of $554 million. Tactical Communications backlog was a healthy $1.06 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect year end Tactical Communications backlog to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range. So our U.S. Tactical Radio business remains healthy and is benefiting from strong customer demand for our next-generation Falcon III radios. These are being procured to address a wide range of applications for both ongoing operations, as well as communications modernization. Our second quarter closed with a healthy U.S. opportunity pipeline of $1.2 billion.
  
  Orders in the U.S. market during the quarter included $24.5 million from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III handheld and vehicular tactical radio systems; $16 million from a DoD customer for development of a new wave form to be incorporated into the Harris Falcon III radios; $11 million from the U.S. Air Force and U.S. DoD for Falcon III handheld and vehicular tactical radio systems; $10.5 million from the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III wideband manpack radios; $5.5 million from the U.S. Marine Corps for Falcon III wideband vehicular radio systems; and finally, $5.5 million from the U.S. DoD for Falcon II tactical radios for use in MRAP vehicles.
  
  Turning to international markets. Orders in the second quarter increased significantly, driven by an initial order of over $100 million as part of a multi-year contract that exceeds $300 million for an unidentified international government customer. Other international wins in the quarter included a $9 million order from Brazil to provide HF radio equipment and an $8 million order from Mexico for both Falcon II and Falcon III radios. Our pipeline of international opportunities, even with this order activity, remains strong at $2 billion. We see tremendous future opportunities in the countries where we're already selling radios, including Iraq, Australia, Pakistan, Mexico and our latest undisclosed international customer. In the longer term, opportunities in these countries alone are about $1.5 billion, with about half of that value falling outside of our 15-month opportunity pipeline.
  
  Our competitive position is as strong as ever. We continued to invest to meet the evolving needs of the war fighter at an affordable cost. Our Falcon III handheld continues to be the most widely deployed JTRS approved radio, and our Falcon III 117G manpack is being deployed in increasing numbers by all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. We're providing secured wideband networking connectivity. This connectivity is enabling a hosted new applications, including biometrics, tactical chat and a broader dissemination of live ISR video to greatly enhance the mission-effectiveness of our forces on the battlefield. 
  
  Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $119 million in the second quarter. That was a 10% increase over the prior year. Although the constraints at state and local spending environment is not recovering as fast as we have previously expected, we continue to see modest growth in both revenue and earnings this year in a flat to declining market. Recent major awards and the eventual pickup of the state and local market as a result of an improving economy should help drive faster growth next fiscal year in the Public Safety business.
  
  Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the second quarter were $91 million, and they included a $15 million order from Monterrey County, California to design and deploy a new public safety radio system. The new system will improve coverage, reliability and communications interoperability between local, county, state and federal first responders; and a $7 million order from Dayton Power and Light Company for a 22-site open sky communication system to manage both voice and data traffic. In addition, this communication system will include our new SG 5300 data-only radio, which is used in smart grid data applications. 
  
  It's important to note that after the close of the quarter, Harris was selected by the state of Oregon as the radio system and service provider for the Oregon Wireless Interoperability Network, also known as OWIN. The State of Oregon awarded Harris this ten-year price agreement requirements contract. The contract vehicle will be used by state and local agencies to purchase public safety, communication systems, radios and related equipments and is expected to have a total value of more than $100 million.
  
  So to summarize the RF segment. A strong backlog, we announced new business wins, a robust opportunity pipeline and our continued excellent progress in fielding the Falcon III family radios are all expected to contribute and result in a strong fiscal 2011 and to support sustained earnings in fiscal 2012.
  
  Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $776 million in the second quarter. That was 20% higher compared with the prior year. Organic revenue growth, excluding acquisitions, was about 3% in the quarter. Revenue growth was driven by contributions from the July 2010 acquisition of CapRock Communications by the GOES-R ground segment program. The expansion of the GOES-R program to include the ground and tenet component and/or healthcare solutions and IT services businesses. The segment experienced revenue declines on several classified programs and as expected, a $20 million year-over-year revenue decline related to the wind-down of the 2010 Census program. This program will be completely finished by the end of our fiscal year.
  
  Non-GAAP segment operating income in the second quarter was $86 million, and operating margin was strong at 11%. This compares with non-GAAP operating income of $88 million in the prior year quarter. 
  
  In the second quarter, we achieved several significant program wins in this core business, including a nine-year potential $273 million Canadian follow-on contract from the government of Canada for the CF-18 optimized weapon system support program. Harris will provide engineering services to support fighter aircraft avionics systems; also, a six-year $80 million contract from a classified customer; a 30-month $42 million contract from Sierra Nevada Corporation to supply radar electronics for a satellite that will provide military commanders in the field with timely high-resolution radar imagery of the Earth's surface.
  
  We also were awarded a four-year $19 million contract from the State of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration to implement a statewide health information exchange or HIE that will improve the delivery and coordination of health care across the state; and finally, an $11 million contract from the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport authority to provide network security upgrades and expansion for the third busiest airport in the world. 
  
  Harris CapRock Communications contributed $96 million of revenue in the second quarter and was essentially flat with their prior year quarter. Revenue was higher in their maritime, international energy and U.S. Government markets but was offset by lower indirect government revenue in the Middle East and the weaker U.S. energy market. The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and its impact on the drilling is now expected to result in more modest year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings at CapRock than originally forecasted. We believe, however, these headwinds will be short-lived.
  
  Significant new wins at CapRock in the quarter included an $80 million option year extension on the defense information systems, network access transport services contract known as DATS with the defense information systems agency; also three contracts totaling $7 million from intelligence agency customers to provide satellite bandwidth, logistics and related communications services; and a five-year $6 million contract with Shajin [ph] Brazil to provide data, voice and Internet services to three drilling ships operating in the compost basin.
  
  Harris CapRock mitigations was also named as one of the first government contractors added to the new sections of the General Service Administration's federal supply schedule 70 ID/IQ contract vehicle. This move provides government customers with additional access to our subscription services and least bandwidth. 
  
  Before leaving the Government Communication System segment, let me take a few minutes to talk about two of our key organic growth initiatives going forward: healthcare solutions and cyber-integrated solutions. Our healthcare solutions business continues to grow and is expected now to reach over $100 million in revenue this year at about 10% operating margins. We continue to win new government contracts such as the previously mentioned $19 million project with the State of Florida. We've also been working on some key partnerships to assist us in pursuing additional commercial healthcare opportunities. We'll talk to you more about those partnerships and our strategy at our Investor Day in March. 
  
  We'll also talk a lot about our new cyber integrated solutions business at the upcoming Investor Day. We will complete the initial buildout of our cyber integration center located in Harrisburg, Virginia around the end of this quarter, and we will begin to offer our trusted enterprise cloud hosting services. We have accelerated our investments in this business in fiscal 2011 to take advantage of our proprietary, security technology and systems architecture, as well as to take advantage of the accelerated depreciation tax credits.
  
  Fiscal 2011 capital expenditures for the cyber integration center are now expected to be about $120 million, and we are absorbing about $20 million in operating losses for this business within the segment P&L. We're currently finalizing a multi-million dollars service contract with a blue-chip launch customer, which will extend over multiple years, and we'll talk more about that at the Investor Day. We remain very confident that our cyber business will be a significant contributor to revenue and earnings growth in the future as we offer a differentiated trusted cloud computing environment to host customer data and their applications.
  
  In the Broadcast Communications segment, revenue in the second quarter grew 11% to $130 million compared with the prior year quarter of $117 million. The segment operating loss was $1 million compared with $5 million in the prior year. And including $1 million of charges in both quarters of production cost reduction actions. Orders in the quarter were $134 million compared with the prior year of $139 million and $135 million in the first quarter. 
  
  We saw a number of encouraging signs in our business. We've accomplished year-over-year revenue growth, a book-to-bill of greater than one for the second quarter in a row and operating results nearing break-even. Major orders in the quarter at Broadcast included a $4 million order from Mustafa Sultan Security Co. Following a competitive for a buildout of video distribution network in the country of Oman. This represents the first order for our new silentio baseband and IP networking product line. 
  
  We also received a $4 million order from CTV Television in Canada for television transmitters. This is the first major purchase of Harris transmitters by CTV and represents a significant commitment and validation of our new UHF and VHF product platforms; and finally, a $3 million order from Viditec S.A. in Argentina for transmitters, encoders, multiplexers and our navigator software to support their rollout of DTV services throughout the country.
  
  With that, let me now ask Harris' CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on our financial results in the quarter."
177934,117293163,96108,"Harris Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Howard. We continue to operate from a very solid financial base. As of quarter end, we had $741 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility and all of our $300 million 36",456,"Thank you, Howard. We continue to operate from a very solid financial base. As of quarter end, we had $741 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility and all of our $300 million 364-day revolving credit facility available. In the second quarter, we generated $94 million of operating cash flow, bringing our cash flow from operations for the first six months of this fiscal year to $389 million, well ahead of the cash flow from operations for the first six months of last year of $321 million. All three operating segments generated positive cash flow in the quarter.
  
  Based on our strong first half results, we are increasing our guidance from cash flow from operation from a range of $775 million to $825 million to a new range of $800 million to $850 million. During the quarter, we issued $400 million of 10-year term debt at a coupon of 4.4%, $300 million of 30-year term debt at a coupon of 6.15% and paid off substantially all of the commercial paper issued in conjunction with the acquisition of CapRock Communications. Our current plan is to use available cash on hand for the acquisition of Schlumberger GCS, which is expected to close in the third quarter. 
  
  By the way, none of our guidance, as provided in the earnings release or this call, includes the expected financial results of Schlumberger GCS. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $49 million as compared to $39 million in the second quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2011 are unchanged at $205 million to $215 million.
  
  Capital expenditures were $67 million for the second quarter as compared to $22 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. We have increased our fiscal year 2011 CapEx guidance from our previous range of $250 million to $275 million to our new range of $320 million to $340 million. The increase is primarily related to accelerating the buildout of our cyber integration center and other growth initiatives. 
  
  During the second quarter, Congress extended the R&D tax credit with this catch-up effect impacting the quarter favorably by $0.05 per diluted share. Though not in the second quarter guidance we provided as we chose not to guess when Congress would enact this legislation, it was included in our annual guidance and has no impact on our expected full year effective tax rate that remains at 33.5%. 
  
  Finally, we bought back $50 million of our outstanding common stock at an average price of $46.13. And as of the end of the second quarter, we have $350 million remaining authorization under our share repurchase program. 
  
  Back to you, Howard."
177934,117293163,96108,"Harris Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. As we turn to the video outlook, we're maintaining our previous financial guidance for fiscal 2011 with some ups and downs in the individual segments as compared to our previous outlook.     Consolidated revenue is still expected to b",612,"Thank you, Gary. As we turn to the video outlook, we're maintaining our previous financial guidance for fiscal 2011 with some ups and downs in the individual segments as compared to our previous outlook. 
  
  Consolidated revenue is still expected to be at the high-end of the range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 15% above fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs is still expected to be in a range from $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization again, excluding acquisition-related cost, is now expected to be in a range of $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion, representing an EBITDA increase of 11% to 13% above fiscal 2010 and $10 million above our previous guidance range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion. 
  
  For RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is now expected to be 9% to 10% higher than fiscal 2010, and this is slightly lower as a result of slower growth in Public Safety and Professional Communications, partially offset by stronger-than-expected Tactical Communications revenue. However, segment operating margin for the year is now expected to be higher at about 32% in the back half of the year and between 34% and 35% for the full year as a result of product mix and operating efficiencies.
  
  For the Government Communications System segment, we now expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 21% higher than fiscal 2010. The core government systems and services revenue is still expected to be very strong at 68% even in the face of the U.S. budget continuing resolution. We have reduced the expected revenue contribution from the CapRock Communications acquisition to a range of $360 million to $370 million. Overall segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 10.5% for the fiscal year as a result of slightly lower CapRock revenue and accelerated investments in our cyber integrated solutions business. 
  
  And for the Broadcast Communications segment, we now expect revenue to range of $520 million to $540 million. That's 7% to 11% higher than fiscal 2010 results with break-even operating results.
  
  I remain optimistic about our ability to achieve revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012, and we will discuss our strategy in more detail at our March Investor Day, which I hope you can all join. But for now, let me take a minute and give you some takeaways. We believe our core government systems and services business should continue to outperform its peers as a result of past program wins and strong program execution. Our core RF Tactical Communications business is seeing strong international demand and the increasing adoption of our commercial business model with the U.S. Department of Defense versus the JTRS programs of record. We see an improving economy that will provide healthier state and local budgets, and along with our recently announced major program wins, we'll drive revenue and profit growth in our Public Safety and Professional Communications business. Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to resume, and international energy markets are very robust. 
  
  Our international position will be further enhanced by the pending acquisition of Schlumberger's Global Connectivity Services business where we'll create a global leader in managed satellite services for the energy, maritime and government markets. Our Broadcast Communications business performance has improved and offers the opportunity to contribute to furniture earnings growth. 
  
  And lastly, our continued investments in attractive adjacent growth markets, including healthcare and cyber integrated solutions should provide a robust funnel of new opportunities for revenue and profit growth going forward.
  
  At this time, I'll ask the operator to open the lines, and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

About half of that is included in the $2 billion pipeline of opportunities that we talked about when we say international. The other half of that would be sitting out beyond 15 months so it would be tail-end of fiscal '12 or more likely fiscal '13. All of this is intended to give you a level of comfort that on these large international multi-year modernization programs, we're awarded the program, sometimes an umbrella contract such as the undisclosed country contract we just talked about, and then we get the actual orders over a period of quarters or years.

First of all, remember, we've got three businesses. Two of them make up what we call the core tactical communications business with the DoD part and the international part, and then the third piece of being our Public Safety and Professional Communications business. So let me just talk very briefly to each one of those, recognizing that we're very early and we're not giving any specific guidance. In the DoD part, we certainly expect that sequentially, revenue in '12 will be lower than '11, and that's based on the wind-down of the MRAP program. We are very pleased with the growth we had outside of MRAP but we don't see another big MRAP program coming there. We expect that's going to be lower but still very, very significant. Offsetting that decline, though, will be continued growth we believe based on the orders and the opportunity pipeline in international. So we expect international to drive higher revenue than '11 and to offset a decline in the DoD piece. And then we certainly expect a significant growth in the Public Safety business and profit increase as a result of the higher revenue. So net-net, when I add all that together, we could say our current perspective, given that we are a long ways from fiscal year '12, is we can see a path to higher revenue in this segment and sustainable earnings in the segment assuming everything that we assume plays out as advertised. So we think that's a very good prognosis for the RF segment. We certainly don't see any kind of a major drop-off in that segment in profitability in fiscal year '12 based on the current assumptions we're using."

GMR, as I understand it, is going to be funded on a very limited basis going forward, a feel that I think to one combat team only on a very limited basis. I think the pricing for that very, very complex and expensive radio system has caused DoD to want to go into different direction and to feel the more affordable radios that can be distributed down echelon. Really, Harris is participating in that decision, and I see us as benefiting as a result of what our Falcon III is doing in the field. With regard to any other specifics to the HMS program, I don't really know anything new. Again, none of those radios for the programs of record are in any kind of limited production. They're still in the engineering and test phase, best of my knowledge. We're still the only ones that are fielding radios that are doing with the troops needed to do today, which is take advantage of the wideband networking. As you know, we're incorporating the SRW waveform into the Falcon radios. We're augmenting that with our existing A&W2 Harris waveform for wideband networking. We continue to offer that waveform to the DoD should they want to establish it in the libraries of standard. And just bottom line, we continue to gain momentum and credibility as each quarter goes by, and we're seeing that in the orders. I think the other thing on Falcon III to note is the uptake in international. We're now up to something like I think it's 20 or more international countries have taken their initial deliveries of Falcon III, and as you've heard us talk before to me, this is the beginning of the way that will not only continue in the U.S. but then will be picked up and adopted in these international countries. And Falcon III is not involved in all of those international contracts and programs that I'm talking about. It is in Australia, for example. That was one of the reasons I think we won that one. But again, many of the other countries will still be deploying Falcon II radios, and we'll have the opportunity down range for Falcon III upgrades. We also continue to have a lot of success with our secure personnel radio. This is the smaller form factor radio we're marketing internationally. And I think now we're up to over 35 international countries that have taken initial deliveries on the SPR. So lots of momentum in both Falcon III adoption domestically, as well as internationally with Falcon III and the SPR."

We see this though as again we have lost any market share. I think this is an intermediate kind of slowdown. Some of those rigs are no longer in the Gulf. They're now off the West Coast of Africa. they're in Brazil. They're going Asia Pacific, and so we really are going to benefit from having this global footprint.

And that has created a larger CapEx in fiscal '11. Gary included in his guidance now the total. The largest amount of that delta was the acceleration of about $50 million from next year into this year for the cyber center. The second element is the acceleration of the people, and yes, and what I said about $20 million of operating loss in this fiscal year in our current guidance buried within the overall segment, and that number is larger than we would've expected a couple of quarters ago because we're pulling in the people and we'll start taking some depreciation and amortization on the CapEx.

But I feel pretty comfortable in saying our positioning should allow us to outperform the peer group, whether on an absolute basis we like that or not, it all remains to be seen. I guess what to me is I guess we have to continue to work hard in communicating because to take the mix of business that Harris has and where we're investing and what our portfolio looks like going forward and lump us together with prime DoD contractors to me is just doesn't make a lot of sense. We'll be talking a lot about that in the March Analyst Meeting. This company going forward is much better positioned because of where we are in government and DoD, where we are in our international programs and where we are with a number of these initiatives that are driving commercial markets in energy, healthcare and allowing us to take to these commercial markets what we already do very well and very credibly in the government space. So hopefully over time, we'll be able to distance ourselves from the pack, not because they aren't good companies, but because they aren't serving the same markets going forward as we are."

Your first question was around products versus services. Clearly, our business model in both CapRock and Schlumberger GCS has offered managed services and that is in a certain commitment to a service level agreement, certain commitment to bend within productivity, so the list of services for a fixed price on a monthly and annual basis in contracts. There are some product sales that are part of that, but our preference is to really deploy the whole thing and give the customer one price tag on a monthly or annual basis for the services they want and let us worry about all of the equipment and details required to provide that. That also gives us the ability that with that fixed price, we've locked in to the cost of the space segment. We have an opportunity for our efficiencies and scale economies to improve margins. So that's our preferred model. Do we sometimes sell products? Yes, but the predominant is services, and that's true both in the government and the energy and the maritime pieces that make up that business. With regard to your second question, certainly, it's a very fragmented market. We've made two major acquisitions. There may be opportunities down the road to do others, but you shouldn't look for us to be doing anything major in this segment of the kind of scale we've just done for a while. We want to integrate what we have. This really is a merger if you think about -- Harris had our maritime communications business. We've now acquired back in July that CapRock Communications business, and now we're acquiring Schlumberger's GCS business so Peter shaper, who leads that group, is really focused on putting all of these together with the right organization, the right global footprint and the most efficient operating processes. So we want to look and get that done before we bring any more into the mix. So I suspect that's a couple of years down the road, Mark."

And I want to welcome all of you to our second quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call. Harris' second quarter results were excellent, with contributions from all of our operating segments.

Harris' second quarter results were excellent, with contributions from all of our operating segments. RF Communications posted strong international growth. Government Communications Systems showed continued stability with better-than-industry-average margins. And we saw good improvement in Broadcast Communications results. 
I'm pleased to report that the previously announced Schlumberger's Global Connectivity Services acquisition is still expected to close in our third fiscal quarter. GCS adds scale to our Global Managed Satellite Communication Services business, expands our global footprint and further diversifies the company in the faster-growing markets. When combined with the previously acquired CapRock Communications business, this merger will create exciting new channels to provide Harris assured communications solutions to both government and commercial customers alike. 
Our consolidated revenue in the second quarter was $1.44 billion. That was 18% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis, when we adjust for the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased by a strong 9%. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related cost, was $155 million in the second quarter or $1.20 per diluted share. That was an increase of 12% compared with the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and also excluding acquisition-related cost was $296 million in the quarter, an 11% increase compared to the prior year.
Consolidated orders in the second quarter were $1.41 billion, about even with the very strong $1.42 billion in the prior year quarter. Of course, the prior year benefited significantly from tactical radio orders for MRAPs and M-ATVs for the U.S. Department of Defense. 
Second quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $545 million, 18% higher compared to the prior year. Operating income was $189 million, and operating margin for the segment continued very strong at 35% due to favorable product mix and continuing operating efficiencies. 
Second quarter orders for the RF segment were $391 million. Segment backlog of $1.52 billion at the end of the quarter remains high and is expected to rise in the second half of our fiscal year. Thanks to several large multi-year contract wins that were awarded during and following the close of the quarter. These wins included the greater than $300 million international Tactical Radio contract, the province-wide Alberta, Canada, First Responder program and the statewide Oregon Wireless Interoperability Network contract. 
Tactical Communications revenue was $426 million in the quarter, increasing 20% compared to the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong international deliveries on multi-year modernization programs for Pakistan, Australia and Iraq, as well as an uptick in the U.S. Department of Defense adoption of the company's new line of Falcon III radios. These increases were partially offset by fewer radio deliveries for the military's MRAP vehicles program. The remaining $80 million of the fiscal 2010 MRAP backlog was shipped during this quarter. And that compares to $195 million in MRAP shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The positive note, however, is that even with this significant decline in MRAP deliveries, we were able to more than take up the slack through higher shipments of our Falcon III radios such that the total U.S. DoD revenue in the quarter actually increased year-over-year by 4%.
Orders for Tactical Communications were $300 million in the quarter, with the corresponding book-to-bill of 0.70 and compared to orders in the prior year of $554 million. Tactical Communications backlog was a healthy $1.06 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect year end Tactical Communications backlog to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range. So our U.S. Tactical Radio business remains healthy and is benefiting from strong customer demand for our next-generation Falcon III radios. These are being procured to address a wide range of applications for both ongoing operations, as well as communications modernization. Our second quarter closed with a healthy U.S. opportunity pipeline of $1.2 billion.
Orders in the U.S. market during the quarter included $24.5 million from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III handheld and vehicular tactical radio systems; $16 million from a DoD customer for development of a new wave form to be incorporated into the Harris Falcon III radios; $11 million from the U.S. Air Force and U.S. DoD for Falcon III handheld and vehicular tactical radio systems; $10.5 million from the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III wideband manpack radios; $5.5 million from the U.S. Marine Corps for Falcon III wideband vehicular radio systems; and finally, $5.5 million from the U.S. DoD for Falcon II tactical radios for use in MRAP vehicles.
Turning to international markets. Orders in the second quarter increased significantly, driven by an initial order of over $100 million as part of a multiyear contract that exceeds $300 million for an unidentified international government customer. Other international wins in the quarter included a $9 million order from Brazil to provide HF radio equipment and an $8 million order from Mexico for both Falcon II and Falcon III radios. Our pipeline of international opportunities, even with this order activity, remains strong at $2 billion. We see tremendous future opportunities in the countries where we're already selling radios, including Iraq, Australia, Pakistan, Mexico and our latest undisclosed international customer. In the longer term, opportunities in these countries alone are about $1.5 billion, with about half of that value falling outside of our 15-month opportunity pipeline.
Our competitive position is as strong as ever. We continue to invest to meet the evolving needs of the war fighter at an affordable cost. Our Falcon III handheld continues to be the most widely deployed JTRS approved radio, and our Falcon III 117G manpack is being deployed in increasing numbers by all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. We're providing secure wideband networking connectivity. This connectivity is enabling a host of new applications, including biometrics, tactical chat and a broader dissemination of live ISR video to greatly enhance the mission effectiveness of our forces on the battlefield. 
Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $119 million in the second quarter. That was a 10% increase over the prior year. Although the constraints at state and local spending environment is not recovering as fast as we had previously expected, we continue to see modest growth in both revenue and earnings this year in a flat to declining market. Recent major awards and the eventual pickup of the state and local market as a result of an improving economy should help drive faster growth next fiscal year in the Public Safety business.
Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the second quarter were $91 million. And they included a $15 million order from Monterey County, California, to design and deploy a new public safety radio system. The new system will improve coverage, reliability and communications interoperability between local, county, state and federal first responders; and a $7 million order from Dayton Power and Light Company for a 22-site open sky communication system to manage both voice and data traffic. In addition, this communications system will include our new SG5300 data-only radio, which is used in Smart Grid data applications. 
It's important to note that after the close of the quarter, Harris was selected by the state of Oregon as the radio system and service provider for the Oregon Wireless Interoperability Network, also known as OWIN. The State of Oregon awarded Harris this ten-year price agreement requirements contract. The contract vehicle will be used by state and local agencies to purchase public safety, communications systems, radios and related equipments and is expected to have a total value of more than $100 million.
So to summarize the RF segment. A strong backlog, we announced new business wins, a robust opportunity pipeline and our continued excellent progress in fielding the Falcon III family radios are all expected to contribute and result in a strong fiscal 2011 and to support sustained earnings in fiscal 2012.
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $776 million in the second quarter. That was 20% higher compared with the prior year. Organic revenue growth, excluding acquisitions, was about 3% in the quarter. Revenue growth was driven by contributions from the July 2010 acquisition of CapRock Communications by the GOES-R Ground Segment program, the expansion of the GOES-R program to include the ground and tenet component and/or healthcare solutions and IT services businesses. The segment experienced revenue declines on several classified programs and, as expected, a $20 million year-over-year revenue decline related to the wind down of the 2010 Census program. This program will be completely finished by the end of our fiscal year.
Non-GAAP segment operating income in the second quarter was $86 million. And operating margin was strong at 11%. This compares with non-GAAP operating income of $88 million in the prior year quarter. 
In the second quarter, we achieved several significant program wins in this core business, including a nine-year potential CAD $273 million follow-on contract from the government of Canada for the CF-18 Optimized Weapon System Support program. Harris will provide engineering services to support fighter aircraft avionics systems; also, a six-year $80 million contract from a classified customer; a 30-month $42 million contract from Sierra Nevada Corporation to supply radar electronics for a satellite that will provide military commanders in the field with timely, high-resolution radar imagery of the Earth's surface.
We also were awarded a four-year $19 million contract from the State of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration to implement a statewide health information exchange or HIE that will improve the delivery and coordination of health care across the state; and finally, an $11 million contract from the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport authority to provide network security upgrades and expansion for the third busiest airport in the world. 
Harris CapRock Communications contributed $96 million of revenue in the second quarter and was essentially flat with their prior year quarter. Revenue was higher in their maritime, international energy and U.S. Government markets, but was offset by lower indirect government revenue in the Middle East and the weaker U.S. energy market. The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and its impact on new drilling is now expected to result in more modest year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings at CapRock than originally forecasted. We believe, however, these headwinds will be short-lived.
Significant new wins at CapRock in the quarter included an $80 million option year extension on the Defense Information System Network Access Transport Services contract known as DATS with the Defense Information Systems Agency; also three contracts totaling $7 million from intelligence agency customers to provide satellite bandwidth, logistics and related communications services; and a five-year $6 million contract with Shajin [ph] Brazil to provide data, voice and Internet services to three drilling ships operating in the Campos Basin.
Harris CapRock Communications was also named as one of the first government contractors added to the new sections of the General Service Administration's federal supply schedule 70 IDIQ contract vehicle. This move provides government customers with additional access to our subscription services and leased bandwidth. 
Before leaving the Government Communication System segment, let me take a few minutes to talk about two of our key organic growth initiatives going forward: Healthcare Solutions and Cyber-integrated solutions. Our Healthcare Solutions business continues to grow and is expected to now reach over $100 million in revenue this year at about 10% operating margins. We continue to win new government contracts such as the previously mentioned $19 million project with the State of Florida. We've also been working on some key partnerships to assist us in pursuing additional commercial healthcare opportunities. We'll talk to you more about those partnerships and our strategy at our Investor Day in March. 
We'll also talk a lot about our new Cyber Integrated Solutions business at the upcoming Investor Day. We will complete the initial buildout of our Cyber Integration Center located in Harrisonburg, Virginia, around the end of this quarter, and we will begin to offer our trusted enterprise cloud hosting services. We have accelerated our investments in this business in fiscal 2011 to take advantage of our proprietary, security technology and systems architecture, as well as to take advantage of the accelerated depreciation tax credits.
Fiscal 2011 capital expenditures for the Cyber Integration Center are now expected to be about $120 million. And we are absorbing about $20 million in operating losses for this business within the segment P&L. We're currently finalizing a multi-million dollars service contract with a blue chip launch customer, which will extend over multiple years. We'll talk more about that at the Investor Day. We remain very confident that our Cyber business will be a significant contributor to revenue and earnings growth in the future, as we offer a differentiated trusted cloud computing environment to host customer data and their applications.
In the Broadcast Communications segment, revenue in the second quarter grew 11% to $130 million compared with the prior year quarter of $117 million. The segment operating loss was $1 million compared with $5 million in the prior year. And including $1 million of charges in both quarters for cost reduction actions. Orders in the quarter were $134 million compared with the prior year of $139 million and $135 million in the first quarter. 
We saw a number of encouraging signs in our business. We've accomplished year-over-year revenue growth, a book-to-bill of greater than one for the second quarter in a row and operating results nearing breakeven. Major orders in the quarter at Broadcast included a $4 million order from Mustafa Sultan Security Co. following a competitive for the buildout of video distribution network in the country of Oman. This represents the first order for our new Salanio [ph] Baseband and IP Networking product line. 
 
We also received a $4 million order from CTV Television in Canada for television transmitters. This is the first major purchase of Harris transmitters by CTV and represents a significant commitment and validation of our new UHF and VHF product platforms; and finally, a $3 million order from Viditec S.A. in Argentina for transmitters, encoders, multiplexers and our navigator software to support their rollout of DTV services throughout the country.
With that, let me now ask Harris' CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on our financial results in the quarter."
177934,117293163,96422,"Harris Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Howard. We continue to operate from a very solid financial base. As of quarter end, we had $741 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility and all of our $300 million 36",456,"Thank you, Howard. We continue to operate from a very solid financial base. As of quarter end, we had $741 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility and all of our $300 million 364-day revolving credit facility available. In the second quarter, we generated $94 million of operating cash flow, bringing our cash flow from operations for the first six months of this fiscal year to $389 million, well ahead of the cash flow from operations for the first six months of last year of $321 million. All three operating segments generated positive cash flow in the quarter.
Based on our strong first half results, we are increasing our guidance from cash flow from operation from a range of $775 million to $825 million to a new range of $800 million to $850 million. During the quarter, we issued $400 million of 10-year term debt at a coupon of 4.4%, $300 million of 30-year term debt at a coupon of 6.15% and paid off substantially all of the commercial paper issued in conjunction with the acquisition of CapRock Communications. Our current plan is to use available cash on hand for the acquisition of Schlumberger GCS, which is expected to close in the third quarter. 
By the way, none of our guidance, as provided in the earnings release or this call, includes the expected financial results of Schlumberger GCS. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $49 million as compared to $39 million in the second quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2011 are unchanged at $205 million to $215 million.
Capital expenditures were $67 million for the second quarter as compared to $22 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. We have increased our fiscal year 2011 CapEx guidance from our previous range of $250 million to $275 million to our new range of $320 million to $340 million. The increase is primarily related to accelerating the buildout of our cyber integration center and other growth initiatives. 
During the second quarter, Congress extended the R&D tax credit with this catch-up effect impacting the quarter favorably by $0.05 per diluted share. Though not in the second quarter guidance we provided, as we chose not to guess when Congress would enact this legislation, it was included in our annual guidance and has no impact on our expected full year effective tax rate that remains at 33.5%. 
Finally, we bought back $50 million of our outstanding common stock at an average price of $46.13. And as of the end of the second quarter, we have $350 million remaining authorization under our share repurchase program. 
Back to you, Howard."
177934,117293163,96422,"Harris Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. As we turn to the outlook, we're maintaining our previous financial guidance for fiscal 2011 with some ups and downs in the individual segments as compared to our previous outlook. Consolidated revenue is still expected to be at the hig",612,"Thank you, Gary. As we turn to the outlook, we're maintaining our previous financial guidance for fiscal 2011 with some ups and downs in the individual segments as compared to our previous outlook. 
Consolidated revenue is still expected to be at the high-end of the range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 15% above fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is still expected to be in a range from $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, again, excluding acquisition-related cost, is now expected to be in a range of $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion, representing an EBITDA increase of 11% to 13% above fiscal 2010 and $10 million above our previous guidance range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion. 
For RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is now expected to be 9% to 10% higher than fiscal 2010, and this is slightly lower as a result of slower growth in Public Safety and Professional Communications, partially offset by stronger-than-expected Tactical Communications revenue. However, segment operating margin for the year is now expected to be higher at about 32% in the back half of the year and between 34% and 35% for the full year as a result of product mix and operating efficiencies.
For the Government Communications System segment, we now expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 21% higher than fiscal 2010. The Core Government Systems and Services revenue is still expected to be very strong at 68% even in the face of the U.S. budget continuing resolution. We have reduced the expected revenue contribution from the CapRock Communications acquisition to a range of $360 million to $370 million. Overall segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 10.5% for the fiscal year as a result of slightly lower CapRock revenue and the accelerated investments in our Cyber Integrated Solutions business. 
And for the Broadcast Communications segment, we now expect revenue to range at $520 million to $540 million. That's 7% to 11% higher than fiscal 2010 results with break-even operating results.
I remain optimistic about our ability to achieve revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012. And we will discuss our strategy in more detail at our March Investor Day, which I hope you can all join. But for now, let me take a minute and give you some takeaways. We believe our Core Government Systems and Services business should continue to outperform its peers as a result of past program wins and strong program execution. Our core RF Tactical Communications business is seeing strong international demand and the increasing adoption of our commercial business model with the U.S. Department of Defense versus the JTRS programs of record. We see an improving economy that will provide healthier state and local budgets. And along with our recently announced major program wins, we'll drive revenue and profit growth in our Public Safety and Professional Communications business. Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to resume, and international energy markets are very robust. 
Our international position will be further enhanced by the pending acquisition of Schlumberger's Global Connectivity Services business, where we'll create a global leader in managed satellite services for the energy, maritime and government markets. Our Broadcast Communications business performance has improved and offers the opportunity to contribute to future earnings growth. 
And lastly, our continued investments in attractive, adjacent growth markets, including Healthcare and Cyber Integrated solutions should provide a robust funnel of new opportunities for revenue and profit growth going forward.

About half of that is included in the $2 billion pipeline of opportunities that we talked about when we say international. The other half of that would be sitting out beyond 15 months, so it would be tail end of fiscal '12 or more likely fiscal '13. All of this is intended to give you a level of comfort that on these large international multi-year modernization programs, we're awarded the program, sometimes an umbrella contract such as the undisclosed country contract we just talked about, and then we get the actual orders over a period of quarters or years.

First of all, remember, we've got three businesses. Two of them make up what we call the Core Tactical Communications business, the DoD part and the international part, and then the third piece of being our Public Safety and Professional Communications business. So let me just talk very briefly to each one of those, recognizing that we're very early, and we're not giving any specific guidance. In the DoD part, we certainly expect that, sequentially, revenue in '12 will be lower than '11. And that's based on the wind down of the MRAP program. We are very pleased with the growth that we had outside of MRAP. But we don't see another big MRAP program coming there. We expect that's going to be lower, but still very, very significant. Offsetting that decline, though, will be continued growth, we believe, based on the orders and the opportunity pipeline in international. So we expect international to drive higher revenue than '11 and to offset a decline in the DoD piece. And then we certainly expect significant growth in the Public Safety business and profit increase as a result of the higher revenue. So net-net, when I add all that together, we would say our current perspective, given that we are a long ways from fiscal year '12, is we can see a path to higher revenue in the segment and sustainable earnings in the segment assuming everything that we assume plays out as advertised. So we think that's a very good prognosis for the RF segment. We certainly don't see any kind of a major drop-off in that segment in profitability in fiscal year '12 based on the current assumptions we're using."

GMR, as I understand, it is going to be funded on a very limited basis going forward, fielded, I think, to one brigade combat team only on a very limited basis. I think the pricing for that very, very complex and expensive radio system has caused DoD to want to go a different direction and to feel the more affordable radios that can be distributed down echelon. Clearly, Harris is participating in that decision, and I see us as benefiting as a result of what our Falcon III is doing in the field. With regard to any other specifics to the HMS program, I don't really know anything new. Again, none of those radios for the programs of record are in any kind of limited production. They're still in the engineering and test phase, best of my knowledge. We're still the only ones that are fielding radios that are doing what the troops needed to do today, which is take advantage of the wideband networking. As you know, we're incorporating the SRW waveform into the Falcon radios. We're augmenting that with our existing A&W2 Harris waveform for wideband networking. We continue to offer that waveform to the DoD should they want to establish it in the libraries of standard. And just bottom line, we continue to gain momentum and credibility as each quarter goes by, and we're seeing that in the orders. I think the other thing on Falcon III to note is the uptake in international. We're now up to something like I think it's 20 or more international countries have taken their initial deliveries of Falcon III. And as you've heard us talk before, to me, this is the beginning of a wave that will not only continue in the U.S., but then will be picked up and adopted in these international countries. And Falcon III is not involved in all of those international contracts and programs that I'm talking about. It is in Australia, for example. That was one of the reasons, I think, we won that one. But again, many of the other countries will still be deploying Falcon II radios, and we'll have the opportunity down range for Falcon III upgrades. We also continue to have a lot of success with our secure personnel radio. This is the smaller form factor radio we're marketing internationally. And I think now we're up to over 35 international countries that have taken initial deliveries on the SPR. So lots of momentum in both Falcon III adoption domestically, as well as internationally with Falcon III and the SPR."

We believe we have a significantly differentiated solution as it relates to security, how we handle that and how we manage the architecture of the system to really make this a trusted cloud computing environment. And as a result, we made the decision to invest sooner, both in capital, as well as in operating expense and people to get organized, to ramp up that business. And that has created a larger CapEx in fiscal '11. Gary included in his guidance now the total. The largest amount of that delta was the acceleration of about $50 million from next year into this year for the cyber center. The second element is the acceleration of the people. And yes, and what I said about $20 million of operating loss in this fiscal year in our current guidance buried within the overall segment, and that number is larger than we would've expected a couple of quarters ago because we're pulling in the people, and we'll start taking some depreciation and amortization on the CapEx.

What exactly our growth rate will be in fiscal '12 over '11 remains to be communicated. But I feel pretty comfortable in saying our positioning should allow us to outperform the peer group. Whether on an absolute basis we like that or not, it all remains to be seen. I guess we have to continue to work hard on communicating because to take the mix of business that Harris has and where we're investing and what our portfolio looks like going forward and lump us together with prime DoD contractors to me is -- it just doesn't make a lot of sense. We'll be talking a lot about that in the March Analyst Meeting. This company, going forward, is much better positioned because of where we are in government and DoD, where we are in our international programs and where we are with a number of these initiatives that are driving commercial markets in energy, healthcare and allowing us to take to these commercial markets what we already do very well and very credibly in the government space.

Clearly, our business model in both CapRock and Schlumberger GCS is to offer managed services. And that is a certain commitment to a service level agreement, certain commitment to bandwidth and connectivity, a certain list of services for a fixed price on a monthly and annual basis in contracts. There are some product sales that are part of that, but our preference is to really deploy the whole thing and give the customer one price tag on a monthly or annual basis for the services they want and let us worry about all of the equipment and details required to provide that. That also gives us the ability that with that fixed price, we've locked in the cost of the space segment. We have an opportunity through our efficiencies and scale economies to improve margins. So that's our preferred model. Do we sometimes sell products? Yes, but the predominant is the services. And that's true both in the government and the energy and the maritime pieces that make up that business. With regard to your second question, certainly, it's a very fragmented market. We've made two major acquisitions. There may be opportunities down the road to do others, but you shouldn't look for us to be doing anything major in this segment of the kind of scale we've just done for a while. We want to integrate what we have. This really is a merger, if you think about it. Harris had our Maritime Communications business. We've now acquired back in July the CapRock Communications business. And now we're acquiring Schlumberger's GCS business. So Peter Shaper, who leads that group, is really focused on putting all of these together with the right organization, the right global footprint and the most efficient operating processes. So we want to let that get done before we would bring any more into the mix. So I suspect that's a couple of years down the road, Mark."

Harris' second quarter results were excellent, with contributions from all of our operating segments. RF Communications posted strong international growth. Government Communications Systems showed continued stability with better-than-industry-average margins. And we saw good improvement in Broadcast Communications results. 
  
  I'm pleased to report that the previously announced Schlumberger's Global Connectivity Services acquisition is still expected to close in our third fiscal quarter. GCS adds scale to our Global Managed Satellite Communication Services business, expands our global footprint and further diversifies the company in the faster-growing markets. When combined with the previously acquired CapRock Communications business, this merger will create exciting new channels to provide Harris assured communications solutions to both government and commercial customers alike. 
  
  Our consolidated revenue in the second quarter was $1.44 billion. That was 18% higher than the prior year. On an organic basis, when we adjust for the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased by a strong 9%. Non-GAAP income, which excludes acquisition-related cost, was $155 million in the second quarter or $1.20 per diluted share. That was an increase of 12% compared with the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and also excluding acquisition-related cost was $296 million in the quarter, an 11% increase compared to the prior year.
  
  Consolidated orders in the second quarter were $1.41 billion, about even with the very strong $1.42 billion in the prior year quarter. Of course, the prior year benefited significantly from tactical radio orders for MRAPs and M-ATVs for the U.S. Department of Defense. 
  
  Second quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $545 million, 18% higher compared to the prior year. Operating income was $189 million, and operating margin for the segment continued very strong at 35% due to favorable product mix and continuing operating efficiencies. 
  
  Second quarter orders for the RF segment were $391 million. Segment backlog of $1.52 billion at the end of the quarter remains high and is expected to rise in the second half of our fiscal year thanks to several large multi-year contract wins that were awarded during and following the close of the quarter. These wins included the greater than $300 million international Tactical Radio contract, the province-wide Alberta, Canada, First Responder program and the statewide Oregon Wireless Interoperability Network contract. 
  
  Tactical Communications revenue was $426 million in the quarter, increasing 20% compared to the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by strong international deliveries on multi-year modernization programs for Pakistan, Australia and Iraq, as well as an uptick in the U.S. Department of Defense adoption of the company's new line of Falcon III radios. These increases were partially offset by fewer radio deliveries for the military's MRAP vehicles program. The remaining $80 million of the fiscal 2010 MRAP backlog was shipped during this quarter. And that compares to $195 million in MRAP shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The positive note, however, is that even with this significant decline in MRAP deliveries, we were able to more than take up the slack through higher shipments of our Falcon III radios such that the total U.S. DoD revenue in the quarter actually increased year-over-year by 4%.
  
  Orders for Tactical Communications were $300 million in the quarter, with the corresponding book-to-bill of 0.70 and compared to orders in the prior year of $554 million. Tactical Communications backlog was a healthy $1.06 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect year end Tactical Communications backlog to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range. So our U.S. Tactical Radio business remains healthy and is benefiting from strong customer demand for our next-generation Falcon III radios. These are being procured to address a wide range of applications for both ongoing operations, as well as communications modernization. Our second quarter closed with a healthy U.S. opportunity pipeline of $1.2 billion.
  
  Orders in the U.S. market during the quarter included $24.5 million from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III handheld and vehicular tactical radio systems; $16 million from a DoD customer for development of a new wave form to be incorporated into the Harris Falcon III radios; $11 million from the U.S. Air Force and U.S. DoD for Falcon III handheld and vehicular tactical radio systems; $10.5 million from the U.S. Department of Defense for Falcon III wideband manpack radios; $5.5 million from the U.S. Marine Corps for Falcon III wideband vehicular radio systems; and finally, $5.5 million from the U.S. DoD for Falcon II tactical radios for use in MRAP vehicles.
  
  Turning to international markets. Orders in the second quarter increased significantly, driven by an initial order of over $100 million as part of a multiyear contract that exceeds $300 million for an unidentified international government customer. Other international wins in the quarter included a $9 million order from Brazil to provide HF radio equipment and an $8 million order from Mexico for both Falcon II and Falcon III radios. Our pipeline of international opportunities, even with this order activity, remains strong at $2 billion. We see tremendous future opportunities in the countries where we're already selling radios, including Iraq, Australia, Pakistan, Mexico and our latest undisclosed international customer. In the longer term, opportunities in these countries alone are about $1.5 billion, with about half of that value falling outside of our 15-month opportunity pipeline.
  
  Our competitive position is as strong as ever. We continue to invest to meet the evolving needs of the war fighter at an affordable cost. Our Falcon III handheld continues to be the most widely deployed JTRS approved radio, and our Falcon III 117G manpack is being deployed in increasing numbers by all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. Where it's providing secure wideband networking connectivity. This connectivity is enabling a host of new applications, including biometrics, tactical chat and a broader dissemination of live ISR video to greatly enhance the mission effectiveness of our forces on the battlefield. 
  
  Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $119 million in the second quarter. That was a 10% increase over the prior year. Although the constraints at state and local spending environment is not recovering as fast as we had previously expected, we continue to see modest growth in both revenue and earnings this year in a flat to declining market. Recent major awards and the eventual pickup of the state and local market as a result of an improving economy should help drive faster growth next fiscal year in the Public Safety business.
  
  Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the second quarter were $91 million. And they included a $15 million order from Monterey County, California, to design and deploy a new public safety radio system. The new system will improve coverage, reliability and communications interoperability between local, county, state and federal first responders; and a $7 million order from Dayton Power and Light Company for a 22-site open sky communication system to manage both voice and data traffic. In addition, this communications system will include our new SG5300 data-only radio, which is used in Smart Grid data applications. 
  
  It's important to note that after the close of the quarter, Harris was selected by the state of Oregon as the radio system and service provider for the Oregon Wireless Interoperability Network, also known as OWIN. The State of Oregon awarded Harris this ten-year price agreement requirements contract. The contract vehicle will be used by state and local agencies to purchase public safety communications systems, radios and related equipment and is expected to have a total value of more than $100 million.
  
  So to summarize the RF segment. A strong backlog, we announced new business wins, a robust opportunity pipeline and our continued excellent progress in fielding the Falcon III family radios are all expected to contribute and result in a strong fiscal 2011 and to support sustained earnings in fiscal 2012.
  
  Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $776 million in the second quarter. That was 20% higher compared with the prior year. Organic revenue growth, excluding acquisitions, was about 3% in the quarter. Revenue growth was driven by contributions from the July 2010 acquisition of CapRock Communications by the GOES-R Ground Segment program, the expansion of the GOES-R program to include the ground and tenet component and our healthcare solutions and IT services businesses. The segment experienced revenue declines on several classified programs and, as expected, a $20 million year-over-year revenue decline related to the wind down of the 2010 Census program. This program will be completely finished by the end of our fiscal year.
  
  Non-GAAP segment operating income in the second quarter was $86 million. And operating margin was strong at 11%. This compares with non-GAAP operating income of $88 million in the prior year quarter. 
  
  In the second quarter, we achieved several significant program wins in this core business, including a nine-year potential CAD $273 million follow-on contract from the government of Canada for the CF-18 Optimized Weapon System Support program. Harris will provide engineering services to support fighter aircraft avionics systems; also, a six-year $80 million contract from a classified customer; a 30-month $42 million contract from Sierra Nevada Corporation to supply radar electronics for a satellite that will provide military commanders in the field with timely, high-resolution radar imagery of the Earth's surface.
  
  We also were awarded a four-year $19 million contract from the State of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration to implement a statewide health information exchange or HIE that will improve the delivery and coordination of health care across the state; and finally, an $11 million contract from the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport authority to provide network security upgrades and expansion for the third busiest airport in the world. 
  
  Harris CapRock Communications contributed $96 million of revenue in the second quarter and was essentially flat with their prior year quarter. Revenue was higher in their maritime, international energy and U.S. Government markets, but was offset by lower indirect government revenue in the Middle East and the weaker U.S. energy market. The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and its impact on new drilling is now expected to result in more modest year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings at CapRock than originally forecasted. We believe, however, these headwinds will be short-lived.
  
  Significant new wins at CapRock in the quarter included an $80 million option year extension on the Defense Information System Network Access Transport Services contract known as DATS with the Defense Information Systems Agency; also three contracts totaling $7 million from intelligence agency customers to provide satellite bandwidth, logistics and related communications services; and a five-year $6 million contract with Schahin [ph] Brazil to provide data, voice and Internet services to three drilling ships operating in the Campos Basin.
  
  Harris CapRock Communications was also named as one of the first government contractors added to the new sections of the General Service Administration's federal supply schedule 70 IDIQ contract vehicle. This move provides government customers with additional access to our subscription services and leased bandwidth. 
  
  Before leaving the Government Communication System segment, let me take a few minutes to talk about two of our key organic growth initiatives going forward: Healthcare Solutions and Cyber-integrated solutions. Our Healthcare Solutions business continues to grow and is expected to now reach over $100 million in revenue this year at about 10% operating margins. We continue to win new government contracts such as the previously mentioned $19 million project with the State of Florida. We've also been working on some key partnerships to assist us in pursuing additional commercial healthcare opportunities. We'll talk to you more about those partnerships and our strategy at our Investor Day in March. 
  
  We'll also talk a lot about our new Cyber Integrated Solutions business at the upcoming Investor Day. We will complete the initial buildout of our Cyber Integration Center located in Harrisonburg, Virginia, around the end of this quarter, and we will begin to offer our trusted enterprise cloud hosting services. We have accelerated our investments in this business in fiscal 2011 to take advantage of our proprietary, security technology and systems architecture, as well as to take advantage of the accelerated depreciation tax credits.
  
  Fiscal 2011 capital expenditures for the Cyber Integration Center are now expected to be about $120 million. And we are absorbing about $20 million in operating losses for this business within the segment P&L. We're currently finalizing a multi-million dollars service contract with a blue chip launch customer, which will extend over multiple years. We'll talk more about that at the Investor Day. We remain very confident that our Cyber business will be a significant contributor to revenue and earnings growth in the future, as we offer a differentiated trusted cloud computing environment to host customer data and their applications.
  
  In the Broadcast Communications segment, revenue in the second quarter grew 11% to $130 million compared with the prior year quarter of $117 million. The segment operating loss was $1 million compared with $5 million in the prior year. And including $1 million of charges in both quarters for cost reduction actions. Orders in the quarter were $134 million compared with the prior year of $139 million and $135 million in the first quarter. 
  
  We saw a number of encouraging signs in our business. We've accomplished year-over-year revenue growth, a book-to-bill of greater than one for the second quarter in a row and operating results nearing breakeven. Major orders in the quarter at Broadcast included a $4 million order from Mustafa Sultan Security Co. following a competitive procurement for the buildout of a video distribution network in the country of Oman. This represents the first order for our new Selenio [ph] Baseband and IP Networking product line. 
   
  We also received a $4 million order from CTV Television in Canada for television transmitters. This is the first major purchase of Harris transmitters by CTV and represents a significant commitment and validation of our new UHF and VHF product platforms; and finally, a $3 million order from Viditec S.A. in Argentina for transmitters, encoders, multiplexers and our navigator software to support their rollout of DTV services throughout the country.
  
  With that, let me now ask Harris' CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on our financial results in the quarter."
177934,117293163,96505,"Harris Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Howard. We continue to operate from a very solid financial base. As of quarter end, we had $741 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility and all of our $300 million 36",456,"Thank you, Howard. We continue to operate from a very solid financial base. As of quarter end, we had $741 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $720 million available under our $750 million revolving credit facility and all of our $300 million 364-day revolving credit facility available. In the second quarter, we generated $94 million of operating cash flow, bringing our cash flow from operations for the first six months of this fiscal year to $389 million, well ahead of the cash flow from operations for the first six months of last year of $321 million. All three operating segments generated positive cash flow in the quarter.
  
  Based on our strong first half results, we are increasing our guidance for cash flow from operation from a range of $775 million to $825 million to a new range of $800 million to $850 million. During the quarter, we issued $400 million of 10-year term debt at a coupon of 4.4%, $300 million of 30-year term debt at a coupon of 6.15% and paid off substantially all of the commercial paper issued in conjunction with the acquisition of CapRock Communications. Our current plan is to use available cash on hand for the acquisition of Schlumberger GCS, which is expected to close in the third quarter. 
  
  By the way, none of our guidance, as provided in the earnings release or this call, includes the expected financial results of Schlumberger GCS. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $49 million as compared to $39 million in the second quarter of the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2011 are unchanged at $205 million to $215 million.
  
  Capital expenditures were $67 million for the second quarter as compared to $22 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. We have increased our fiscal year 2011 CapEx guidance from our previous range of $250 million to $275 million to our new range of $320 million to $340 million. The increase is primarily related to accelerating the buildout of our cyber integration center and other growth initiatives. 
  
  During the second quarter, Congress extended the R&D tax credit with this catch-up effect impacting the quarter favorably by $0.05 per diluted share. Though not in the second quarter guidance we provided, as we chose not to guess when Congress would enact this legislation, it was included in our annual guidance and has no impact on our expected full year effective tax rate that remains at 33.5%. 
  
  Finally, we bought back $50 million of our outstanding common stock at an average price of $46.13. And as of the end of the second quarter, we have $350 million remaining authorization under our share repurchase program. 
  
  Back to you, Howard."
177934,117293163,96505,"Harris Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. As we turn to the outlook, we're maintaining our previous financial guidance for fiscal 2011 with some ups and downs in the individual segments as compared to our previous outlook.     Consolidated revenue is still expected to be at t",613,"Thank you, Gary. As we turn to the outlook, we're maintaining our previous financial guidance for fiscal 2011 with some ups and downs in the individual segments as compared to our previous outlook. 
  
  Consolidated revenue is still expected to be at the high-end of the range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, about 15% above fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is still expected to be in a range from $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, again, excluding acquisition-related cost, is now expected to be in a range of $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion, representing an EBITDA increase of 11% to 13% above fiscal 2010 and $10 million above our previous guidance range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion. 
  
  For RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 revenue is now expected to be 9% to 10% higher than fiscal 2010, and this is slightly lower as a result of slower growth in Public Safety and Professional Communications, partially offset by stronger-than-expected Tactical Communications revenue. However, segment operating margin for the year is now expected to be higher at about 32% in the back half of the year and between 34% and 35% for the full year as a result of product mix and operating efficiencies.
  
  For the Government Communications System segment, we now expect revenue for fiscal 2011 to be 20% to 21% higher than fiscal 2010. The Core Government Systems and Services revenue is still expected to be very strong at 68% even in the face of the U.S. budget continuing resolution. We have reduced the expected revenue contribution from the CapRock Communications acquisition to a range of $360 million to $370 million. Overall segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 10.5% for the fiscal year as a result of slightly lower CapRock revenue and the accelerated investments in our Cyber Integrated Solutions business. 
  
  And for the Broadcast Communications segment, we now expect revenue in a range at $520 million to $540 million. That's 7% to 11% higher than fiscal 2010 results with break-even operating results.
  
  I remain optimistic about our ability to achieve revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012. And we will discuss our strategy in more detail at our March Investor Day, which I hope you can all join. But for now, let me take a minute and give you some takeaways. We believe our Core Government Systems and Services business should continue to outperform its peers as a result of past program wins and strong program execution. Our core RF Tactical Communications business is seeing strong international demand and the increasing adoption of our commercial business model with the U.S. Department of Defense versus the JTRS programs of record. We see an improving economy that will provide healthier state and local budgets. And along with our recently announced major program wins, we'll drive revenue and profit growth in our Public Safety and Professional Communications business. Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to resume, and international energy markets are very robust. 
  
  Our international position will be further enhanced by the pending acquisition of Schlumberger's Global Connectivity Services business, where we'll create a global leader in managed satellite services for the energy, maritime and government markets. Our Broadcast Communications business performance has improved and offers the opportunity to contribute to future earnings growth. 
  
  And lastly, our continued investments in attractive, adjacent growth markets, including Healthcare and Cyber Integrated solutions should provide a robust funnel of new opportunities for revenue and profit growth going forward.
  
  At this time, I'll ask the operator to open the line, and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

So in those five or six countries that we mentioned, there's about $1.5 billion of total program value that we believe we will receive. About half of that is included in the $2 billion pipeline of opportunities that we talk about when we say international. The other half of that would be sitting out beyond 15 months, so it would be tail end of fiscal '12 or more likely fiscal '13. All of this is intended to give you a level of comfort that on these large international multi-year modernization programs, we're awarded the program, sometimes an umbrella contract such as the undisclosed country contract we just talked about, and then we get the actual orders over a period of quarters or years.

First of all, remember, we've got three businesses. Two of them make up what we call the Core Tactical Communications business, the DoD part and the international part, and then the third piece being our Public Safet",286,"Well, let's talk about the RF segment. First of all, remember, we've got three businesses. Two of them make up what we call the Core Tactical Communications business, the DoD part and the international part, and then the third piece being our Public Safety and Professional Communications business. So let me just talk very briefly to each one of those, recognizing that we're very early, and we're not giving any specific guidance. In the DoD part, we certainly expect that, sequentially, revenue in '12 will be lower than '11. And that's based on the wind down of the MRAP program. We are very pleased with the growth that we had outside of MRAP. But we don't see another big MRAP program coming there. We expect that's going to be lower, but still very, very significant. Offsetting that decline, though, will be continued growth, we believe, based on the orders and the opportunity pipeline in international. So we expect international to drive higher revenue than '11 and to offset a decline in the DoD piece. And then we certainly expect significant growth in the Public Safety business and profit increase as a result of the higher revenue. So net-net, when I add all that together, we would say our current perspective, given that we are a long ways from fiscal year '12, is we can see a path to higher revenue in the segment and sustainable earnings in the segment assuming everything that we assume plays out as advertised. So we think that's a very good prognosis for the RF segment. We certainly don't see any kind of a major drop-off in that segment in profitability in fiscal year '12 based on the current assumptions we're using."

And the rest of it would be then outside of that business that will come into the pipeline as we move into say fiscal year '13. I think the bottom line is how our momentum in international is really significant both in terms of the timing of these orders and the scale of the opportunities.

GMR, as I understand it, is going to be funded on a very limited basis going forward, fielded, I think, to one brigade combat team only on a very limited basis. I think the pricing for that very, very complex and expensive radio system has caused DoD to want to go a different direction and to field the more affordable radios that can be distributed down echelon. Clearly, Harris is participating in that decision, and I see us as benefiting as a result of what our Falcon III is doing in the field. With regard to any other specifics to the HMS program, I don't really know anything new. Again, none of those radios for the programs of record are in any kind of limited production. They're still in the engineering and test phase, best of my knowledge. We're still the only ones that are fielding radios that are doing what the troops need it to do today, which is take advantage of the wideband networking. As you know, we're incorporating the SRW waveform into the Falcon radios. We're augmenting that with our existing A&W2 Harris waveform for wideband networking. We continue to offer that waveform to the DoD should they want to establish it in the libraries of standard. And just bottom line, we continue to gain momentum and credibility as each quarter goes by, and we're seeing that in the orders. I think the other thing on Falcon III to note is the uptake in international. We're now up to something like I think it's 20 or more international countries have taken their initial deliveries of Falcon III. And as you've heard us talk before, to me, this is the beginning of a wave that will not only continue in the U.S., but then will be picked up and adopted in these international countries. And Falcon III is not involved in all of those international contracts and programs that I'm talking about. It is in Australia, for example. That was one of the reasons, I think, we won that one. But again, many of the other countries will still be deploying Falcon II radios, and we'll have the opportunity down range for Falcon III upgrades. We also continue to have a lot of success with our Secure Personal Radio. This is the smaller form factor radio we're marketing internationally. And I think now we're up to over 35 international countries that have taken initial deliveries on the SPR. So lots of momentum in both Falcon III adoption domestically, as well as internationally with Falcon III and the SPR."

We're going to benefit from that with the new Schlumberger acquisition, which is 90-plus percent international in its revenue make up and where they go to market. So that's going to be a positive. We see this, though, as again -- we haven't lost any market share. I think this is an intermediate kind of slowdown. Some of those rigs are no longer in the Gulf. They're now off the West Coast of Africa. They're in Brazil. They're going to Asia Pacific. And so we really are going to benefit from having this global footprint.

DoD, as I already have said, we expect to be lower in '12 than '11 but that's not lower as in zero. It's lower, still a very healthy level and one that I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to sustain for the go forward.

And that has created a larger CapEx in fiscal '11. Gary included in his guidance now the total. The largest amount of that delta was the acceleration of about $50 million from next year into this year for the cyber center. The second element is the acceleration of the people. And yes, and what I said about $20 million of operating loss in this fiscal year in our current guidance buried within the overall segment, and that number is larger than we would've expected a couple of quarters ago because we're pulling in the people, and we'll start taking some depreciation and amortization on the CapEx.

I think the whole industry certainly will see fewer new programs started. We've talked about that before. I don't think that's a surprise. What exactly our growth rate will be in fiscal '12 over '11 remains to be communicated. But I feel pretty comfortable in saying our positioning should allow us to outperform the peer group. Whether on an absolute basis we like that or not, it all remains to be seen. I guess we have to continue to work hard on communicating because to take the mix of business that Harris has and where we're investing and what our portfolio looks like going forward and lump us together with prime DoD contractors to me is -- it just doesn't make a lot of sense. We'll be talking a lot about that in the March Analyst Meeting. This company, going forward, is much better positioned because of where we are in government and DoD, where we are in our international programs and where we are with a number of these initiatives that are driving commercial markets in energy, healthcare and allowing us to take to these commercial markets what we already do very well and very credibly in the government space. So hopefully over time, we'll be able to distance ourselves from the pack, not because they aren't good companies, but because they aren't serving the same markets, going forward, as we are."

Clearly, our business model in both CapRock and Schlumberger GCS is to offer managed services. And that is a certain commitment to a service level agreement, certain commitment to bandwidth and connectivity, a certain list of services for a fixed price on a monthly and annual basis in contracts. There are some product sales that are part of that, but our preference is to really deploy the whole thing and give the customer one price tag on a monthly or annual basis for the services they want and let us worry about all of the equipment and details required to provide that. That also gives us the ability that with that fixed price, we've locked in the cost of the space segment. We have an opportunity through our efficiencies and scale economies to improve margins. So that's our preferred model. Do we sometimes sell products? Yes, but the predominant is the services. And that's true both in the government and the energy and the maritime pieces that make up that business. With regard to your second question, certainly, it's a very fragmented market. We've made two major acquisitions. There may be opportunities down the road to do others, but you shouldn't look for us to be doing anything major in this segment of the kind of scale we've just done for a while. We want to integrate what we have. This really is a merger, if you think about it. Harris had our Maritime Communications business. We've now acquired back in July the CapRock Communications business. And now we're acquiring Schlumberger's GCS business. So Peter Shaper, who leads that group, is really focused on putting all of these together with the right organization, the right global footprint and the most efficient operating processes. So we want to let that get done before we would bring any more into the mix. So I suspect that's a couple of years down the road, Mark."

I want to add my welcome to all of you for our third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call.

I want to add my welcome to all of you for our third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call. Harris posted solid third quarter results with higher consolidated orders in the prior year and a strong operating margins in both our Communications and Government Communications Systems segment. 
Revenue was higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Income was lower due to the favorable product mix in the prior year. As you remember, we have the large volume of expedited shipments of tactical radios to equip the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles for Afghanistan. 
In addition, our government programs and IT Services businesses began to see some impact in the quarter from slowing U.S. Government spending, including the disruption caused by the continuing budget resolution. We've reduced our expected revenue in fiscal 2011 by a total of $100 million government probe rams and IT services as a result, and we've reduced fiscal 2012 revenue by a comparable $100 million. But you may recall in our previous earnings call, we explained that if revenue was impacted by the CR, we did not expect any appreciable impact on margins as a result of our continuing emphasis on operating efficiencies and cost control, and that's exactly what's happened. 
I'm pleased to report that we've closed now on 3 previously announced acquisitions that are become part of our new Integrated Network Solutions segment. We believe these businesses will help drive revenue growth, margin expansion and increase earnings for Harris in fiscal 2012 and beyond. On April 4, we completed the acquisition of a Schlumberger Global Connectivity Services business. They are a leading provider of satellite and terrestrial communication services for the international energy markets. We also acquired the infrastructure assets from Core180's government business, thereby extending our U.S. terrestrial network capabilities and lowering our cost of operations. These 2 acquisitions have been combined with previously acquired CapRock Communications and the Harris Maritime Communication Services business to create Harris CapRock Communications, a $600 million-plus managed Communication Services business serving government, energy and maritime markets. This business combination positions us as a leading supplier in our high-growth industry. The added scale makes our second only to the U.S. Government as a purchaser of satellite bandwidth, which along with our plans to rationalize our redundant facilities and operations, creates a very rich opportunity for expanding operating margins across the business as we move forward. 
We also completed the acquisition of Carefx, a leading provider of interoperability workflow solutions for government and commercial healthcare providers. Carefx has broad hospital customer base, providing Harris with increased channel access to the fast-growing commercial healthcare IT market. We'll benefit from increased sales of Carefx solutions, along with cross-selling additional services offered by other Harris businesses. 
Consolidated revenue in the third quarter was a $1.41 billion, 6% higher than the prior year. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related cost was $149 million or $1.16 per share compared with $170 million or $1.29 per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was $294 million in the quarter compared to $310 million in the prior year quarter. This represents a year-over-year decline of about 5% in EBITDA, as compared to an EPS decline of 10%. 
Consolidated orders of $1.55 billion exceeded revenue and was 7% higher compared with $1.45 billion in the prior year. This resulted in a consolidated company book-to-bill of $1.1 billion for the third quarter. 
Turning to RF Communications. Third quarter revenue for RF Communications segment was $550 million, about flat with the prior year. Prior year expedited shipments of tactical radios to equip MRAP vehicles created a distorted year-over-year comparison. Remember that airship $1 billion in MRAP program radios over the 5 quarters that ended in 1Q of fiscal 2011. While this is certainly a great testament to our leading radio technology and our commercial business model, this success produced some very tough quarters to beat in an already very successful business. 
Operating income for the RF Communications segment was a $179 million compared with non-GAAP operating income of $208 million in the prior year, again the prior year benefited from the MRAP shipments previously noted. Operating margin in the quarter was very strong at 32.5% and that's about 50 basis points higher than we've previously expected. And we believe this higher margins are sustainable going forward in fiscal 2012. 
Our new manufacturing facility is scheduled to be operational in July, further helping us to maintain our low-cost position and supporting healthy margins for the long run. 
Tactical Communications revenue was $431 million in the quarter, about flat with the prior year, and we believe this is an excellent result given the difficult comparison. Deliveries to the MRAP program declined by $206 million year-over-year. Non-MRAP shipments to DoD customers increased significantly due to the adoption of our new Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio, and international revenue increased significantly comprising 1/2 of Tactical Communications revenue during the third quarter. 
Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $119 million in the third quarter, also flat with the prior year and continuing to reflect a constrained state and local government spending environment. However, we expect recent program wins to begin to drive sequential revenue improvements beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
RF Communications segment orders were $722 million in the quarter with a book-to-bill of $1.3 million, and segment backlog increased to $1.70 billion. Orders for Tactical Communications as part of that total were $351 million with a corresponding book-to-bill of 0.8. Backlog continues to be healthy, with Tactical Communications backlog standing at $981 million at the end of the third quarter. 
U.S. DoD orders were slightly higher than revenue in the quarter, with international orders as expected slightly below revenue. Ongoing instability in the Middle East is likely to push about $100 million in orders previously planned for the back half of fiscal 2011 into fiscal 2012. It's important to note this is simply a timing issue, we haven't lost any orders. But given its likelihood at the present time, backlog at the end of our fiscal year is now expected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million for Tactical Communications. This is still very healthy and continues to support our fiscal 2012 guidance. 
Key orders in the U.S. market during the quarter included $70 million to deliver encryption devices and support services for the Blue Force Tracking System used by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps. Total orders for this encryption devices and support now exceed $100 million, also $40 million from the Army for Falcon II HF vehicular systems, $23 million for the Air Force with Falcon III and multi-band handheld radios and $9 million from the Army for HF radios for use in the joint biological point detection system, and this is an important new application for our communication systems. 
The U.S. Department of Defense continues to accelerate its adoption of Harris Falcon III wideband networking radios, embracing our commercial enterprise business model. We continue to believe that legacy communications, which rely on large, heavy, single-band, single-mission radios used primarily for voice are far beyond their useful life. The modern battlefield where war fighters have to simultaneously deal with multiple threats require high-bandwidth network communications capability driven down to individual soldiers. Their increasingly complex missions require video, e-mail, collaborative chat and multiple waveform application availability. The upgrade from narrowband to wideband radios will occur on a large scale, and Harris will continue to lead this transformation. Ultimately, the DoD install base of legacy radios represents a $10 billion market opportunity for Harris. 
Turning to international. Orders in the quarter came from diverse regions around the world and included multiple types of products and systems. They included $29 million from a country in Asia to provide the next phase of their integrated C4ISR project and a $22 million order from the same country for Falcon III Secure Personal Radios, $19 million from a country in Southeast Asia for Falcon III and Falcon II tactical radios and $11 million from the Australia Department of Defense for Falcon III tactical radios as part of their network battlefield communication system, $10 million from an international customer to provide a secure tactical network communication system and this one is comprised of Falcon III, Falcon II, as well as our public safety land mobile radios, a $10 million order from the Afghanistan National Army for Falcon III multi-band, handheld tactical radios and a $5 billion order from a nation in East Africa for Falcon II and falcon III tactical radios. 
Our fiscal 2012 outlook for Tactical Communications remains solid. We closed the third quarter with healthy opportunity pipelines, $1 billion in U.S. market and $2.6 billion in international markets. While some of the increase from the previous international pipeline of $2 billion reflects timing issues I referred to, most of the increases due to additional, new identified opportunities. 
Our expanded regional hubs are playing a key role. In the U.K., we're serving Europe and Western Asia. In the United Arab Emirates, we're serving the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. Our new hub in Australia, we'll be serving throughout Asia-Pacific, and our hub in Miami Florida providing service to Latin America. All of these hubs are increasingly effective in securing new business for Harris. These locations host sales and business development staff, a customer briefing center to show customers the capabilities of our products, along with system engineering and technical support resources. 
We're also continuing to expand our addressable markets by investing in new international products and by extending our reach into large, integrated communication systems projects. Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the third quarter were $371 million compared to $168 million in the prior year. And included most notably, a $291 million order to design and deploy the First Responders Radio Communications System throughout Alberta, Canada. This is a province-wide public safety communications network. And also, orders included $15 million from Dane County, Wisconsin to upgrade their public safety communications system with our digital P25 IP solution. 
For the past several quarters, we've seen some opportunities in this market and are push out due to constrained state and local budgets. But on the positive side, we're finally beginning to see a pickup in new bid and proposal activity, and we view this as a very encouraging sign. Overall, our pipeline of public safety and professional communications opportunities remains large at $3 billion. 
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment in the quarter was $431 million, up 1% from the prior year. Revenue growth on a pro forma basis was about 7% higher in the quarter, and this is when you exclude the Field Data Collection Automation program for the U.S. Census Bureau, which declined by $24 million year-over-year as expected. Of course, they're winding down of the 2010 Census program represents a total of $80 million in year-over-year revenue decline for fiscal 2011 in total. 
Revenue increased in the quarter on the GOES-R program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as on the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft program for the DoD. Slowing U.S. Government spending continue to impact revenue on several of our classified programs. I remind you that a portion of our Classified business consist of short-cycle programs, and these are hit particularly hard in the case of a continuing resolution where funding for new programs is not always available. 
Segment operating income in the third quarter was $60 million, and operating margin was very strong at 13.9%. During the third quarter, we achieved several significant program wins in the business, and these included a $15 million delivery order from the Air Force for telemetry modules for the advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air missile program. Also, a new 3-year contract to build Ka-band antennas for 3 Inmarsat-5 satellites, which will be the backbone of a worldwide wireless broadband network and another order for a 3-year contract to build 22-meter deployable L-band reflectors to support military and civilian communications in Mexico. Together, these programs have a combined value of more than $100 million and illustrate the current strength in the global satellite market. 
And finally, after the close of the quarter, Harris received $11 million contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. We also introduced an important new capability this quarter, we called the Nighthawk 3G. This is our ruggedized, mobile tactical base station, that when it's combined with our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio, enables war fighters on the move to maintain cellular services in locations with limited or no connectivity. The Nighthawk 3G allows war fighters to train, fight, communicate more effectively and report to commanders in realtime regardless of their location. 
Moving to the new Integrated Network Solutions segment. Revenue in the third quarter grew 23% to $463 million. Organic revenue was about flat compared with the prior year. Broadcast Communications showed strong revenue growth of 9%, while revenue declined in the Harris' IT Services business as a result of the slowing U.S. Government spending, including the disruption caused by the continuing resolution. 
Segment non-GAAP operating income was $32 million, 6.8% of sales. Operating income benefited both from acquisitions, as well as much-improved performance in Broadcast Communications. Broadcast Communications business was profitable in the quarter and is still on target to be at breakeven for the fiscal year. That's a significant year-over-year improvement. 
These profit improvements were partially offset, however, by an operating loss in the Cyber Integrated Solutions business. We talked about this last quarter, as we continue to invest in this large and fast-growing market. Also, we talked about last quarter lower pricing and the contract extension for the Navy marine Corps internet program and that's impacting year-over-year Harris IT Services margins. 
Major Integrated Network Solutions orders or program wins in the quarter included 14 task orders totaling $150 million to provide C, Ku and X-band space segment capacity, monitoring control, teleport services and operations and maintenance to DoD, agency customers both in and around the world. Also, a $15 million contract extension from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for systems engineering services for their VistA imaging applications. A $4 million contract to provide local operations and support to the U.S. Army Dental Command in Houston, Texas, Temple, Kentucky, For Bragg, North Carolina and internationally at bases in Korea and Germany. We received at $9 million order from a country in Central Asia for our broadcast solutions, including master control rooms, production studios, play out and new centers. Also in Broadcast, the contract for the installation of an advanced digital out-of-home and IPTV network for the new Madison Square Garden transformation project. More than 1,100 arena displays will deliver dynamic viewing experience to fans at MSG going forward. This project will commence this summer and be completed for the 2013, 2014 season. 
Continuing orders from traditional U.S. broadcast stations also were received in the quarter, including from Gray Communications, Cox Broadcasting and CBS. And we received a $10 million order from Virtual Computing Environment Corp., or VCE, for trusted enterprise cloud solutions. This is an important milestone for our Cyber Integrated Solutions business. 
Harris also recently announced a strategic alliance with VCE and their majority owner EMSC that's expected to accelerate the growth of cloud infrastructure as a service. As part of this strategic alliance, development teams from Harris, RSA and VCE are integrating patented Harris technologies within the VCE Vbox infrastructure platform. We expect together to deliver unparalleled levels of visibility, control, security, performance and availability in the cloud environment. EMC and VCE are also actively engaged in joint marketing affairs to create trusted, enterprise cloud services demand. 
Turning to that Healthcare Solutions business. We announced the formation of a joint venture with Johns Hopkins Medicine to develop next-generation, medical imaging management solutions. This collaboration brings together Harris' industry-leading health information capabilities and security technologies with Johns Hopkins renowned clinical expertise. The new image managed solutions will be deployed first by the entire Johns Hopkins health system and later, we'll market this to other hospitals and healthcare providers around the country. 
At our broadcast team, we introduced the new Celenio Media Convergence Platform to the U.S. market at the Annual National Association of Broadcasters Trade Show. Harris introduced the industry's first, integrated media convergence platform. Traditional broadcast in IP signal distribution together can require the use of up to 45 different components, 25 rack units of physical space, consume 2,500 watts of power and require 131 connector cables. Now let's compare that to Celenio. Distribution requires one single component, 3 rack units of vertical space, consumes only 600 watts of power and requires only 14 cables. This is an amazing improvement, and we think will lead to rapid adoption of the new Celenio technology and globally across broadcast customers. 
We continue to believe the Integrated Network Support segment is well-positioned to deliver future revenue growth and margin expansion. As we discussed during our Analyst Day in March, we expect the segment to grow faster than other segments and achieve margins of 11% to 12% by fiscal 2014. Let me now ask Harris CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on our financial results during the quarter."

Our balance sheet continues to be strong. We ended the quarter with $885 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $552 million was used to fund the acquisitions of GCS and Carefx, both of which closed on April 4, the first day of our fourth quarter. $870 million of the $1.05 billion under our two revolving credit facility is available, and no long-term debt maturity come due until October of 2015. Return on invested capital remains strong at 21%, while return on equity was at 27%. 
During the quarter, we used $50 million to repurchase 1.02 million shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of $49.02 per share, and we currently have $300 million authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was weaker than expected primarily due to timing of U.S. Government funding and payments, decreasing $146 million to $168 million versus $314 million in the third quarter of the prior year. In light of this, we are decreasing our expectation for cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2011 to a range of $775 million to $825 million, back to where we were with guidance as of the end of the first quarter and lower as compared to our most recent guidance of $800 million to $850 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $52 million, as compared to $40 billion for the third quarter of 2010. While capital expenditures were $88 million for the third quarter, as compared to $94 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Including the acquisitions of Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, our guidance for depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures are both increasing by $5 million to ranges of $210 million to $220 million and $325 million to $345 million respectively. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 31.7%, and our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2011 now is 33%. Our initial outlook for 2012 full year tax rate is 33.5%, however, the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. Other areas of guidance for fiscal 2012 are as follows: Cash flow from operations, $850 million to $900 million dollars; depreciation and amortization $280 million to $290 million; capital expenditures, including capitalized software of $275 million to $300 million. Our current priorities for cash that is expected to be generated remain the same: Funding internal investments to drive growth and generate higher earnings, pay appropriate dividends, acquire companies that need our strategic objectives and enhanced financial returns and repurchase shares. 
In summary, we expect to finish 2011 on a very strong financial foundation with expectations for another very solid year in fiscal 2012. Let me now turn it back to you Howard."

Let me close with discussion about fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 guidance. We have updated our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 as follows: Consolidated revenue is now expected to be approximately $5.9 billion, and that's about 13% above fis",649,"Thanks, Gary. Let me close with discussion about fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 guidance. We have updated our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 as follows: Consolidated revenue is now expected to be approximately $5.9 billion, and that's about 13% above fiscal 2010. That compares our previously expected revenue target of about $6 billion. 
Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs is unchanged from our previous guidance, still expected to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, again excluding acquisition-related cost and expenses are now expected to be in the range from $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion, representing an EBITDA increase of 11% to 13% above fiscal 2010. 
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 guidance is unchanged. I'll just remind you that revenues is expected to be 9% to 10% higher than the prior year, and operating margin for the full year expected to be between 34% and 35%. For Government Communications Systems, we now expect revenue for 2011 to be flat to 2% higher in fiscal 2010. Previous range was 3% to 5% higher. Segment over margin is it still expected to be between 12.5% and 13%. 
And for the Integrated Network Solutions segment, we now expect revenue in a range of 33% to 35% higher than fiscal 2010, and that compares to our previous range of 36% to 38%. And, again, it's due to the government budget impact at Harris IT Services. Organic growth is now expected to be in a range of 4% to 6% over the prior year. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is now expected to be a bit higher at 5% to 7%. Previous margin guidance was within the range of 5% to 6%. 
So that's a recap of 2011, let me now move on to fiscal 2012. You'll recall we initiated guidance for 2012 in March. And today, I'll update that guidance, provide a more color around our 3 operating segments. 
Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2012 is expected to be between 7% and 10% higher than fiscal 2011, with revenue between $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related cost, is still expected to be in a range of $5.10 to $5.20 per diluted share, so no change in our guidance for non-GAAP EPS. And this range represents a year-over-year increase of 5% to 7%. 
Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization excluding acquisition-related cost is expected to be in the range from $1.34 billion to $1.38 billion. That's a strong year-over-year increase in EBITDA of 9% to 12%. 
Turning to color around the segments. For RF Communications, fiscal 2012 revenues is expected to be 2% to 4% higher than fiscal 2011. With Tactical Communications business, about flat with the prior year, reflecting lower DoD revenue as we indicated in the March analyst meeting, and correspondingly, higher international revenue. Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue is also expected to be higher in 2012. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range from 32% to 33%. 
For the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2012 to be 3% to 5% higher than fiscal 2011. Segment operating margins are expected to be about 13%. And for our new Integrated Network Solutions segment, we expect revenue in a range of 18% to 20% higher than fiscal 2011, representing organic growth in a range of 9% to 11% compared to prior year. 
Non-GAAP segment operating margin is expected to be between 6% and 8%, that's about 100 basis points above fiscal 2011 expectations. We expect margins to grow faster in this segment beyond fiscal 2012 when the recent acquisitions have been fully integrated and we receive the full benefits of the integration. With that, I will stop. I'll ask the operator to open the line, and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

So it's a series of relatively small things, but they add up to about $100 million. We expect to hit those orders in the first half of the next year. And we're not expecting that any of those will have a material impact on fiscal year '12. We will start the year with a little less backlog, but still very adequate backlog and order pipeline to reach the guidance we've provided for the year-over-year, essentially maintaining our revenue with DoD orders as we've been talking now for several quarters offset by higher International business."

We're going to be starting '12 with last backlog than we started '11, but we're going to be starting with a lot more backlog than we started fiscal '10 and pretty comparable backlog plus or minus to what we started fiscal '09. So it's really, as you know, a combination of the backlog then coupled with the orders that you get, when you get those orders and your ability to turn them. We have a pretty efficient process. We'll have the new manufacturing facility online, significantly more capacity in place. And so I think we're going to benefit from that with the new facility both in terms of the time orders into revenue will quickly, but also turn orders into revenue at even more competitive cost. So at this point, not concerned. And as we go forward, the next call and get into the fiscal year, we'll talk about any seasonality that we expect in terms of how we expect to deliver on the comparable Tactical Communications revenue.

Certainly, the testing that is anticipated this summer that we've spoken about previously is going to be an important milestone. We think we're very well-positioned with the only field-employed, proven, NSA-certified technology. So we think that's a huge lead that we have. Secondly, we recently seen a request information, kind of out of the jitters, GPEO office, essentially asking for what they call nondevelopmental solutions for the GMR specification, translated in our view meaning, already developed, commercially developed technologies. Again, we think we're the only ones in the position to really meet the full spec and the timeframe that they would want so that we can continue to deploy technologies to the brigade combats teams in Afghanistan and around the world. I certainly like our position more and more as it relates to the Falcon III technology. And then finally, remember, we're going to be reporting the SRW form very quickly into the Falcon III handheld, and so we're going to have some amount of networking capability using the SOW networking waveform even in the handheld. And you couple that with the announcement we made on the Nighthawk 3G capability to link battlefield tactical networks to 3G cellular networks. And I just believe we continue to widen to the lead that we have. That doesn't mean that there won't be competition, certainly, there'll be competition. But when it comes down to who can really deliver today, I think we're in a very strong position."

There are literally billions of dollars of procurements expected over a period of years as they deploy the jitters based technology in vehicular applications. So it's a big, big market. And I think what you have to be determined is exactly what the uptake of that will be. I commented in my prepared remarks that there's 10 billion of radios deployed today that basically do 1 thing: They're single band, single mission, noncompatible with jitters, and there's about another $2.5 billion of radios that are compatible with jitters but are not wideband networking. So you have this huge market in DoD that will be upgraded and transformed overtime, and it's really just a question of when. We believe that the capabilities that we are providing will accelerate the adoption. When you see what the radios can do, it continually impresses the leadership in DoD, which causes them to become proponents of investing budget dollars in these tactical radio deployments because they lead to more effective missions and ultimately, save lives. So those are the best, the most positive attributes you can have for your technologies."

On the flipside, the adoption of cloud computing is hard to predict and what the uptake of orders and turning them into revenue for us, which ultimately would drive profitability that is still an estimate. And I think we'll be monitoring very closely our funnel. We'll be monitoring the uptake of new orders. We are off to a good start and pretty high expectations for '12 and beyond. So will pay close attention to that. But overall, I don't believe this is the question if we'll be successful in cloud computing, we'll take off or security and access to what's going on and compliance and seismic cloud will be required. I think its more of a question of when and what will the actual uptake be with the new market. It's sometimes difficult to peg. But there's no question, interest is high, lots of meetings, lots of proposals, and then we'll have to see how those work through the funnel and turn it into revenue.

We'll have a material amount of revenue in fiscal '12 from that program. I don't think there's much in fiscal '11, just a little bit. And to remind you with these programs, I think it's pretty typical, what we will be a doer doing during the initial implement phases is putting in the systems and the infrastructure along with our partners. That's typically a little lower margin business, and then toward the end of it, are the opportunities to sell the terminals, both portable, as well as mobile and much higher margin opportunities. So we'll expect to see pickup in revenue, certainly profitability but not at the level we'll ultimately get to when we're able to deploy the terminals into the completed system. So at any given time, we've got a large number of these projects at different phases. But given that we took over the business, it wasn't growing all that much. We've had good success in growing it. We still have a lot of programs that are kind of toward the front end of that cycle. I think we talked about that previously as it relates to our margin. Some of the margin uptake in this business that's going to feed into this segment is going to come from a mix of what we're selling, not necessarily that there's a lot of cost coming out, but more as the mix gets higher for selling terminals or radios, the margins are going to be better than when you're setting a higher percentage of systems."

It's been pretty steady even as we've been winning programs, so that suggest that others are coming in. We see this contrast, day to day, they're not hiring a lot of additional police officers or firefighters. So the day-to-day add-on sales for an additional base station for more capacity or more radios for more people, we're not seeing. That's why the budgets are absolutely being constrained because of state and local revenue income. On the other hand, the big projects continue to move along. Many of them are already funded, either funded through federal grants or they're funded through revenue-producing kinds of services or fee-based. In Florida, for example, the statewide network, fixed income from licenses of various kinds. So there's still a number of them that are out there. There's still a lot of very old technology, analog technology that needs to be upgraded. There's still a requirement for going to this narrow banding, so they can give up frequency for the other uses. And then finally, you've got the opportunity being offered by the introduction of this LTE fourth generation of broadband technology, and we think we're going to be in a very strong position to integrate, converge networks, LTE 4G for wideband along with our traditional and narrowband LMR radio technology. So we're feeling very positive about the market. We've restaffed the state and local funds were a little clear as it relate to the higher-margin add-on kind of business. But overall, I think we're very pleased with the progress we've made since we bought the business. We have some new leadership in place, very pleased with how that is coming along, very pleased with the strides we've made in the sales organization, sales leadership, channel partners, having signed up a couple of Motorola dealers. To me, lots of good signs, it never comes as quickly as we want, but the progress is definitely a there."

Our expectations are higher than that. And, as I said earlier on the call, we'll have to see how to take up this. I think this is a business where we don't want to be too short term in our thinking where we won't invest and we'll miss what is we expect -- and we're not the expert on this, what everyone in the market expects to be a major transformation in how IT is delivered to users over the next decade.

But increasingly and you're seeing this in our reports, we're not able to divulge the individual countries. Security and deployment of these technologies is becoming more and more of an issue. So I really can't go country-to-country. I can tell you that it's a well diversified mix of opportunities. It's our traditional tactical radios. It's our new products like the Falcon Fighter, the Secure Personal Radio, high-capacity line of sight, high-capacity data radios and a mix of services and systems of that we wrap around that. But it's a very good cross-section, and I think real opportunities. You can imagine, I'm a skeptic when I see that kind of increase in the scrub the pipeline to make sure it's real, and we're very comfortable that it is. To your first point, in terms of the FY '11, Gary talked about a little better on the tax rate, and we also raised about 100 basis points, the expectation for the new Integrated Network Solutions return on sales for '11. So that's offsetting the margins associated with $100 million in revenue in government programs and IT services. We haven't provided that level of detail in '12. We felt we had adequate comfort in the guidance we provided to maintain the EPS guidance in the face of about $100 million lower revenue. So we're still very comfortable in our growth rates and margins for next year. I think '12 is going to turn out to be a good year for us as we go forward."

I want to add my welcome to all of you for our third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call.

I want to add my welcome to all of you for our third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call. 
Harris posted solid third quarter results with higher consolidated orders in the prior year and strong operating margins in both our Communications and Government Communications Systems segments. 
Revenue was higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Income was lower due to the favorable product mix in the prior year. As you'll remember, we had the large volume of expedited shipments of tactical radios to equip the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles for Afghanistan. 
In addition, our Government Programs and IT Services businesses began to see some impact in the quarter from slowing U.S. Government spending, including the disruption caused by the continuing budget resolution. We've reduced our expected revenue in fiscal 2011 by a total of $100 million in Government Programs and IT services as a result, and we've reduced fiscal 2012 revenue by a comparable $100 million. But you may recall in our previous earnings call we explained that if revenue was in fact impacted by the CR, we did not expect any appreciable impact on margins as a result of our continuing emphasis on operating efficiencies and cost control, and that's exactly what's happened. 
I'm pleased to report that we've closed now on 3 previously announced acquisitions that have become part of our new Integrated Network Solutions segment. We believe these businesses will help drive revenue growth, margin expansion and increase earnings for Harris in fiscal 2012 and beyond. On April 4, we completed the acquisition of the Schlumberger Global Connectivity Services business. They are a leading provider of satellite and terrestrial communications services for the international energy markets. We also acquired the infrastructure assets from Core180's government business, thereby extending our U.S. terrestrial network capabilities and lowering our cost of operations. These 2 acquisitions have been combined with previously acquired CapRock Communications and the Harris Maritime Communication Services business to create Harris CapRock Communications, a $600 million-plus managed Communications Services business serving government, energy and maritime markets. This business combination positions us as the leading supplier in our high-growth industry. The added scale makes our second only to the U.S. Government as a purchaser of satellite bandwidth, which, along with our plans to rationalize redundant facilities and operations, creates a very rich opportunity for expanding operating margins across the business as we move forward. 
We also completed the acquisition of Carefx, a leading provider of interoperability workflow solutions for government and commercial healthcare providers. Carefx has broad a hospital customer base, providing Harris with increased channel access to the fast-growing commercial healthcare IT market. We'll benefit from increased sales of Carefx solutions, along with cross-selling additional services offered by other Harris businesses. 
Consolidated revenue in the third quarter was  $1.41 billion, 6% higher than the prior year. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, was $149 million or $1.16 per share compared with $170 million or $1.29 per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was $294 million in the quarter compared to $310 million in the prior year quarter. This represents a year-over-year decline of about 5% in EBITDA as compared to an EPS decline of 10%. 
Consolidated orders of $1.55 billion exceeded revenue and was 7% higher compared with $1.45 billion in the prior year. This resulted in a consolidated company book-to-bill of $1.1 billion for the third quarter. 
Turning to RF Communications. Third quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $550 million, about flat with the prior year. Prior year expedited shipments of tactical radios to equip MRAP vehicles created a distorted year-over-year comparison. Remember that airshipped $1 billion in MRAP program radios over the 5 quarters that ended in 1Q of fiscal 2011. While this is certainly a great testament to our leading radio technology and our commercial business model, this success produced some very tough quarters to beat in an already very successful business. 
Operating income for the RF Communications segment was $179 million compared with non-GAAP operating income of $208 million in the prior year. Again, the prior year benefited from the MRAP shipments previously noted. 
Operating margin in the quarter was very strong at 32.5%. And that's about 50 basis points higher than we had previously expected. And we believe these higher margins are sustainable going forward in fiscal 2012. Our new manufacturing facility is scheduled to be operational in July, further helping us to maintain our low-cost position and supporting healthy margins for the long run. 
Tactical Communications revenue was $431 million in the quarter, about flat with the prior year. And we believe this was an excellent result given the difficult comparison. Deliveries to the MRAP program declined by $206 million year-over-year. Non-MRAP shipments to DoD customers increased significantly due to the adoption of our new Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio. And International revenue increased significantly comprising 1/2 of Tactical Communications' revenue during the third quarter. 
Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $119 million in the third quarter, also flat with the prior year and continuing to reflect the constrained state and local government spending environment. However, we expect recent program wins to begin to drive sequential revenue improvement beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
RF Communications segment orders were $722 million in the quarter with a book-to-bill of $1.3 million, and segment backlog increased to $1.70 billion. Orders for Tactical Communications as part of that total were $351 million with a corresponding book-to-bill of 0.8. Backlog continues to be healthy, with Tactical Communications backlog standing at $981 million at the end of the third quarter. 
U.S. DoD orders were slightly higher than revenue in the quarter, with international orders as expected slightly below revenue. Ongoing instability in the Middle East is likely to push about $100 million in orders previously planned for the back half of fiscal 2011 into fiscal 2012. It's important to note this is simply a timing issue. We haven't lost any orders. But given its likelihood at the present time, backlog at the end of our fiscal year is now expected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million for Tactical Communications. This is still very healthy and continues to support our fiscal 2012 guidance. 
Key orders in the U.S. market during the quarter included $70 million to deliver encryption devices and support services for the Blue Force Tracking system used by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps. Total orders for these encryption devices and support now exceed $100 million. Also, $40 million from the Army for Falcon II HF vehicular systems; $23 million from the Air Force for Falcon III multiband handheld radios; and $9 million from the Army for HF radios for use in the Joint Biological Point Detection System. And this is an important new application for our communication systems. 
The U.S. Department of Defense continues to accelerate its adoption of Harris Falcon III wideband networking radios, embracing our commercial enterprise business model. We continue to believe that legacy communications, which rely on large, heavy, single-band, single-mission radios used primarily for voice, are far beyond their useful life. The modern battlefield, where war fighters have to simultaneously deal with multiple threats, require high-bandwidth network communications capability driven down to individual soldiers. Their increasingly complex missions require video, e-mail, collaborative chat and multiple waveform application availability. The upgrade from narrowband to wideband radios will occur on a large scale, and Harris will continue to lead this transformation. Ultimately, the DoD installed base of legacy radios represents a $10 billion market opportunity for Harris. 
Turning to International. Orders in the quarter came from diverse regions around the world and included multiple types of products and systems. They included $29 million from a country in Asia to provide the next phase of their integrated C4ISR project and a $22 million order from the same country for Falcon III Secure Personal Radios; $19 million from a country in Southeast Asia for Falcon III and Falcon II tactical radios; $11 million from the Australia Department of Defence for Falcon III tactical radios as part of their networked battlefield communication system; $10 million from an international customer to provide a secure tactical network communication system, and this one is comprised of Falcon III, Falcon II, as well as our public safety land mobile radios; a $10 million order from the Afghanistan National Army for Falcon III multiband, handheld tactical radios; and a $5 billion order from a nation in East Africa for Falcon II and Falcon III tactical radios. 
Our fiscal 2012 outlook for Tactical Communications remains solid. We closed the third quarter with healthy opportunity pipelines: $1 billion in U.S. market and $2.6 billion in international markets. While some of the increase from the previous International pipeline of $2 billion reflects the timing issues I referred to, most of the increase is due to additional new identified opportunities. 
Our expanded regional hubs are playing a key role. In the U.K., we're serving Europe and Western Asia. In the United Arab Emirates; we're serving the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa; our new hub in Australia will be serving throughout Asia-Pacific; and our hub in Miami, Florida are providing service to Latin America. Now all of these hubs are increasingly effective in securing new business for Harris. Each locations host sales and business development staff, a customer briefing center to show customers the capabilities of our products, along with system engineering and technical support resources. We're also continuing to expand our addressable markets by investing in new international products and by extending our reach into large, integrated communication systems projects. 
Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the third quarter were $371 million compared to $168 million in the prior year and included, most notably, a $291 million order to design and deploy the First Responder Radio Communications System throughout Alberta, Canada. This is a province-wide public safety communications network. And also, orders included $15 million from Dane County, Wisconsin to upgrade their public safety communications system with our digital P25 IP solution. 
For the past several quarters, we've seen some opportunities in this market push out due to constrained state and local budgets. But on the positive side, we're finally beginning to see a pickup in new bid and proposal activity, and we view this as a very encouraging sign. Overall, our pipeline of public safety and professional communications opportunities remains large at $3 billion. 
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment in the quarter was $431 million, up 1% from the prior year. Revenue growth on a pro forma basis was about 7% higher in the quarter, and this is when you exclude the Field Data Collection Automation program for the U.S. Census Bureau, which declined by $24 million year-over-year as expected. Of course, their winding down of the 2010 Census program represents a total of $80 million in year-over-year revenue decline for fiscal 2011 in total. Revenue increased in the quarter on the GOES-R program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as on the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft program for the DoD. 
Slowing U.S. Government spending continued to impact revenue on several of our classified programs. I'll remind you that a portion of our Classified business consists of short-cycle programs. And these were hit particularly hard in the case of a continuing resolution where funding for new programs is not always available. 
Segment operating income in the third quarter was $60 million, and operating margin was very strong at 13.9%. During the third quarter, we achieved several significant program wins in the business. And these included a $15 million delivery order from the Air Force for telemetry modules for the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile program; also, a new 3-year contract to build Ka-band antennas for 3 Inmarsat-5 satellites, which will be the backbone of a worldwide wireless broadband network; and another order for a 3-year contract to build a 22-meter deployable L-band reflectors to support military and civilian communications in Mexico. Together, these programs have a combined value of more than $100 million and illustrate the current strength in the global satellite market; and finally, after the close of the quarter, Harris received an $11 million contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. 
We also introduced an important new capability this quarter we call the KnightHawk 3G. This is our ruggedized mobile tactical base station that, when it's combined with our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio, enables war fighters on the move to maintain cellular services in locations with limited or no connectivity. The KnightHawk 3G allows war fighters to train, fight, communicate more effectively and report to commanders in real time regardless of their location. 
Moving to the new Integrated Network Solutions segment. Revenue in the third quarter grew 23% to $463 million. Organic revenue was about flat compared with the prior year. Broadcast Communications showed strong revenue growth of 9%, while revenue declined in Harris' IT Services business as a result of the slowing U.S. Government spending, including the disruption caused by the continuing resolution. 
Segment non-GAAP operating income was $32 million, 6.8% of sales. Operating income benefited both from acquisitions as well as much-improved performance in Broadcast Communications. Broadcast Communication business was profitable in the quarter and is still on target to be at breakeven for the fiscal year. That's a significant year-over-year improvement. 
These profit improvements were partially offset, however, by an operating loss in the Cyber Integrated Solutions business. We talked about this last quarter as we continued to invest in this large and fast-growing market. Also, we talked about last quarter lower pricing and the contract extension for the Navy Marine Corps intranet program, and that's impacting year-over-year Harris IT Services margins. 
Major Integrated Network Solutions orders or program wins in the quarter included 14 task orders totaling $150 million to provide C-, Ku- and X-band space segment capacity, monitoring and control, teleport services and operations and maintenance to DoD agency customers located around the world. Also, a $15 million contract extension from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for systems engineering services for their VistA imaging applications. A $4 million contract to provide local operations and support to the U.S. Army Dental Command at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and internationally at bases in Korea and Germany. 
We received a $9 million order from a country in Central Asia for our broadcast solutions, including master control rooms, production studios, playout and news centers. 
Also in Broadcast, the contract for the installation of an advanced digital out-of-home and IPTV network for the new Madison Square Garden transformation project. More than 1,100 arena displays will deliver a dynamic viewing experience to fans at MSG going forward. This project will commence this summer and be completed for the 2013, 2014 season. 
Continuing orders from traditional U.S. broadcast stations also were received in the quarter, including from Gray Communications, Cox Broadcasting and CBS. And we received a $10 million order from Virtual Computing Environment Corporation (sic) [Company], or VCE, for trusted enterprise cloud solutions. This is an important milestone for our Cyber Integrated Solutions business. 
Harris also recently announced a strategic alliance with VCE and their majority owner, EMC, that's expected to accelerate the growth of cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service. As part of this strategic alliance, development teams from Harris, RSA and VCE are integrating patented Harris technologies within the VCE Vblock infrastructure platform. We expect together to deliver unparalleled levels of visibility, control, security, performance and availability in the cloud environment. EMC and VCE are also actively engaged in joint marketing affairs to create Trusted Enterprise Cloud services demand. 
Turning to the Healthcare Solutions business. We announced the formation of a joint venture with Johns Hopkins Medicine to develop next-generation, medical imaging management solutions. This collaboration brings together Harris' industry-leading health information capabilities and security technologies with Johns Hopkins renowned clinical expertise. The new image management solutions will be deployed first by the entire Johns Hopkins health system. And later, we'll market this to other hospitals and healthcare providers around the country. 
At our broadcast team, we introduced the new Selenio media convergence platform to the U.S. market at the annual National Association of Broadcasters trade show. With Selenio, Harris introduced the industry's first integrated media convergence platform. Traditional broadcast and IP signal distribution together can require the use of up to 45 different components, 25 rack units of physical space, consume 2,500 watts of power and require 131 connector cables. Now let's compare that to Selenio. Distribution requires one single component, 3 rack units of vertical space, consumes only 600 watts of power and requires only 14 cables. So this is an amazing improvement, and we think will lead to rapid adoption of the new Selenio technology globally across broadcast customers. 
We continue to believe the Integrated Network Support segment is well positioned to deliver future revenue growth and margin expansion. As we discussed during our Analyst Day in March, we expect this segment to grow faster than other segments and achieve margins of 11% to 12% by fiscal 2014. Let me now ask Harris CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on our financial results during the quarter."

Our balance sheet continues to be strong. We ended the quarter with $885 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $552 million was used to fund the acquisitions of Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, both of which closed on April",478,"Thank you, Howard. Our balance sheet continues to be strong. We ended the quarter with $885 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $552 million was used to fund the acquisitions of Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, both of which closed on April 4, the first day of our fourth quarter. $870 million of the $1.05 billion under our 2 revolving credit facility is available, and no long-term debt maturities come due until October of 2015. Return on invested capital remained strong at 21%, while return on equity was at 27%. 
During the quarter, we used $50 million to repurchase 1.02 million shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of $49.02 per share, and we currently have $300 million authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was weaker than expected primarily due to timing of U.S. Government funding and payments, decreasing $146 million to $168 million versus $314 million in the third quarter of the prior year. In light of this, we are decreasing our expectation for cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2011 to a range of $775 million to $825 million, back to where we were with guidance as of the end of the first quarter and lower as compared to our most recent guidance of $800 million to $850 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $52 million as compared to $40 million for the third quarter of 2010, while capital expenditures were $88 million for the third quarter as compared to $94 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Including the acquisitions of Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, our guidance for depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures are both increasing by $5 million to ranges of $210 million to $220 million and $325 million to $345 million, respectively. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 31.7%, and our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2011 now is 33%. Our initial outlook for 2012 full year tax rate is 33.5%, however, the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. Other areas of guidance for fiscal 2012 are as follows: cash flow from operations, $850 million to $900 million dollars; depreciation and amortization $280 million to $290 million; capital expenditures, including capitalized software of $275 million to $300 million. 
Our current priorities for cash that is expected to be generated remain the same: funding internal investments to drive growth and generate higher earnings, pay appropriate dividends, acquire companies that meet our strategic objectives and enhance financial returns and repurchase shares. 
In summary, we expect to finish fiscal 2011 on a very strong financial foundation with expectations for another very solid year in fiscal 2012. Let me now turn it back to you, Howard."

Let me close with discussion about fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 guidance. We've updated our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 as follows.

We've updated our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 as follows.  Consolidated revenue is now expected to be approximately $5.9 billion, and that's about 13% above fiscal 2010. That compares to our previously expected revenue target of about $6 billion.  Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs is unchanged from our previous guidance, still expected to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, again excluding acquisition-related costs and expenses, are now expected to be in a range from $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion, representing an EBITDA increase of 11% to 13% above fiscal 2010. 
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 guidance is unchanged. I'll just remind you that revenue is expected to be 9% to 10% higher than the prior year, and operating margin for the full year expected to be between 34% and 35%. 
For Government Communications Systems, we now expect revenue for 2011 to be flat to 2% higher in fiscal 2010. Previous range was 3% to 5% higher. Segment operating margin is it still expected to be between 12.5% and 13%. 
And for the Integrated Network Solutions segment, we now expect revenue in a range of 33% to 35% higher than fiscal 2010, and that compares to our previous range of 36% to 38%. And again, it's due to the government budget impact at Harris IT Services. Organic growth is now expected to be in a range of 4% to 6% over the prior year. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is now expected to be a bit higher at 5% to 7%. Previous margin guidance was in a range of 5% to 6%. 
So that's a recap of 2011. Let me now move on to fiscal 2012. You'll recall we initiated guidance for 2012 in March. And today, I'll update that guidance, provide more color around our 3 operating segments. 
Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2012 is expected to be between 7% and 10% higher than fiscal 2011, with revenue between $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is still expected to be in a range of $5.10 to $5.20 per diluted share. So no change in our guidance for non-GAAP EPS. And this range represents a year-over-year increase of 5% to 7%. 
Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition-related costs, is expected to be in a  range from $1.34 billion to $1.38 billion. That's a strong year-over-year increase in EBITDA of 9% to 12%. 
Turning to color around the segments. For RF Communications, fiscal 2012 revenue is expected to be 2% to 4% higher than fiscal 2011. With Tactical Communications business, about flat with the prior year, reflecting lower DoD revenue, as we indicated at the March Analyst Meeting, and, correspondingly, higher International revenue. Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue is also expected to be higher in 2012. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range from 32% to 33%. 
For the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2012 to be 3% to 5% higher than fiscal 2011. Segment operating margins are expected to be about 13%. And for our new Integrated Network Solutions segment, we expect revenue in a range of 18% to 20% higher than fiscal 2011, representing organic growth in a range of 9% to 11% compared to prior year. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is expected to be between 6% and 8%. That's about 100 basis points above fiscal 2011 expectations. We expect margins to grow faster in this segment beyond fiscal 2012 when the recent acquisitions have been fully integrated and we receive the full benefits of integration. With that, I will stop. I'll ask the operator to open the line, and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

So it's a series of relatively small things, but they add up to about $100 million. We expect to get those orders in the first half of next year. And we're not expecting that any of those will have a material impact on fiscal year '12. We will start the year with a little less backlog but still very adequate backlog and order pipeline to reach the guidance we've provided for the year-over-year, essentially maintaining our revenue with DoD lower as we've been talking now for several quarters, offset by higher International business."

So it's really, as you know, a combination of the backlog then coupled with the orders that you get. When you get those orders, then your ability to turn them. We have a pretty efficient process. We'll have the new manufacturing facility online, significantly more capacity in place. And so I think we're going to benefit from that new facility both in terms of being able to turn orders into revenue quickly but also turn orders into revenue at even more competitive cost. So at this point, not concerned. And as we go forward to the next call and get into the fiscal year, we'll talk about any seasonality that we expect in terms of how we expect to deliver on the comparable Tactical Communications revenue.

Certainly, the testing that is anticipated this summer that we've spoken about previously is going to be an important milestone. We think we're very well positioned with the only field-employed, proven, NSA-certified technology. So we think that's a huge lead that we have. Secondly, we've recently seen a request for information kind of out of the JTRS JPEO office, essentially asking for what they call nondevelopmental solutions for the GMR specification. Translated in our view, meaning already developed, commercially developed technologies. Again, we think we're the only ones in a position to really meet the full spec and the time frame that they will want so that we can continue to deploy technologies to the brigade combat teams in Afghanistan and around the world. So I certainly like our position more and more as it relates to the Falcon III technology. And then, finally, remember we're going to be porting the SRW waveform very quickly into the Falcon III handheld, and so we're going to have some amount of networking capability using the SRW networking waveform even in the handheld. And couple that with the announcement we made on the KnightHawk 3G capability to link battlefield tactical networks to 3G cellular networks, and I just believe we continue to widen the lead that we have. That doesn't mean there won't be competition. Certainly, there'll be competition. But when it comes down to who can really deliver today, I think we're in a very strong position."

I commented in my prepared remarks that there's $10 billion of radios deployed today that basically do one thing: They're single-band, single-mission, noncompatible with JTRS, and there's about another $2.5 billion of radios that are compatible with JTRS but aren't wideband networking. So you have this huge market in DoD that will be upgraded and transformed over time, and it's really just a question of when. We believe that the capabilities that we are providing will accelerate the adoption. When you see what the radios can do, it continually impresses the leadership in DoD, which causes them to become proponents of investing budget dollars in these tactical radio deployments because they lead to more effective missions and ultimately save lives.

I think its more a question of when and what will the actual uptake be with the new market. That's sometimes difficult to peg. But there's no question interest is high, lots of meetings, lots of proposals, and then we'll have to see how those work through the funnel and turn into revenue.

That's typically a little lower margin business. And then toward the end of it are the opportunities to sell the terminals, both portable as well as mobile, and much higher margin opportunities. So we'll expect to see pickup in revenue, certainly profitability, but not at the level we'll ultimately get to when we're able to deploy the terminals into the completed system. So at any given time, we've got a large number of these projects at different phases. But given that we took over the business, it wasn't growing all that much. We've had good success in growing it. We still have a lot of programs that are kind of toward the front end of that cycle. I think we talked about that previously as it relates to our margins. Some of the margin uptake in this business that's going to feed into the segment is going to come from the mix of what we're selling. Not necessarily that there's a lot of costs coming out but more that as the mix gets higher for selling terminals or radios, the margins are going to be better than when you're selling a higher percentage of systems."

So the day to day add-on sales for an additional base station, for more capacity or more radios for more people we're not seeing. That's where budgets are absolutely being constrained because of state and local revenue income. On the other hand, the big projects continue to move along. Many of them are already funded, either funded through federal grants or they're funded through revenue-producing kinds of services or fee-based. In Florida, for example, the statewide network, its income from licenses of various kinds. So there's still a number that are out there. There are still a lot of very old technology, analog technology that needs to be upgraded. There's still a requirement for going to this narrow banding so they can give up frequency for the other uses. And then, finally, you've got the opportunity being offered by the introduction of this LTE fourth generation of broadband technology. And we think we're going to be in a very strong position to integrate, converge networks of LTE 4G for wideband along with our traditional narrowband LMR radio technology. So we're feeling very positive about the market. We wish that the state and local funds were a little clear as it related to the higher margin add-on kind of business. But overall, I think we're very pleased with the progress we've made since we bought the business. I have some new leadership in place. Very pleased with how that is coming along.

But it's a very good cross-section, and I think real opportunities. You can imagine I'm a skeptic when I see that kind of an increase. And we'll scrub the pipeline to make sure it's real, and we're very comfortable that it is. To your first point in terms of the FY '11, Gary talked about a little better on the tax rate, and we also raised about 100 basis points, the expectation for the new Integrated Network Solutions return on sales for '11. So that's offsetting the margins associated with the $100 million in revenue in government programs and IT services. We haven't provided that level of detail in '12. We felt we had adequate comfort in the guidance we've provided to maintain the EPS guidance even in the face again of about $100 million lower revenue.

I want to add my welcome to all of you for our third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call. Harris posted solid third quarter results with higher consolidated orders in the prior year and strong operating margins in both our RF Communication",2879,"Thank you, Pam. I want to add my welcome to all of you for our third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call. 
Harris posted solid third quarter results with higher consolidated orders in the prior year and strong operating margins in both our RF Communications and Government Communications Systems segments.  Revenue was higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Income was lower due to the favorable product mix in the prior year. As you'll remember, we had the large volume of expedited shipments of tactical radios to equip the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles for Afghanistan. 
In addition, our Government Programs and IT Services businesses began to see some impact in the quarter from slowing U.S. Government spending, including the disruption caused by the continuing budget resolution. We've reduced our expected revenue in fiscal 2011 by a total of $100 million in Government Programs and IT services as a result, and we've reduced fiscal 2012 revenue by a comparable $100 million. But you may recall in our previous earnings call we explained that if revenue was in fact impacted by the CR, we did not expect any appreciable impact on margins as a result of our continuing emphasis on operating efficiencies and cost control, and that's exactly what's happened. 
I'm pleased to report that we've closed now on 3 previously announced acquisitions that have become part of our new Integrated Network Solutions segment. We believe these businesses will help drive revenue growth, margin expansion and increase earnings for Harris in fiscal 2012 and beyond. On April 4, we completed the acquisition of the Schlumberger Global Connectivity Services business. They are a leading provider of satellite and terrestrial communications services for the international energy markets. We also acquired the infrastructure assets from Core180's government business, thereby extending our U.S. terrestrial network capabilities and lowering our cost of operations. These 2 acquisitions have been combined with previously acquired CapRock Communications and the Harris Maritime Communication Services business to create Harris CapRock Communications, a $600 million-plus managed Communications Services business serving government, energy and maritime markets. This business combination positions us as the leading supplier in a high-growth industry. The added scale makes our second only to the U.S. Government as a purchaser of satellite bandwidth, which, along with our plans to rationalize redundant facilities and operations, creates a very rich opportunity for expanding operating margins across the business as we move forward. 
We also completed the acquisition of Carefx, a leading provider of interoperability workflow solutions for government and commercial healthcare providers. Carefx has a broad hospital customer base, providing Harris with increased channel access to the fast-growing commercial healthcare IT market. We'll benefit from increased sales of Carefx solutions, along with cross-selling additional services offered by other Harris businesses. 
Consolidated revenue in the third quarter was  $1.41 billion, 6% higher than the prior year. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, was $149 million or $1.16 per share compared with $170 million, or $1.29 per share, in the prior year. Non-GAAP income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was $294 million in the quarter compared to $310 million in the prior year quarter. This represents a year-over-year decline of about 5% in EBITDA as compared to an EPS decline of 10%. 
Consolidated orders of $1.55 billion exceeded revenue and was 7% higher compared with $1.45 billion in the prior year. This resulted in a consolidated company book-to-bill of $1.1 billion for the third quarter. 
Turning to RF Communications. Third quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $550 million, about flat with the prior year. Prior year expedited shipments of tactical radios to equip MRAP vehicles created a distorted year-over-year comparison. Remember that Harris shipped $1 billion in MRAP program radios over the 5 quarters that ended in 1Q of fiscal 2011. While this is certainly a great testament to our leading radio technology and our commercial business model, this success produced some very tough quarters to beat in an already very successful business. 
Operating income for the RF Communications segment was $179 million compared with non-GAAP operating income of $208 million in the prior year. Again, the prior year benefited from the MRAP shipments previously noted. 
Operating margin in the quarter was very strong at 32.5%. And that's about 50 basis points higher than we had previously expected. And we believe these higher margins are sustainable going forward in fiscal 2012. Our new manufacturing facility is scheduled to be operational in July, further helping us to maintain our low-cost position and supporting healthy margins for the long run. 
Tactical Communications revenue was $431 million in the quarter, about flat with the prior year. And we believe this was an excellent result given the difficult comparison. Deliveries to the MRAP program declined by $206 million year-over-year. Non-MRAP shipments to DoD customers increased significantly due to the adoption of our new Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio. And International revenue increased significantly comprising 1/2 of Tactical Communications' revenue during the third quarter. 
Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $119 million in the third quarter, also flat with the prior year and continuing to reflect the constrained state and local government spending environment. However, we expect recent program wins to begin to drive sequential revenue improvement beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
RF Communications segment orders were $722 million in the quarter with a book-to-bill of $1.3 million, and segment backlog increased to $1.70 billion. Orders for Tactical Communications as part of that total were $351 million with a corresponding book-to-bill of 0.8. Backlog continues to be healthy, with Tactical Communications backlog standing at $981 million at the end of the third quarter. 
U.S. DoD orders were slightly higher than revenue in the quarter, with international orders as expected slightly below revenue. Ongoing instability in the Middle East is likely to push about $100 million in orders previously planned for the back half of fiscal 2011 into fiscal 2012. It's important to note this is simply a timing issue. We haven't lost any orders. But given its likelihood at the present time, backlog at the end of our fiscal year is now expected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million for Tactical Communications. This is still very healthy and continues to support our fiscal 2012 guidance. 
Key orders in the U.S. market during the quarter included $70 million to deliver encryption devices and support services for the Blue Force Tracking system used by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps. Total orders for these encryption devices and support now exceed $100 million. Also, $40 million from the Army for Falcon II HF vehicular systems; $23 million from the Air Force for Falcon III multiband handheld radios; and $9 million from the Army for HF radios for use in the Joint Biological Point Detection System. And this is an important new application for our communication systems. 
The U.S. Department of Defense continues to accelerate its adoption of Harris Falcon III wideband networking radios, embracing our commercial enterprise business model. We continue to believe that legacy communications, which rely on large, heavy, single-band, single-mission radios used primarily for voice, are far beyond their useful life. The modern battlefield, where war fighters have to simultaneously deal with multiple threats, require high-bandwidth network communications capability driven down to individual soldiers. Their increasingly complex missions require video, e-mail, collaborative chat and multiple waveform application availability. The upgrade from narrowband to wideband radios will occur on a large scale, and Harris will continue to lead this transformation. Ultimately, the DoD installed base of legacy radios represents a $10 billion market opportunity for Harris. 
Turning to International. Orders in the quarter came from diverse regions around the world and included multiple types of products and systems. They included $29 million from a country in Asia to provide the next phase of their integrated C4ISR project and a $22 million order from the same country for Falcon III Secure Personal Radios; $19 million from a country in Southeast Asia for Falcon III and Falcon II tactical radios; $11 million from the Australia Department of Defence for Falcon III tactical radios as part of their networked battlefield communication system; $10 million from an international customer to provide a secure tactical network communication system, and this one is comprised of Falcon III, Falcon II, as well as our public safety land mobile radios; a $10 million order from the Afghanistan National Army for Falcon III multiband, handheld tactical radios; and a $5 billion order from a nation in East Africa for Falcon II and Falcon III tactical radios. 
Our fiscal 2012 outlook for Tactical Communications remains solid. We closed the third quarter with healthy opportunity pipelines: $1 billion in the U.S. market and $2.6 billion in international markets. While some of the increase from the previous International pipeline of $2 billion reflects the timing issues I referred to, most of the increase is due to additional new identified opportunities. 
Our expanded regional hubs are playing a key role. In the U.K., we're serving Europe and Western Asia. In the United Arab Emirates, we're serving the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa; our new hub in Australia will be serving throughout Asia-Pacific; and our hub in Miami, Florida providing service to Latin America. Now all of these hubs are increasingly effective in securing new business for Harris. Each locations hosts sales and business development staff, a customer briefing center to show customers the capabilities of our products, along with system engineering and technical support resources. We're also continuing to expand our addressable markets by investing in new international products and by extending our reach into large, integrated communication systems projects. 
Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications in the third quarter were $371 million compared to $168 million in the prior year and included, most notably, a $291 million order to design and deploy the First Responder Radio Communications System throughout Alberta, Canada. This is a province-wide public safety communications network. And also, orders included $15 million from Dane County, Wisconsin to upgrade their public safety communications system with our digital P25 IP solution. 
For the past several quarters, we've seen some opportunities in this market push out due to constrained state and local budgets. But on the positive side, we're finally beginning to see a pickup in new bid and proposal activity, and we view this as a very encouraging sign. Overall, our pipeline of public safety and professional communications opportunities remains large at $3 billion. 
Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment in the quarter was $431 million, up 1% from the prior year. Revenue growth on a pro forma basis was about 7% higher in the quarter, and this is when you exclude the Field Data Collection Automation program for the U.S. Census Bureau, which declined by $24 million year-over-year as expected. Of course, the winding down of the 2010 Census program represents a total of $80 million in year-over-year revenue decline for fiscal 2011 in total. Revenue increased in the quarter on the GOES-R program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as on the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft program for the DoD. 
Slowing U.S. Government spending continued to impact revenue on several of our classified programs. I'll remind you that a portion of our Classified business consists of short-cycle programs. And these were hit particularly hard in the case of a continuing resolution where funding for new programs is not always available. 
Segment operating income in the third quarter was $60 million, and operating margin was very strong at 13.9%. During the third quarter, we achieved several significant program wins in the business. And these included a $15 million delivery order from the Air Force for telemetry modules for the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile program; also, a new 3-year contract to build Ka-band antennas for 3 Inmarsat-5 satellites, which will be the backbone of a worldwide wireless broadband network; and another order for a 3-year contract to build a 22-meter deployable L-band reflectors to support military and civilian communications in Mexico. Together, these programs have a combined value of more than $100 million and illustrate the current strength in the global satellite market; and finally, after the close of the quarter, Harris received an $11 million contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. 
We also introduced an important new capability this quarter we call the KnightHawk 3G. This is our ruggedized mobile tactical base station that, when it's combined with our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio, enables war fighters on the move to maintain cellular services in locations with limited or no connectivity. The KnightHawk 3G allows war fighters to train, fight, communicate more effectively and report to commanders in real time regardless of their location. 
Moving to the new Integrated Network Solutions segment. Revenue in the third quarter grew 23% to $463 million. Organic revenue was about flat compared with the prior year. Broadcast Communications showed strong revenue growth of 9%, while revenue declined in Harris' IT Services business as a result of the slowing U.S. Government spending, including the disruption caused by the continuing resolution. 
Segment non-GAAP operating income was $32 million, 6.8% of sales. Operating income benefited both from acquisitions as well as much-improved performance in Broadcast Communications. Broadcast Communication business was profitable in the quarter and is still on target to be at breakeven for the fiscal year. That's a significant year-over-year improvement. 
These profit improvements were partially offset, however, by an operating loss in the Cyber Integrated Solutions business. We talked about this last quarter as we continued to invest in this large and fast-growing market. Also, we talked about last quarter lower pricing and the contract extension for the Navy Marine Corps intranet program, and that's impacting year-over-year Harris IT Services margins. 
Major Integrated Network Solutions orders or program wins in the quarter included 14 task orders totaling $150 million to provide C-, Ku- and X-band space segment capacity, monitoring and control, teleport services and operations and maintenance to DoD agency customers located around the world. Also, a $15 million contract extension from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for systems engineering services for their VistA imaging application. A $4 million contract to provide local operations and support to the U.S. Army Dental Command at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and internationally at bases in Korea and Germany. 
We received a $9 million order from a country in Central Asia for our broadcast solutions, including master control rooms, production studios, playout and news centers. 
Also in Broadcast, the contract for the installation of an advanced digital out-of-home and IPTV network for the new Madison Square Garden transformation project. More than 1,100 arena displays will deliver a dynamic viewing experience to fans at MSG going forward. This project will commence this summer and be completed for the 2013, 2014 season. 
Continuing orders from traditional U.S. broadcast stations also were received in the quarter, including from Gray Communications, Cox Broadcasting and CBS. And we received a $10 million order from Virtual Computing Environment Corporation (sic) [Company], or VCE, for trusted enterprise cloud solutions. This is an important milestone for our Cyber Integrated Solutions business. 
Harris also recently announced a strategic alliance with VCE and their majority owner, EMC, that's expected to accelerate the growth of cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service. As part of this strategic alliance, development teams from Harris, RSA and VCE are integrating patented Harris technologies within the VCE Vblock infrastructure platform. We expect together to deliver unparalleled levels of visibility, control, security, performance and availability in the cloud environment. EMC and VCE are also actively engaged in joint marketing with Harris to create Trusted Enterprise Cloud services demand. 
Turning to the Healthcare Solutions business. We announced the formation of a joint venture with Johns Hopkins Medicine to develop next-generation, medical imaging management solutions. This collaboration brings together Harris' industry-leading health information capabilities and security technologies with Johns Hopkins renowned clinical expertise. The new image management solutions will be deployed first by the entire Johns Hopkins health system. And later, we'll market this to other hospitals and healthcare providers around the country. 
At our broadcast team, we introduced the new Selenio media convergence platform to the U.S. market at the annual National Association of Broadcasters trade show. With Selenio, Harris introduced the industry's first integrated media convergence platform. Traditional broadcast and IP signal distribution together can require the use of up to 45 different components, 25 rack units of physical space, consume 2,500 watts of power and require 131 connector cables. Now let's compare that to Selenio. Distribution requires one single component, 3 rack units of vertical space, consumes only 600 watts of power and requires only 14 cables. So this is an amazing improvement, and we think will lead to rapid adoption of the new Selenio technology globally across broadcast customers. 
We continue to believe the Integrated Network Support segment is well positioned to deliver future revenue growth and margin expansion. As we discussed during our Analyst Day in March, we expect this segment to grow faster than other segments and achieve margins of 11% to 12% by fiscal 2014. Let me now ask Harris CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on our financial results during the quarter."

Our balance sheet continues to be strong. We ended the quarter with $885 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $552 million was used to fund the acquisitions of Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, both of which closed on April 4, the first day of our fourth quarter. $870 million of the $1.05 billion under our 2 revolving credit facilities is available, and no long-term debt maturities come due until October of 2015. Return on invested capital remained strong at 21%, while return on equity was at 27%. 
During the quarter, we used $50 million to repurchase 1.02 million shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of $49.02 per share, and we currently have $300 million authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was weaker than expected primarily due to timing of U.S. Government funding and payments, decreasing $146 million to $168 million versus $314 million in the third quarter of the prior year. In light of this, we are decreasing our expectation for cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2011 to a range of $775 million to $825 million, back to where we were with guidance as of the end of the first quarter and lower as compared to our most recent guidance of $800 million to $850 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $52 million as compared to $40 million for the third quarter of 2010, while capital expenditures were $88 million for the third quarter as compared to $94 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Including the acquisitions of Schlumberger GCS and Carefx, our guidance for depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures are both increasing by $5 million to ranges of $210 million to $220 million and $325 million to $345 million, respectively. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 31.7%, and our outlook for the full year tax rate for fiscal 2011 now is 33%. Our initial outlook for 2012 full year tax rate is 33.5%, however, the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. Other areas of guidance for fiscal 2012 are as follows: cash flow from operations, $850 million to $900 million dollars; depreciation and amortization $280 million to $290 million; capital expenditures, including capitalized software of $275 million to $300 million. 
Our current priorities for cash that is expected to be generated remain the same: funding internal investments to drive growth and generate higher earnings, pay appropriate dividends, acquire companies that meet our strategic objectives and enhance financial returns and repurchase shares. 
In summary, we expect to finish fiscal 2011 on a very strong financial foundation with expectations for another very solid year in fiscal 2012. Let me now turn it back to you, Howard."

Let me close with discussion about fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 guidance. We've updated our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 as follows.

We've updated our financial guidance for fiscal 2011 as follows.  Consolidated revenue is now expected to be approximately $5.9 billion, and that's about 13% above fiscal 2010. That compares to our previously expected revenue target of about $6 billion.  Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is unchanged from our previous guidance, still expected to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 8% to 11%. Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, again excluding acquisition-related costs and expenses, are now expected to be in a range from $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion, representing an EBITDA increase of 11% to 13% above fiscal 2010. 
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2011 guidance is unchanged. I'll just remind you that revenue is expected to be 9% to 10% higher than the prior year, and operating margin for the full year expected to be between 34% and 35%. 
For Government Communications Systems, we now expect revenue for 2011 to be flat to 2% higher in fiscal 2010. Previous range was 3% to 5% higher. Segment operating margin is it still expected to be between 12.5% and 13%. 
And for the Integrated Network Solutions segment, we now expect revenue in a range of 33% to 35% higher than fiscal 2010, and that compares to our previous range of 36% to 38%. And again, it's due to the government budget impact at Harris IT Services. Organic growth is now expected to be in a range of 4% to 6% over the prior year. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is now expected to be a bit higher at 5% to 7%. Previous margin guidance was in a range of 5% to 6%. 
So that's a recap of 2011. Let me now move on to fiscal 2012. You'll recall we initiated guidance for 2012 in March. And today, I'll update that guidance, provide more color around our 3 operating segments. 
Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2012 is expected to be between 7% and 10% higher than fiscal 2011, with revenue between $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is still expected to be in a range of $5.10 to $5.20 per diluted share. So no change in our guidance for non-GAAP EPS. And this range represents a year-over-year increase of 5% to 7%. 
Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition-related costs, is expected to be in a  range from $1.34 billion to $1.38 billion. That's a strong year-over-year increase in EBITDA of 9% to 12%. 
Turning to color around the segments. For RF Communications, fiscal 2012 revenue is expected to be 2% to 4% higher than fiscal 2011. With Tactical Communications business, about flat with the prior year, reflecting lower DoD revenue, as we indicated at the March Analyst Meeting, and, correspondingly, higher International revenue. Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue is also expected to be higher in 2012. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range from 32% to 33%. 
For the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2012 to be 3% to 5% higher than fiscal 2011. Segment operating margins are expected to be about 13%. And for our new Integrated Network Solutions segment, we expect revenue in a range of 18% to 20% higher than fiscal 2011, representing organic growth in a range of 9% to 11% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is expected to be between 6% and 8%. That's about 100 basis points above fiscal 2011 expectations. We expect margins to grow faster in this segment beyond fiscal 2012 when the recent acquisitions have been fully integrated and we receive the full benefits of integration. With that, I will stop. I'll ask the operator to open the line, and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

So it's a series of relatively small things, but they add up to about $100 million. We expect to get those orders in the first half of next year. And we're not expecting that any of those will have a material impact on fiscal year '12. We will start the year with a little less backlog but still very adequate backlog and order pipeline to reach the guidance we've provided for the year-over-year, essentially maintaining our revenue with DoD lower as we've been talking now for several quarters, offset by higher International business."

We'll have the new manufacturing facility online, significantly more capacity in place. And so I think we're going to benefit from that new facility both in terms of being able to turn orders into revenue quickly but also turn orders into revenue at even more competitive cost. So at this point, not concerned. And as we go forward to the next call and get into the fiscal year, we'll talk about any seasonality that we expect in terms of how we expect to deliver on the comparable Tactical Communications revenue.

Secondly, we've recently seen a request for information kind of out of the JTRS JPEO office, essentially asking for what they call nondevelopmental solutions for the GMR specification. Translated in our view, meaning already developed, commercially developed technologies. Again, we think we're the only ones in a position to really meet the full spec and the time frame that they will want so that we can continue to deploy technologies to the brigade combat teams in Afghanistan and around the world. So I certainly like our position more and more as it relates to the Falcon III technology. And then, finally, remember we're going to be porting the SRW waveform very quickly into the Falcon III handheld, and so we're going to have some amount of networking capability using the SRW networking waveform even in the handheld. And you couple that with the announcement we made on the KnightHawk 3G capability to link battlefield tactical networks to 3G cellular networks, and I just believe we continue to widen the lead that we have.

So you have this huge market in DoD that will be upgraded and transformed over time, and it's really just a question of when. We believe that the capabilities that we are providing will accelerate the adoption. When you see what the radios can do, it continually impresses the leadership in DoD, which causes them to become proponents of investing budget dollars in these tactical radio deployments because they lead to more effective missions and ultimately save lives.

And almost a week doesn't go by that we hear of another cyber -- successful cyber attack or issues related to security, for example taking down one of the Amazon cloud computing sites. So I am more convinced every week that we're exactly in the right place, and we're developing discriminating technology. On the flipside, the adoption of cloud computing is hard to predict and whether -- and what the uptake of orders and turning that into revenue for us, which ultimately would drive profitability is still an estimate. And I think we'll be monitoring very closely our funnel. We'll be monitoring the uptake of new orders. We are off to a good start but have pretty high expectations for '12 and beyond. So we'll pay close attention to that. But overall, I don't believe this is a question of if we will be successful or cloud computing will take off or security and access to what's going on and compliance inside your cloud will be required. I think its more a question of when and what will the actual uptake be with the new market. That's sometimes difficult to peg. But there's no question interest is high, lots of meetings, lots of proposals, and then we'll have to see how those work through the funnel and turn into revenue. We have a pretty high fixed cost in that business. Once we get above that, it's going to leverage profitability very, very well. But we've got to get to that breakeven point first."

And neither of them are hugely capital intensive, a little more capital intensive than our traditional businesses at Harris but still relatively low capital. And it has a lot to do with whether the customer rolls into the monthly costs for providing services, the very small aperture antenna terminal or not. And the more they include that, then the more the capital is a little bit higher. Other customers sometimes prefer to pay for that, capitalize it themselves, and then just buy the various services from us. So there is a variety. But I wouldn't expect it to be materially different across those 2 businesses as we put them together. We are still engaged, and you may also be thinking about discussions we've had about kind of the make-or-buy question. CapRock traditionally bought VSATs and Schlumberger GCS, designed and manufactured their own line of VSATs.

And to remind you with these programs, I think it's pretty typical, what we will be doing during the initial deployment phases is putting in the systems and the infrastructure along with our partners. That's typically a little lower margin business. And then toward the end of it are the opportunities to sell the terminals, both portable as well as mobile, and much higher margin opportunities. So we'll expect to see pickup in revenue, certainly profitability, but not at the level we'll ultimately get to when we're able to deploy the terminals into the completed system. So at any given time, we've got a large number of these projects at different phases. But given that we took over the business, it wasn't growing all that much. We've had good success in growing it. We still have a lot of programs that are kind of toward the front end of that cycle. I think we talked about that previously as it relates to our margins. So some of the margin uptake in this business that's going to feed into the segment is going to come from the mix of what we're selling. Not necessarily that there's a lot of costs coming out but more that as the mix gets higher for selling terminals or radios, the margins are going to be better than when you're selling a higher percentage of systems."

So the day to day add-on sales for an additional base station, for more capacity or more radios for more people we're not seeing. That's where budgets are absolutely being constrained because of state and local revenue income. On the other hand, the big projects continue to move along. Many of them are already funded, either funded through federal grants or they're funded through revenue-producing kinds of services or fee-based. In Florida, for example, the statewide network, its income from licenses of various kinds. So there's still a number that are out there. There are still a lot of very old technology, analog technology that needs to be upgraded. There's still a requirement for going to this narrow banding so they can give up frequency for the other uses. And then, finally, you've got the opportunity being offered by the introduction of this LTE fourth generation of broadband technology. And we think we're going to be in a very strong position to integrate, converge networks of LTE 4G for wideband along with our traditional narrowband LMR radio technology. So we're feeling very positive about the market. We wish that the state and local funds were a little clear as it related to the higher margin add-on kind of business. But overall, I think we're very pleased with the progress we've made since we bought the business. Have some new leadership in place. Very pleased with how that is coming along.

But it's a very good cross-section, and I think real opportunities. You can imagine I'm a skeptic when I see that kind of an increase. And we've scrubbed the pipeline to make sure it's real, and we're very comfortable that it is. To your first point in terms of the FY '11, Gary talked about a little better on the tax rate, and we also raised about 100 basis points, the expectation for the new Integrated Network Solutions return on sales for '11. So that's offsetting the margins associated with the $100 million in revenue in government programs and IT services. We haven't provided that level of detail in '12.

To provide added clarity to the call, this time we've posted some slides on our website, and we'll be referring to them throughout the conference call. Begin",3613,"Thank you, Pam, and let me welcome all of you to our fourth quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call.  To provide added clarity to the call, this time we've posted some slides on our website, and we'll be referring to them throughout the conference call. 
Beginning first with Slide 3 and 4. We ended fiscal 2011 with another solid quarter. Revenue was $1.67 billion, increasing 15%. Organic revenue growth was 4%, and that was driven by 11% growth in our Government Communications Systems segment and 7% growth in our new Integrated Network Solutions segment. Flat year-over-year revenue in RF Communications was, we think, an excellent outcome for this business as we make our way beyond the large tactical radio shipments in the prior year to equip MRAP vehicles. The first quarter of fiscal 2012 will be our last tough compare as we reset our baseline for future growth. 
We certainly highlights in the quarter as our Public Safety and Professional communications business posted strong revenue growth of 9% and a record quarter end backlog of the $737 million. Our move into this very close adjacent market during fiscal 2009 is contributing nicely to both our revenue growth and higher operating income. The Broadcast Communications business posted 37% growth in orders, 31% growth in revenue and a solid profit. Harris IT Services posted 8% top line growth and higher profitability. And Harris CapRock Communications delivered a solid rocket number in the quarter. 
On the downside, our new initiatives in Healthcare and Cyber will take time to contribute to earnings. Both businesses had operating losses in the quarter. And about $100 million in International Tactical Communications orders slipped to the right as a result of political uncertainty in Central Asia, the Middle East and Northern Africa. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.24 in the quarter and flat with the prior year. Of course, again, the prior year benefited significantly from the large MRAP shipments. Fourth quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA was $320 million, and that was a 7% increase. We think this is a very encouraging sign for future earnings growth. Throughout fiscal 2012, we should see this upward trend in EBITDA continue as we finish integrating the new acquisition and may begin to significantly contribute to our growth and higher earnings. 
For the full fiscal year 2011, revenue was $5.92 billion, an increase of 14% and about a 5% higher on an organic basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.89, an increase of 10%, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.23 billion, an increase of 11%. We are incredibly proud of these results delivered by our team, especially in the year where we faced an extended U.S. government continuing budget resolution, lower MRAP shipments, lower state and local government spending and a drilling moratorium for part of the year in the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time this challenges were occurring, we increased the investments in new vertical market growth initiatives, which we believe will be a major driver of long-term growth and higher earnings for the company. 
Moving now to the segment results. First, on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenues for the RF Communications segment was $628 million, as indicated flat with the prior year. Large shipments of tactical radios in the prior year to equip MRAP vehicles continue to create difficult year-over-year comparisons for both revenue and income. As expected, operating income in the fourth quarter was lower at $191 million compared with non-GAAP operating income in the prior year quarter of $227 million. Operating margins in the fourth quarter were 30.4%. Our new manufacturing facility in Rochester, New York is up and running ahead of schedule, and we're back at full production. The new facility consolidates multiple facilities into 1 location, reducing production cycle times and creating a number of operational efficiencies. We now have a single facility on sufficient size, layout and capabilities to fully implement the lean processes that we need to further reduce our product cost. The new facility will provide cost savings and creates a state-of-the-art, high-volume manufacturing capability for products across the RF segment, including our unity mobile radio, which is newly introduced to the market and our 700 megahertz LTE subscriber terminals. 
Tactical Communications revenue was $472 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of 3% compared with the prior year. Again, we believe this was an excellent result given that MRAP radio deliveries declined by $200 million year-over-year. If we look at the non-MRAP revenue to the Department of Defense, it actually increased significantly in the quarter driven by continuing Falcon III product adoption to support the DoD vision for wideband networking throughout the battlefield and arm forces. International revenue growth was driven in the quarter by major deliveries to the Australian Ministry of Defense and a number of countries in the Middle East and Asia. Public Safety and professional Communications revenue was $156 million in the fourth quarter, as indicated, increasing 9% compared to the prior year. A series of important contract wins led to the best quarter since acquiring this business in fiscal 2009. 
Turning to orders, RF segment orders were $447 million in the quarter, with Tactical Communications orders accounting for $257 million of this total. Our Tactical Communications backlog stood at $766 million at the end of the year. Ongoing political instability in Northern Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia has continued to delay some of our international orders. While the delays are certainly unfortunate in the near-term, they will get sorted out eventually. And we're confident that our business will benefit in the long term from this business. 
In the U.S. market, important orders during the quarter included $25 million from RAIDCore, for Falcon III radios and remote control systems, $18 million for Falcon II, HF vehicular radio systems for Army vehicles, several orders for our Falcon III 117G multiband manpack radios, and these included $12 million from DoD in support of requirements for wideband networking, $16 million from the Army to provide ground forces with expanded interoperable voice and high-bandwidth data communications and $9 million from the Air Force in support of new emerging applications in situational awareness, intelligence and analysis, and realtime battlefield collaboration. And we're also awarded an IDIQ contract with a $60 million ceiling from the Navy for our new technical key loader encryption devices, along with the initial order against that contract of $6 million. 
Consistent with our roadmap, we are introducing additional features and functionality to our Falcon III JTRS product offering. This will widen our technology and product lead in the U.S. market and equally importantly, this lead ultimately fuels our continued leadership in international markets. 
First, we expect to receive NSA certification in the next few weeks for the SRW waveform in our Falcon III 117G wideband networking manpack radio, and shipments will begin to customers immediately thereafter. As promised, we will be first to market with NSA-certified radio incorporating SRW the soldier radio waveform for JTRS. At the same time, we expect to receive NSA certification for and begin shipping our Falcon III AN/PRC-152A handheld radio, which will have new wideband networking capability using the Harris ANW2 waveform. And then shortly down the road in October, we'll begin demonstrations where we will include the SW waveform also in the 152A. So we're going to and up with a very, very capable JTRS handheld radio. That's going to include the SRW, waveform, the ANW2 waveform and Type-1 NSA certification, and of course, remember that 152A is also backward compatible with legacy radio waveforms in the field such as CINGARS. 
Now for second, compare that with the new rifleman radio. Rifleman really has a very narrow mission, to provide position location information up echelon using the SRW waveform. For example, it doesn't have wideband capability or NSA Type-1 capability, nor does it have the ability to communicate with legacy radio using waveforms such as CINGARS where there's over 400,000 units deployed in the field. We think this creates a significant differentiation, and once again, Harris takes the lead with radio technology. 
In June and July, Harris was invited to participate for the first time in the U.S. Army Network Integration Evaluation or NIE exercise, held at Fort Worth, Texas and Whiteside Missile Range in Mexico. The NIE is a series of semiannual evaluations designed to evaluate the Army's tactical network capabilities and to promote competition among the multiple programs of record and viable commercial solutions, and this is all part of the Army's evolving network acquisition strategy. The NIE involve a series of user test and evaluations with the goal to speed to deployment of an integrated battlefield network while making sure the technologies are ready for primetime use in the field by the war fighter. I'm pleased to say that Harris delivered its combat-proven wideband networking capability to the Falcon III 117G as part of the evaluation. The Army evaluated our 117G radios as a vehicular-based, mobile, wideband tactical communications network, enabling this network to Harris ANW2 wideband waveform. Our radio successfully form a 30-node network across a range of military vehicles, including company command post platforms and provided reliable access to a number of applications such as the tactical ground reporting system, combat chat and the transfer of multimedia mission command files. It was a major success in our view. We received great user feedback and valuable insights in to both our radio and waveform functionality, and we'll be quickly incorporating this insights in to our future product releases. We will expand our participation in the next NIE scheduled for October, and this will include incorporation of the Falcon III 117G with SRW and the Falcon III 152A handheld with both the SRW and the ANW2 waveforms. Bottom line, we came away from the series of test more convinced than ever that our radios are, in fact, the most advanced in the world. No competing radios come close to delivering the performance and cost that we can offer our customers. 
Turning to international orders in the quarter, with a $16 million order from a country in Africa to provide HF radios, a $10 million order from a country in Southeast Asia for Falcon III and Falcon II tactical radios, a $5 million order from Brazil for Falcon III VHF tactical radios. These will provide the Brazilian Armed Forces with next-generation voice and high-speed data communications. Also a $5 million order from Canada for Falcon III 117G multiband manpack radios, as well as our RF 7800B tactical satellite communication system. These systems will provide Brazilian Armed Forces with next-generation tactical comms in support of a number of network enabled applications, including video and collaborative chat. And finally, we receive $4 million follow-on order from France for the 117G. The 117G is quickly becoming the radio of choice by all of our NATO allies for their high-end mission requirements. 
We closed the fourth quarter with a healthy opportunity pipeline in the Tactical Communications business. $1 billion in the U.S. and $2.3 billion in international. Large opportunities in the U.S. pipeline exists for follow-on business to the Falcon III radios in the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force. Also, the U.S. pipeline includes opportunities, which will be procured through new IDIQ contracts that which we expect imminently for the Navy and the Special Operations command. The international pipeline is highlighted by significant opportunities with the Iraq Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense, the Australia Ministry of Defense, United Arab Emirates, as well as other nations in Africa, Asia and Southeast Asia. As we stated before, some orders have been delayed in the international market during the last 2 quarters but none have been lost to competition. We've already indicated that a Public Safety and Professional Communications had a great quarter. Orders in the fourth quarter were $190 million, higher than the prior year quarter and certainly, also had a book-to-bill of greater than one. Orders included a $50 million order from the Oregon Department of Transportation to deliver a new P-25 system, which will support their mission-critical communication needs of as well as the Oregon State Police. This program includes 4,200 unity multiband mobile radios and will be the first large-scale deployment of our new vehicular version of the Unity radio. This is a very important extension of the Unity family of multiband radios and of course, Unity allows interoperability across a much wider band of frequencies than any other radio in the market. The program in Oregon also includes an integrated statewide network, which will allow Oregon to comply with the federal narrowbanding mandate that is governing spectrum use for land, mobile radio systems. And the initial $50 million orders part of a 10-year contract that is expected to have a total value of more than $100 million. 
We also received 3 other significant orders we want to call out in the quarter, $24 million from Floyd County Georgia for a P25 IP digital radio system, an $18 million order from Dane County, Iowa, again, for a P25 IP trunked radio system, and again, this contract includes the Harris Unity multiband portable radios as well. And then finally, a $12 million order from the city of Chicago Office Of Emergency Management Communications for our Maestro dispatch consoles. 
In summary, we continue to see a steady recovery in new bid and proposal activity in the Public Safety markets, and our pipeline of opportunities for this business remains very large at $3 billion. Let me move on now to Slide 6 and talk about our Integrated Network Solutions segment. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 45% to $585 million, and of course, benefited from the acquisitions of CapRock Communications and the Schlumberger Global Connectivity Services business. But we also have strong performance on an organic basis with revenue growing by 7% above the prior year. Our Broadcast Communications business showed excellent revenue growth with 31%. Harris IT Services revenue increased by 8%. Revenue from Harris CapRock Communications was about flat with the prior year on a pro forma basis. Segment non-GAAP operating income was much higher, $32 million or 5.5% of sales. Income benefited from the vastly improved performance in Broadcast Communications compared to the prior year. Broadcast was profitable in the quarter and for the fiscal year in total, following the market downturn experienced over the past couple of years. Harris CapRock Communications and Harris IT Services income were also were well above the prior quarter. 
Our Healthcare and Cyber businesses posted a combined $16 million loss in the quarter as a result of the Carefx acquisition and the opening of our Cyber Integration Center in Virginia and its related depreciation and overhead expense. Several new contract wins in the quarter worth mentioning, a 3-year master service agreement with the potential value of $58 million to operate the offshore communications backbone in the Eastern Mediterranean. First year the agreement is worth up to $22 million. We signed a 2-year, $13 million contract to provide offshore satellite communications with drilling in Norway. This included a provision of turnkey VSAT services, voice and Internet services. It's a significant expansion of our existing business with and we think demonstrates the value of both our local presence and very strong client relationships. We also were awarded 2, 3-year contracts valued at $3 million from Debit Energy in Brazil for a telecommunications and professional services. Energy is a leading independent natural gas and oil exploration company. We also received a 5-year IDIQ contract, which has a very large ceiling of $12 billion from the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is associated with what they call their T4 program, a transformation 21 total technology, allowing the VU to upgrade their IT systems, that will streamline and modernize their operations, including patient care delivery at over 150 VA hospitals. We also received a 2-year, blanket purchase agreement with a ceiling of $199 million from the VA for a separate initiative called Enhance the Veteran Experience and Access to Healthcare. Here, the goal of the VA is to expand healthcare access for veterans who reside in rural areas. And in the Broadcast division, we received orders totaling $16 million in the quarter from Turkmenistan Television, the state broadcaster in the country. This project will comprise a full range of broadcast solutions from Harris. And the seamless interoperability of our solutions, we believe, was the determining factor in the contract award. We're continuing our global integration efforts at Harris CapRock Communications. During the quarter, we announced Tom Eaton as President of this business. Tom has a remarkable track record in positioning businesses for the next phase of growth. We also officially opened during the quarter the new Harris Cyber Integration Center in Virginia. This center will provide cloud computing services for customers within a trusted interested environment. Cyber Integration Center has already won national awards for its energy efficiency and innovation. And we continue our collaboration with leading IT companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Sendmail, Red Hat, BNC and VCE, who continue to see partnership with Harris, and we believe this continues to validate with our technology and our security differentiation. 
In the near-term, however, we are experiencing a much longer selling cycle in the Cyber business than we have previously expected. Customers are beginning with a small pilot projects and proofs-of-concept before moving their larger application into the crowd. This will allow the effect of postponing revenue and income out of our fiscal 2012 into fiscal 2013, resulting in a fiscal 2012 operating loss for Cyber currently estimated at about $30 million. Obviously, we're taking steps to improve at outcome, and we'll keep you posted on future calls. 
In the Healthcare Solutions business, we completed the acquisition of Carefx Corporation at the beginning of fourth quarter. Carefx brings interoperable workflow and clinical analytics solutions to the Harris Healthcare portfolio. Terratec solutions are aimed at enabling improved operating efficiencies and access to vital clinical data within hospitals. Let me give you an example. Hartford Hospital in Connecticut recently implemented a business intelligent dashboard from Carefx to better understand their patient flow trends and to cut the patient length of stay. Hartford increased its early discharge rate nearly threefold after implementing our dashboard. This kinds of success stories will continue to help Harris Healthcare Solutions penetrate the commercial healthcare market and strengthen its overall position as a leading provider and interoperability solutions to both commercial and government customers. 
In Broadcast Communications, international broadcast sales and growth in New Media are both driving higher revenue. In addition to the orders already mentioned for Turkmenistan, we're experiencing orders growth in Asia and Latin America, and we recently installed our first digital signage system in the U.K. at Harris. In the U.S., we're in collaboration with digital Display Networks Inc. and ABC to create one of the largest digital out of home advertising networks in the world, 711 TV. Digital Display Networks is providing content production. ABC as the sales agent for advertising, and Harris is providing its infocast or hardware and punctuate software, along with our managed services and content delivery capabilities. We're already installed in over 3,000, 711 stores. Promotional advertising content has been successfully running on a network for several months. ABC has secured a number of new ad sales and is managing a solid pipeline for the future. Bottom line, we remain very excited about this project in the emerging digital out-of-home market in general. 
In summary, we continue to be enthusiastic with the future of the new Integrated Network Solutions segment. As the integration of our new acquisitions and the maturing of our new business occurs, INS will, in fact, be a major driver of Harris EPS growth going forward. 
Moving to Slide 7, Government Communications Systems segment revenue was a $500 million in the fourth quarter, an excellent 11% growth from the prior year. Revenue increases were driven by the GOES-R program from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by our new product line high-back networking radios for the U.S. Army and by satellite reflector programs for several commercial customers. Segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $63 million with margins at a strong 12.7% of sales. Fourth quarter wins in Government Communications included a $19 million follow-on contract to supply more than 100 Harris high-band networking radios systems for the Army, war fighter information network tactical OFC program. This order is an addition $6 million contract award from the Army during the quarter for rapid deployment of H&R radios into Afghanistan. This Harris product really redefines battlefield communications with high-capacity wireless networking between both the mobile and fixed platforms. Using a breakthrough radio waveform and directed beam antenna technology, the Harris H&R establishes a self-forming, self-healing mesh network, capable of delivering voice, video and data over very large geographic areas. 
In the quarter, we also received a 42-month $57 million follow-on contract -- $57 million follow-on contract with the FAA. This is to upgrade and manage the system that provides realtime weather data in-flight planning for Alaska General Aviation. We also received 2, 1-year classified contracts totaling $83 million, and a 4-year, $32 million classified contract in addition. So our National Intelligence business is definitely increasing. After the close of the quarter, Harris was selected for a 10-year, $85 million contract award from the FAA as a prime contractor to the Alaska Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure program. Harris will replace and upgrade the existing SATCOM network that links the Alaska Air Route Traffic Control Center in Alaska -- Anchorage, Alaska with 64 other FAA facilities throughout the region. So with that, let me now turn it over to our CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on the financial results for the quarter."

We ended of the year, with $367 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We generated $833 million of operating cash flow, $508 million of free cash flow, repurchased $250 million of our outstanding stock and paid $127 million in dividends. None of our outstanding long-term debt comes due prior to October 2015. And as of year end, we had $870 million available under our $1 billion and $50 million, combined credit facilities. After the fourth quarter, cash flow generated from operating activities was $276 million as compared to $167 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and capital expenditures were $129 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $62 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The $67 million higher capital expenditures resulted primarily from the fadeout of our new RF manufacturing facility that is now fully up and operational, the Cyber Security Solutions facility was grand opening was in late May and capital expenditures at INS as a result of the CapRock and Schlumberger acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was $63 million for fourth quarter as compared to $45 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.5%. 
During the quarter, we increased our share buyback to $100 million. We purchased 2 million shares at an average purchase price of $48.83 per share. Total shares repurchased during fiscal 2011 were $5.3 million or 4.2% of our outstanding shares. As announced in our press release, we replaced our existing share repurchase program with $1 billion new program under which we expect to repurchase up to $500 million worth of our shares largely by the end of this calendar year or roughly 8% to 9% of the shares outstanding. Further, we announced a 12% dividend increase that takes our quarterly dividend from $0.25 to $0.28, our 10th year in a row of double-digit increases. 
Moving to Slide 9, we revised guidance for fiscal 2012 as follows: Cash flow from operations in a range of $825 million to $875 million; depreciation and amortization of $280 million to $290 million; and capital expenditures, including capitalized software of $265 million to $285 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be 33% compared with our prior guidance of 33.5%, for tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax event occurring therein. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength, which allows us to invest for the future while delivering significant value to our shareholders in the forms of share repurchases and higher dividends. Our outlook for operating cash flow remain strong, and fiscal 2012 should be another year of solid financial returns. Back to you, Howard."

Let me conclude my prepared remarks and talk about a 2012 outlook, utilizing Slides 10 and 11. We are updating our financial guidance for fiscal 2012 with consolidated revenue now expected to be between 4% and 6% higher than fiscal 2011, a r",431,"Thanks, Gary. Let me conclude my prepared remarks and talk about a 2012 outlook, utilizing Slides 10 and 11. We are updating our financial guidance for fiscal 2012 with consolidated revenue now expected to be between 4% and 6% higher than fiscal 2011, a revenue between $6.15 billion and $6.3 billion. 
Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs is now expected to be in a range from $5.10 to $5.30 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 4% to 8%. The changes between our prior outlook and current outlook reflect lower revenue and income in International Tactical Communications, as well as increased losses in our Cyber business, offset by higher expected income in Government Communications, a slightly lower tax rate and the positive impact from our new share repurchase plan. We'll certainly have a clearer picture of the timing of international orders and revenue as we move through the next 2 quarters, which will help to tighten our EPS range going forward. 
Now our current view to the distribution of EPS in fiscal 2012 is about 40% of earnings in the first half and about 60% of the earnings in the second half, with the first quarter EPS in a range of $1 to $1.05 per share. Back to the full year guidance, adjusted EBITDA as expected to be in a range of from $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion, that's a year-over-year increase of 4% to 8% in line with revenue. For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2012 revenue is expected to be 3% to 6% lower than fiscal 2011, reflecting the timing of international orders turning into revenue. So the new guidance now anticipates decline in Tactical Communications revenue of about 10% year-over-year versus our previous flat year-over-year revenue guidance. We continue to expect double-digit growth in Public Safety and Professional Communications. And our segment operating margins are now expected to be in the 33% to 34% range. For our Integrated Network Solutions segment, we expect revenue to be at a range of 16% to 18% higher than fiscal 2011, and that represents organic growth in a range of 7% and 9% higher. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is expected to be between 5.5% to 6.5%, which includes the anticipated operating losses of about $30 million in our Cyber business. And finally, for the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2012 to be 2% to 4% higher than fiscal 2011, and segment operating margins are expected to be about 13.5% of revenue. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line, and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

As we look back acquisitions, we've made a number of acquisitions in fiscal '11, and the focus of fiscal '12 is very much on integrating those acquisitions and delivering on the promise of them, as well as the ones that have gone previously like the Public Safety business, which as you see is really starting to pick up steam. We certainly feel that a double-digit increase in our dividend rate is consistent with what we've done in the past as the target our payout ratio, north of 20%, and this will be consistent with that. And so when we look the cash flow that we're going to generate from operating cash, less our needs for the requirements for CapEx, we felt that the current valuation of shares that this was a very appropriate deployment of cash and makes a strong statement about the board and management's view of the future earnings potential for the company. Whether this becomes the court norm or not, beyond that, I think remains to be seen. But the fact that we do have a $1 billion authorization suggest that there is another $500 million tranche that's going to be a repurchase beyond fiscal year '12."

It's really been everything that you see going on across the region over what's been a very tumultuous 6-month period, and it's primarily politically-driven. It's really not at all driven by expectations of somehow a lower security risk or lower need for these communications. So we're certainly frustrated now 2 quarters in a row to see about $100 million each quarter of orders pushed out. But the good news is that we haven't lost any orders, and I actually think our product position is even strengthening as time goes on.

In this segment it's only about 100 basis points, so how we've done that? Well, number one, Public Safety and Professional Communications business return on sales or margins are moving significantly higher. If you go back 2 years, Gary and I talked about guidance in that business, and we are now starting to see the top line and the bottom line move. And so it's becoming, as a result, less dilutive to the segment. Secondly, our new manufacturing facility and a number of other operational and cost-reduction actions are allowing us to actually maintain very, very high margins in the RF segment. Fourth quarter was a little bit of an anomaly. We used the opportunity to accelerate some R&D by using some contract engineering, not only inside but outside the company. And so the previous quarter, I think, for the segment was 32.5%. So Q4 was a little bit of an anomaly and sometimes happens in quarters. But the bottom line is, that we feel very confident in the 33% to 34% guidance we're providing, and it does not involve a major reduction in R&D, but rather, focuses heavily on actions at the gross margin line in both Tactical, as well as a significant progress being made in Public Safety."

On the flip side though, money is available for these large modernization programs. And we have one 4 or 5 large ones over the last several quarters we've announced. These have all the competitive. And I think a combination of 3 factors is allowing us to win. Certainly, we have to be competitive on price, but we don't need to have the lowest overall price by a significant amount. We are viewed as having a very competitive and often superior technology in support. And thirdly, the Harris brand that's now wrapped around the Public Safety business has created a lot of demand and a lot of traction for competitive bids in this market. So I think you put those factors together and a strong and even upgraded management team at ESPC, and we certainly like the momentum that seems to be building in that market. Having said that, certainly, it's competitive. And in the day-to-day replacement and upgrade business, budgets are tight."

Back in March, we talked about the investments that we've made in capital for the facility, the upgrade, for all of our initial tranche of customer-facing equipment, kind of in the $175 million to $200 million range. And that would ultimately be able to drive revenue about $80 million and nice profitability with maybe $50 million of revenue or so being as the break even point, given the expenses that we have and we have people operating the business and the depreciation and amortization on the investments. So that's kind of where we we're sitting. We thought that in FY '12 we would have enough momentum to get to that level and kind of be plus or minus or breakeven. My assessment now is that's going to be probably pushed out a year. I don't believe that we would have lost a significant amount of business. I think we were just in the category of start-up. We started up the business and opened the center a little later than we have planned, and just didn't allow enough time in our planning for what was going to be channel development. We're starting to work with our partners on developing prospects. And then the time to close, once we had a prospect, is turning out to be much longer. People are just going to be a little more cautious, especially about taking their business to the cloud in an outside cloud, as opposed to they may take it to a cloud faster in our own operations than outsource it to someone else. And again, we were focused -- we are focused on really mission-critical, very high-end applications. And so in hindsight, we were just too optimistic in how quickly this was going to turn. We're still very convinced this is going to be a very large market, one that suits Harris well and one that we ought to be able to generate $100 million of very profitable revenue from. But we are not starting out where we'd hoped. We lost, as we already had indicated, in excess of $20 million in fiscal '11. And now we're estimated it's $30 million for fiscal '12. So I think it's -- unfortunately, like sometimes newmarket entries, you don't know what you don't know. You make assumptions. You find out sometimes you're right. In this case, we weren't, and so we have to make that into our updated guidance for next year."

To provide added clarity to the call, this time we've posted some slides on our website, and we'll be referring to those throughout the conference call. Begin",3619,"Thank you, Pam, and let me welcome all of you to our fourth quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call. To provide added clarity to the call, this time we've posted some slides on our website, and we'll be referring to those throughout the conference call. 
Beginning first with Slides 3 and 4. We ended fiscal 2011 with another solid quarter. Revenue was $1.67 billion, increasing 15%. Organic revenue growth was 4%, and that was driven by 11% growth in our Government Communications Systems segment and 7% growth in our new Integrated Network Solutions segment. Flat year-over-year revenue in RF Communications was, we think, an excellent outcome for this business as we make our way beyond the large tactical radio shipments in the prior year to equip MRAP vehicles. The first quarter of fiscal 2012 will be our last tough compare as we reset our baseline for future growth. 
There were certainly highlights in the quarter as our Public Safety and Professional Communications business posted strong revenue growth of 9% and a record quarter end backlog of the $737 million. Our move into this very close adjacent market during fiscal 2009 is contributing nicely to both our revenue growth and higher operating income. The Broadcast Communications business posted 37% growth in orders, 31% growth in revenue and a solid profit. Harris IT Services posted 8% top line growth and higher profitability. And Harris CapRock Communications delivered a solid profit number in the quarter. 
On the downside, our new initiatives in Healthcare and Cyber will take time to contribute to earnings. Both businesses had operating losses in the quarter. And about $100 million in International Tactical Communications orders slipped to the right as a result of political uncertainty in Central Asia, the Middle East and Northern Africa. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.24 in the quarter and flat with the prior year. Of course, again, the prior year benefited significantly from the large MRAP shipments. Fourth quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA was $320 million, and that was a 7% increase. We think this is a very encouraging sign for future earnings growth. Throughout fiscal 2012, we should see this upward trend in EBITDA continue as we finish integrating the new acquisitions and they begin to significantly contribute to our growth and higher earnings. 
For the full fiscal year 2011, revenue was $5.92 billion, an increase of 14% and about a 5% higher on an organic basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.89, an increase of 10%, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.23 billion, an increase of 11%. We are incredibly proud of these results delivered by our team, especially in the year where we faced an extended U.S. government continuing budget resolution, lower MRAP shipments, lower state and local government spending and a drilling moratorium for part of the year in the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time these challenges were occurring, we increased our investments in new vertical market growth initiatives, which we believe will be a major driver of long-term growth and higher earnings for the company. 
Moving now to the segment results. First, on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $628 million, as indicated, flat with the prior year. Large shipments of tactical radios in the prior year to equip MRAP vehicles continue to create difficult year-over-year comparisons for us in both revenue and income. As expected, operating income in the fourth quarter was lower at $191 million compared with non-GAAP operating income in the prior year quarter of $227 million. Operating margins in the fourth quarter were 30.4%. 
Our new manufacturing facility in Rochester, New York is up and running, ahead of schedule and we're back at full production. The new facility consolidates multiple facilities into 1 location, reducing production cycle times and creating a number of operational efficiencies. We now have a single facility of sufficient size, layout and capabilities to fully implement the lean production processes that we need to further reduce our product cost. The new facility will provide cost savings and creates a state-of-the-art, high-volume manufacturing capability for products across the RF segment, including our Unity mobile radio, which is newly introduced to the market and our 700 megahertz LTE subscriber terminals. 
Tactical Communications revenue was $472 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of 3% compared with the prior year. Again, we believe this was an excellent result given that MRAP radio deliveries declined by $200 million year-over-year. If we look at the non-MRAP revenue to the Department of Defense, it actually increased significantly in the quarter, driven by continuing Falcon III product adoption to support the DoD vision for wideband networking throughout the battlefield in Armed Forces. 
International revenue growth was driven in the quarter by major deliveries to the Australian Ministry of Defense and a number of countries in the Middle East and Asia. Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $156 million in the fourth quarter, as indicated, increasing 9% compared to the prior year. A series of important contract wins led to the best quarter since acquiring this business in fiscal 2009. 
Turning to orders. RF segment orders were $447 million in the quarter, with Tactical Communications orders accounting for $257 million of this total. Our Tactical Communications backlog stood at $766 million at the end of the year. Ongoing political instability in Northern Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia has continued to delay some of our international orders. While the delays are certainly unfortunate in the near term, they will get sorted out eventually. And we're confident that our business will benefit in the long term from this business. 
In the U.S. market, important orders during the quarter included $25 million from Marine Corps for Falcon III radios and remote control systems, $18 million for Falcon II HF vehicular radio systems for Army vehicles. Several orders for our Falcon III 117G multiband manpack radios, and these included $12 million from DoD in support of requirements for wideband networking, $16 million from the Army to provide ground forces with expanded interoperable voice and high-bandwidth data communications and $9 million from the Air Force in support of new emerging applications in situational awareness, intelligence and analysis and real-time battlefield collaboration. And we were also awarded an IDIQ contract with a $60 million ceiling from the Navy for our new Technical Key Loader encryption devices, along with an initial order against that contract of $6 million. 
Consistent with our roadmap, we are introducing additional features and functionality to our Falcon III JTRS product offering. This will widen our technology and product lead in the U.S. market and equally importantly, this lead ultimately fuels our continued leadership in the international markets.   First, we expect to receive NSA certification in the next few weeks for the SRW waveform in our Falcon III 117G wideband networking manpack radio and shipments will begin to customers immediately after. As promised, we will be first-to-market with an NSA-certified radio incorporating SRW, the Soldier Radio Waveform, for JTRS. At the same time, we expect to receive NSA certification for and begin shipping our Falcon III AN/PRC-152A handheld radio, which will have new wideband networking capability using the Harris ANW2 waveform. And then shortly down the road in October, we'll begin demonstrations where we will include the SRW waveform also in the 152A. So we're going to end up with a very, very capable JTRS handheld radio. That's going to include the SRW, waveform, the ANW2 waveform and Type-1 NSA certification, and of course, remember that 152A is also backward compatible with legacy radio waveforms in the field such as SINCGARS. 
Now for a second, compare that with the new Rifleman Radio. Rifleman really has a very narrow mission, to provide position location information up echelon using the SRW waveform. For example, it doesn't have wideband capability or NSA Type-1 capability, nor does it have the ability to communicate with legacy radios using waveforms such as SINCGARS, where there's over 400,000 units deployed in the field. We think this creates a significant differentiation, and once again, Harris takes the lead with radio technology. 
In June and July, Harris was invited to participate for the first time in the U.S. Army Network Integration Evaluation, or NIE, exercise held at  Fort Bliss, Texas and White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The NIE is a series of semi-annual evaluations designed to evaluate the Army's tactical network capabilities and to promote competition among the multiple programs of record and viable commercial solutions, and this is all part of the Army's evolving network acquisition strategy. The NIE involves a series of user test and evaluations with the goal to speed the deployment of an integrated battlefield network, while making sure the technologies are ready for prime time use in the field by the warfighter. I'm pleased to say that Harris delivered its combat-proven wideband networking capability through the Falcon III 117G as part of the evaluation. The Army evaluated our 117G radios as a vehicular-based mobile wideband tactical communications network, enabling this network using to Harris ANW2 wideband waveform. Our radio successfully formed a 30-node network across a range of military vehicles included company command post-platforms and provided reliable access to a number of applications such as the tactical ground reporting system, combat chat and the transfer of multimedia mission command files. It was a major success in our view. We received great user feedback and valuable insights into both our radio and waveform functionality, and we'll be quickly incorporating these insights into our future product releases. We will expand our participation in the next NIE scheduled for October, and this will include incorporation of the Falcon III 117G with SRW and the Falcon III 152A handheld with both the SRW and the ANW2 waveforms. Bottom line, we came away from these series of tests more convinced than ever that our radios are, in fact, the most advanced in the world. No competing radios come close to delivering the performance and cost that we can offer our customers. 
Turning to international orders in the quarter. We had a $16 million order from a country in Africa to provide HF radios, a $10 million order from a country in Southeast Asia for Falcon III and Falcon II tactical radios, a $5 million order from Brazil for Falcon III VHF tactical radios. These will provide the Brazilian Armed Forces with next-generation voice and high-speed data communications. Also, a $5 million order from Canada for Falcon III 117G multiband manpack radios, as well as our RF-7800B tactical satellite communication system. These systems will provide Canada's Armed Forces with next-generation tactical comms in support of a number of network-enabled applications, including video and collaborative chat. And finally, we received a $4 million follow-on order from France for the 117G. The 117G is quickly becoming the radio of choice by all of our NATO allies for their high-end mission requirements. 
We closed the fourth quarter with healthy opportunity pipelines in the Tactical Communications business, $1 billion in the U.S. and $2.3 billion in international. Large opportunities in the U.S. pipeline exists for follow-on business for the Falcon III radios in the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force. Also, the U.S. pipeline includes opportunities, which will be procured through new IDIQ contracts that we expect imminently from the Navy and the Special Operations Command. The international pipeline is highlighted by significant opportunities with the Iraq Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense, the Australia Ministry of Defense, United Arab Emirates, as well as other nations in Africa, Asia and Southeast Asia. As we stated before, some orders have been delayed in the international market during the last 2 quarters, but none have been lost to competition. 
We've already indicated that Public Safety and Professional Communications had a great quarter. Orders in the fourth quarter were $190 million higher than the prior year quarter and certainly, also had a book-to-bill of greater than 1. Orders included a $50 million order from the Oregon Department of Transportation to deliver a new P25 system, which will support the mission-critical communication needs of ODOT, as well as the Oregon State Police. This program includes 4,200 Unity multiband mobile radios and it will be the first large-scale deployment of our new vehicular version of the Unity radio. This is a very important extension of the Unity family of multiband radios and of course, Unity allows interoperability across a much wider band of frequencies than any other radio in the market. The program in Oregon also includes an integrated statewide network, which will allow Oregon to comply with the federal narrowbanding mandate that is governing spectrum use for land mobile radio systems. And the initial $50 million order is part of a 10-year contract that is expected to have a total value of more than $100 million. We also received 3 other significant orders we want to call out in the quarter, $24 million from Floyd County, Georgia for a P25IP digital radio system, an $18 million order from Linn County, Iowa, again, for a P25IP trunked radio system. And again, this contract includes the Harris Unity multiband portable radios as well. And then finally, a $12 million order from the city of Chicago, Office of Emergency Management Communications for our Maestro dispatch consoles. In summary, we continue to see a steady recovery in new bid and proposal activity in the Public Safety markets, and our pipeline of opportunities for this business remains very large at $3 billion. 
Let me move on now to Slide 6 and talk about our Integrated Network Solutions segment. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 45%, $585 million, and of course, benefited from the acquisitions of CapRock Communications and the Schlumberger Global Connectivity Services business. But we also had strong performance on an organic basis with revenue growing by 7% above the prior year. Our Broadcast Communications business showed excellent revenue growth with 31%. Harris IT Services revenue increased by 8%. Revenue from Harris CapRock Communications was about flat with the prior year on a pro forma basis. Segment non-GAAP operating income was much higher at $32 million or 5.5% of sales, income benefited from the vastly improved performance in Broadcast Communications compared to the prior year. Broadcast was profitable in the quarter and for the fiscal year in total, following the market downturn experienced over the past couple of years. Harris CapRock Communications and Harris IT Services income were also well above the prior quarter. 
Our Healthcare and Cyber businesses posted a combined $16 million loss in the quarter as a result of the Carefx acquisition and the opening of our Cyber Integration Center in Virginia and its related depreciation and overhead expense. Several new contract wins in the quarter worth mentioning, a 3-year master service agreement with a potential value of $58 million to operate the Offshore Communications Backbone in the Eastern Mediterranean. First year of the agreement is worth up to $22 million. We signed a 2-year, $13 million contract to provide offshore satellite communications with Odfjell Drilling in Norway. This includes a provision of turnkey VSAT services, voice and Internet services. It's a significant expansion of our existing business with Odfjell, and we think demonstrates the value of both our local presence and very strong client relationships. We also were awarded 2 3-year contracts valued at $3 million from Devon Energy in Brazil for our telecommunications and professional services. Devon Energy is a leading independent natural gas and oil exploration company. We also received a 5-year IDIQ contract, which has a very large ceiling of $12 billion from the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is associated with what they call their T4 program, Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology, allowing the VA to upgrade their IT systems. It'll streamline and modernize their operations, including patient care delivery at over 150 VA hospitals. We also received a 2-year blanket purchase agreement with a ceiling of $199 million from the VA for a separate initiative called Enhance the Veteran Experience and Access to Healthcare. Here, the goal of the VA is to expand healthcare access for veterans who reside in rural areas. And in the Broadcast division, we received orders totaling $16 million in the quarter from Turkmenistan Television, the state broadcaster in the country. This project comprises a full range of broadcast solutions from Harris, and the seamless interoperability of our solutions, we believe, was the determining factor in the contract award. 
We're continuing our global integration efforts at Harris CapRock Communications. During the quarter, we announced Tom Eaton as President of this business. Tom has a remarkable track record in positioning businesses for their next phase of growth. We also officially opened, during the quarter, the new Harris Cyber Integration Center in Virginia. This center will provide cloud computing services for customers within a trusted environment. The Cyber Integration Center has already won national awards for its energy efficiency and innovation. And we continue our collaboration with leading IT companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Sendmail, RedHat, BMC and VCE, who continue to seek partnership with Harris, and we believe this continues to validate with our technology and our security differentiation. In the near term, however, we are experiencing a much longer selling cycle in the Cyber business than we had previously expected. Customers are beginning with small pilot projects and proofs-of-concept before moving their larger applications into the cloud. This will allow the effect of postponing revenue and income out of our fiscal 2012 into fiscal 2013, resulting in a fiscal 2012 operating loss for Cyber currently estimated at about $30 million. Obviously, we're taking steps to improve that outcome, and we'll keep you posted on future calls. 
In the Healthcare Solutions business, we completed the acquisition of Carefx Corporation at the beginning of fourth quarter. Carefx brings interoperable workflow and clinical analytics solutions to the Harris Healthcare portfolio. Carefx solutions are aimed at enabling improved operating efficiencies and access to vital clinical data within hospitals. Let me give you an example. Hartford Hospital in Connecticut recently implemented a business intelligent dashboard from Carefx to better understand their patient flow trends and to cut the patient length of stay. Hartford increased its early discharge rate nearly threefold after implementing our dashboard. These kinds of success stories will continue to help Harris Healthcare Solutions penetrate the commercial healthcare market and strengthen its overall position as a leading provider of interoperability solutions to both commercial and government customers. 
In Broadcast Communications, international broadcast sales and growth in new media are both driving higher revenue. In addition to the orders already mentioned for Turkmenistan, we're experiencing orders growth in Asia and Latin America, and we recently installed our first digital signage system in the U.K. at Harrod's. In the U.S., we're in collaboration with Digital Display Networks, Inc. and ABC to create one of the largest digital out-of-home advertising networks in the world, 7-Eleven TV. Digital Display Networks is providing content production, ABC as the sales agent for advertising and Harris is providing its InfoCaster hardware and Punctuate software, along with our managed services and content delivery capabilities. We're already installed in over 3,000 7-Eleven stores. Promotional advertising content has been successfully running on the network for several months. ABC has secured a number of new ad sales and is managing a solid pipeline for the future. Bottom line, we remain very excited about this project in the emerging digital out-of-home market in general. In summary, we continue to be enthusiastic about the future of the new Integrated Network Solutions segment. As the integration of our new acquisitions and the maturing of our new businesses occurs, INS will, in fact, be a major driver of Harris EPS growth going forward. 
Moving to Slide 7. Government Communications Systems segment revenue was $500 million in the fourth quarter, an excellent 11% growth from the prior year. Revenue increases were driven by the GOES-R program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by our new product line, Highband Networking Radios, for the U.S. Army and by satellite reflector programs for several commercial customers. Segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $63 million with margins at a strong 12.7% of sales. Fourth quarter wins in Government Communications included a $19 million follow-on contract to supply more than 100 Harris Highband Networking Radio systems for the Army Warfighter Information Network Tactical, or WIN-T, program. This order is an addition to $6 million contract award from the Army during the quarter for rapid deployment of HNR radios into Afghanistan. This Harris product really redefines battlefield communications with high-capacity wireless networking between both mobile and fixed platforms. Using a breakthrough radio waveform and directed beam antenna technology, the Harris HNR establishes self-forming, self-healing mesh network capable of delivering voice, video and data over very large geographic areas. 
In the quarter, we also received a 42-month, potential $57 million follow-on contract -- $57 million follow-on contract with the FAA. This is to upgrade and manage the system that provides real-time weather data and flight planning for Alaska general aviation. We also received 2 1-year classified contracts totaling $83 million, and a 4-year, $32 million classified contract in addition. So our national intelligence business tempo is definitely increasing. After the close of the quarter, Harris was selected for a 10-year, $85 million contract award from the FAA as a prime contractor to the Alaska Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure program. Harris will replace and upgrade the existing SATCOM network and -- that links the Alaska Air Route Traffic Control Center in Alaska -- in Anchorage, Alaska with 64 other FAA facilities throughout the region. 
So with that, let me now turn it over to our CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on the financial results for the quarter."

Fiscal year 2011 was another very solid financial year for Harris. We ended the year with $367 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We generated $833 million of operating cash flow, $508 million of free cash",476,"Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 8. Fiscal year 2011 was another very solid financial year for Harris. We ended the year with $367 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We generated $833 million of operating cash flow, $508 million of free cash flow, repurchased $250 million of our outstanding stock and paid $127 million in dividends. None of our outstanding long-term debt comes due prior to October 2015. And as of year end, we had $870 million available under our $1,050,000,000 combined revolving credit facilities. 
As to the fourth quarter, cash flow generated from operating activities was $276 million as compared to $167 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and capital expenditures were $129 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $62 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The $67 million higher capital expenditures resulted primarily from the fit-out of our new RF manufacturing facility that is now fully up and operational, the Cyber Security Solutions facility whose grand opening was in late May and capital expenditures at INS as a result of the CapRock and Schlumberger acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was $63 million for fourth quarter as compared to $45 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.5%. 
During the quarter, we increased our share buyback to $100 million. We purchased 2 million shares at an average purchase price of $48.83 per share. Total shares repurchased during fiscal 2011 were 5.3 million or 4.2% of our outstanding shares. As announced in our press release, we replaced our existing share repurchase program with $1 billion new program under which we expect to repurchase up to $500 million worth of our shares, largely by the end of this calendar year or roughly 8% to 9% of the shares outstanding. Further, we announced a 12% dividend increase that takes our quarterly dividend from $0.25 to $0.28, our 10th year in a row of double-digit increases. 
Moving to Slide 9. We revised guidance for fiscal 2012 as follows: cash flow from operations in a range of $825 million to $875 million; depreciation and amortization of $280 million to $290 million; and capital expenditures, including capitalized software of $265 million to $285 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be 33% compared with our prior guidance of 33.5%. The tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events occurring therein. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength, which allows us to invest for the future while delivering significant value to our shareholders in the forms of share repurchases and higher dividends. Our outlook for operating cash flow remain strong and fiscal 2012 should be another year of solid financial returns. 
Back to you, Howard."

Let me conclude my prepared remarks and talk about the 2012 outlook, utilizing Slides 10 and 11. We're updating our financial guidance for fiscal 2012 with consolidated revenue now expected to be between 4% and 6% higher than fiscal 2011, re",427,"Thanks, Gary. Let me conclude my prepared remarks and talk about the 2012 outlook, utilizing Slides 10 and 11. We're updating our financial guidance for fiscal 2012 with consolidated revenue now expected to be between 4% and 6% higher than fiscal 2011, revenue between $6.15 billion and $6.3 billion. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is now expected to be in a range from $5.10 to $5.30 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 4% to 8%. The changes between our prior outlook and current outlook reflect lower revenue and income in International Tactical Communications, as well as increased losses in our Cyber business, offset by higher expected income in Government Communications, a slightly lower tax rate and the positive impact from our new share repurchase plan. We'll certainly have a clearer picture of the timing of international orders and revenue as we move through the next 2 quarters, which will help to tighten our EPS range going forward. 
Now our current view to the distribution of EPS in fiscal 2012 is about 40% of the earnings in the first half and about 60% of the earnings in the second half, with first quarter EPS in a range of $1 to $1.05 per share. Back to full year guidance, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range from $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion, that's a year-over-year increase of 4% to 8% in line with revenue. 
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2012 revenue is expected to be 3% to 6% lower than fiscal 2011, reflecting the timing of international orders turning into revenue. So the new guidance now anticipates decline in Tactical Communications revenue of about 10% year-over-year versus our previous flat year-over-year revenue guidance. We continue to expect double-digit growth in Public Safety and Professional Communications. And our segment operating margins are now expected to be in the 33% to 34% range. For our Integrated Network Solutions segment, we expect revenue to be in a range of 16% to 18% higher than fiscal 2011, and that represents organic growth in a range of 7% and 9% higher. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is expected to be between 5.5% to 6.5%, which includes the anticipated operating losses of about $30 million in our Cyber business. And finally, for the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2012 to be 2% to 4% higher than fiscal 2011, and segment operating margins are expected to be about 13.5% of revenue. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line and we'll be pleased to take your questions."

First off, on the share repurchase plan, I mean, obviously, this is quite a big step up from where you've been before. You're going to repurchase in the next 2 quarters more than you've done in the last 2 years combined -- 2 fiscal years combined. So I just wondered if you might talk about the board's view here, and what this may signal in terms of cash deployment, your strategy there? How you're thinking about this? Is this something we should consider as a new norm? Has your view changed? How should we consider this?"

As we at acquisitions, we've made a number of acquisitions in fiscal '11 and the focus in fiscal '12 is very much on integrating those acquisitions and delivering on the promise of them, as well as the ones that had gone previously like the Public Safety business, which as you see is really starting to pick up steam. We certainly feel that a double-digit increase in our dividend rate is consistent with what we've done in the past as we target a payout ratio, north of 20%, and this will be consistent with that. And so when we look at then the cash flow that we're going to generate from operating cash less our needs for the requirements for CapEx, we felt that the current valuation of the shares that this was a very appropriate deployment of cash and makes a strong statement about the board and management's view of the future earnings potential for the company. Whether this becomes the ""norm"" or not, beyond that, I think, remains to be seen. But the fact that we do have a $1 billion authorization suggest that there is another $500 million tranche that's going to be repurchased beyond fiscal year '12."

But in and of itself, that one country is not the reason behind it. It's really been everything that you've seen going on across the region over what's been a very tumultuous 6-month period, and it's primarily politically-driven. It's really not at all driven by expectations of somehow a lower security risk or a lower need for these communications. So we're certainly frustrated now 2 quarters in a row to see about $100 million each quarter of orders pushed out. But the good news is we haven't lost any orders, and I actually think our product position is even strengthening as time goes on. So we're going to see the orders come in at some point and get turned to revenue. If that happens earlier in the year, then certainly the high end of our guidance is possible. If it doesn't happen until later in the year, then it might be the lower end. And that's why you see the range a little wider than it traditional is."

In the segment it's only about 100 basis points. So how have we done that? Well, number one, Public Safety, Professional Communications business return on sales or margins are moving significantly higher. If you go back 2 years, Gary and I talked about guidance in that business, and we are now starting to see the top line and the bottom line move. And so it's becoming, as a result, less dilutive to the segment. Secondly, our new manufacturing facility and a number of other operational and cost reduction actions are allowing us to actually maintain very, very high margins in the RF segment. Fourth quarter was a little bit of an anomaly. We used the opportunity to accelerate some of our R&D by using some contract engineering, not only inside, but outside the company. And so the previous quarter, I think, for the segment was 32.5%. So Q4 was a little bit of an anomaly, as sometimes happens in quarters. But the bottom line is, we feel very confident in the 33% to 34% guidance we're providing, and it does not involve a major reduction in R&D, but rather focuses heavily on actions at the gross margin line in both Tactical, as well as significant progress being made in Public Safety."

We really haven't seen anything material as a result of the last quarter. It's been a little slow, as you know, and our guidance shows modest growth compared to what we've been able to deliver in the past. So obviously, we're hopeful that this is overblown and the opportunity to have higher growth in government systems and in IT services. We've been doing very well in IT services and with 11% in government systems, that's kind of a blowout quarter. So we really haven't seen a lot of big things. I think that has a lot to do with our diversity of programs for a company our size, with 250 to 300 programs across not just DoD, but intelligence, civilian agencies, lots of $10 million and smaller annual revenue programs. I think that's cushioning us pretty well. We won't be totally blind, I'm sure, to program adjustments and so on.

And then the other one for the Navy is maybe tens of millions of dollars. That one is more FY '12 oriented. So gives you a little bit of color around them. But the nice thing about IDIQs, it sets a ceiling and gives a lot of flexibility. So if up-tempo or needs emerge and new technology they want to take advantage of, especially special forces, they had then have a contract ceiling and a vehicle to procure radios. So as we continue to put out radios with more and more capabilities, we love to see these IDIQ contracts because I think that the balance shifts really toward a commercial company like Harris and to be able to make the maximum benefit out of those kinds of vehicles."

The part that's really been most impacted by kind of yearly annual budgets is what I would call the kind of repair and replacement, what we call the flow business. And we have certainly seen pressure on that business because they're not adding additional police officers, firemen, emergency technicians. If they have 5 radios in reserve and 2 break down, they're not buying new radios because they don't have the short-term budget money. So we've already seen, I think, significant impacts from that. On the flip side though, money is available for these large modernization programs. And we have won 4 or 5 large ones over the last several quarters we've announced. These have all been competitive. And I think a combination of 3 factors is allowing us to win. Certainly, we have to be competitive on price, but we don't need to have the lowest overall price by a significant amount. We are viewed as having very competitive and often superior technology and support. And thirdly, the Harris brand that's now wrapped around the Public Safety business has created a lot of demand and a lot of traction for competitive bids in this market. So I think you put those factors together and a strong and even upgraded management team at PSPC, and we certainly like the momentum that seems to be building in that market.

Back in March, we talked about the investments that we've made in capital for the facility, the upgrade, for all of our initial tranche at customer-facing equipment, kind of in the $175 million to $200 million range. And that would ultimately be able to drive revenue of about $80 million at nice profitability with maybe $50 million of revenue or so being at the break-even point, given the expenses that we have and we have people operating the business and the depreciation and amortization on the investments. So that's kind of where we were sitting. We thought that in FY '12 we would have enough momentum to get to that level and kind of be plus or minus at break even. My assessment now is that's going to be probably pushed out a year. I don't believe that we have lost a significant amount of business. I think we were just in the category of start-up. We started up the business and opened the center a little later than we have planned, and just didn't allow enough time in our planning for what was going to be channel development, starting to work with our partners on developing prospects. And then the time to close, once we had a prospect, is turning out to be much longer. Because people are just going to be a little more cautious, especially about taking their business to the cloud in an outside cloud as opposed to -- they may take it to a cloud faster in their own operations than outsource it to someone else. And again, we were focused -- we are focused on really mission-critical, very high-end applications. And so in hindsight, we were just too optimistic in how quickly this was going to turn. We're still very convinced this is going to be a very large market, one that suits Harris well and one that we ought to be able to generate $100 million of very profitable revenue from. But we are not starting out where we had hoped. We lost, as we already had indicated, an excess of $20 million in fiscal '11. And now we're estimating this $30 million for fiscal '12. So I think it's -- unfortunately, like sometimes new market entries, you don't know what you don't know. You make assumptions. You find out sometimes you're right. In this case, we weren't.

I don't know if that'll happen or not, but that's a current expectation.

I think we're going to build momentum and see a lot of growth in '13 and '14. But the reality was that we lost money primarily on the commercial acquisition in Q4, and we need to build that results base to show you as we go forward in '12. But we do not expect to lose money in the Healthcare in fiscal '12."

To provide added clarity to the call, this time we've posted some slides on our website, and we'll be referring to those throughout the conference call. Begin",3619,"Thank you, Pam, and let me welcome all of you to our fourth quarter fiscal 2011 earnings call. To provide added clarity to the call, this time we've posted some slides on our website, and we'll be referring to those throughout the conference call. 
Beginning first with Slides 3 and 4. We ended fiscal 2011 with another solid quarter. Revenue was $1.67 billion, increasing 15%. Organic revenue growth was 4%, and that was driven by 11% growth in our Government Communications Systems segment and 7% growth in our new Integrated Network Solutions segment. Flat year-over-year revenue in RF Communications was, we think, an excellent outcome for this business as we make our way beyond the large tactical radio shipments in the prior year to equip MRAP vehicles. The first quarter of fiscal 2012 will be our last tough compare as we reset our baseline for future growth. 
There were certainly highlights in the quarter as our Public Safety and Professional Communications business posted strong revenue growth of 9% and a record quarter end backlog of the $737 million. Our move into this very close adjacent market during fiscal 2009 is contributing nicely to both our revenue growth and higher operating income. The Broadcast Communications business posted 37% growth in orders, 31% growth in revenue and a solid profit. Harris IT Services posted 8% top line growth and higher profitability. And Harris CapRock Communications delivered a solid profit number in the quarter. 
On the downside, our new initiatives in Healthcare and Cyber will take time to contribute to earnings. Both businesses had operating losses in the quarter. And about $100 million in International Tactical Communications orders slipped to the right as a result of political uncertainty in Central Asia, the Middle East and Northern Africa. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.24 in the quarter and flat with the prior year. Of course, again, the prior year benefited significantly from the large MRAP shipments. Fourth quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA was $320 million, and that was a 7% increase. We think this is a very encouraging sign for future earnings growth. Throughout fiscal 2012, we should see this upward trend in EBITDA continue as we finish integrating the new acquisitions and they begin to significantly contribute to our growth and higher earnings. 
For the full fiscal year 2011, revenue was $5.92 billion, an increase of 14% and about a 5% higher on an organic basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.89, an increase of 10%, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.23 billion, an increase of 11%. We are incredibly proud of these results delivered by our team, especially in the year where we faced an extended U.S. government continuing budget resolution, lower MRAP shipments, lower state and local government spending and a drilling moratorium for part of the year in the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time these challenges were occurring, we increased our investments in new vertical market growth initiatives, which we believe will be a major driver of long-term growth and higher earnings for the company. 
Moving now to the segment results. First, on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue for the RF Communications segment was $628 million, as indicated, flat with the prior year. Large shipments of tactical radios in the prior year to equip MRAP vehicles continue to create difficult year-over-year comparisons for us in both revenue and income. As expected, operating income in the fourth quarter was lower at $191 million compared with non-GAAP operating income in the prior year quarter of $227 million. Operating margins in the fourth quarter were 30.4%. 
Our new manufacturing facility in Rochester, New York is up and running, ahead of schedule and we're back at full production. The new facility consolidates multiple facilities into 1 location, reducing production cycle times and creating a number of operational efficiencies. We now have a single facility of sufficient size, layout and capabilities to fully implement the lean production processes that we need to further reduce our product cost. The new facility will provide cost savings and creates a state-of-the-art, high-volume manufacturing capability for products across the RF segment, including our Unity mobile radio, which is newly introduced to the market and our 700 megahertz LTE subscriber terminals. 
Tactical Communications revenue was $472 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of 3% compared with the prior year. Again, we believe this was an excellent result given that MRAP radio deliveries declined by $200 million year-over-year. If we look at the non-MRAP revenue to the Department of Defense, it actually increased significantly in the quarter, driven by continuing Falcon III product adoption to support the DoD vision for wideband networking throughout the battlefield in Armed Forces. 
International revenue growth was driven in the quarter by major deliveries to the Australian Ministry of Defense and a number of countries in the Middle East and Asia. Public Safety and Professional Communications revenue was $156 million in the fourth quarter, as indicated, increasing 9% compared to the prior year. A series of important contract wins led to the best quarter since acquiring this business in fiscal 2009. 
Turning to orders. RF segment orders were $447 million in the quarter, with Tactical Communications orders accounting for $257 million of this total. Our Tactical Communications backlog stood at $766 million at the end of the year. Ongoing political instability in Northern Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia has continued to delay some of our international orders. While the delays are certainly unfortunate in the near term, they will get sorted out eventually. And we're confident that our business will benefit in the long term from this business. 
In the U.S. market, important orders during the quarter included $25 million from Marine Corps for Falcon III radios and remote control systems, $18 million for Falcon II HF vehicular radio systems for Army vehicles. Several orders for our Falcon III 117G multiband manpack radios, and these included $12 million from DoD in support of requirements for wideband networking, $16 million from the Army to provide ground forces with expanded interoperable voice and high-bandwidth data communications and $9 million from the Air Force in support of new emerging applications in situational awareness, intelligence and analysis and real-time battlefield collaboration. And we were also awarded an IDIQ contract with a $60 million ceiling from the Navy for our new Technical Key Loader encryption devices, along with an initial order against that contract of $6 million. 
Consistent with our roadmap, we are introducing additional features and functionality to our Falcon III JTRS product offering. This will widen our technology and product lead in the U.S. market and equally importantly, this lead ultimately fuels our continued leadership in the international markets.   First, we expect to receive NSA certification in the next few weeks for the SRW waveform in our Falcon III 117G wideband networking manpack radio and shipments will begin to customers immediately after. As promised, we will be first-to-market with an NSA-certified radio incorporating SRW, the Soldier Radio Waveform, for JTRS. At the same time, we expect to receive NSA certification for and begin shipping our Falcon III AN/PRC-152A handheld radio, which will have new wideband networking capability using the Harris ANW2 waveform. And then shortly down the road in October, we'll begin demonstrations where we will include the SRW waveform also in the 152A. So we're going to end up with a very, very capable JTRS handheld radio. That's going to include the SRW, waveform, the ANW2 waveform and Type-1 NSA certification, and of course, remember that 152A is also backward compatible with legacy radio waveforms in the field such as SINCGARS. 
Now for a second, compare that with the new Rifleman Radio. Rifleman really has a very narrow mission, to provide position location information up echelon using the SRW waveform. For example, it doesn't have wideband capability or NSA Type-1 capability, nor does it have the ability to communicate with legacy radios using waveforms such as SINCGARS, where there's over 400,000 units deployed in the field. We think this creates a significant differentiation, and once again, Harris takes the lead with radio technology. 
In June and July, Harris was invited to participate for the first time in the U.S. Army Network Integration Evaluation, or NIE, exercise held at Fort Bliss, Texas and White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The NIE is a series of semi-annual evaluations designed to evaluate the Army's tactical network capabilities and to promote competition among the multiple programs of record and viable commercial solutions, and this is all part of the Army's evolving network acquisition strategy. The NIE involves a series of user test and evaluations with the goal to speed the deployment of an integrated battlefield network, while making sure the technologies are ready for prime time use in the field by the warfighter. I'm pleased to say that Harris delivered its combat-proven wideband networking capability through the Falcon III 117G as part of the evaluation. The Army evaluated our 117G radios as a vehicular-based mobile wideband tactical communications network, enabling this network using to Harris ANW2 wideband waveform. Our radio successfully formed a 30-node network across a range of military vehicles included company command post-platforms and provided reliable access to a number of applications such as the tactical ground reporting system, combat chat and the transfer of multimedia mission command files. It was a major success in our view. We received great user feedback and valuable insights into both our radio and waveform functionality, and we'll be quickly incorporating these insights into our future product releases. We will expand our participation in the next NIE scheduled for October, and this will include incorporation of the Falcon III 117G with SRW and the Falcon III 152A handheld with both the SRW and the ANW2 waveforms. Bottom line, we came away from these series of tests more convinced than ever that our radios are, in fact, the most advanced in the world. No competing radios come close to delivering the performance and cost that we can offer our customers. 
Turning to international orders in the quarter. We had a $16 million order from a country in Africa to provide HF radios, a $10 million order from a country in Southeast Asia for Falcon III and Falcon II tactical radios, a $5 million order from Brazil for Falcon III VHF tactical radios. These will provide the Brazilian Armed Forces with next-generation voice and high-speed data communications. Also, a $5 million order from Canada for Falcon III 117G multiband manpack radios, as well as our RF-7800B tactical satellite communication system. These systems will provide Canada's Armed Forces with next-generation tactical comms in support of a number of network-enabled applications, including video and collaborative chat. And finally, we received a $4 million follow-on order from France for the 117G. The 117G is quickly becoming the radio of choice by all of our NATO allies for their high-end mission requirements. 
We closed the fourth quarter with healthy opportunity pipelines in the Tactical Communications business, $1 billion in the U.S. and $2.3 billion in international. Large opportunities in the U.S. pipeline exists for follow-on business for the Falcon III radios in the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force. Also, the U.S. pipeline includes opportunities, which will be procured through new IDIQ contracts that we expect imminently from the Navy and the Special Operations Command. The international pipeline is highlighted by significant opportunities with the Iraq Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense, the Australia Ministry of Defense, United Arab Emirates, as well as other nations in Africa, Asia and Southeast Asia. As we stated before, some orders have been delayed in the international market during the last 2 quarters, but none have been lost to competition. 
We've already indicated that Public Safety and Professional Communications had a great quarter. Orders in the fourth quarter were $190 million higher than the prior year quarter and certainly, also had a book-to-bill of greater than 1. Orders included a $50 million order from the Oregon Department of Transportation to deliver a new P25 system, which will support the mission-critical communication needs of ODOT, as well as the Oregon State Police. This program includes 4,200 Unity multiband mobile radios and it will be the first large-scale deployment of our new vehicular version of the Unity radio. This is a very important extension of the Unity family of multiband radios and of course, Unity allows interoperability across a much wider band of frequencies than any other radio in the market. The program in Oregon also includes an integrated statewide network, which will allow Oregon to comply with the federal narrowbanding mandate that is governing spectrum use for land mobile radio systems. And the initial $50 million order is part of a 10-year contract that is expected to have a total value of more than $100 million. We also received 3 other significant orders we want to call out in the quarter, $24 million from Floyd County, Georgia for a P25IP digital radio system, an $18 million order from Linn County, Iowa, again, for a P25IP trunked radio system. And again, this contract includes the Harris Unity multiband portable radios as well. And then finally, a $12 million order from the city of Chicago, Office of Emergency Management Communications for our Maestro dispatch consoles. In summary, we continue to see a steady recovery in new bid and proposal activity in the Public Safety markets, and our pipeline of opportunities for this business remains very large at $3 billion. 
Let me move on now to Slide 6 and talk about our Integrated Network Solutions segment. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 45%, $585 million, and of course, benefited from the acquisitions of CapRock Communications and the Schlumberger Global Connectivity Services business. But we also had strong performance on an organic basis with revenue growing by 7% above the prior year. Our Broadcast Communications business showed excellent revenue growth with 31%. Harris IT Services revenue increased by 8%. Revenue from Harris CapRock Communications was about flat with the prior year on a pro forma basis. Segment non-GAAP operating income was much higher at $32 million or 5.5% of sales, income benefited from the vastly improved performance in Broadcast Communications compared to the prior year. Broadcast was profitable in the quarter and for the fiscal year in total, following the market downturn experienced over the past couple of years. Harris CapRock Communications and Harris IT Services income were also well above the prior quarter. 
Our Healthcare and Cyber businesses posted a combined $16 million loss in the quarter as a result of the Carefx acquisition and the opening of our Cyber Integration Center in Virginia and its related depreciation and overhead expense. Several new contract wins in the quarter worth mentioning, a 3-year master service agreement with a potential value of $58 million to operate the Offshore Communications Backbone in the Eastern Mediterranean. First year of the agreement is worth up to $22 million. We signed a 2-year, $13 million contract to provide offshore satellite communications with Odfjell Drilling in Norway. This includes a provision of turnkey VSAT services, voice and Internet services. It's a significant expansion of our existing business with Odfjell, and we think demonstrates the value of both our local presence and very strong client relationships. We also were awarded 2 3-year contracts valued at $3 million from Devon Energy in Brazil for our telecommunications and professional services. Devon Energy is a leading independent natural gas and oil exploration company. We also received a 5-year IDIQ contract, which has a very large ceiling of $12 billion from the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is associated with what they call their T4 program, Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology, allowing the VA to upgrade their IT systems. It'll streamline and modernize their operations, including patient care delivery at over 150 VA hospitals. We also received a 2-year blanket purchase agreement with a ceiling of $199 million from the VA for a separate initiative called Enhance the Veteran Experience and Access to Healthcare. Here, the goal of the VA is to expand healthcare access for veterans who reside in rural areas. And in the Broadcast division, we received orders totaling $16 million in the quarter from Turkmenistan Television, the state broadcaster in the country. This project comprises a full range of broadcast solutions from Harris, and the seamless interoperability of our solutions, we believe, was the determining factor in the contract award. 
We're continuing our global integration efforts at Harris CapRock Communications. During the quarter, we announced Tom Eaton as President of this business. Tom has a remarkable track record in positioning businesses for their next phase of growth. We also officially opened, during the quarter, the new Harris Cyber Integration Center in Virginia. This center will provide cloud computing services for customers within a trusted environment. The Cyber Integration Center has already won national awards for its energy efficiency and innovation. And we continue our collaboration with leading IT companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Sendmail, RedHat, BMC and VCE, who continue to seek partnership with Harris, and we believe this continues to validate with our technology and our security differentiation. In the near term, however, we are experiencing a much longer selling cycle in the Cyber business than we had previously expected. Customers are beginning with small pilot projects and proofs-of-concept before moving their larger applications into the cloud. This will allow the effect of postponing revenue and income out of our fiscal 2012 into fiscal 2013, resulting in a fiscal 2012 operating loss for Cyber currently estimated at about $30 million. Obviously, we're taking steps to improve that outcome, and we'll keep you posted on future calls. 
In the Healthcare Solutions business, we completed the acquisition of Carefx Corporation at the beginning of fourth quarter. Carefx brings interoperable workflow and clinical analytics solutions to the Harris Healthcare portfolio. Carefx solutions are aimed at enabling improved operating efficiencies and access to vital clinical data within hospitals. Let me give you an example. Hartford Hospital in Connecticut recently implemented a business intelligent dashboard from Carefx to better understand their patient flow trends and to cut the patient length of stay. Hartford increased its early discharge rate nearly threefold after implementing our dashboard. These kinds of success stories will continue to help Harris Healthcare Solutions penetrate the commercial healthcare market and strengthen its overall position as a leading provider of interoperability solutions to both commercial and government customers. 
In Broadcast Communications, international broadcast sales and growth in new media are both driving higher revenue. In addition to the orders already mentioned for Turkmenistan, we're experiencing orders growth in Asia and Latin America, and we recently installed our first digital signage system in the U.K. at Harrod's. In the U.S., we're in collaboration with Digital Display Networks, Inc. and ABC to create one of the largest digital out-of-home advertising networks in the world, 7-Eleven TV. Digital Display Networks is providing content production, ABC as the sales agent for advertising and Harris is providing its InfoCaster hardware and Punctuate software, along with our managed services and content delivery capabilities. We're already installed in over 3,000 7-Eleven stores. Promotional advertising content has been successfully running on the network for several months. ABC has secured a number of new ad sales and is managing a solid pipeline for the future. Bottom line, we remain very excited about this project in the emerging digital out-of-home market in general. In summary, we continue to be enthusiastic about the future of the new Integrated Network Solutions segment. As the integration of our new acquisitions and the maturing of our new businesses occurs, INS will, in fact, be a major driver of Harris EPS growth going forward. 
Moving to Slide 7. Government Communications Systems segment revenue was $500 million in the fourth quarter, an excellent 11% growth from the prior year. Revenue increases were driven by the GOES-R program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by our new product line, Highband Networking Radios, for the U.S. Army and by satellite reflector programs for several commercial customers. Segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $63 million with margins at a strong 12.7% of sales. Fourth quarter wins in Government Communications included a $19 million follow-on contract to supply more than 100 Harris Highband Networking Radio systems for the Army Warfighter Information Network Tactical, or WIN-T, program. This order is an addition to $6 million contract award from the Army during the quarter for rapid deployment of HNR radios into Afghanistan. This Harris product really redefines battlefield communications with high-capacity wireless networking between both mobile and fixed platforms. Using a breakthrough radio waveform and directed beam antenna technology, the Harris HNR establishes self-forming, self-healing mesh network capable of delivering voice, video and data over very large geographic areas. 
In the quarter, we also received a 42-month, potential $57 million follow-on contract -- $57 million follow-on contract with the FAA. This is to upgrade and manage the system that provides real-time weather data and flight planning for Alaska general aviation. We also received 2 1-year classified contracts totaling $83 million, and a 4-year, $32 million classified contract in addition. So our national intelligence business tempo is definitely increasing. After the close of the quarter, Harris was selected for a 10-year, $85 million contract award from the FAA as a prime contractor to the Alaska Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure program. Harris will replace and upgrade the existing SATCOM network and -- that links the Alaska Air Route Traffic Control Center in Alaska -- in Anchorage, Alaska with 64 other FAA facilities throughout the region. 
So with that, let me now turn it over to our CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on the financial results for the quarter."

We ended the year with $367 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We generated $833 million of operating cash flow, $508 million of free cash flow, repurchased $250 million of our outstanding stock and paid $127 million in dividends. None of our outstanding long-term debt comes due prior to October 2015. And as of year end, we had $870 million available under our $1,050,000,000 combined revolving credit facilities. 
As to the fourth quarter, cash flow generated from operating activities was $276 million as compared to $167 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and capital expenditures were $129 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $62 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The $67 million higher capital expenditures resulted primarily from the fit-out of our new RF manufacturing facility that is now fully up and operational, the Cyber Security Solutions facility whose grand opening was in late May and capital expenditures at INS as a result of the CapRock and Schlumberger acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was $63 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $45 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.5%. 
During the quarter, we increased our share buyback to $100 million. We purchased 2 million shares at an average purchase price of $48.83 per share. Total shares repurchased during fiscal 2011 were 5.3 million or 4.2% of our outstanding shares. As announced in our press release, we replaced our existing share repurchase program with $1 billion new program under which we expect to repurchase up to $500 million worth of our shares, largely by the end of this calendar year or roughly 8% to 9% of the shares outstanding. Further, we announced a 12% dividend increase that takes our quarterly dividend from $0.25 to $0.28, our 10th year in a row of double-digit increases. 
Moving to Slide 9. We revised guidance for fiscal 2012 as follows: cash flow from operations in a range of $825 million to $875 million; depreciation and amortization of $280 million to $290 million; and capital expenditures, including capitalized software of $265 million to $285 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be 33% compared with our prior guidance of 33.5%. The tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events occurring therein. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength, which allows us to invest for the future while delivering significant value to our shareholders in the forms of share repurchases and higher dividends. Our outlook for operating cash flow remain strong and fiscal 2012 should be another year of solid financial returns. 
Back to you, Howard."

Let me conclude my prepared remarks and talk about the 2012 outlook, utilizing Slides 10 and 11.

Let me conclude my prepared remarks and talk about the 2012 outlook, utilizing Slides 10 and 11. We're updating our financial guidance for fiscal 2012 with consolidated revenue now expected to be between 4% and 6% higher than fiscal 2011, revenue between $6.15 billion and $6.3 billion. Non-GAAP income, excluding acquisition-related costs, is now expected to be in a range from $5.10 to $5.30 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 4% to 8%. The changes between our prior outlook and current outlook reflect lower revenue and income in International Tactical Communications, as well as increased losses in our Cyber business, offset by higher expected income in Government Communications, a slightly lower tax rate and the positive impact from our new share repurchase plan. We'll certainly have a clearer picture of the timing of international orders and revenue as we move through the next 2 quarters, which will help to tighten our EPS range going forward. 
Now our current view to the distribution of EPS in fiscal 2012 is about 40% of the earnings in the first half and about 60% of the earnings in the second half, with first quarter EPS in a range of $1 to $1.05 per share. Back to full year guidance, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range from $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion, that's a year-over-year increase of 4% to 8% in line with revenue. 
For the RF Communications segment, fiscal 2012 revenue is expected to be 3% to 6% lower than fiscal 2011, reflecting the timing of international orders turning into revenue. So the new guidance now anticipates decline in Tactical Communications revenue of about 10% year-over-year versus our previous flat year-over-year revenue guidance. We continue to expect double-digit growth in Public Safety and Professional Communications. And our segment operating margins are now expected to be in the 33% to 34% range. For our Integrated Network Solutions segment, we expect revenue to be in a range of 16% to 18% higher than fiscal 2011, and that represents organic growth in a range of 7% and 9% higher. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is expected to be between 5.5% to 6.5%, which includes the anticipated operating losses of about $30 million in our Cyber business. And finally, for the Government Communications Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2012 to be 2% to 4% higher than fiscal 2011, and segment operating margins are expected to be about 13.5% of revenue.

As we look at acquisitions, we've made a number of acquisitions in fiscal '11 and the focus in fiscal '12 is very much on integrating those acquisitions and delivering on the promise of them, as well as the ones that had gone previously like the Public Safety business, which as you see is really starting to pick up steam. We certainly feel that a double-digit increase in our dividend rate is consistent with what we've done in the past as we target a payout ratio, north of 20%, and this will be consistent with that. And so when we look at then the cash flow that we're going to generate from operating cash less our needs for the requirements for CapEx, we felt that the current valuation of the shares that this was a very appropriate deployment of cash and makes a strong statement about the board and management's view of the future earnings potential for the company. Whether this becomes the ""norm"" or not, beyond that, I think, remains to be seen. But the fact that we do have a $1 billion authorization suggest that there is another $500 million tranche that's going to be repurchased beyond fiscal year '12."

It's really been everything that you've seen going on across the region over what's been a very tumultuous 6-month period, and it's primarily politically-driven. It's really not at all driven by expectations of somehow a lower security risk or a lower need for these communications. So we're certainly frustrated now 2 quarters in a row to see about $100 million each quarter of orders pushed out. But the good news is we haven't lost any orders, and I actually think our product position is even strengthening as time goes on. So we're going to see the orders come in at some point and get turned to revenue. If that happens earlier in the year, then certainly the high end of our guidance is possible. If it doesn't happen until later in the year, then it might be the lower end. And that's why you see the range a little wider than it traditional is."

Well, number one, Public Safety, Professional Communications business return on sales or margins are moving significantly higher. If you go back 2 years, Gary and I talked about guidance in that business, and we are now starting to see the top line and the bottom line move. And so it's becoming, as a result, less dilutive to the segment. Secondly, our new manufacturing facility and a number of other operational and cost reduction actions are allowing us to actually maintain very, very high margins in the RF segment. Fourth quarter was a little bit of an anomaly. We used the opportunity to accelerate some of our R&D by using some contract engineering, not only inside, but outside the company. And so the previous quarter, I think, for the segment was 32.5%. So Q4 was a little bit of an anomaly, as sometimes happens in quarters. But the bottom line is, we feel very confident in the 33% to 34% guidance we're providing, and it does not involve a major reduction in R&D, but rather focuses heavily on actions at the gross margin line in both Tactical, as well as significant progress being made in Public Safety."

And then the other one for the Navy is maybe tens of millions of dollars. That one is more FY '12 oriented. So gives you a little bit of color around them. But the nice thing about IDIQs, it sets a ceiling and gives a lot of flexibility. So if up-tempo or needs emerge and new technology they want to take advantage of, especially special forces, they had then have a contract ceiling and a vehicle to procure radios.

The part that's really been most impacted by kind of yearly annual budgets is what I would call the kind of repair and replacement, what we call the flow business. And we have certainly seen pressure on that business because they're not adding additional police officers, firemen, emergency technicians. If they have 5 radios in reserve and 2 break down, they're not buying new radios because they don't have the short-term budget money. So we've already seen, I think, significant impacts from that. On the flip side though, money is available for these large modernization programs. And we have won 4 or 5 large ones over the last several quarters we've announced. These have all been competitive. And I think a combination of 3 factors is allowing us to win. Certainly, we have to be competitive on price, but we don't need to have the lowest overall price by a significant amount. We are viewed as having very competitive and often superior technology and support. And thirdly, the Harris brand that's now wrapped around the Public Safety business has created a lot of demand and a lot of traction for competitive bids in this market. So I think you put those factors together and a strong and even upgraded management team at PSPC, and we certainly like the momentum that seems to be building in that market. Having said that, certainly, it's competitive, and the day-to-day replacement and upgrade business, budgets are tight."

Back in March, we talked about the investments that we've made in capital for the facility, the upgrade, for all of our initial tranche at customer-facing equipment, kind of in the $175 million to $200 million range. And that would ultimately be able to drive revenue of about $80 million at nice profitability with maybe $50 million of revenue or so being at the break-even point, given the expenses that we have and we have people operating the business and the depreciation and amortization on the investments. So that's kind of where we were sitting. We thought that in FY '12 we would have enough momentum to get to that level and kind of be plus or minus at break even. My assessment now is that's going to be probably pushed out a year. I don't believe that we have lost a significant amount of business. I think we were just in the category of start-up. We started up the business and opened the center a little later than we have planned, and just didn't allow enough time in our planning for what was going to be channel development, starting to work with our partners on developing prospects. And then the time to close, once we had a prospect, is turning out to be much longer. Because people are just going to be a little more cautious, especially about taking their business to the cloud in an outside cloud as opposed to -- they may take it to a cloud faster in their own operations than outsource it to someone else. And again, we were focused -- we are focused on really mission-critical, very high-end applications. And so in hindsight, we were just too optimistic in how quickly this was going to turn. We're still very convinced this is going to be a very large market, one that suits Harris well and one that we ought to be able to generate $100 million of very profitable revenue from. But we are not starting out where we had hoped. We lost, as we already had indicated, an excess of $20 million in fiscal '11. And now we're estimating this $30 million for fiscal '12. So I think it's -- unfortunately, like sometimes new market entries, you don't know what you don't know. You make assumptions. You find out sometimes you're right. In this case, we weren't. And so we've had to bake that into our updated guidance for next year."

I don't know if that'll happen or not, but that's a current expectation.

I want to welcome all of you to our First Quarter Fiscal 2012 earnings call. Before I turn to the quarter's results, earlier this month, Harris Board of Directors announced the appointment of William Brown as President and CEO to become effective on November 1. Bill joins Harris from United Technologies Corporation, where he most recently served as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Development. Previously, he served for 5 years as President of UTC's fire and security business. revenues of $6.5 billion and 45,000 employees. He has a proven track record providing growth, building and motivating teams and delivering financial results. I'm confident that his P&L management experience, his operating and commercial skills and strategic acumen will allow him to be very successful as he comes forward to  lead Harris. 
Moving now to first quarter results in Slides 3 and 4 of our presentation. We began fiscal 2012 with a number of important new wins and strong orders. We're off to a good start. Orders increased 23% compared to the prior year. They exceeded revenue and that drove a book to bill for the total company of greater than 1 during the first quarter. Consolidated revenue was $1.46 billion. That increased 4% over the prior year. If we exclude the impact of acquisitions then revenue declined about 2%. Expedited tactical radio shipments in the prior year of $235 million created a difficult year-over-year comparison to both revenue and income. And you remember these were before the expedited MRAP vehicle program. This was expected the year-over-year change and included in our prior guidance. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06 in the first quarter. Also during the first quarter, we repurchased $400 million in outstanding shares, reducing the share count by 8.6% and achieving our targeted share reduction that we had previously discussed of 8% to 9% for the fiscal year. 
Moving now to the segment results first on Slide 5. First quarter revenue for RF Communications was $497 million, comprised $373 million for Tactical Communications and $124 million for Public Safety and Professional Communications. Again the year-over-year revenue decline in RF Communications was as a result of the $235 million of expedited tactical radio shipments in the prior year quarter. 
The worst of these year-over-year quarterly comparisons is now behind us, and our baseline for future growth is essentially reset. All that remains of the $1 billion in expedited MRAP shipments that occurred over 5 quarters is the last $80 million that shipped in the second quarter in fiscal 2011. 
We believe the underlying performance in the quarter was strong with segment revenue $497 million. Excluding deliveries with the MRAP program shipments, U.S. DoD revenue and Tactical Communications increased significantly year-over-year driven by continuing Falcon III adoption supporting the DoD vision to deploy wideband networking to replace outdated voice-centric and line-of-sight Tactical Communications. International revenue growth was also strong in the quarter, increasing significantly over the prior year driven by major deliveries to Australia, Kenya and other countries in North Africa and Central Asia. Revenue from Public Safety and Professional Communications is $124 million in the first quarter, and that was a 3% increase over the prior year. Significant new wins, including the province of Alberta in Canada, Oregon, Department of Transportation, Floyd County, Georgia and Lane County, Iowa, which were all announced in the back half of fiscal 2011 are contributing to the seals ramp up and allowing us to maintain a healthy backlog in this business. For the segment, operating income in the first quarter was lower as expected at $154 million compared with the $229 million in the prior year. 
Operating margin was 31% in the quarter and is expected to improve over fiscal year '12 as a result of more favorable product mix, continuing cost containment activities and lower manufacturing costs. Lean manufacturing factory improvements implemented as part of our facilities consolidation in Rochester, New York are expected to drive productivity improvements for the year in excess of 5%, and production cycle time reductions are expected 10% to 20% across each of our product lines. 
News on the orders front was very positive. Segment orders were $514 million in the quarter with Tactical Communications orders of $398 million, Public Safety and Professional Communications orders of $116 million. That means that book to bill for the segment and for Tactical Communications were both greater than 1. And we're exiting first quarter with $800 million tactical radio backlog, and we believe that's very encouraging. New orders were especially strong in the U.S. market, perhaps the most meaningful win in the quarter was a $66 million order from the U.S. Army as part of their brigade to combat modernization program, allowing them to outset the first 8 brigade combat teams with their initial wideband networking capability. This is also known throughout the Army as Capability Set 13. So this is not the full extent to which wideband will ultimately be implemented for each of the brigade combat teams, it marks the beginning of the Army's modernization efforts. We consider the Falcon III 117G order a milestone event and our effort to become the preferred wideband tactical communications provider to the U.S. Army. The leadership position we've already achieved with the U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force and Special Operations Command, all of whom are standardizing in the Falcon III family tactical radios. 
Our success at this summer's Army in IE event, and NIE is short in Network Integration Evaluation, led in large part to the award that we received. The NIE valuations are a critical element on how the Army's network acquisition strategy is evolving. These are expected to be semi-annual evaluations. They're designed to assess and qualify the Army's tactical networking capabilities and to promote enhanced competition among programs of record and viable commercial solutions. 
Our radios clearly demonstrated the advanced capabilities of wideband networking in a challenging and real world, formal evaluation environment, receiving high marks in both their reliability and their ease-of-use. At the same time, the NIE pointed out significant deficiencies and challenges yet to be overcome by our competitors as they struggle to deliver the basic program of record radios. The successful porting of the JTRS soldier radio waveform into the Falcon III, feedback from actual users side-by-side comparisons and the fact that our Falcon III radios provide capabilities beyond what the program of record had promised, are all creating strong advocacy for our products. Also leading to this significant win with the Army has been our excellent performance in real battlefield situation in Afghanistan, where we've already outfitted 9 brigade combat teams with Falcon III radios in support of the Army's previous capability sets. The success in the field, along with our performance in the NIE, are helping to create a new model for Army radio acquisition. The latest $66 million order validates our leading position and our ability to win. DoD is clearly moving away from programs of record models and embracing Falcon III and the Enterprise Business Model as the new wave forward in acquisition. 
Now the recurring question is whether or not the DoD will continue to have an appetite to invest in Tactical Communications modernization during the tough government budget environment going forward. Without a warrant, without OCO funding, we believe the answer is, yes, and that their commitment to modernization remains strong. Just 2 weeks ago in an interview with the defense news, recently appointed U.S. Army Chief of Staff [indiscernible] commented on modernization strategy in the face of budget cuts and priorities. He said and I quote, ""Networks is one of the most important things we do. Our ability to network and provide information from the highest level down to our soldiers is one of the things we're really working on. And the reason we are excited about this is we now have companies that have developed their own capabilities and are coming down at Fort Bliss to work on these new technologies. We think there's a real potential here to lower the cost and to move us forward very quickly. We don't want to walk away from that. We have to  continue to invest in that."" 
Clearly, our customers are pleased with our progress. During the first quarter, we continued to achieve several significant product milestones, creating new capabilities and features in the Falcon III family, and we'll demonstrate these at the fall of 2011 NIE exercises that are scheduled. We received NSA certification for the SRW waveform and our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio. Shipments of these products have already begun, making Harris the first to market with an NSA certified radio incorporating the JTRS radio waveform. 
We also received NSA certification before it began shipping the Falcon III AN/PRC 152, a handheld radio, also with wideband networking capability using the Harris ANW2 waveform. 152 is the only Type-1-certified wideband handheld radio on the market. Other major U.S. orders for Falcon III wideband networking radios included $29 million in U.S. Air Force; $20 million to equip MRAP vehicles to the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps; and orders of $16 million and $15 million, respectively, from the DoD. We closed the quarter with a healthy opportunity pipeline in the U.S. market of $1.1 billion. Large opportunities continue to exist for Falcon III radios as the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force continue to upgrade their tactical networks. Also, the U.S. pipeline includes opportunities which would be procured through IDIQ contracts that we expect to be awarded from the Navy and the special operations command. 
International tactical orders in the quarter demonstrate the demand for wideband networking capabilities is also increasing and spreading around the globe. Significant wins in  the quarter included new orders totaling $52 million from a country in Southeast Asia, an integrated command control and communications systems is in Falcon III and Falcon II tactical radios; a $38 million IDIQ win with an $8 million initial delivery order to supply military communication and field support services to international partners in the Caribbean and South America; and orders from Poland, Republic of Georgia and Kuwait. 
Visibility in the international market has also improved. This is a key point. Last quarter, we talked about the political instability in North America, the Middle East and Central Asia and how that has impacted international orders. We're feeling much more optimistic about these areas as the political environment has improved and the opportunities have firmed up. International opportunity pipeline is $2.4 billion and is highlighted by significant opportunities with Iraq, Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense, the Australian Ministry of Defense, United Arab Emirates and a number of other nations in Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia. Orders in Public Safety Professional Communications were $116 million in the quarter, only slightly below revenue of $124 million, and we think still a very solid orders quarter in what continues to be a weak state in local spending environment. Backlog continues to be large, and our pipeline of opportunities remains robust with $3 billion. USPC orders in the quarter included $16 million from one of the nation's largest electric utilities to provide advanced OpenSky data and voice communication systems; $7 million for P25 LMR communication system and related radios for Beard County, Texas; and $4 million from Mobile County, Alabama of P25 system. 
Moving on next to Slide 6. Integrated Network Solutions segment revenue in the first quarter increased 26% to $554 million, primarily as a result of the contribution from acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter, and revenue increased in each of the business areas included in INS. Segment non-GAAP operating income was $19 million compared with $29 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease resulted from a combined loss of $16 million in the new cyber and commercial healthcare initiatives, partially offset by year-over-year operating income increases at Harris CapRock Communications and Broadcast Communications. Across this segment, we're winning time positions on a number of U.S. Government IDIQ contracts, giving us better access to multiple agencies and the ability to sell a broader solutions offering. In the Harris IT Services, we received a 5-year, $25 million contract from the Air Force Space Command and Missile Systems Center under the LI IDIQ contract, the sustained ground system for the Defense Meteorological Satellites Program. Also at IT services, following the close of the quarter, we acquired an Encore-2 IDIQ contract from another company, procuring a prime position to serve DISA, Defense Information Systems Agency. Encore-2 is a broad procurement contract vehicle enabling companies to provide network-centric IT solutions for command and control, intelligence and mission support. Also following the close of the quarter, IT services was awarded a prime position on the connection to GSA contract. It's similar to the SDI program for the FAA, a contract vehicle is used to procure broad telecommunications and network solutions. CapRock Communications, we were very encouraged by the leading indicators for increased demand in the energy market that we saw during the quarter. We experienced an increase in the request for proposals from customers anticipating more mix being put into service. And on existing contracts, there was definitely an uptick in short-term, add-on communication services. 
During the quarter, Harris was also awarded a 5-year $9 million contract from Farstad Shipping to provide managed satellite communications to their fleet of 53 offshore drilling ships and exploration vessels, and these operated in the North Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and off the coast of Brazil and Australia. In the government market, we received several awards totaling $52 million under the DSDSG and FCSA IDIQ contracts. We will provide managed satellite communications for DoD and national intelligence customers. Our integration efforts have resulted in Harris CapRock in consolidating 5 commercial network operation centers down to 2: 1 in Aberdeen, Scotland, 1 in Houston, Texas. We're also reducing costs by consolidating our teleport footprint and also bundling our satellite bandwidth purchases, all aimed to drive lower costs. All 3 of our vertical markets: energy, maritime and government, have significant overlap in their harsh and remote geographic coverage requirements. As a result, we've been able to establish new satellite capacity requirements under long-term contracts and repurpose this capacity as customers change their demand over time. 
In Broadcast Communications, we continue to see revenue growth in international regions: the South America, Middle East and Asia. Orders during the quarter, included $3 million from TV Azteca for the first live 3D transmissions throughout Mexico. Harris also received a $3 million order from Engineering, our Russian manufacturing partner where we'll begin local production of digital television transmitters. Russia is only on the initial stages transition from analog to digital. This will ultimately include the replacement of 22,000 transmitters across the country. So it will take place over the next several years, and we believe da Harris is well-positioned to participate significantly in this revenue opportunity. 
During the quarter, our Broadcast Communications team participated in IVC 2011 in Amsterdam, the industry's largest tradeshow. There were more than 50,000 attendees, making it the biggest show ever and is another encouraging sign for international market growth opportunities and broadcast. 
A final comment on broadcast, we recently learned that one of our contract manufacturers located in Thailand has been impacted by the recent flooding. It's really too soon for us to understand the extent of the impact and what impact it might have on the second quarter results in broadcast. We're working feverishly to mitigate any impact. All of our finished goods have been moved out of Thailand, and our suppliers in the process are moving production and starting it at an alternate location. 
Moving on, Harris Healthcare Solutions achieved a number of new government wins in the quarter. The National Cancer Institute awarded Harris a 5-year, $37 million contract under their CIO SP2 IDIQ contract vehicle for comprehensive data management. Under this contract, Harris will continue to provide the expertise that has enabled the National Cancer Institute to enhance their research databases and systems used for clinical trials. Harris was also awarded a 5-year, $55 million contract under the recently won $199 million blanket purchase agreement from the Department of Veterans Affairs for a healthcare IT program called EVEAH, Enhance the Veteran Experience and Access to HealthCare. In this program, we will integrate and deploy a Surgical Quality and Workflow Manager tool, and we'll integrate a cost solution to reduce surgery wait times and cancellations, increase patient throughput and improve the overall surgical experience for veterans and their families. The solution represents the first time to the VA has used the solution for an enterprise-wide critical information system. It will operate in all 130 of the VA hospitals who perform surgery and support over 400,000 cases per year. 
Four major academic medical centers went live this quarter with our Physician Insight Plus program, which is part of the Carefx performance management dashboard suite that's been developed in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic. Dashboard is critical to the interoperability of healthcare IT systems. It connects databases, organize the information and apply analytics that help improve clinical and operational performance. 
Also during the quarter, Healthcare Solutions was awarded a $10 million contract from Kaiser Permanente to develop and support the health information exchange, providing interoperability between their legacy systems. This is the largest commercial provider of veteran healthcare. Kaiser Permanente, a $43 billion health enterprise with over 35 medical centers and 400 medical offices serving 9 million healthcare plan members. This contract has the potential to reach $20 million and was a major win for this business in the quarter. Bottom line is, we are continuing to integrate our recent acquisitions. We're winning prime positions on IDIQ contracts, maturing new initiative with major partners in our INS segment in order to drive growth and improve profitability going forward. 
Let me now move on to Slide 7. Revenue in the Government Communications System segment was $444 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than the prior year. Underlying growth when we exclude the FDCA revenue for the Census Bureau that program finished in the prior year, our underlying growth was up 9%. We think this is outstanding performance given the tough U.S. Government spending environment. Especially positive in the quarter was the strong revenue growth in our classified programs business. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, wins in classified programs area began increasing, and we continue to experience this pickup in the first quarter where we won 5 large contracts totaling $125 million. Revenue growth in the quarter was offset also driven by the ramp up of a couple of large existing programs, including the GOES-R program, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the MET program for the U.S. Army, which provides satellite ground terminals that make up their worldwide backbone for high-priority, military communications. 
In the quarter, Harris was awarded the next 5-year, $51 million delivery order for MET to provide additional fixed and transportable X and Ka-band terminals, equipment racks, spares and operator training. This brings our total orders under the MET program to date more than $200 million of the potential $600 million contract award value. 
Revenue growth in the quarter also came from higher shipments of Highband Networking Radios, commercial satellite reflectors, wireless products and geospatial products. Especially offsetting this growth, as I've mentioned, was decline in revenue from the completion of the program for the 2010 U.S. Census and the completion of build-out of the FTI microwave network with the FAA. 
Staying with FAA, Harris received a new program award from them in the quarter, a 10-year contract with a potential value of $85 million with the Alaska satellite, telecommunications infrastructure program. Under this new program, Harris will replace and upgrade the existing satellite communications network that links the Alaska traffic control center in Anchorage with 64 other FAA facilities throughout the region. This demonstrates our continued strong relationship with the FAA, and we believe will benefit Harris as the large next-gen programs begin to be awarded over the next several years. 
Segment operating income and government communications in the first quarter was $63 million, and operating margin was very strong at 14.2%. Strong execution across the segment, along with a favorable mix from our product-focused areas continue to drive our above-industry average margins. With that, let me now ask Harris CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on our financial results in the quarter."

At the quarter end, we have $600 million remaining authorization under our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slides 8 and 9. We ended up quarter with cash on hand of $305 million. Cash flow generated from operating activities was $79 million in the quarter as compared to $295 million in the prior year. All 3 segments generated positive operating cash flow. Operating cash flow was weaker mainly as a result of lower operating income and collections primarily at RF Communications wherein in the prior year, expedited shipments and collections on tactical radios for MRAP vehicles benefited income and cash flow. And in the first quarter this year, the transition to the new factory, shipments and ultimately collections. Our expectations for the corporation our that cash flow from operations will increase steadily over the next 3 quarters as operating income increases, and days sales outstanding declined from 56 days as of the end of the first quarter to the more typical low 50s. So we are maintaining our guidance for operating cash flow at $825 million to $875 million. As a result of our slower-than-expected start to the year, we will continue to monitor this closely. 
Depreciation and amortization was $63 million as compared to $47 million in the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2012 are unchanged at $280 million to $290 million. Capital expenditures were $82 million as compared to $41 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our current guidance for fiscal year 2012 CapEx is unchanged to between $265 million and $285 million. Our effective and non-GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 31%. Our outlook for the full year tax rate remains at 33%, again noting, however, that the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. And finally during the quarter, we renewed our 364-day revolving credit facility at a level of $250 million, which combined with our primary revolver provides us with $1 billion of short-term debt capacity. With that, I'll turn it back to Howard."

Non-GAAP income excluding acquisition-related cost is expected to be in a range from $5.10 to $5.30 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 4% to 8%. Adjusted EBITDA for the year is expected to be in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion, a year-over-year increase of 4% to 8%. The RF Communications segment fiscal 2012 revenue is expected to be 3% to 6% lower than fiscal 2011. This includes a 10% decline in Tactical Communications revenue, along with double-digit growth in Public Safety and Professional Communications business area. 
Segment operating margin is still expected to be 33% to 34%. In the Integrated Network Solutions segment, we expect revenue in the range 16% to 18% higher than fiscal 2011 with organic growth in the range of 7% to 9%. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is expected to be between 5.5% and 6.5%. 
And finally, for the Government Communication System segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2012 to be 2% to 4% higher than fiscal 2011, and segment operating margins of about 13.5%. Let me close my final earnings call as Harris President and CEO by saying it's been a real privilege for me to serve this great company and our shareholders. I continue to believe in the future growth prospects for Harris. The company is well-positioned to outperform in our core U.S. government and defense businesses, while benefiting from a growing number of growth platforms, including international tactical communications, public safety, broadcast, satellite communication services, healthcare information systems and cyber integrated solutions. I believe Bill Brown will do a great job taking over from me in the leadership role, and I want to wish him and the entire Harris team my very best.

The other thing, just  to remind you, there's a significant amount of amortization intangibles and depreciation of the assets invested in cyber that are really dragging and creating a much bigger gap between operating income growth and EBITDA growth year-over-year.

I think it's going to be lumpy. A lot of it has to do with one thing. Everybody wants to have the ability to pass data over an LTE network that is robust and private and secure. It's a lot more efficient and lower cost than what they do today where they're basically using cards and laptops over these public networks, commercial networks. The issue is all about funding. The FCC and Congress are trying to move forward on this national broadband plan. $5 billion of continues to be talked about. But it's not just something that is apparent. It's going to be available in the budget for a couple of years. So I think, until up until this time, you're going to see trial systems out and essentially proving out the technology. I'm very pleased with our progress. I think LTE, as a technology, is going to be ultimately pervasive in both the public safety, as well as in the DoD market. And ultimately, our advantage, I think in being in both of these, both tactical radios, as well as public safety radios is we're going to be able to develop the integrated networks between tactical and LTE and public safety and LTE. So that from our customers perspective, the network traffic and how that's all be managed is just going to happen behind the curtain. They're not going to care, but it's going to seamlessly being able to move traffic over those networks but still get them to secure, private, control of the networks that they need.

But really like our position, and it's a much stronger than it would have been in this had happened several years ago where we were much more dependent only a couple of growth initiatives."

I want to welcome all of you to our First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Call. Before I turn to the quarter's results, earlier this month, the Harris Board of Directors announced the appointment of William M. Brown as President and CEO to become effective on November 1. Bill joins Harris from United Technologies Corporation, where he most recently served as Senior Vice President, of Corporate Strategy and Development. Previously, he served for 5 years as President of UTC's Fire & Security business, which has revenues of $6.5 billion and 45,000 employees. He has a proven track record, driving growth, building and motivating teams and delivering financial results. I'm confident that his P&L management experience, his operating and commercial skills and strategic acumen will allow him to be very successful as he comes forward to lead Harris. 
Moving now to first quarter results in Slides 3 and 4 in our presentation. We began fiscal 2012 with a number of important new wins and strong orders that  we're off to a good start. Orders increased 23% compared to the prior year. They exceeded revenue, and that drove a book-to-bill for the total company of greater than 1 during the first quarter. Consolidated revenue was $1.46 billion. That increased 4% over the prior year. If we exclude the impact of acquisitions, then revenue declined about 2%. Expedited tactical radio shipments in the prior year of $235 million created a difficult year-over-year comparison to both revenue and income. And you'll remember these were for the expedited MRAP vehicle program. This was expected, the year-over-year change, and included in our prior guidance. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06 in the first quarter. Also during the first quarter, we repurchased $400 million in outstanding shares, reducing the share count by 8.6% and achieving our targeted share reduction that we had previously discussed of 8% to 9% for the fiscal year. 
Moving now to the segment results, first on Slide 5. First quarter revenue for RF Communications was $497 million, comprised $373 million from Tactical Communications and $124 million from Public Safety and Professional Communications. Againthe year-over-year revenue decline in RF Communications was as a result of the $235 million of expedited tactical radio shipments in the prior year quarter. 
The worst of these year-over-year quarterly comparisons is now behind us, and our baseline for future growth is essentially reset. All that remains of the $1 billion in expedited MRAP shipments that occurred over 5 quarters is the last $80 million that shipped in the second quarter in fiscal 2011. 
We believe the underlying performance in the quarter was strong, with segment revenue of $497 million. Excluding deliveries with the MRAP program shipments, U.S. DoD revenue and Tactical Communications increased significantly year-over-year, driven by continuing Falcon III adoption, supporting the DoD vision to deploy wideband networking to replace outdated voice-centric and line-of-sight tactical communications. International revenue growth was also strong in the quarter, increasing significantly over the prior year, driven by major deliveries to Australia, Kenya and other countries in North Africa and Central Asia. Revenue from Public Safety and Professional Communications is $124 million in the first quarter, and that was a 3% increase over the prior year. Significant new wins, including the province of Alberta in Canada, Oregon's, Department of Transportation, Floyd County, Georgia and Linn County, Iowa, which were all announced in the back half of fiscal 2011, are contributing to the seals ramp up and allowing us to maintain a healthy backlog in this business. For the segment, operating income in the first quarter was lower as expected, at $154 million compared with the $229 million in the prior year. 
Operating margin was 31% in the quarter and is expected to improve over fiscal year '12 as a result of more favorable product mix, continuing cost containment activities and lower manufacturing costs. Lean manufacturing improvements implemented as part of our facilities consolidation in Rochester, New York are expected to drive productivity improvements for the year in excess of 5%, and production cycle time reductions are expected at 10% to 20% across each of our product lines. 
News on the orders front was very positive. Segment orders were $514 million in the quarter, with Tactical Communications orders of $398 million and Public Safety and Professional Communications orders of $116 billion (sic) [million]. That means that book-to-bill for the segment and for Tactical Communications were both greater than 1. And we're exiting first quarter with $800 million tactical radio backlog, and we believe that's very encouraging. New orders were especially strong in the U.S. market. Perhaps our most meaningful win in the quarter was a $66 million order from the U.S. Army as part of their Brigade Combat Modernization program, allowing them to outset the first 8 brigade combat teams with their initial wideband networking capability. This is also known throughout the Army as Capability Set 13. This is not the full extent to which wideband will ultimately be implemented for each of the brigade combat teams, but it marks the beginning of the Army's modernization efforts. We consider the Falcon III 117G order a milestone event in our effort to become the preferred wideband tactical communications provider to the U.S. Army. The leadership position we've already achieved with the U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force and Special Operations Command, all of whom are already standardizing in the Falcon III family tactical radios. 
Our success at this summer's Army NIE event, and NIE is short in Network Integration Evaluation, led in large part to the award that we received. The NIE evaluations are a critical element on how the Army's network acquisition strategy is evolving. These are expected to be semi-annual evaluations. They're designed to assess and qualify the Army's tactical networking capabilities and to promote enhanced competition among programs of record and viable commercial solutions. 
Our radios clearly demonstrated the advanced capabilities of wideband networking in a challenging and real world formal evaluation environment, receiving high marks in both their reliability and their ease-of-use. At the same time, the NIE pointed out significant deficiencies and challenges yet to be overcome by our competitors as they struggle to deliver the basic program-of-record  radios. The successful porting of the JTRS soldier radio waveform into the Falcon III, feedback from actual users, side-by-side comparisons and the fact that our Falcon III radios provide capabilities beyond what the program-of-record had promised, are all creating strong advocacy for our products. Also leading to this significant win with the Army has been our excellent performance in real battlefield situations in Afghanistan, where we've already outfitted 9 brigade combat teams with Falcon III radios in support of the Army's previous capability sets. The success in the field, along with our performance in the NIE, are helping  create a new model for Army radio acquisition. The latest $66 million order validates our leading position and our ability to win. DoD is clearly moving away from programs of record models and embracing Falcon III and the Enterprise Business Model as the new way forward in acquisition. 
Now a recurring question has been whether or not the DoD will continue to have an appetite to invest in tactical communications modernization during the tough government budget environment going forward. Without a warrant, without OCO funding, we believe the answer is, yes, and that their commitment to modernization remains strong. Just 2 weeks ago in an interview with Defense News, recently appointed U.S. Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno commented on modernization strategy in the face of budget cuts and priorities. He said, and I quote, ""Networks is one of the most important things we do. Our ability to network and provide information from the highest level down to our soldiers is one of the things we're really working on. And the reason we are excited about this is we now have companies that have developed their own capabilities and are coming down at Fort Bliss to work these new technologies. We think there's a real potential here to lower the cost and to move us forward very quickly. We don't want to walk away from that. We have to continue to invest in that."" 
Clearly, our customers are pleased with our progress. During the first quarter, we continued to achieve several significant product milestones, creating new capabilities and features in the Falcon III family, and we'll demonstrate these at the fall of 2011 NIE exercises that are scheduled. We received NSA certification for the SRW waveform and our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio. Shipments in these products have already begun, making Harris the first to market with an NSA certified radio incorporating the JTRS soldier radio waveform. 
We also received NSA certification before we began shipping the Falcon III AN/PRC 152 handheld radio, also with wideband networking capability using the Harris ANW2 waveform. 152 A is the only Type-1-certified wideband handheld radio on the market. Other major U.S. orders for Falcon III wideband networking radios included $29 million in U.S. Air Force; $20 million to equip MRAP vehicles to the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps; and orders of $16 million and $15 million, respectively, from the DoD. We closed the quarter with a healthy opportunity pipeline in the U.S. market of $1.1 billion. Large opportunities continue to exist for Falcon III radios as the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force continue to upgrade their tactical networks. Also, the U.S. pipeline includes opportunities, which will be procured through IDIQ contracts that we expect to be awarded from the Navy and the special operations command. 
International tactical communications orders in the quarter demonstrate that demand for wideband networking capabilities is also increasing and spreading around the globe. Significant wins in the quarter included 2 orders totaling $52 million from a country in Southeast Asia, integrated command control and communications systems is in Falcon III and Falcon II tactical radios; a $38 million IDIQ win with an $8 million initial delivery order to supply military communications and field support services to international partners in the Caribbean and South America; and orders from Poland, Republic of Georgia and Kuwait. 
Visibility in the international market has also improved. This is a key point. Last quarter, we talked about the political instability in North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia and how that has impacted international orders. We're feeling much more optimistic about these areas as the political environment has improved and the opportunities have firmed up. International opportunity pipeline is $2.4 billion and is highlighted by significant opportunities with Iraq, Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense, the Australian Ministry of Defense, United Arab Emirates and a number of other nations in Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia. Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications were $116 million in the quarter, only slightly below revenue of $124 million, and we think still at very solid orders quarter in what continues to be weak state and local spending environment. Backlog continues to be large, and our pipeline of opportunities remains robust at $3 billion. USPC orders in the quarter included $16 million from one of the nation's largest electric utilities to provide advanced OpenSky data and voice communication systems; $7 million for a p25 LMR communication system and related radios for Beard County, Texas; and $4 million from Mobile County, Alabama of P25 system. 
Moving on next to Slide 6. Integrated Network Solutions segment revenue in the first quarter increased 26% to $554 million, primarily as a result of the contribution from acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter, and revenue increased in each of the business areas included in INS. Segment non-GAAP operating income was $19 million compared with $29 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease resulted from a combined loss of $16 million in the new cyber and commercial healthcare initiatives, partially offset by year-over-year operating income increases at Harris CapRock Communications and Broadcast Communications. Across this segment, we're winning prime positions on a number of U.S. government IDIQ contracts, giving us better access to multiple agencies and the ability to sell a broader solutions offering. In the Harris IT Services, we received a 5-year, $25 million contract from the Air Force Space Command and Missile Systems Center under the Alliant IDIQ contract, the sustained in the ground system for the Defense Meteorological Satellites Program. Also at IT Services, following the close of the quarter, we acquired an Encore II IDIQ contract from another company, securing a prime position to serve DISA, Defense Information Systems Agency. Encore II is a broad procurement contract vehicle, enabling companies to provide network-centric IT solutions for command and control, intelligence and mission support. Also following the close of the quarter, IT services was awarded a prime position on the connections to GSA contract. It is similar to the FTI program for the FAA. A contract vehicle is used to procure broad telecommunications and network solutions. 
CapRock Communications, we were very encouraged by the leading indicators for increased demand in the energy market that we saw during the quarter. We experienced an increase in the request for proposals from customers anticipating more rigs being put into service. And on existing contracts, there was definitely an uptick in short-term, add-on communication services. 
During the quarter, Harris was also awarded a 5-year $9 million contract from Farstad Shipping  to provide managed satellite communications to their fleet of 53 offshore drilling ships and exploration vessels, and these operate in the North Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and off the coast of Brazil and Australia. In the government market, we received several awards totaling $52 million under the DSTS-G and FCSA IDIQ contracts. We will provide managed satellite communications for DoD and national intelligence customers. Our integration efforts have resulted in Harris CapRock in consolidating 5 commercial network operation centers down to 2: 1 in Aberdeen, Scotland, 1 in Houston, Texas. We're also reducing costs by consolidating our teleport footprint and also bundling our satellite bandwidth purchases, all aimed to driving lower costs. All 3 of our vertical markets: energy, maritime and government, have significant overlap in their harsh and remote geographic coverage requirements. As a result, we've been able to establish new satellite capacity requirements under long-term contracts and repurpose this capacity as customers change their demand over time. 
In Broadcast Communications, we continue to see revenue growth in international regions: the South America, Middle East and Asia. Orders during the quarter, included $3 million from TV Azteca for the first live 3D transmissions throughout Mexico. Harris also received a $3 million order from Svyaz  Engineering, our Russian manufacturing partner, where we'll begin local production of digital television transmitters. Russia is only in the initial stages of their transition from analog to digital. This will ultimately include the replacement of 22,000 transmitters across the country. So it'll take place over the next several years, and we believe as Harris is well positioned to participate significantly in this revenue opportunity. 
During the quarter, our Broadcast Communications team participated in IBC 2011 in Amsterdam, the industry's largest tradeshow. There were more than 50,000 attendees, making it the biggest show ever, and this is another encouraging sign for international market growth opportunities in Broadcast. 
A final comment on Broadcast. We recently learned that one of our contract manufacturers located in Thailand has been impacted by the recent flooding. It's really too soon for us to understand the extent of the impact and what impact it might have on the second quarter results in broadcast. We're working feverishly to mitigate any impact. All of our finished goods have been moved out of Thailand, and our suppliers in the process are moving production and starting it at an alternate location. 
Moving on, Harris Healthcare Solutions achieved a number of new government wins in the quarter. The National Cancer Institute awarded Harris a 5-year, $37 million contract under their CIO-SP2 IDIQ contract vehicle for comprehensive data management. Under this contract, Harris will continue to provide the expertise that has enabled the National Cancer Institute to enhance their research databases and systems used for clinical trials. Harris was also awarded a 5-year, $55 million contract under the recently won $199 million blanket purchase agreement from the Department of Veterans Affairs for a healthcare IT program called EVEAH, Enhance the Veteran Experience and Access to HealthCare. In this program, we will integrate and deploy a Surgical Quality and Workflow Manager tool, and we'll integrate a COTS solution to reduce surgery wait times and cancellations, increase patient throughput and improve the overall surgical experience for veterans and their families. The solution represents the first time EVEAH has used the COTS solution for an enterprise-wide clinical information system. It will operate in all 130 of EVEAH hospitals who perform surgery and support over 400,000 cases per year. 
Four major academic medical centers went live this quarter with our Physician Insight Plus program, which is part of the Carefx performance management dashboard suite that's been developed in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic. Dashboards are critical to the interoperability of healthcare IT systems. It connects dual-pipe [ph] databases, organize the information and apply analytics that help improve clinical and operational performance. 
Also during the quarter, Healthcare Solutions was awarded a $10 million contract from Kaiser-Permanente to develop and support the health information exchange, providing interoperability between their legacy systems. It's the largest commercial provider of veteran healthcare. Kaiser Permanente, a $43 billion health enterprise with over 35 medical centers and 400 medical offices serving 9 million healthcare plan members. This contract has the potential to reach $20 million and was a major win for this business in the quarter. Bottom line is we're continuing to integrate our recent acquisitions. We're winning prime positions on IDIQ contracts, maturing new initiative with major partners in our INS segment in order to drive growth and improve profitability going forward. 
Let me now move on to Slide 7. Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $444 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than the prior year. Underlying growth when we exclude the FDCA revenue for the Census Bureau -- that program finished in the prior year, our underlying growth was up 9%. We think this is outstanding performance given the tough U.S. Government spending environment. Especially positive in the quarter was a strong revenue growth in our classified programs business. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, wins in classified programs area began increasing, and we continue to experience this pickup in the first quarter, where we won 5 large contracts totaling $125 million. Revenue growth in the quarter was also driven by the ramp up of a couple of large existing programs, including the GOES-R program, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the MET program for the U.S. Army, which provides satellite ground terminals that make up their worldwide backbone for high-priority, military communications. 
In the quarter, Harris was awarded the next 5-year, $51 million delivery order for MET to provide additional fixed and transportable X and Ka-band terminals, equipment racks, spares and operator training. This brings our total orders under the MET program to date more than $200 million of the potential $600 million contract award value. 
Revenue growth in the quarter also came from higher shipments of Highband Networking Radios, commercial satellite reflectors, wireless products and geospatial products. Especially offsetting this growth, as I mentioned, was a decline in revenues from the completion of the Cisco [ph] program for the 2010 U.S. Census and the completion to build-out [ph] of the FTI microwave network, the FAA. 
And with FAA, Harris received a new program award from them in the quarter, a 10-year contract with a potential value of $85 million with the Alaska  Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure program. Under this new program, Harris will replace and upgrade the existing satellite communications network that links the Alaska traffic control center in Anchorage with 64 other FAA facilities throughout the region. This demonstrates our continued strong relationship with the FAA, and we believe will benefit Harris as the large next-gen programs begin to be awarded over the next several years. 
Segment operating income and government communications in the first quarter was $63 million, and operating margin was very strong at 14.2%. Strong execution across the segment, along with a favorable mix from our product-focused areas, continue to drive our above-industry average margins. 
With that, let me now ask Harris' CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on our financial results in the quarter."

As of quarter end, we have $600 million remaining authorization under our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slides 8 and 9. We ended the quarter with cash on hand of $305 million. Cash flow generated from operating activities was $79 million in the quarter as compared to $295 million in the prior year. All 3 segments generated positive operating cash flow. Operating cash flow was weaker mainly as a result of lower operating income and collections primarily at RF Communications, wherein in the prior year, expedited shipments and collections on tactical radios for MRAP vehicles benefited income and cash flow, and in the first quarter of this year, the transition to the new factory, delayed shipments and ultimately collections. Our expectations for the corporation are that our that cash flow from operations will increase steadily over the next 3 quarters as operating income increases, and days sales outstanding declined from 56 days as of the end of the first quarter to the more typical low 50s. So we are maintaining our guidance for operating cash flow at $825 million to $875 million. As a result of our slower-than-expected start to the year, we will continue to monitor this closely. 
Depreciation and amortization was $63 million as compared to $47 million in the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2012 are unchanged at $280 million to $290 million. Capital expenditures were $82 million as compared to $41 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our current guidance for fiscal year 2012 CapEx is unchanged to between $265 million and $285 million. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 31%. Our outlook for the full year tax rate remains at 33%, again noting, however, that the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. And finally during the quarter, we renewed our 364-day revolving credit facility at a level of $250 million, which combined with our primary revolver, provides us with $1 billion of short-term debt capacity.

But certainly, I don't have any specifics on the timing of that any more than we did last quarter. We're very pleased obviously with this first award. Our performance in the NIE, our performance in the field, the advancements we continue to make in the technology that are further distancing our performance in the radios from the programs of record, ultimately, that made this an easy decision, I think, for the Army and one obviously we're pleased with."

I think that's a reasonable expectation, that the drag from those gets eliminated in '12, and that they are breakeven or above in '13. The other thing just to remind you of is there's a significant amount of amortization intangibles and depreciation of the assets invested in cyber that are really dragging down and creating a much bigger gap between operating income growth and EBITDA growth year-over-year. On a cash basis, these businesses are doing much better than on a fully amortized and depreciated basis. Having said that, we understand that that's way we're reporting numbers. That's what you should focus on. I think you got it about right, by '13, these 2 contribute.

I think it's going to be lumpy. A lot of it has to do with one thing. Everybody wants to have the ability to pass data over an LTE network that is robust and private and secure. It's a lot more efficient than -- and lower cost than what they do today where they're basically using cards in laptops over these public networks, commercial networks. The issue is all about funding. The FCC and Congress are trying to move forward on this national broadband plan. $5 billion continues to be talked about. But it's not just something that is apparent. It's going to be available in the budget for a couple of years. So I think up until this time, you're going to see trial systems out and essentially proving out the technology. I'm very pleased with our progress. I think LTE, as a technology, is going to be ultimately pervasive in both the public safety, as well as in the DoD market. And ultimately, our advantage, I think, in being in both of these, both tactical radios, as well as public safety radios is we're going to be able to develop integrated networks between tactical and LTE and public safety and LTE, so that from our customers perspective, the network traffic and how it's all being managed, is just going to all happen behind the curtain. They're not going to care, but it's going to seamlessly be able to move traffic over those networks, but still give them the secure, private, control of the networks that they need. So I'm still very bullish on the technology, but it's going to be a long, long road before it's adopted in any scale, in our view."

It certainly was not at the top of the list, but it's a wonderful skill and experience that Bill has in not just doing acquisitions but in integrating them. And I think that his focus in fiscal '12, as we've said previously, will be on integrating the acquisitions that we have, getting them fully up to speed both from a cost standpoint, as well as driving revenue synergies. In the longer term, we certainly would expect acquisitions will continue to be, as they have been in the past, a part of our growth strategy, filling in holes for vertical markets, product or technologies or geographies. So I think all those are going to be positive, and certainly Bill's experience in those areas will be a great help. But I don't think you should read into this too much. He was in the M&A corporate development job only for a few months at UTC. His primary background is in running businesses and growing businesses organically. But he's got a lot of experience in allowing acquisitions to fit and to fit effectively. So it will be a great added value that he'll bring to the company by having that experience. But I don't think you should read into that it's going to somehow change Harris' strategy or that the Board is going to go out and charge Bill of doing a big deal, like the UTC-Goodrich acquisition. That's just -- that's coincidental. And in fact, it hadn't even been announced when they were talking with Bill. So that was not why they went out and found him."

I want to welcome all of you to our First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Call. Before I turn to the quarter's results, earlier this month, the Harris Board of Directors announced the appointment of William M. Brown as President and CEO to become effective on November 1. Bill joins Harris from United Technologies Corporation, where he most recently served as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Development. Previously, he served for 5 years as President of UTC's Fire & Security business, which has revenues of $6.5 billion and 45,000 employees. Bill has a proven track record of 
driving growth, building and motivating teams and delivering financial results. I'm confident that his P&L management experience, his operating and commercial skills and strategic acumen will allow him to be very successful as he comes forward to lead Harris. 
Moving now to first quarter results in Slides 3 and 4 in our presentation. We began fiscal 2012 with a number of important new wins and strong orders so we're off to a good start. Orders increased 23% compared to the prior year. They exceeded revenue, and that drove a book-to-bill for the total company of greater than 1 during the first quarter. Consolidated revenue was $1.46 billion. That increased 4% over the prior year. If we exclude the impact of acquisitions, then revenue declined about 2%. Expedited tactical radio shipments in the prior year of $235 million created a difficult year-over-year comparison to both revenue and income. And you'll remember these were for the expedited MRAP vehicle program. This was expected, the year-over-year change, and included in our prior guidance. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06 in the first quarter. Also during the first quarter, we repurchased $400 million in outstanding shares, reducing the share count by 8.6% and achieving our targeted share reduction that we had previously discussed of 8% to 9% for the fiscal year. 
Moving now to the segment results, first on Slide 5. First quarter revenue for RF Communications was $497 million, comprised $373 million from Tactical Communications and $124 million from Public Safety and Professional Communications. Again the year-over-year revenue decline in RF Communications was as a result of the $235 million of expedited tactical radio shipments in the prior year quarter. 
The worst of these year-over-year quarterly comparisons is now behind us, and our baseline for future growth is essentially reset. All that remains of the $1 billion in expedited MRAP shipments that occurred over 5 quarters is the last $80 million that shipped in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. 
We believe the underlying performance in the quarter was strong, with segment revenue of $497 million. Excluding deliveries with the MRAP program shipments, U.S. DoD revenue and Tactical Communications increased significantly year-over-year, driven by continuing Falcon III adoption, supporting the DoD vision to deploy wideband networking to replace outdated voice-centric and line-of-sight tactical communications. International revenue growth was also strong in the quarter, increasing significantly over the prior year, driven by major deliveries to Australia, Kenya and other countries in North Africa and Central Asia. Revenue from Public Safety and Professional Communications was $124 million in the first quarter, and that was a 3% increase over the prior year. Significant new wins, including the province of Alberta in Canada, Oregon's, Department of Transportation, Floyd County, Georgia and Linn County, Iowa, which were all announced in the back half of fiscal 2011, are contributing to the seals ramp up and allowing us to maintain a healthy backlog in this business. For the segment, operating income in the first quarter was lower as expected, at $154 million compared with $229 million in the prior year. 
Operating margin was 31% in the quarter and is expected to improve over fiscal year '12 as a result of more favorable product mix, continuing cost containment activities and lower manufacturing costs. Lean manufacturing improvements implemented as part of our facilities consolidation in Rochester, New York are expected to drive productivity improvements for the year in excess of 5%, and production cycle time reductions are expected at 10% to 20% across each of our product lines. 
News on the orders front was very positive. Segment orders were $514 million in the quarter, with Tactical Communications orders of $398 million and Public Safety and Professional Communications orders of $116 billion (sic) [million]. That means that book-to-bill for the segment and for Tactical Communications were both greater than 1. And we're exiting first quarter with $800 million tactical radio backlog, and we believe that's very encouraging. New orders were especially strong in the U.S. market. Perhaps our most meaningful win in the quarter was a $66 million order from the U.S. Army as part of their Brigade Combat Modernization program, allowing them to outfit the first 8 brigade combat teams with their initial wideband networking capability. This is also known throughout the Army as Capability Set 13. This is not the full extent to which wideband will ultimately be implemented for each of the brigade combat teams, but it marks the beginning of the Army's modernization efforts. We consider the Falcon III 117G order a milestone event in our effort to become the preferred wideband tactical communications provider to the U.S. Army. A leadership position we've already achieved with the U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force and Special Operations Command, all of whom are already standardizing in the Falcon III family oftactical radios. 
Our success at this summer's Army NIE event, and NIE is short in Network Integration Evaluation, led in a large part to the award that we received. The NIE evaluations are a critical element on how the Army's network acquisition strategy is evolving. These are expected to be semi-annual evaluations. They're designed to assess and qualify the Army's tactical networking capabilities and to promote enhanced competition among programs of record and viable commercial solutions. 
Our radios clearly demonstrated the advanced capabilities of wideband networking in a challenging and real world formal evaluation environment, receiving high marks in both their reliability and their ease-of-use. At the same time, the NIE pointed out significant deficiencies and challenges yet to be overcome by our competitors as they struggle to deliver the basic program-of-record  radios. The successful porting of the JTRS soldier radio waveform into the Falcon III, feedback from actual users, side-by-side comparisons and the fact that our Falcon III radios provide capabilities beyond what the program-of-record had promised, are all creating strong advocacy for our products. Also leading to this significant win with the Army has been our excellent performance in real battlefield situations in Afghanistan, where we've already outfitted 9 brigade combat teams with Falcon III radios in support of the Army's previous capability sets. Our success in the field, along with our performance at the NIE, are helping  create a new model for Army radio acquisition. The latest $66 million order validates our leading position and our ability to win.  TheDoD is clearly moving away from programs of record models and embracing Falcon III and the Enterprise Business Model as the new way forward in acquisition. 
Now a recurring question has been whether or not the DoD will continue to have an appetite to invest in tactical communications modernization during the tough government budget environment going forward. Without a war and without OCO funding, we believe the answer is, yes, and that their commitment to modernization remains strong. Just 2 weeks ago in an interview with Defense News, recently appointed U.S. Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno commented on modernization strategy in the face of budget cuts and priorities. He said, and I quote, ""Networks is one of the most important things we do. Our ability to network and provide information from the highest level down to our soldiers is one of the things we're really working on. And the reason we are excited about this is we now have companies that have developed their own capabilities and are coming down to Fort Bliss to work these new technologies. We think there's a real potential here to lower the cost and to move us forward very quickly. We don't want to walk away from that. We have to continue to invest in that."" 
Clearly, our customers are pleased with our progress. During the first quarter, we continued to achieve several significant product milestones, creating new capabilities and features in the Falcon III family, and we'll demonstrate these at the fall of 2011 NIE exercises that are scheduled. We received NSA certification for the SRW waveform in our Falcon III 117G wideband networking radio. Shipment of this product have already begun, making Harris the first to market with an NSA certified radio incorporating the JTRS soldier radio waveform. 
We also received NSA certification for and began shipping the Falcon III AN/PRC 152A handheld radio, also with wideband networking capability using the Harris ANW2 waveform. 152A is the only Type-1-certified wideband handheld radio on the market. Other major U.S. orders for Falcon III wideband networking radios included $29 million for the U.S. Air Force; $20 million to equip MRAP vehicles for the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps; and orders of $16 million and $15 million, respectively, from the DoD. We closed the quarter with a healthy opportunity pipeline in the U.S. market of $1.1 billion. Large opportunities continue to exist for Falcon III radios as the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force continue to upgrade their tactical networks. Also, the U.S. pipeline includes opportunities, which would be procured through IDIQ contracts that we expect to be awarded from the Navy and the Special Operations Command. 
International tactical communications orders in the quarter demonstrate that demand for wideband networking capabilities is also increasing and spreading around the globe. Significant wins in the quarter included 2 orders totaling $52 million from a country in Southeast Asia for integrated command control and communications systems is in Falcon III and Falcon II tactical radios; a $38 million IDIQ win with an $8 million initial delivery order to supply military communications and field support services to international partners in the Caribbean and South America; and orders from Poland, Republic of Georgia and Kuwait. 
Visibility in the international market has also improved. This is a key point. Last quarter, we talked about the political instability in North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia and how that has impacted international orders. We're feeling much more optimistic about these areas as the political environment has improved and the opportunities have firmed up. The international opportunity pipeline is $2.4 billion and is highlighted by significant opportunities with the Iraq Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense, the Australian Ministry of Defense, the United Arab Emirates and a number of other nations in Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia. Orders in Public Safety and Professional Communications were $116 million in the quarter, only slightly below revenue of $124 million, and we think still at very solid orders quarter in what continues to be weak state and local spending environment. Backlog continues to be large, and our pipeline of opportunities remains robust at $3 billion. PSPC orders in the quarter included $16 million from one of the nation's largest electric utilities to provide advanced OpenSky data and voice communication systems; $7 million for a p25 LMR communication system and related radios for Beard County, Texas; and $4 million from Mobile County, Alabama for a P25 system. 
Moving on next to Slide 6. Integrated Network Solutions segment revenue in the first quarter increased 26% to $554 million, primarily as a result of the contribution from acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter, and revenue increased in each of the business areas included in INS. Segment non-GAAP operating income was $19 million compared with $29 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease resulted from a combined loss of $16 million in the new cyber and commercial healthcare initiatives, partially offset by year-over-year operating income increases at Harris CapRock Communications and Broadcast Communications. Across this segment, we're winning prime positions on a number of U.S. government IDIQ contracts, giving us better access to multiple agencies and the ability to sell a broader solutions offering. In the Harris IT Services, we received a 5-year, $25 million contract from the Air Force Space Command and Missile Systems Center under the Alliant IDIQ contract, to sustain the ground system for the Defense Meteorological Satellites Program. Also at IT Services, following the close of the quarter, we acquired an Encore II IDIQ contract from another company, securing a prime position to serve DISA, the Defense Information Systems Agency. Encore II is a broad procurement contract vehicle, enabling companies to provide network-centric IT solutions for command and control, intelligence and mission support. Also following the close of the quarter, IT services was awarded a prime position on the connections to GSA contract. This is similar to the FTI program for the FAA. A contract vehicle is used to procure broad telecommunications and network solutions. 
At CapRock Communications, we were very encouraged by the leading indicators for increased demand in the energy market that we saw during the quarter. We experienced an increase in the request for proposals from customers anticipating more rigs being put into service. And on existing contracts, there was definitely an uptick in short-term, add-on communication services. 
During the quarter, Harris was also awarded a 5-year $9 million contract from Farstad Shipping  to provide managed satellite communications to their fleet of 53 offshore drilling ships and exploration vessels, and these operate in the North Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and off the coast of Brazil and Australia. In the government market, we received several awards totaling $52 million under the DSTS-G and FCSA IDIQ contracts. Where  we'll provide managed satellite communications for DoD and national intelligence customers. Our integration efforts have resulted at Harris CapRock in consolidating 5 commercial network operation centers down to 2: 1 in Aberdeen, Scotland, 1 in Houston, Texas. We're also reducing costs by consolidating our teleport footprint and also bundling our satellite bandwidth purchases, all aimed at driving lower costs. All 3 of our vertical markets: energy, maritime and government, have significant overlap in their harsh and remote geographic coverage requirements. As a result, we've been able to establish new satellite capacity requirements under long-term contracts and repurpose this capacity as customers change their demand over time. 
In Broadcast Communications, we continue to see revenue growth in international regions: the South America, Middle East and Asia. Orders during the quarter, included $3 million from TV Azteca for the first live 3D transmissions throughout Mexico. Harris also received a $3 million order from Svyaz  Engineering, our Russian manufacturing partner, where we'll begin local production of digital television transmitters. Russia is only in the initial stages of their transition from analog to digital. This will ultimately include the replacement of 22,000 transmitters across the country. This will take place over the next several years, and we believe as Harris is well positioned to participate significantly in this revenue opportunity. 
During the quarter, our Broadcast Communications team participated in IBC 2011 in Amsterdam, the industry's largest tradeshow. There were more than 50,000 attendees, making it the biggest show ever, and this is another encouraging sign for international market growth opportunities in Broadcast. 
A final comment on Broadcast. We recently learned that one of our contract manufacturers located in Thailand has been impacted by the recent flooding. It's really too soon for us to understand the extent of the impact and what impact it might have on the second quarter results in broadcast. We're working feverishly to mitigate any impact. All of our finished goods have been moved out of Thailand, and our suppliers in the process of moving production and starting it at an alternate location. 
Moving on, Harris Healthcare Solutions achieved a number of new government wins in the quarter. The National Cancer Institute awarded Harris a 5-year, $37 million contract under their CIO-SP2 IDIQ contract vehicle for comprehensive data management. Under this contract, Harris will continue to provide the expertise that has enabled the National Cancer Institute to enhance their research databases and systems used for clinical trials. Harris was also awarded a 5-year, $55 million contract under the recently won $199 million blanket purchase agreement from the Department of Veterans Affairs for a healthcare IT program called EVEAH, Enhance the Veterans Experience and Access to HealthCare. In this program, we will integrate and deploy a Surgical Quality and Workflow Manager tool, and we'll integrate a COTS solution to reduce surgery wait times and cancellations, increase patient throughput and improve the overall surgical experience for veterans and their families. The solution represents the first time EVEAH has used the COTS solution for an enterprise-wide clinical information system. It will operate in all 130 of EVEAH hospitals who perform surgery and support over 400,000 cases per year. 
Four major academic medical centers went live this quarter with our Physician Insight Plus program, which is part of the Carefx performance management dashboard suite that's been developed in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic. Dashboards are critical to the interoperability of healthcare IT systems. It connects dual-pipe [ph] databases, organize the information and apply analytics that help improve clinical and operational performance. 
Also during the quarter, Healthcare Solutions was awarded a $10 million contract from Kaiser-Permanente to develop and support a health information exchange, providing interoperability between their legacy systems. As the largest commercial provider of veteran healthcare. Kaiser Permanente, a $43 billion health enterprise with over 35 medical centers and 400 medical offices serving 9 million healthcare plan members. This contract has the potential to reach $20 million and was a major win for this business in the quarter. Bottom line is we're continuing to integrate our recent acquisitions. We're winning prime positions on IDIQ contracts, maturing new initiative with major partners in our INS segment in order to drive growth and improve profitability going forward. 
Let me now move on to Slide 7. Revenue in the Government Communications Systems segment was $444 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than the prior year. Underlying growth when we exclude the FDCA revenue for the Census Bureau -- that program finished in the prior year, our underlying growth was up 9%. We think this is outstanding performance given the tough U.S. Government spending environment. Especially positive in the quarter was a strong revenue growth in our classified programs business. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, wins in classified programs area began increasing, and we continue to experience this pickup in the first quarter, where we won 5 large contracts totaling $125 million. Revenue growth in the quarter was also driven by the ramp up of a couple of large existing programs, including the GOES-R program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the MET program for the U.S. Army, which provides satellite ground terminals that make up their worldwide backbone for high-priority, military communications. 
In the quarter, Harris was awarded the next 5-year, $51 million delivery order for MET to provide additional fixed and transportable X and Ka-band terminals, equipment racks, spares and operator training. This brings our total orders under the MET program to date to more than $200 million of the potential $600 million contract award value. 
Revenue growth in the quarter also came from higher shipments of Highband Networking Radios, commercial satellite reflectors, wireless products and geospatial products. Partially offsetting this growth, as I mentioned, was a decline in revenue from the completion of the Cisco [ph] program for the 2010 U.S. Census and the completion to build-out [ph] of the FTI microwave network, the FAA. 
Staying with FAA, Harris received a new program award from them in the quarter, a 10-year contract with a potential value of $85 million with the Alaska  Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure program. Under this new program, Harris will replace and upgrade the existing satellite communications network that links the Alaska Air Route Traffic Control Center in Anchorage with 64 other FAA facilities throughout the region. This demonstrates our continued strong relationship with the FAA, and we believe will benefit Harris as the large next-gen programs begin to be awarded over the next several years. 
Segment operating income and government communications in the first quarter was $63 million, and operating margin was very strong at 14.2%. Strong execution across the segment, along with a favorable mix from our product-focused areas, continue to drive our above-industry average margins. 
With that, let me now ask Harris' CFO, Gary McArthur, to comment on our financial results in the quarter."

As highlighted on Slide 4 and already mentioned by Howard, we repurchased $400 million in shares, reducing shares outstanding by $10.6 million or 8.6%. As of quarter end, we have $600 million remaining authorization under our share repurchase program. 
Turning to Slides 8 and 9. We ended the quarter with cash on hand of $305 million. Cash flow generated from operating activities was $79 million in the quarter as compared to $295 million in the prior year. All 3 segments generated positive operating cash flow. Operating cash flow was weaker mainly as a result of lower operating income and collections primarily at RF Communications, wherein in the prior year, expedited shipments and collections on tactical radios for MRAP vehicles benefited income and cash flow, and in the first quarter of this year, the transition to the new factory, delayed shipments and ultimately collections. Our expectations for the corporation are that cash flow from operations will increase steadily over the next 3 quarters as operating income increases, and days sales outstanding declined from 56 days as of the end of the first quarter to the more typical low 50s. Though we are maintaining our guidance for operating cash flow at $825 million to $875 million. As a result of our slower-than-expected start to the year, we will continue to monitor this closely. 
Depreciation and amortization was $63 million as compared to $47 million in the prior year. Our expectations for depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2012 are unchanged at $280 million to $290 million. Capital expenditures were $82 million as compared to $41 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our current guidance for fiscal year 2012 CapEx is unchanged to between $265 million and $285 million. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 31%. Our outlook for the full year tax rate remains at 33%, again noting, however, that the tax rate for any given quarter could vary up or down as a result of discrete tax events. And finally during the quarter, we renewed our 364-day revolving credit facility at a level of $250 million, which combined with our primary revolver, provides us with $1 billion of short-term debt capacity. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Howard."

Segment operating margin is still expected to be 33% to 34%. For the Integrated Network Solutions segment, we expect revenue in the range 16% to 18% higher than fiscal 2011, with organic growth in the range of 7% to 9%. Non-GAAP segment operating margin is expected to be between 5.5% and 6.5%. 
And finally, for the Government Communication Systems segment, we expect revenue for fiscal 2012 to be 2% to 4% higher than fiscal 2011, and segment operating margins of about 13.5%. 
Let me close my final earnings call as Harris President and CEO by saying it's been a real privilege for me to serve this great company and our shareholders. I continue to believe in the future growth prospects for Harris. The company is well positioned to outperform in our core U.S. government and defense businesses, while benefiting from a growing number of growth platforms, including international tactical communications, public safety, broadcast, satellite communication services, healthcare information systems and cyber-integrated solutions. I believe Bill Brown will do a great job taking over from me in the leadership role, and I want to wish him and the entire Harris team my very best.

Is this -- is it your view that you'll get through most of those activities and we can see the money-losing businesses moving to profitability in '13 and the restructuring largely being behind you in '13? Or is this going to be a process that drags on further than that based on what you're seeing today?"

But right now, we expect to see improvement as the year goes on. And we are not expecting to take that negative 60 to a positive number next quarter, but we are expecting progress in the commercial healthcare business we bought, as well as the cyber business that we have started from scratch. So I think that's a reasonable expectation, that the drag from those gets eliminated in '12, and that they are breakeven or above in '13. The other thing just to remind you of is there's a significant amount of amortization intangibles and depreciation of the assets invested in cyber that are really dragging down and creating a much bigger gap between operating income growth and EBITDA growth year-over-year. On a cash basis, these businesses are doing much better than on a fully amortized and depreciated basis. Having said that, we understand that that's the way we're reporting numbers. That's what you should focus on. I think you got it about right, by '13, these 2 contribute. We continue to see improvement from the Harris CapRock acquisition and their growth and in broadcast and continue to feel very positive about the INS segment as a major driver of revenue growth and margin expansion in '13 and '14 to help us get up to the higher levels of EPS that we're striving for."

So I think up until this time, you're going to see trial systems out and essentially proving out the technology. I'm very pleased with our progress. I think LTE, as a technology, is going to be ultimately pervasive in both the public safety, as well as in the DoD market. And ultimately, our advantage, I think, in being in both of these, both tactical radios, as well as public safety radios is we're going to be able to develop integrated networks between tactical and LTE and public safety and LTE, so that from our customers perspective, the network traffic and how it's all being managed, is just going to all happen behind the curtain. They're not going to care, but it's going to seamlessly be able to move traffic over those networks, but still give them the secure, private, control of the networks that they need.

Although I think General Odierno's quote that I read clearly says that he's interested in cost and speed and capability. And I think that's where we win this game. We really are offering all 3 of those, and no one else can do it. In terms of additional features, I think it's more of the same. I think it's very much about the network and the network effectivity. We'll be able to use radios now from Harris at that NIE in the fall that will have both the SRW and the ANW2 waveform. No one else is going to have both of those in the radio. And -- so we just have such a significant lead, but I think it's just -- it's more of the same. The last one was the first NIE. Part of it is just getting, I think, a tempo of doing this a couple of times a year. But I can't really speak to any specific requirements they have added over the last one at this point, Michael. So I'm just not aware of anything significantly different. But I know what we're going to be bringing are the lessons learned and continued enhancements we've made since the last one and the integration of the SRW2 -- SRW waveform into both the 117G and the 152."

We're talking about them because we think they're significant. They occurred after the quarter end. So when the orders booked is what determines what quarter it goes into, sometimes -- in fact, in every case, there's usually a gap of at least a few weeks between when we get an order and when the customer approves a press release allowing us to announce it. So those don't always line up when we issue it. It's normally weeks. As Pam said, sometimes it's longer. But we can announce an order in October, but the order may have been booked, received and appropriately booked in September. It would have been included in the first quarter numbers. But we don't include anything in the quarter that doesn't meet our requirements as a bookable order, and that's got a pretty high threshold and E&Y [indiscernible] reviews that."

We don't believe that the CR would have a meaningful impact on our fiscal '12 operations. We have tried to bake into our outlook what we think may be some impact. Now it's always possible, it could be worse. But I don't feel like, today, there is much downside for Harris Corporation if we stayed on a continued resolution for the rest of fiscal year '12. '13, '14, '15, there's lots of question marks out there regarding budgets and so on. So I'm not going to comment on that because I don't know what's going to happen anymore than you do. Bottom line is, I think our '12 guidance is solid, and the continuing CR shouldn't have much downside impact this fiscal year. I think that, again, our level of diversification in programs, in customers and now across a number of government and commercial vertical markets should allow us to continue to outperform the market. Will we outperform at a level we're all happy with? I think that time remains to be seen whether we do that. But I really like our position, and it's much stronger than it would have been if this had happened several years ago, where we were much more dependent only on a couple of growth initiatives."
