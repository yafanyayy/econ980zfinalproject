With the loss of $0.04 per diluted share, the fourth quarter proved to be the most challenging quarter of 2010 as we predicted. Of particular note, metal margins in our steel mills declined by $27 per ton from third qua",958,"Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon. With the loss of $0.04 per diluted share, the fourth quarter proved to be the most challenging quarter of 2010 as we predicted. Of particular note, metal margins in our steel mills declined by $27 per ton from third quarter levels. A sharp escalation in scrap prices late this fall outpaced our ability to realize mill price increases in time to benefit the fourth quarter. The margin compression was great in that of our flat rolled mills. 
In our mid December guidance, we reported our expectation that the 2010 four-year LIFO charge will be lower than the amount estimated at the end of the third quarter. The fourth quarter LIFO charge of $23 million was down from our average quarterly expense of $47 million at the end of the third quarter, but in line with our guidance estimate. This decline reflected lower year-end units of inventory compared to third quarter. 
Our full year 2010 LIFO charge was $164 million compared with the 2009 LIFO credit of $467 million. Nucor incurred a $10 million charge in the fourth quarter related to the termination of the Highs Mill joint venture in Australia. This charge was not incorporated in the quantitative guidance we gave in mid-December. While the Highs Mill technology still has promise, the partners at decided additional capital expenditures would not be a good investment in the current economic environment. For Nucor, we believe our best iron-making investment opportunities today are in growing our direct reduced iron or DRI I should give abilities. We will continue to build on both the knowledge gained from our highly successful DRI Plant Internet and our long term supplies of attractive price natural gas. 
Fourth quarter results also included $39 million of pre-operating and startup costs. On a quarterly basis, there has been some improvement from the peak level of more than $50 million in 2010's first quarter. For the full year 2010, these expenses totaled $175 million. Nucor typically incur significant pre-operating and startup expenses during economic downturns. We view these cost as investments to grow our long-term earnings power. We look for these new businesses to be significant profit generators in the years ahead. That is in our companies experienced over many three cycles. 
For example, Nucor's most recent cyclical peak earnings of almost $6 per share in 2008 carried sizable benefits and contributions from the startup projects undertaken during the 2001 to 2003 downturn. It goes back to the Dan's point that our team continues Nucor's long history of emerging from downturns stronger than we enter them. Successful execution of this strategy is how we build long-term value for our shareholders. It is our financial strength that allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. At the close of 2010, cash and short-term investments totaled almost $2.5 billion. Not included in that total is an additional $600 million of restricted cash. This restricted cash resulted from our issuance of golf opportunities or goes own funds in November. These tax-exempt bonds were authorized by the state of Louisiana and will finance a significant portion of the $750 million DRI Plant we're building in St. James Parish in Louisiana. 
Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until November 2012. We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at year-end 2010. That is an increase of $1.2 billion from the beginning of the year. Nucor's conservative financial practices and strong balance sheet allowed us to be opportunistic in taking advantage of favorable credit market conditions last year to reduce our overall cost of capital. In addition to November's tax-exempt bond financing, we issued $600 million of 12-year unsecured notes with a coupon rate of 4.125%. That transaction was an excellent opportunity to prepare for upcoming long-term debt maturities of $650 million in 2012 and $250 million in 2013. 
Allowing for these dynamics, Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash balances over $1.2 billion. At year-end 2010, that net debt-to-capital ratio was approximately 29%. That calculation excludes restricted cash. Our operating cash flow performance in 2010 highlights another key strength of our business model. Cash provided for buy-to-buy operating activities were nearly $900 million in 2010. That more than covered capital spending of $345 million and cash dividends paid of $457 million for the year. In 2011, we will continue to allocate capital to investments that build our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $560 million. Included in that total are about $120 million of spending for our Louisiana DRI Plant and about $60 million for our natural gas working interest drilling program. 
As we enter the first quarter, the trend of improving market conditions that began in the fourth quarter has continued. Steel mill utilization rates have increased then in fact, fourth quarter shipments increased 32% over third quarter levels. We have been able to significantly raise mill selling prises in response to rising raw material costs and some improvement in and use demand. Downstream fabricated Construction Products markets remain very challenging. Overall, we expect a return to profitability in the first quarter. And we believe the positive trend in earnings will continue into the second quarter.
We'll again file all our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. In the long-term, we're very optimistic about Nucor's prospects to continue building attractive and sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. Our team is working hard very effectively to capitalize in our company's position of strength. Thank you for your interest in Nucor.

We are extremely proud of the work that you ar",1268,"Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon. Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel products teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and taking care of Nucor's customers. We are extremely proud of the work that you are doing in the tough economic times that have been with us for more than two years. Thank you, and please keep it going.
My report can be summarized in this one sentence: For Nucor, downturns create opportunities, opportunities for profitable growth. Here are some examples of how we are coming out of the economic downturn stronger than we entered it. Nucor's plate and structural mills are doing an excellent job of growing our market during the current downturn. Highlighting the gains, these mills are shipped to total of 240,000 tons of products that were not even offered in our mix two years ago. Even better, their work continues. Our preferred County North Carolina plate mills new heat treat line was commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2010, and it is quickly ramping up to its full capacity of 125,000 tons per year. The product coming off of this line is everything we hoped it would be: Great shape, great service and write on speck.  This investment allows to go into higher margin products were higher strained, a greater resistance and greater toughness are required. 
Our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill team has continued to improve our recently added Temple line so that it's now capable of running one inch thick plates. This will allow us to sell as much as 250,000 tons per year of higher margins of the length blades rather than commodity powered coiled. Just as exciting, the Tuscaloosa team has used their ingenuity and virtually no capital to start producing the end of the hot mill. We expect to be able to produce as much as 125,000 tons per year of this higher valued, higher margin discrete plate at Tuscaloosa due to these improvements.
Although these projects at Hartford County in Tuscaloosa will not increase our total plate capacity, they will have the combined effect of moving more than 500,000 annual tons of plate output from commodity grades to higher value grades that generate higher margins per ton. That of course means higher earnings power in the future from our plate mills.  And we will not stop there in expanding our portfolio of margin enhanced plate products to better serve our customers and generate greater profits for our shareholders.
We recently approved the capital to install a vacuum gas in the Hartford County. Commissioning is expected in the first quarter of 2013. This will further broaden our product mix to include all the plate and served alloy plate grades. Our Bomill group is also growing Nucor's long-term earnings power with a number of projects that have started up during the current downturn. These include our new SBQ mill in Memphis and our wire rod and coiled rebar rolling mill in Arizona. The Memphis mill more than doubles our capacity to serve the SBQ markets while also expanding our product range into the highly attractive 3-inch and 10-inch larger diameter segment.  Memphis continues to gain product qualifications and production volumes for OEMs in the construction equipment, automotive, heavy truck, farm equipment and energy markets.  In December, our Memphis team set a record for shipments of rolled finished goods. 
With the addition of our low-cost rolling mill in Arizona, Nucor can now serve all regions of the country with our wire rod products. Our Nucor Steel came in team also is at our shipment record in December and recently expanded from a single shift to double shift operations.
Reflecting our cultures drive for continual improvement and profitable growth, there is more to come. For example, Nucor Steel Nebraska will be adding a downstream processing line that provides new growth opportunities and even higher-quality SBQ products than they currently offer. Additionally, our bar mills in Texas, Utah and South Carolina, along with our Nucor model being mill has established NQA1 quality systems that allow them to supply steel to nuclear power plant construction projects.
Nucor's sheep mill group is also continuing to what the value chain, with margin enhanced products that grow long-term earnings power. Building on Nucor Steel Berkeley while value-added bakken degas steel, we will be installing a second sheet mill bakken degasser at our Hickman, Arkansas facility. As though westernmost flat rolled facility in the United States, where the back end the gas Nucor Steel Arkansas will be strategically positioned to take advantage of the growing market to the West, Southwest and Mexico. Already, over 20% of all the gas deals currently sold in the U.S. are purchased by OEMs located in states adjacent Arkansas. 
In addition to the opportunities to expand our current market share with existing customers in automotive, HVAC, and oil country tubular goods, the Hickman degasser will enable us to develop new customers and target markets such as motor laminations, garage doors and lawn-and-garden.
We expect commissioning took our in the fourth quarter of 2012.
I will close my report with our thoughts on current market conditions. The market environment for our fabricated Construction Products business continues to be extremely challenged, and it has been for some time. We have been working throughout 2010 to raise prices in each of the industries in which we participate, with varying degrees of success. In addition to seeing some measured success in achieving price increases, we have seen our market share increase strongly in several of our downstream businesses. In our ball crop Verco group, we achieved significant market share increases in both joint and deck in 2010. In our Metal Buildings group, we obtained an even greater market share increase. We also signed up a large number of new builders. Builders are the distribution chain in that industry. And we bought fabrication we purchased several small fabricators in the Southeast and another one in Texas.
We want to thank all of our teammates in those businesses for their excellent work in making the best of the very difficult environment. Despite the challenging times, they are unrelenting and demonstrating the Nucor can-do spirit by working safely, working hard and staying focused on continuous improvement.
On the Steelmaking side, we are encouraged by recent signs of some improvement in wheel demand. However, it is difficult to determine how much of the overall increase in a parent demand is driven by steel buyers reacting to increasing raw material and steel prices.
Fortunately, service center inventories through December remain at relatively low levels. It is our belief that real demand will continue to grow gradually throughout 2011.
The December AIA Architecture Building Index suggest non-residential construction activity may start growing again in late 2011.  We view 2011  with cautious optimism. An optimism anchored by our ongoing view that the U.S. economy is likely to experience a gradual recovery due to structural imbalances that must be addressed by our elected officials. In addition, we are keeping more than a watchful eye on influence that continued to have two great a share of the U.S. market at a time when our low-cost domestic industry is still running at only 70% of capacity. We are focused on taking preemptive trade actions as a more supportive administration and Congress has shown a willingness to do. But whatever direction the economy takes over the short term, our team is primed and ready to utilize Nucor's position of strength and our extremely flexible business model to continue to generate long-term earnings for our shareholders.
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

The Nucor team is building long-term value for our shareholders. And we have had a successful record that extends over nearly five decades of doing just that. Its' worthwhile to look at the long-term value we have generated over the last cycle. From the cyclical trough and in our stock price in the 7th of September of 2001 when the new executive team started to 2010 closing price, our long-term shareholders enjoyed a more than 7.3x increase in the value of their investment including dividends, 7.3x. Speaking of dividends, in December, our board increased are regular quarterly cash dividend for the 38th consecutive year. And over the period from 2000 and 2010, Nucor's based dividend has increased approximately tenfold. is returned star shareholders from growth in our stock price and pay cash dividends have not just happened by accident or by writing a cyclical upturn. They were achieved by building sustainable business that is generated large returns on capital in the North American steel industry over that 2000 to 2010 time span. And they reflect our teams' unrelenting focus of being effective stewards of our shareholders valuable capital. 
In our long-term focus and approach to managing our business has been constant to this most recent severe recession. Nucor continue to make substantial investments to position us for our new high-rise earnings power once the sustainable economic recovery arrives.
What exactly what we mean when we say growing strong returning downturns? From 2007 to our expected 2011 capital spending plans, we have invested more than $6 billion of capital, including both capital expenditures and acquisitions. That is a lot of capital that Nucor shareholders will get paid for to attract the returns as they move to the next obstacle. Our team is very optimistic about Nucor's prospects for rewarding our shareholders with attractive long-term returns, just like we've been doing. Why? Because as a team, we're driven to sell for nothing less. 
Finally, I will close with some very exciting news received just today. We have received the final permit for our 22.5 million tons plant in Louisiana. These facilities will produce high-quality  DRI to use our SBQ plates and sheet mills. Initially we will build the plant. To expand to the solidity shortly thereafter. These plants will enable a second allow for greater self sufficiency, controlling more of our own raw materials, along with assuring us of high-quality raw material feed. We anticipate starting construction immediately, and we have placed orders for the major equipment irons already with our suppliers.
We have an anticipated startup of mid-2013. The Nucor team is excited to be part of the same Louisiana and bringing in the type high-paying jobs that would help make us interval partners community. We appreciate all of the help and support that govern Bobby Jindall and all the others to local agencies have given to us to help this process come to fruition.
Once again, thank you for your interest in Nucor and we would now be happy to take your questions."

And currently, the second phase is still planned to be a blast furnace coke oven operation and the third phase to be finishing and rolling, maybe steelmaking operations, depending on how the market develops over the next several years and so the total investment could be significantly greater than $3 billion and you've seen numbers in the past that were $6 billion. But those numbers include a blast furnace and coke ovens and associated support equipment and power plants for the first phase being glass furnace as opposed to now being DRI plans.

With a loss of $0.04 per diluted share, the fourth quarter proved to be the most challenging quarter of 2010 as we predicted. Of particular note, metal margins at our steel mills declined by $27 per ton from third quart",954,"Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon. With a loss of $0.04 per diluted share, the fourth quarter proved to be the most challenging quarter of 2010 as we predicted. Of particular note, metal margins at our steel mills declined by $27 per ton from third quarter levels. A sharp escalation in scrap prices late this fall outpaced our ability to realize mill price increases in time to benefit the fourth quarter. The margin compression was great as that of our flat rolled mills. 
In our mid-December guidance, we reported our expectation that the 2010 four-year LIFO charge would be lower than the amount estimated at the end of the third quarter. The fourth quarter LIFO charge of $23 million was down from our average quarterly expense of $47 million at the end of the third quarter, but in line with our guidance estimate. This decline reflected lower year-end units of inventory compared to third quarter. 
Our full year 2010 LIFO charge was $164 million compared with the 2009 LIFO credit of $467 million. Nucor incurred a $10 million charge in the fourth quarter related to the termination of the HIsmelt joint venture in Australia. This charge was not incorporated in the quantitative guidance we gave in mid-December. While the HIsmelt technology still has promise, the partners had decided that additional capital expenditures would not be a good investment in the current economic environment. For Nucor, we believe our best iron-making investment opportunities today are in growing our direct reduced iron or DRI production abilities. We will continue to build on both the knowledge gained from our highly successful DRI plant in Trinidad and on our long term supplies of attractively priced natural gas. 
Fourth quarter results also included $39 million of pre-operating and startup costs. On a quarterly basis, there has been some improvement from the peak level of more than $50 million in 2010's first quarter. For the full year 2010, these expenses totaled $175 million. Nucor typically incurs significant pre-operating and startup expenses during economic downturns. We view these costs as investments to grow our long-term earnings power. We look for these new businesses to be significant profit generators in the years ahead. That has been our company's experience over many three cycles. 
For example, Nucor's most recent cyclical peak earnings of almost $6 per share in 2008 carried sizable benefits in contributions from the startup projects undertaken during the 2001 to 2003 downturn. It goes back to Dan's point that our team expects to continue Nucor's long history of emerging from downturns stronger than we entered them. Successful execution of this strategy is how we build long-term value for our shareholders. It is our financial strength that allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. At the close of 2010, cash and short-term investments totaled almost $2.5 billion. Not included in that total is an additional $600 million of restricted cash. This restricted cash resulted from our issuance of Gulf Opportunity or GO Zone Bonds in November. These tax-exempt bonds were authorized by the State of Louisiana and will finance a significant portion of the $750 million DRI plant we're building in St. James Parish, Louisiana. 
Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until November 2012. We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at year-end 2010. That is an increase of $1.2 billion from the beginning of the year. Nucor's conservative financial practices and strong balance sheet allowed us to be opportunistic in taking advantage of favorable credit market conditions last year to reduce our overall cost of capital. In addition to November's tax-exempt bond financing, we issued $600 million of 12-year unsecured notes with a coupon rate of 4.125%. That transaction was an excellent opportunity to prepare for upcoming long-term debt maturities of $650 million in 2012 and $250 million in 2013.  Allowing for these dynamics, Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash balances over $1.2 billion. At year-end 2010, that net debt-to-capital ratio was approximately 29%. That calculation excludes restricted cash. 
Our operating cash flow performance in 2010 highlights another key strength of our business model. Cash provided by operating activities were nearly $900 million in 2010. That more than covered capital spending of $345 million and cash dividends paid of $457 million for the year. In 2011, we will continue to allocate capital to investments that build our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $560 million. Included in that total are about $120 million of spending for our Louisiana DRI plant and about $60 million for our natural gas working interest drilling program. 
As we enter the first quarter, the trend of improving market conditions that began in the fourth quarter has continued. Steel mill utilization rates have increased. In fact, fourth quarter shipments increased 32% over third quarter levels. We have been able to significantly raise mill selling prices in response to rising raw material costs and some improvement in end-use demand. Downstream fabricated Construction Products markets remain very challenging. Overall, we expect a return to profitability in the first quarter, and we believe the positive trend in earnings will continue into the second quarter.  We'll again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. 
In the long-term, we are very optimistic about Nucor's prospects to continue building attractive and sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. Our team is working hard and very effectively to capitalize on our company's position of strength. Thank you for your interest in Nucor.

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel products teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and taking care of Nucor's customers. We are extremely proud of the work that you are doing in the tough economic times that have been with us for more than two years. Thank you, and please keep it going.
My report can be summarized in this one sentence: For Nucor, downturns create opportunities; opportunities for profitable growth. Here are some examples of how we are coming out of the economic downturn stronger than we entered it. Nucor's plate and structural mills are doing an excellent job of growing our market during the current downturn. Highlighting the gains, these mills have shipped a total of 240,000 tons of products that were not even offered in our mix two years ago. Even better, their work continues. Our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mills' new heat treat line was commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2010, and it is quickly ramping up to its full capacity of 125,000 tons per year. The product coming off of this line is everything we hoped it would be: Great shape, great surface and right on spec.  This investment allows Hertford County to grow into higher margin products where higher strength, abrasion resistance and greater toughness are required. 
Our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill team has continued to improve our recently added temper line so that it's now capable of running one-inch thick plates. This will allow us to sell as much as 250,000 tons per year of higher margins, temper pass, cut-to-length plates blades rather than commodity hot rolled coil. Just as exciting, the Tuscaloosa team has used their ingenuity and virtually no capital to start producing discrete plate off the end of the hot mill. We expect to be able to produce as much as 125,000 tons per year of this higher valued, higher margin discrete plate at Tuscaloosa due to these improvements.
Although these projects at Hertford County in Tuscaloosa will not increase our total plate capacity, they will have the combined effect of moving more than 500,000 annual tons of plate output from commodity grades to higher value grades that generate higher margins per ton. That, of course, means higher earnings power in the future from our plate mills.  And we will not stop there in expanding our portfolio of margin-enhanced plate products to better serve our customers and generate greater profits for our shareholders.
We recently approved a capital to install a vacuum degasser at Hertford County. Commissioning is expected in the first quarter of 2013. This will further broaden our product mix to include armor plate and certain alloyed plate grades. Our Bar Mill Group is also growing Nucor's long-term earnings power with a number of projects that have started up during the current downturn. These include our new SBQ mill in Memphis and our wire rod and coiled rebar rolling mill in Arizona. The Memphis mill more than doubles our capacity to serve the SBQ mill in Memphis and our wire rod and coil rebar rolling mill in Arizona. The Memphis mill more than doubles our capacity to serve the SBQ markets, while also expanding our product range into the highly attractive 3-inch and 10-inch Larger Diameter segment.  Memphis continues to gain product qualifications and production volumes for OEMs in the construction equipment, automotive, heavy truck, farm equipment and energy markets.  In December, our Memphis team set a record for shipments of rolled finished goods.  With the addition of our low-cost rolling mill in Arizona, Nucor can now serve all regions of the country with our wire rod products. Our Nucor Steel Kingman team also set our shipment record in December and recently expanded from a single shift to double shift operations.
Reflecting our culture's drive for continual improvement and profitable growth, there is more to come. For example, Nucor Steel Nebraska will be adding a downstream processing line that provides new growth opportunities and even higher-quality SBQ products than they currently offer. Additionally, our bar mills in Texas, Utah and South Carolina, along with our Nucor-Yamato beam mill, have established NQA-1 quality systems that will allow them to supply steel to nuclear power plant construction projects.
Nucor's Sheet Mill group is also continuing to move up the value chain, with margin-enhanced products that grow long-term earnings power. Building on Nucor Steel Berkeley's success with value-added vacuum degassed steel, we will be installing a second sheet mill vacuum degasser at our Hickman, Arkansas facility. As the westernmost flat rolled facility in the United States, with a vacuum degasser, Nucor Steel Arkansas will be strategically positioned to take advantage of the growing markets to the West, Southwest and in Mexico. Already, over 20% of all the degassed deals currently sold in the U.S. are purchased by OEMs located in states adjacent to Arkansas.  In addition to the opportunities to expand our current market share with existing customers in automotive, HVAC, and oil country tubular goods, the Hickman degasser will enable us to develop new customers and target markets such as motor laminations, garage doors and lawn and garden.  We expect commissioning took our in the fourth quarter of 2012.
I will close my report with our thoughts on current market conditions. The market environment for our Fabricated Construction Products business continues to be extremely challenged, and it has been for some time. We have been working throughout 2010 to raise prices in each of the industries in which we participate, with varying degrees of success. In addition to seeing some measured success in achieving price increases, we have seen our market share increase strongly in several of our downstream businesses. In our Vulcraft/Verco group, we achieved significant market share increases in both joist and deck in 2010. 
In our Metal Buildings group, we obtained an even greater market share increase. We also signed up a large number of new builders. Builders are the distribution chain in that industry. In Rebar Fabrication, we purchased several small fabricators in the Southeast and another one in Texas.
We want to thank all of our teammates in those businesses for their excellent work in making the best of a very difficult environment. Despite the challenging times, they are unrelenting in demonstrating the Nucor can-do spirit by working safely, working hard and staying focused on continuous improvement.
On the Steelmaking side, we are encouraged by recent signs of some improvement in wheel demand. However, it is difficult to determine how much of the overall increase and apparent demand is driven by steel buyers reacting to increasing raw material and steel prices.  Fortunately, service center inventories through December remain at relatively low levels. It is our belief that wheel demand will continue to grow gradually throughout 2011.
The December AIA Architecture Billings Index suggests non-residential construction activity may start growing again in late 2011.  We view 2011  with cautious optimism, an optimism anchored by our ongoing view that the U.S. economy is likely to experience a gradual recovery due to structural imbalances that must be addressed by our elected officials. In addition, we are keeping more than a watchful eye on imports that continue to have too great a share of the U.S. market at a time when our low-cost domestic industry is still running at only 70% of capacity. We are focused on taking preemptive trade action as a more supportive administration and Congress has shown a willingness to do. But whatever direction the economy takes over the short term, our team is primed and ready to utilize Nucor's position of strength and our extremely flexible business model to continue to generate long-term earnings for our shareholders.
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

There's one loud and clear message coming from these reports from Jim and John. The Nucor team is building long-term value for our shareholders. And we have had a successful record that extends over nearly five decades of doing just that.",541,"Thank you, John. There's one loud and clear message coming from these reports from Jim and John. The Nucor team is building long-term value for our shareholders. And we have had a successful record that extends over nearly five decades of doing just that. It's worthwhile to look at the long-term value we have generated over the last cycle. From the cyclical trough in our stock price reached in September of 2000 when the new executive team started to 2010's closing price, our long-term shareholders enjoyed a more than 7.3x increase in the value of their investment, including dividends, 7.3x. Speaking of dividends, in December, our board increased our regular quarterly cash dividend for the 38th consecutive year. And over the period from 2000 to 2010, Nucor's base dividend has increased approximately tenfold. These returns to our shareholders to growth in our stock price and paying cash dividends have not just happened by accident or by riding a cyclical upturn. They were achieved by building sustainable business that has generated the highest returns on capital in the North American steel industry over that 2000 to 2010 time span, and they reflect our team's unrelenting focus of being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital.  And our long-term focus and approach to managing our business has been constant through this most recent severe recession. Nucor's continued to make substantial investments that position us for our new higher highs and cyclical earnings power once a sustainable economic recovery arrives.
That's exactly what we mean when we say growing strong returning downturns. From 2007  through our expected 2011 capital spending plans, we have invested more than $6 billion of capital, including both capital expenditures and acquisitions. That is a lot of capital that Nucor shareholders will get paid for to attract the returns as they move into the next upcycle. Our team is very optimistic about Nucor's prospects for rewarding our shareholders with attractive long-term returns, just like we've been doing. Why? Because as a team, we're driven to settle for nothing less. 
Finally, I will close with some very exciting news received just today. We have received the final permit for the two 2.5 million tons DRI plants in Louisiana. These facilities will produce high-quality DRI to use at our SBQ plates and sheet mills. Initially, we will build one DRI plant. We plan to expand it to two separate facilities shortly thereafter. These plants will enable us to continue to allow for greater self sufficiency, controlling more of our own raw materials, along with assuring us of high-quality raw material feed. We anticipate starting construction immediately, and we have placed orders for the major equipment items already with our suppliers.  We have an anticipated startup of mid-2013. The Nucor team' is excited to be part of the St. James Parish community in Louisiana and bringing in the type of high-paying jobs that would help make us an integral part in this community. We appreciate all of the help and support that Governor Bobby Jindall and all the others state and local agencies have given to us to help this process come to fruition.  Once again, thank you for your interest in Nucor and we would now be happy to take your questions."

And it'll just take over a several-month period, it will take that period of time for all the higher price scrap purchases to work through into our actual usage numbers. And in addition, we work very hard to get pricing in our steel products up to keep as close a space as we could to the scrap movement so our raw material price increases will coincide with the finished steel price increases, substantial ones on both parts. And both of those moves should allow our margins to expand from where they have been reported in the fourth quarter. Exact timing of those things, it's not feasible to pinpoint those for you. But as we've stated, you will see that occur throughout the first quarter, and maybe a month, maybe two, lag between the peak in pricing achieved on steel products; probably closer to a month versus the peak in raw material pricing. And as we get into the second quarter, they should in launched and we're foreseeing a fairly stable pricing environment for both raw materials and steel prices as we move through the second quarter."

All of the inventory that we were receiving in December in new scrap deliveries didn't get into the scrap that we used yet, it'll be part of our January cost structure. So there's a little bit of a lag effect between when prices rise in the marketplace and when they hit us in our usage numbers. But we try and get the pricing matched in a way that we're neutral.

You know what's going on in the residential housing, which impacts the non-residential. You know how bad things are in there. We watched the housing starts and what-have-you. There's a million things that we look at, but at the end of the day, you know how well the economy is doing. And if we don't see economic growth north of 3%, then things are going to grow slowly for steel consumption, whether it's in manufactured goods or it's in Construction Products, construction-related products. The best gauge that we can give you is listen to what we're telling you because we've been very conservative and pretty spot on as to what is really going on from time to time to time. And we're saying to you today that, ""Listen, things are getting better, but they're getting better slowly."" And if anybody's providing contrary information to that, then I don't think they're giving you accurate information. And the main things we look at are the things you mentioned. And we can't predict what's going to go on with scrap; our track record there is poor, even though we have a major scrap processing and brokerage company within the company. Scrap is not the same environment today as that 20 years ago. Scrap moved $10, $15, $20 a year, that was a big move. That's not the case for the last seven years. Because of global demand, it's become much more volatile. So if we're predicting when that is going to happen, it's still difficult to do despite our best efforts because we don't control really what goes on in these markets, in the global world. It's much more complicated than that. But at the end of the day, if you don't see GDP growing over 3%, it's going to be slow growth for the steel industry."

With a loss of $0.04 per diluted share, the fourth quarter proved to be the most challenging quarter of 2010, as we predicted.

With a loss of $0.04 per diluted share, the fourth quarter proved to be the most challenging quarter of 2010, as we predicted. Of particular note, metal margins at our steel mills declined by $27 per ton from third quarter levels. A sharp escalation in scrap prices late this fall outpaced our ability to realize mill price increases in time to benefit the fourth quarter. The margin compression was greatest at our flat rolled mills. 
In our mid-December guidance, we reported our expectation that the 2010 four-year LIFO charge would be lower than the amount estimated at the end of the third quarter. The fourth quarter LIFO charge of $23 million was down from our average quarterly expense of $47 million at the end of the third quarter, but in line with our guidance estimate. This decline reflected lower year-end units of inventory compared to third quarter. 
Our full-year 2010 LIFO charge was $164 million compared with the 2009 LIFO credit of $467 million. Nucor incurred a $10 million charge in the fourth quarter related to the termination of the HIsmelt joint venture in Australia. This charge was not incorporated in the quantitative guidance we gave in mid-December. While the HIsmelt technology still has promise, the partners had decided that additional capital expenditures would not be a good investment in the current economic environment. For Nucor, we believe our best iron-making investment opportunities today are in growing our direct reduced iron or DRI production abilities. We will continue to build on both the knowledge gained from our highly successful DRI plant in Trinidad and on our long term supplies of attractively priced natural gas. 
Fourth quarter results also included $39 million of pre-operating and startup costs. On a quarterly basis, there has been some improvement from the peak level of more than $50 million in 2010's first quarter. For the full year 2010, these expenses totaled $175 million. Nucor typically incurs significant pre-operating and startup expenses during economic downturns. We view these costs as investments to grow our long-term earnings power. We look for these new businesses to be significant profit generators in the years ahead. That has been our company's experience over many previous cycles. 
For example, Nucor's most recent cyclical peak earnings of almost $6 per share in 2008 carried sizable benefits in contributions from the startup projects undertaken during the 2001 to 2003 downturn. It goes back to Dan's point that our team expects to continue Nucor's long history of emerging from downturns stronger than we entered them. Successful execution of this strategy is how we build long-term value for our shareholders. It is our financial strength that allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. At the close of 2010, cash and short-term investments totaled almost $2.5 billion. Not included in that total is an additional $600 million of restricted cash. This restricted cash resulted from our issuance of Gulf Opportunity, or GO Zone Bonds, in November. These tax-exempt bonds were authorized by the State of Louisiana and will finance a significant portion of the $750 million DRI plant we're building in St. James Parish, Louisiana. 
Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until November 2012. We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at year-end 2010. That is an increase of $1.2 billion from the beginning of the year. Nucor's conservative financial practices and strong balance sheet allowed us to be opportunistic in taking advantage of favorable credit market conditions last year to reduce our overall cost of capital. In addition to November's tax-exempt bond financing, we issued $600 million of 12-year unsecured notes with a coupon rate of 4.125%. That transaction was an excellent opportunity to prepare for upcoming long-term debt maturities of $650 million in 2012 and $250 million in 2013.  Allowing for these dynamics, Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash balances over $1.2 billion. At year-end 2010, that net debt-to-capital ratio was approximately 29%. That calculation excludes restricted cash. 
Our operating cash flow performance in 2010 highlights another key strength of our business model. Cash provided by operating activities were nearly $900 million in 2010. That more than covered capital spending of $345 million and cash dividends paid of $457 million for the year. In 2011, we will continue to allocate capital to investments that build our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $560 million. Included in that total are about $120 million of spending for our Louisiana DRI plant and about $60 million for our natural gas working interest drilling program. 
As we enter the first quarter, the trend of improving market conditions that began in the fourth quarter has continued. Steel mill utilization rates have increased. In fact, fourth quarter shipments increased 32% over third quarter levels. We have been able to significantly raise mill selling prices in response to rising raw material costs and some improvement in end-use demand. Downstream fabricated Construction Products markets remain very challenging. Overall, we expect a return to profitability in the first quarter, and we believe the positive trend in earnings will continue into the second quarter. We'll again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. 
In the long-term, we are very optimistic about Nucor's prospects to continue building attractive and sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. Our team is working hard and very effectively to capitalize on our company's position of strength. Thank you for your interest in Nucor.

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel products teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and taking care of Nucor's customers. We are extremely proud of the work that you are doing in the tough economic times that have been with us for more than two years. Thank you, and please keep it going.
My report can be summarized in this one sentence: For Nucor, downturns create opportunities; opportunities for profitable growth. Here are some examples of how we are coming out of the economic downturn stronger than we entered it. Nucor's plate and structural mills are doing an excellent job of growing our market during the current downturn. Highlighting the gains, these mills have shipped a total of 240,000 tons of products that were not even offered in our mix two years ago. Even better, their work continues. Our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mills' new heat treat line was commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2010, and it is quickly ramping up to its full capacity of 125,000 tons per year. The product coming off of this line is everything we hoped it would be: Great shape, great surface and right on spec. This investment allows Hertford County to grow into higher margin products where higher strength, abrasion resistance and greater toughness are required. 
Our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill team has continued to improve our recently added temper line so that it's now capable of running one-inch thick plates. This will allow us to sell as much as 250,000 tons per year of higher margin, temper pass, cut-to-length plates blades rather than commodity hot rolled coil. Just as exciting, the Tuscaloosa team has used their ingenuity and virtually no capital to start producing discrete plate off the end of the hot mill. We expect to be able to produce as much as 125,000 tons per year of this higher valued, higher margin, discrete plate at Tuscaloosa due to these improvements.
Although these projects at Hertford County and Tuscaloosa will not increase our total plate capacity, they will have the combined effect of moving more than 500,000 annual tons of plate output from commodity grades to higher value grades that generate higher margins per ton. That, of course, means higher earnings power in the future from our plate mills.  And we will not stop there in expanding our portfolio of margin-enhanced plate products to better serve our customers and generate greater profits for our shareholders.
We recently approved a capital to install a vacuum degasser at Hertford County. Commissioning is expected in the first quarter of 2013. This will further broaden our product mix to include armor plate and certain alloyed plate grades. Our Bar Mill Group is also growing Nucor's long-term earnings power with a number of projects that have started up during the current downturn. These include our new SBQ mill in Memphis and our wire rod and coiled rebar rolling mill in Arizona. The Memphis mill more than doubles our capacity to serve the SBQ mill in Memphis and our wire rod and coil rebar rolling mill in Arizona. The Memphis mill more than doubles our capacity to serve the SBQ markets, while also expanding our product range into the highly attractive 3-inch and 10-inch Larger Diameter segment. Memphis continues to gain product qualifications and production volumes for OEMs in the construction equipment, automotive, heavy truck, farm equipment and energy markets.  In December, our Memphis team set a record for shipments of rolled finished goods. With the addition of our low-cost rolling mill in Arizona, Nucor can now serve all regions of the country with our wire rod products. Our Nucor Steel Kingman team also set our shipment record in December and recently expanded from a single shift to double shift operations.
Reflecting our culture's drive for continual improvement and profitable growth, there is more to come. For example, Nucor Steel Nebraska will be adding a downstream processing line that provides new growth opportunities and even higher-quality SBQ products than they currently offer. Additionally, our bar mills in Texas, Utah and South Carolina, along with our Nucor-Yamato beam mill, have established NQA-1 quality systems that will allow them to supply steel to nuclear power plant construction projects.
Nucor's Sheet Mill group is also continuing to move up the value chain, with margin-enhanced products that grow long-term earnings power. Building on Nucor Steel Berkeley's success with selling value-added vacuum degassed steel, we will be installing a second sheet mill vacuum degasser at our Hickman, Arkansas facility. As the westernmost flat rolled facility in the United States with a vacuum degasser, Nucor Steel Arkansas will be strategically positioned to take advantage of the growing markets to the West, Southwest and in Mexico. Already, over 20% of all degassed deals currently sold in the U.S. are purchased by OEMs located in states adjacent to Arkansas. In addition to the opportunities to expand our current market share with existing customers in automotive, HVAC, and oil country tubular goods, the Hickman degasser will enable us to develop new customers in target markets such as motor laminations, garage doors and lawn and garden.  We expect commissioning to occur in the fourth quarter of 2012.
I will close my report with our thoughts on current market conditions. The market environment for our Fabricated Construction Products business continues to be extremely challenged, and it has been for some time. We have been working throughout 2010 to raise prices in each of the industries in which we participate, with varying degrees of success. In addition to seeing some measured success in achieving price increases, we have seen our market share increase strongly in several of our downstream businesses. In our Vulcraft/Verco group, we achieved significant market share increases in both joist and deck in 2010. 
In our Metal Buildings group, we obtained an even greater market share increase. We also signed up a large number of new builders. Builders are the distribution chain in that industry. In Rebar Fabrication, we purchased several small fabricators in the Southeast and another one in Texas.
We want to thank all of our teammates in those businesses for their excellent work in making the best of a very difficult environment. Despite the challenging times, they are unrelenting in demonstrating the Nucor can-do spirit by working safely, working hard and staying focused on continuous improvement.
On the Steelmaking side, we are encouraged by recent signs of some improvement in wheel demand. However, it is difficult to determine how much of the overall increase and apparent demand is driven by steel buyers reacting to increasing raw material and steel prices.  Fortunately, service center inventories through December remain at relatively low levels. It is our belief that wheel demand will continue to grow gradually throughout 2011.
The December AIA Architecture Billings Index suggests non-residential construction activity may start growing again in late 2011.  We view 2011 with cautious optimism, an optimism anchored by our ongoing view that the U.S. economy is likely to experience a gradual recovery due to structural imbalances that must be addressed by our elected officials. In addition, we are keeping more than a watchful eye on imports that continue to have too great a share of the U.S. market at a time when our low-cost domestic industry is still running at only 70% of capacity. We are focused on taking preemptive trade action as a more supportive administration and Congress has shown a willingness to do. But whatever direction the economy takes over the short term, our team is primed and ready to utilize Nucor's position of strength and our extremely flexible business model to continue to generate long-term earnings for our shareholders.
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"
184945,117846791,96579,"Nucor Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. There's one loud and clear message coming from these reports from Jim and John. The Nucor team is building long-term value for our shareholders. And we have had a successful record that extends over nearly five decades of doing just that.",541,"Thank you, John. There's one loud and clear message coming from these reports from Jim and John. The Nucor team is building long-term value for our shareholders. And we have had a successful record that extends over nearly five decades of doing just that. It's worthwhile to look at the long-term value we have generated over the last cycle. From the cyclical trough in our stock price reached in September of 2000 when the new executive team started to 2010's closing price, our long-term shareholders enjoyed a more than 7.3x increase in the value of their investment, including dividends, 7.3x. Speaking of dividends, in December, our board increased our regular quarterly cash dividend for the 38th consecutive year. And over the period from 2000 to 2010, Nucor's base dividend has increased approximately tenfold. These returns to our shareholders to growth in our stock price and paying cash dividends have not just happened by accident or by riding a cyclical upturn. They were achieved by building sustainable business that has generated the highest returns on capital in the North American steel industry over that 2000 to 2010 time span, and they reflect our team's unrelenting focus of being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital. And our long-term focus and approach to managing our business has been constant through this most recent severe recession. Nucor's continued to make substantial investments that position us for our new higher highs and cyclical earnings power once a sustainable economic recovery arrives.
That is exactly what we mean when we say, growing stronger during downturns. From 2007 through our expected 2011 capital spending plans, we have invested more than $6 billion of capital, including both capital expenditures and acquisitions. That is a lot of capital that Nucor shareholders will get paid for to attract the returns as we move into the next upcycle. Our team is very optimistic about Nucor's prospects for rewarding our shareholders with attractive long-term returns, just like we've been doing. Why? Because as a team, we're driven to settle for nothing less. 
Finally, I will close with some very exciting news received just today. We have received the final permit for the two 2.5 million tons DRI plants in Louisiana. These facilities will produce high-quality DRI to use at our SBQ plate and sheet mills. Initially, we will build one DRI plant with plans to expand to the second facility shortly thereafter. These plants will enable us to continue to allow for greater self sufficiency, controlling more of our own raw materials, along with assuring us of high-quality raw material feed. We anticipate starting construction immediately, and we have placed orders for the major equipment items already with our suppliers. We have an anticipated startup of mid-2013. The Nucor team is excited to be part of the St. James Parish community in Louisiana and bringing in the type of high-paying jobs that will help make us an integral part in this community.

So when you say we only saw 1% increase in usage, we had already seen significant increases in the price that we were paying. And it'll just take over a several-month period, it will take that period of time for all the higher price scrap purchases to work through into our actual usage numbers. And in addition, we worked very hard to get pricing in our steel products up to keep as close a pace as we could to the scrap movement so our raw material price increases will coincide with the finished steel price increases, substantial ones on both parts. And both of those moves should allow our margins to expand from where they have been reported in the fourth quarter. Exact timing of those things, it's not feasible to pinpoint those for you. But as we've stated, you will see that occur throughout the first quarter, and maybe a month, maybe two, lag between the peak in pricing achieved on steel products; probably closer to a month versus the peak in raw material pricing. And as we get into the second quarter, they should be in lockstep, and we're foreseeing a fairly stable pricing environment for both raw materials and steel prices as we move through the second quarter."

It's not just the price of scrap, as the price of what's gone through the entire system and where it sits. So it is not a simple thing to be able to say, LIFO deduced scrap is that, the LIFO in this or the LIFO impact cover what's going on in scrap. At the end of the day, what you and the analysts and investment community should be focusing on is that scrap prices have gone up, steel prices have gone up very strongly, and what we're saying to you about first quarter and second quarter of the year is that we will be getting to the point there in the quarter that the steel pricing is covering the scrap cost, even the increases that you haven't ""seen"" our usage numbers yet, those will be going up in lock step and we see expanding margins as we go through the first quarter into the second quarter. And that's why we are forecasting a profitable first quarter and continued strength in profits moving into the second quarter. So it's not like -- I heard you say, and I think that some other people may have said it earlier, and I didn't comment on it, there's going to be this huge, giant disparity between steel pricing and scrap pricing in the first quarter that's going hit us. There is going to be increased usage cost, but there'll also be increased selling prices."

I think sometimes people try and find out the magic formula for predicting what's going on. Where's the GDP growth rate in the economy? If it's not above 3%, steel demand is not growing. You know what's going on in the residential housing, which impacts the non-residential. You know how bad things are in there. We watched the housing starts and what-have-you. There's a million things that we look at, but at the end of the day, you know how well the economy is doing. And if we don't see economic growth north of 3%, then things are going to grow slowly for steel consumption, whether it's in manufactured goods or it's in Construction Products, construction-related products. The best gauge that we can give you is, listen to what we're telling you because we've been very conservative and pretty spot on as to what is really going on from time to time to time. And we're saying to you today that, ""Listen, things are getting better, but they're getting better slowly."" And if anybody's providing contrary information to that, then I don't think they're giving you accurate information. And the main things we look at are the things you mentioned. And we can't predict what's going to go on with scrap; our track record there is poor, even though we have a major scrap processing and brokerage company within the company. Scrap is not the same environment today as that 20 years ago. Scrap moved $10, $15, $20 a year, that was a big move. That's not the case for the last seven years. Because of global demand, it's become much more volatile. So if we're predicting when that is going to happen, it's still difficult to do despite our best efforts because we don't control, really, what goes on in these markets, in the global world. It's much more complicated than that. But at the end of the day, if you don't see GDP growing over 3%, it's going to be slow growth for the steel industry."

First and most importantly, the senior management team want to thank everyone at our team at Nucor and our Harris Steel and David J. Joseph operations for working safely and working together in an economic environment that, while improving, remains extremely challenging. And it remains our belief that the economic recovery is likely to continue on an uneven path. But here's the really important point to understand and remember in analyzing Nucor. Our company's emerging from the Great Recession stronger than we have entered into it. And we have taken advantage of opportunities provided by the most recent economic downturn to grow our earnings power going forward. This growth in sustainable earnings is a direct result of the talent and dedication, the can-do attitude of the Nucor team and what it brings to work each and every day. While we are encouraged by our first quarter performance and the second quarter outlook, the real returns still are ahead of us. On a robust, sustainable economic recovery inevitably returns, our teams efforts will pay a big dividends to all members of the Nucor family, particularly to people who owned Nucor, our shareholders. As you probably have heard us discuss, our goal is to generate ROIs of each successive peak in the economic and steel markets cycles and higher lows. Again, thank you to all the 20,500 men and women of the Nucor team, and most importantly, continue to work safely.

184945,129455873,116473,"Nucor Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","thanks, Dan, and good afternoon.

First quarter 2011 earnings of $0.50 per diluted share were a substantial improvement over both the fourth quarter 2010 loss of $0.04 per share and the year ago first quarter earnings of $0.10 per share. Our results benefited from volume gains and expanding metal margins at our steel mills, as well as a solid contribution from our David J. Joseph Co.'s, raw materials businesses. On the negative side, our downstream fabricated construction projects continued to face very challenging markets in the first quarter. The first quarter metal margin expansion at our steel mills demonstrated again the long-established historical experience of arising scrap prices leading after a short lag to higher metal margins. The metal margins for the month of March 2011 was at the highest level it came since 2008. The steel mill shipments were 5.2 million tons, an increase of 14% from the fourth quarter. All product groups realized volume growth, but the strongest gains occurring at our sheet and beam mills. Sheet mill shipments increased 23% and beam shipments increased 21% over the fourth quarter. Nucor's first quarter steel mill utilization rate reached 79.6%, that was a significant improvement from our fourth quarter rate of 68.2%. It also compared favorably to the U.S. steel industry's first quarter utilization rate of 73.6%.
With Nucor's highly flexible production capability and unrivaled product diversity, our teams were well-positioned to capitalize an improved demand in the first quarter. In the first quarter, Nucor recorded a LIFO inventory charge of $31 million. That was an increase from LIFO charges of $23 million in the fourth quarter and $24 million in the year ago first quarter. The first quarter effective tax rate measured as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 32%. However, after moving profits for noncontrolling interests, the effective tax rate increases to 34.8%. First quarter results included $28 million of pre-operating and startup of costs. Those costs declined for more than $50 million in the prior-year first quarter and $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. We are pleased to report that our methods SBQ mill and our Kingman, Arizona wire rod rebar mill achieved profitability in the first quarter.
Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. We view pre-operating and start up costs as investments to grow our long-term earnings power. That has been our company's strategy over many previous cycles.
For example, Nucor's most recent cyclical peak earnings of almost $6 per share in 2008 carried sizable contributions from the startup projects undertaken during the 2001 to 2003 downturn. We are now looking forward to growing profit contributions from our investments made just prior to and during the current downturn.
At the close of the first quarter, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion. In addition to that total, there is $577 million of restricted cash held on our balance sheet. We received this restricted cash from tax-exempt bonds issued last year to finance the significant portion of its $750 million DOI plant we are building in Louisiana. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until November 2012.
We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash balances over $1.2 billion. Using that methodology, our net debt-to-capital ratio is 30%. That calculation excludes the restricted cash. Nucor's strong balance sheet and business model will recognize in the report Standard & Poor's issued on April 15th. The report, entitled U.S. and Canadian Metals and Mining Companies, Strongest to weakest, ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among the universe of 61 companies. It is worth noting that Nucor was the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to its assessment of our competitive position and financial performance relative to our peers.
In 2011, we will continue to allocate capital to investments that build our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $500 million. Included in that total are about $70 million of spending for our Louisiana DOI plant and about $60 million for our natural gas working interest drilling program. Examples of other growth projects underway are: A new quality assurance at our Nebraska SBQ mill, at both our Arkansas sheet mill and our North Carolina plate mill, melt shop transfer operates in related electoral system upgrades at our Utah Bar Mill and non-ferrous nonferrous projects at David J. Joseph's recycling operations.
Our outlook for the second quarter is positive. We ended the quarter with strong momentum, as utilization rates, metal margins and profitability improved from the beginning to the end of the first quarter. Although there have been signs of weakness in some market segments, our belief remains that end market usage continues to experience gradual improvement and real demand. Markets for downstream fabricated construction products remain very challenging.
Overall, we expect second quarter results to be an improvement over the first quarter. However, we do caution against overly optimistic expectations for the second quarter. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the final month of the quarter. We remain very optimistic about Nucor's long-term prospects for continuing our improving earnings trend. Our business model is built around adaptability, allowing our company to leverage its position of strength throughout the economic and steel markets cycles. The Nucor team is working hard and working very effectively to build attractive and sustainable value for our shareholders. We are driven and settle for nothing less.
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel product teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and taking care of Nucor's customers. We are extremely proud of the work that you are doing to take advantage of opportunities for profitable and sustainable growth for Nucor. Thank you. And please keep it going.
Turning to first quarter. Our teammates made substantial progress in continuing to grow Nucor's earning power. Here are some current examples of where our teams are building for a stronger Nucor in today's slow growth and uncertain economy.
Our Hartford, county North Carolina plate mills new heat treat line completed trials and began accepting orders in February. It's going extremely well with both volume and development exceeding our plan. In fact, our Hertford County team is running the heat treat facility at full capacity, in production volume that we did not expect to achieve until the fourth quarter of this year. Most importantly, customer feedback on quality and the performance of our heat-treated plate has been excellent and true to Nucor's focus on continual improvement, the team at Hertford County is continuing to develop new, higher value grades. Great job team Hertford County, thank you.
This investment improves Nucor's profitability as it allows Hertford County to grow into higher margin products where higher strength, abrasion resistance and greater toughness are required. And it also allows us to shift and improve the product mix allocation between our 2 plate Mills and 4 sheet mills to improve margins at those facilities. For example, in the first quarter, our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill began producing as rolled discrete carbon plate products. In volume out of Decatur, Alabama and in Arkansas sheet mills benefited from Tuscaloosa shifting some of its hot rolled coil production to them. The bottom line, our expanding Ohio margin plate product portfolio while at the same time optimizing capacity utilization at our plate and sheet mills results in higher earnings power from both our plate and our sheet mill groups. And further expansion plans are in the works for the Hertford County heat-treat operations.
I also have good news to share from another major product, a project that started out during the current downturn. Our special bar quality, or SBQ mill in Memphis. Our Memphis team is rapidly completing the qualification process with many of our customers, and as a result, continues building volume. In March, they set another record of shipments of rolled finished goods. Even better, they delivered their first quarter of profits since starting. Our Memphis team has turned major corner and their future is very bright.
The Memphis mill more than doubles our capacity to serve the SBQ markets, while also expanding our product range into the highly attractive 3 inch to 10-inch large diameter segment. Nucor will now be able to supply the SBQ products from 730 seconds of an inch to 10 inches in diameter, which allows us to offer our customers the most diverse SBQ product range in North America. Memphis is currently producing engineered steel bars for applications such as chem shops, spindles using the heavy truck and automotive markets.
Another attractive markets currently being serve include energy, heavy equipment and agriculture. Reflecting the Nucor culture drive for continual improvement and profitable growth, there is more to come in our SBQ business. Nucor Steel Nebraska is on schedule for the third quarter 2011 start up of a new downstream processing line that provides attractive growth opportunities in even higher-quality SBQ products than they currently offer. Additionally, our South Carolina is enjoying success with their implementation of fully submerged and shrouded casting practices. The resulting improvements in product quality are allowing our Darlington team to grow their margins as they expand their presence in higher-quality SBQ applications. I will close my report with our thoughts on current market conditions.
The market environment for our fabricated construction products businesses continues to be extremely challenged. And we expect it to remain so over the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, there is still good news to report. Our teammates in those businesses are doing an excellent job of working safely, gaining market share in many product lines and staying focused on continuous improvement.
On the steelmaking side, the recovery continues to be slow and uneven between the industrial and energy sectors and the residential and nonresidential construction sectors. Steel buyers have shown more caution as market price has escalated during the first quarter. At the same time, supply in the sheet market has increased with recent blast furnace restarts in addition to greater import offerings.
On the other hand, service center inventories through March remained at relatively low levels. And we continued to see evidence of improvement in real demand in several markets important to Nucor. These include energy, heavy equipment, agriculture, truck trailers and bridgebuilding markets. While nonresidential construction activity remains weak, the bottom in that important market appears to be behind us.
Whatever direction the economy takes in coming months and quarters, the Nucor team will outperform in taking care of all of our customers, that includes our shareholders, our teammates and the people who buy and use our products. And here are some of the reasons we will outperform.
Nucor's low and highly flexible production costs, our great customer service, Nucor's diversified product portfolio. And most importantly, our people, driven by the can-do attitude and their high energy level.
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

I would say that starting with the positive as we look at most of our product lines, plate, SBQ, we expect to remain strong through that period. We expect merchant product to be consistent, structural product to be consistent during that period. So the one market that we'd going to keep a close eye on would be our sheet businesses. And typically, as you come out of the second quarter and enter into the third quarter, you do see a seasonal slowdown that you usually generated as a result of the automotive shutdowns for retooling. Now this year, it's going to be much more difficult to predict the impact of that, that we feel the impact will be mitigated because of what's happening today, as Dan mentioned, with the supply of nonsteel critical components into the automotive market from Japan. As a result, both the domestic and the new domestic's production rates currently are down as they are waiting for those key raw materials. And when you look at, as we look at the fewer inventory days on hand, we see that they are dropping low, they're going down and they're continuing to go down. When you look on the domestic side, the domestic production side, you're looking at about 54 days on hand which is low number the new domestic number is even lower than that. So we see some pent-up demand in the automotive sector which will release as these non-steel components become more available. And we believe that, that will mitigate the impact of the traditional seasonal slowdown that we see at the end of the second quarter and going into the third quarter."

So there are things that will cause our customers to think about importing too much flat rolled or what have you going forward. And so we think that between in keeping our eye on things and half the mindset of our customer base, you should be able to see the results throughout the second quarter."

It was a very strong month, particularly in our efforts to the first 2 months of the quarter. So it was better for us to, under those circumstances, with so many things floating out there in terms of where pricing would end up and how strong shipments will be in the month of March, the stronger the shipments, the further you can go into getting the higher price increases and all of that turned out to be very favorable on all the products, not just flat roll, but in every product line."

First and most importantly, the senior management team wants to thank everyone at our team at Nucor and our Harris Steel and David J. Joseph operations for working safely and working together in an economic environment that, while improving, remains extremely challenging. And it remains our belief that the economic recovery is likely to continue on an uneven path. 
But here's the really important point to understand and remember in analyzing Nucor. Our company is emerging from the Great Recession stronger than we entered into it. We have taken advantage of opportunities provided by the most recent economic downturn to grow our earnings power going forward. This growth in sustainable earnings is a direct result of the talent and dedications, the can-do attitude of the Nucor team and what it brings to work each and every day. 
While we are encouraged by our first quarter performance and the second quarter outlook, the real returns still are ahead of us. On a robust, sustainable economic recovery inevitably returns, our teams' efforts will pay big dividends to all members of the Nucor family, particularly to people who own Nucor, our shareholders. As you have probably heard us discuss, our goal is to generate higher highs of each successive peak in the economic and steel market cycles and higher lows. Again, thank you to all the 20,500 men and women of the Nucor team, and most importantly, continue to work safely.
I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, to discuss our first quarter results and financial position. Following Jim's comments, President and COO, John Ferriola, will report on our operations and computation of our growth initiatives. And then I'll wrap up our remarks before we take your questions.

184945,129455873,116686,"Nucor Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. First quarter 2011 earnings of $0.50 per diluted share were substantial improvement over both the fourth quarter 2010 loss of $0.04 per share and the year ago first quarter earnings of $0.10 per share. Our results benefite",980,"thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. First quarter 2011 earnings of $0.50 per diluted share were substantial improvement over both the fourth quarter 2010 loss of $0.04 per share and the year ago first quarter earnings of $0.10 per share. Our results benefited from volume gains and expanding metal margins at our steel mills as well as a solid contribution from our David J. Joseph Co.'s Raw Materials businesses. 
On the negative side, our downstream fabricated construction products continue to face very challenging markets in the first quarter. The first quarter metal margin expansion at our steel mills demonstrated again the long established historical experience of arising scrap prices leading after a short lag to higher metal margins. Metal margins for the month of March 2011 was at the highest level it came since 2008. Steel mill shipments were 5.2 million tons, an increase of 14% from the fourth quarter. All product groups realized volume growth, but the strongest gains occurring at our sheet and beam mills. Sheet mill shipments increased 23%, and beam shipments increased 21% over the fourth quarter. Nucor's first quarter steel mill utilization rate reached 79.6%. That was a significant improvement from our fourth quarter rate of 68.2%. It also compared favorably to the U.S. steel industry's first quarter utilization rate of 73.6%.
With Nucor's highly flexible production capability and unrivaled product diversity, our teams were well positioned to capitalize an improved demand in the first quarter. In the first quarter, Nucor recorded a LIFO inventory charge of $31 million. That was an increase from LIFO charges of $23 million in the fourth quarter and $24 million in the year ago first quarter. The first quarter effective tax rate measured as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 32%. However, after moving profits for noncontrolling interests, the effective tax rate increases to 34.8%. First quarter results included $28 million of pre-operating and startup of costs. Those costs declined for more than $50 million in the prior year first quarter and $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. We are pleased to report that our Memphis SBQ mill and our Kingman, Arizona wire rod called rebar mill achieved profitability in the first quarter.
Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. We view pre-operating and startup costs as investments to grow our long-term earnings power. That has been our company's strategy over many previous cycles. For example, Nucor's most recent cyclical peak earnings of almost $6 per share in 2008 carried sizable contributions from the startup projects undertaken during the 2001 to 2003 downturn. We are now looking forward to growing profit contributions from our investments made just prior to and during the current downturn.
At the close of the first quarter, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion. In addition to that total, there is $577 million of restricted cash held on our balance sheet. We received this restricted cash from tax-exempt bonds issued last year to finance the significant portion of its $750 million DRI plant we are building in Louisiana. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until November 2012.
We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash balances over $1.2 billion. Using that methodology, our net debt-to-capital ratio is 30%. That calculation excludes the restricted cash. 
Nucor's strong balance sheet and business model will recognize in the report Standard & Poor's issued on April 15. The report, entitled U.S. and Canadian Metals and Mining Companies, Strongness to Weakness, ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among the universe of 61 companies. It is worth noting that Nucor was the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to its assessment of our competitive position and financial performance relative to our peers.
In 2011, we will continue to allocate capital to investments that build our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $500 million. Included in that total are about $70 million of spending for our Louisiana DRI plant and about $60 million for our natural gas working interest drilling program. Examples of other growth projects underway are: a new quality assurance line at our Nebraska SBQ mill that can be gassers at both our Arkansas sheet mill and our North Carolina plate mill, melt shop transform upgrades and related electoral system upgrades at our Utah Bar Mill and non-ferrous rotation projects at David J. Joseph's recycling operations.
Our outlook for the second quarter is positive. We ended the quarter with strong momentum, as utilization rates, metal margins and profitability improve from the beginning to the end of the first quarter. Although there have been signs of weakness in some market segments, our belief remains that end market usage continues to experience gradual improvement and real demand. Markets for downstream fabricated construction products remain very challenging.
Overall, we expect second quarter results to be an improvement over the first quarter. However, we do caution against overly optimistic expectations for the second quarter. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle and final month of the quarter. We remain very optimistic about Nucor's long-term prospects for continuing our improving earnings trend. Our business model is built around adaptability, allowing our company to leverage its position of strength throughout the economic and steel market cycles. The Nucor team is working hard and working very effectively to build attractive and sustainable value for our shareholders. We are driven and settled for nothing less.
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel product teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and taking care of Nucor's customers. We are extremely proud of the work that you were doing to take advantage of opportunities for profitable and sustainable growth for Nucor. Thank you, and please keep it going.
Turning to first quarter. Our teammates made substantial progress in continuing to grow Nucor's earning power. Here are some current examples of where our teams are building for a stronger Nucor in today's slow growth and uncertain economy.
Our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mills new heat treat line completed trials and began accepting orders in February. It's going extremely well with both volume and rate development exceeding our plan. In fact, our Hertford County team is running the heat treat facility at full capacity, a production volume that we did not expect to achieve until the fourth quarter of this year. Most importantly, customer feedback on the quality and the performance of our heat-treated plate has been excellent and true to Nucor's focus on continual improvement. The team at Hertford County is continuing to develop new, higher value grades. Great job team Hertford County. Thank you.
This investment improves Nucor's profitability as it allows Hertford County to grow into higher margin products where higher strength, abrasion resistance and greater toughness are required. And it also allows us to shift and improve the product mix allocation between our 2 plate mills and 4 sheet mills to improve margins at those facilities. For example, in the first quarter, our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill began producing as rolled discrete carbon plate products. And volume out of Decatur, Alabama and Arkansas sheet mills benefited from Tuscaloosa shifting, some of its hot rolled coil production to them. The bottom line, our expanding Ohio margin plate product portfolio, while at the same time optimizing capacity utilization at our plate and sheet mills, results in higher earnings power from both our plate and our sheet mill groups. And further expansion plans are in the works for the Hertford County heat treat operations.
I also have good news to share from another major product -- project that started up during the current downturn, our special bar quality or SBQ mill in Memphis. Our Memphis team is rapidly completing the qualification process with many of our customers, and as a result, continues building volume. In March, they set another record for shipments of rolled finished goods. Even better, they delivered their first quarter of profits since start. Our Memphis team has turned a major corner and their future is very bright.
The Memphis mill more than doubles our capacity to serve the SBQ markets while also expanding our product range into the highly attractive 3-inch to 10-inch large diameter segment. Nucor will now be able to supply SBQ products from 730 seconds of an inch to 10 inches in diameter, which allows us to offer our customers the most diverse SBQ product range in North America. Memphis is currently producing engineered steel bars for applications, such as camshafts, crankshafts, spindles and rain gears using the heavy truck and automotive markets.
Another attractive markets currently being served include energy, heavy equipment and agriculture. Reflecting the Nucor culture's drive for continual improvement and profitable growth, there is more to come in our SBQ business. Nucor Steel Nebraska is on schedule for the third quarter 2011 startup of a new downstream processing line that provides attractive growth opportunities in even higher quality SBQ products than they currently offer. Additionally, our Darlington, South Carolina bar mill is enjoying success with their implementation of fully submerged and shrouded casting practices. The resulting improvements in product quality are allowing our Darlington team to grow their margins as they expand their presence in higher quality SBQ applications. I will close my report with our thoughts on current market conditions.
The market environment for our Fabricated Construction Products businesses continues to be extremely challenged. And we expect it to remain so over the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, there is still good news to report. Our teammates in those businesses are doing an excellent job of working safely, gaining market share in many product lines and staying focused on continuous improvement.
On the steelmaking side, the recovery continues to be slow and uneven between the industrial and energy sectors and the residential and nonresidential construction sectors. Steel buyers have shown more caution as market pricing escalated during the first quarter. At the same time, supply in the sheet market has increased with recent blast furnace restarts in addition to greater import offerings.
On the other hand, service center inventories through March remained at relatively low levels. And we continue to see evidence of improvement in real demand in several markets important to Nucor. These include energy, heavy equipment, agriculture, truck trailers and bridgebuilding markets. While nonresidential construction activity remains weak, the bottom in that important market appears to be behind us.
Whatever direction the economy takes in coming months and quarters, the Nucor team will outperform in taking care of all of our customers. That includes our shareholders, our teammates and the people who buy and use our products. And here are some of the reasons we will outperform: Nucor's low and highly flexible production costs; our great customer service; Nucor's diversified product portfolio; and most importantly, our people driven by the can-do attitude and their high energy level.
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Our message here is very clear. Nucor is extremely well positioned to deliver higher highs, cyclical earnings power, more sustainable economic recovery arrives, having exactly what we are talking about when we say growing stronger during the downturns. 
And here are some of the investments made since the previous cyclical peak in 2008 that will help drive us to higher highs in earnings: an increase of more than 10% in our bar mill group's annual production capacity with the addition of the Memphis and Kingman mills; an increase of 33% in our sheet mill group's value-added coater steel annual capacity with the addition of the Decatur galvanizing facility; an increase of 30% in the David J. Joseph Co. scrap processing annual capacity in addition to the opportunity to realize earnings through our full up cycle on DJJ's original capacity of 3.5 million tons; an increase of more than 50% in Harris Steel's rebar fabrication annual capacity in addition to the opportunity to realize earnings through a full up cycle, the Harris Steel's original capacity of 1 million tons; the opportunity to realize earnings to a full up cycle in our Extended Metals Building businesses, which more than tripled in size at 465,000 tons of annual capacity with the magnet tracks acquisition and the Utah greenfield plant; our 50% interest in southern Europe's largest beam producer, the part of the Nucor and its recently expanded beam and bar annual capacity that now totals approximately 1.8 million tons; our 50% interest in NuMit and our Steel Technology Sheet Steel Processing businesses with 24 processing facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico and more on the way; our North Carolina plate mill's heat treat facility; and Canada's other product line expansions at our bar, beam, sheet and plate mills; and our Nucor Steel Louisiana directly reduced higher facility's first module currently under construction that will more than double our DRI annual production capacity to 4.5 million tons. The plans are more to come at our 4,000-acre site on the Mississippi River.
From 2007 to our expected 2011 capital spending plans, we have invested more than $6 billion of capital, including both capital expenditures and acquisitions. That is a lot of capital that Nucor shareholders will get paid for to attract the returns in the next up cycle. Our confidence has never been greater and Nucor's best is yet to come.

So the one market that we're going to keep a close eye on would be at that addressed sheet businesses. And typically, as you come out of the second quarter and enter into the third quarter, you do see a seasonal slowdown that you usually generated as a result of the automotive shutdowns for retooling. Now this year, it's going to be much more difficult to predict the impact of that, that we feel the impact will be mitigated because of what's happening today, as Dan mentioned, with the supply of nonsteel critical components into the automotive market from Japan. As a result, both the domestic and the new domestic's production rates currently are down as they are waiting for those key raw materials. And when you look at, as we look at the fewer inventory days on hand, we see that they are dropping low, they're going down and they're continuing to go down. When you look on the domestic side, the domestic production side, you're looking at about 54 days, deal these days on hand, which is a low number. With the new domestics, the number is even lower than that. So we see some pent-up demand in the automotive sector, which will release as these non-steel components become more available. And we believe that that will mitigate the impact of the traditional seasonal slowdown that we see at the end of the second quarter and going into the third quarter."

The problem in being more accurate, if we want to call it that, forecast was that that is a moving target, exactly where the pricing ended up dependent upon how strong the shipments were and how strongly our customers were taking those shipments, and in all honestly, March was a rollout month. It was a very strong month, particularly in our efforts to the first 2 months of the quarter. So it was better for us to, under those circumstances, with so many things floating out there in terms of where pricing would end up and how strong shipments would be in the month of March, the stronger the shipments, the further you go into getting the higher price increases, and all of that turned out to be very favorable on all the products, not just flat-roll, but in every product line."

Thank you for joining us for our conference call today. As always, we value your interest in Nucor. 
With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Ferriola; Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, over our Bar Products group; Keith Grass over our Scrap Raw Materials Group; Ladd Hall over our Flat-Rolled Group; Ham Lott over our Downstream Fabricated Products; and Joe Stratman over Business Development and our Plate and Beam Operations.
First and most importantly, the senior management team wants to thank everyone on our team at Nucor and our Harris Steel and David J. Joseph operations for working safely and working together in an economic environment that, while improving, remains extremely challenging. And it remains our belief that the economic recovery is likely to continue on an uneven path. 
But here's the really important point to understand and remember in analyzing Nucor. Our company is emerging from the Great Recession stronger than we entered into it. We have taken advantage of opportunities provided by the most recent economic downturn to grow our earnings power going forward. This growth in sustainable earnings is a direct result of the talent and dedications, the can-do attitude of the Nucor team and what it brings to work each and every day. 
While we are encouraged by our first quarter performance and the second quarter outlook, the real returns still are ahead of us. When a robust, sustainable economic recovery inevitably returns, our teams' efforts will pay big dividends to all members of the Nucor family, particularly the people who own Nucor, our shareholders. As you have probably heard us discuss, our goal is to generate higher highs of each successive peak in the economic and steel market cycles and higher lows. 
Again, thank you to all the 20,500 men and women of the Nucor team. And most importantly, continue to work safely.
I will now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, to discuss our first quarter results and financial position. Following Jim's comments, President and COO, John Ferriola, will report on our operations and computation of our growth initiatives. And then I'll wrap up our remarks before we take your questions.

184945,129455873,116799,"Nucor Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. First quarter 2011 earnings of $0.50 per diluted share were substantial improvement over both fourth quarter 2010 loss of $0.04 per share and the year-ago first quarter earnings of $0.10 per share. Our results benefited fr",976,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. First quarter 2011 earnings of $0.50 per diluted share were substantial improvement over both fourth quarter 2010 loss of $0.04 per share and the year-ago first quarter earnings of $0.10 per share. Our results benefited from volume gains and expanding metal margins at our steel mills, as well as a solid contribution from our David J. Joseph Co.'s Raw Materials businesses. 
On the negative side, our downstream fabricated construction products continue to face very challenging markets in the first quarter. The first quarter metal margin expansion at our steel mills demonstrated, again, the long established historical experience of arising scrap prices leading after a short lag to higher metal margins. Metal margins for the month of March 2011 was at the highest level attained since 2008. Steel mill shipments were 5.2 million tons, an increase of 14% from the fourth quarter. 
All product groups realized volume growth, but the strongest gains occurring at our sheet and beam mills. Sheet mill shipments increased 23%, and beam shipments increased 21% over the fourth quarter. Nucor's first quarter steel mill utilization rate reached 79.6%. That was a significant improvement from our fourth quarter rate of 68.2%. It also compared favorably to the U.S. steel industry's first quarter utilization rate of 73.6%.
With Nucor's highly flexible production capability and unrivaled product diversity, our teams were well positioned to capitalize on improved demand in the first quarter. In the first quarter, Nucor recorded a LIFO inventory charge of $31 million. That was an increase from LIFO charges of $23 million in the fourth quarter and $24 million in the year-ago first quarter. 
The first quarter effective tax rate measured as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 32%. However, after moving profits for noncontrolling interests, the effective tax rate increases to 34.8%. First quarter results included $28 million of pre-operating and startup of costs. Those costs declined for more than $50 million in the prior year first quarter and $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
We are pleased to report that our Memphis SBQ mill and our Kingman, Arizona wire rod called rebar mill achieved profitability in the first quarter.
Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. We view pre-operating and startup costs as investments to grow our long-term earnings power. That has been our company's strategy over many previous cycles. For example, Nucor's most recent cyclical peak earnings of almost $6 per share in 2008 carried sizable contributions from the startup projects undertaken during the 2001 to 2003 downturn. We are now looking forward to growing profit contributions from our investments made just prior to and during the current downturn.
At the close of the first quarter, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion. In addition to that total, there is $577 million of restricted cash held on our balance sheet. We received this restricted cash from tax-exempt bonds issued last year to finance the significant portion of its $750 million DRI plant we are building in Louisiana. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until November 2012.
We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash balances over $1.2 billion. Using that methodology, our net debt-to-capital ratio is 30%. That calculation excludes the restricted cash. 
Nucor's strong balance sheet and business model were recognized in a report Standard & Poor's issued on April 15. The report, entitled U.S. and Canadian Metals and Mining Companies, Strongness to Weakness, ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among the universe of 61 companies. It is worth noting that Nucor was the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to its assessment of our competitive position and financial performance relative to our peers.
In 2011, we will continue to allocate capital to investments that build our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $500 million. Included in that total are about $70 million of spending for our Louisiana DRI plant and about $60 million for our natural gas working interest drilling program. 
Examples of other growth projects underway are: A new quality assurance line at our Nebraska SBQ mill, that can be gassers at both our Arkansas sheet mill and our North Carolina plate mill; melt shop transform upgrades and related electoral system upgrades at our Utah Bar Mill; and non-ferrous rotation projects at David J. Joseph's recycling operations.
Our outlook for the second quarter is positive. We ended the quarter with strong momentum, as utilization rates, metal margins and profitability improved from the beginning to the end of the first quarter. Although there have been signs of weakness in some market segments, our belief remains that end market usage continues to experience gradual improvement and real demand. Markets for downstream fabricated construction products remain very challenging.
Overall, we expect second quarter results to be an improvement over the first quarter. However, we do caution against overly optimistic expectations for the second quarter. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle and final month of the quarter. We remain very optimistic about Nucor's long-term prospects for continuing our improving earnings trend. Our business model is built around adaptability, allowing our company to leverage its position of strength throughout the economic and steel market cycles. 
The Nucor team is working hard and working very effectively to build attractive and sustainable value for our shareholders. We are driven, and settle for nothing less.

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel product teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and taking care of Nucor's customers. We are extremely proud of the work that you are doing to take advantage of opportunities for profitable and sustainable growth for Nucor. Thank you, and please keep it going.
Turning to the first quarter. Our teammates made substantial progress in continuing to grow Nucor's earning power. Here are some current examples of where our teams are building for a stronger Nucor in today's slow growth and uncertain economy.
Our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mills new heat treat line completed trials and began accepting orders in February. It's going extremely well with both volume and rate development exceeding our plan. In fact, our Hertford County team is running the heat treat facility at full capacity, a production volume that we did not expect to achieve until the fourth quarter of this year. Most importantly, customer feedback on the quality and the performance of our heat-treated plate has been excellent and true to Nucor's focus on continual improvement. The team at Hertford County is continuing to develop new, higher value grades. Great job team Hertford County. Thank you.
This investment improves Nucor's profitability as it allows Hertford County to grow into higher margin products where higher strength, abrasion resistance and greater toughness are required. And it also allows us to shift and improve the product mix allocation between our 2 plate mills and 4 sheet mills to improve margins at those facilities. 
For example, in the first quarter, our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill began producing as rolled discrete carbon plate products. And volume out of Decatur, Alabama and Arkansas sheet mills benefited from Tuscaloosa shifting some of its hot rolled coil production to them. 
The bottom line, our expanding Ohio margin plate product portfolio, while at the same time optimizing capacity utilization at our plate and sheet mills, results in higher earnings power from both our plate and our sheet mill groups. And further expansion plans are in the works for the Hertford County heat treat operations.
I also have good news to share from another major product -- project that started up during the current downturn: our special bar quality or SBQ mill in Memphis. Our Memphis team is rapidly completing the qualification process with many of our customers and, as a result, continues building volume. In March, they set another record for shipments of rolled finished goods. Even better, they delivered their first quarter of profits since start-up. Our Memphis team has turned a major corner and their future is very bright.
The Memphis mill more than doubles our capacity to serve the SBQ markets while also expanding our product range into the highly attractive 3-inch to 10-inch large diameter segment. Nucor will now be able to supply SBQ products from 7/32 of an inch to 10 inches in diameter, which allows us to offer our customers the most diverse SBQ product range in North America. Memphis is currently producing engineered steel bars for applications, such as camshafts, crankshafts, spindles and rain gears to use in the heavy truck and automotive markets. And other attractive markets currently being served include energy, heavy equipment and agriculture. 
Reflecting the Nucor culture's drive for continual improvement and profitable growth, there is more to come in our SBQ business. Nucor Steel Nebraska is on schedule for the third quarter 2011 start-up of a new downstream processing line that provides attractive growth opportunities in even higher quality SBQ products than they currently offer. 
Additionally, our Darlington, South Carolina bar mill is enjoying success with their implementation of fully submerged and shrouded casting practices. The resulting improvements in product quality are allowing our Darlington team to grow their margins as they expand their presence in higher quality SBQ applications. 
I will close my report with our thoughts on current market conditions. The market environment for our Fabricated Construction Products businesses continues to be extremely challenged. And we expect it to remain so over the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, there is still good news to report. Our teammates in those businesses are doing an excellent job of working safely, gaining market share in many product lines, and staying focused on continuous improvement.
On the steelmaking side, the recovery continues to be slow and uneven between the industrial and energy sectors and the residential and nonresidential construction sectors. Steel buyers have shown more caution as market pricing escalated during the first quarter. At the same time, supply in the sheet market has increased with recent blast furnace restarts in addition to greater import offerings.
On the other hand, service center inventories through March remained at relatively low levels. And we continue to see evidence of improvement in real demand in several markets important to Nucor. These include energy, heavy equipment, agriculture, truck trailers and bridge building markets. While nonresidential construction activity remains weak, the bottom in that important market appears to be behind us.
Whatever direction the economy takes in coming months and quarters, the Nucor team will outperform in taking care of all of our customers. That includes our shareholders, our teammates, and the people who buy and use our products. And here are some of the reasons we will outperform: Nucor's low and highly flexible production costs; our great customer service; Nucor's diversified product portfolio; and most importantly, our people, driven by the can-do attitude and their high energy level.

And here are some of the investments made since the previous cyclical peak in 2008 that will help drive us to higher highs in earnings: An increase of more than 10% in our bar mill group's annual production capacity with the addition of the Memphis and Kingman mills; an increase of 33% in our sheet mill group's value-added coater steel annual capacity with the addition of the Decatur galvanizing facility; an increase of 30% in the David J. Joseph Co. scrap processing annual capacity in addition to the opportunity to realize earnings through our full up cycle on DJJ's original capacity of 3.5 million tons; an increase of more than 50% in Harris Steel's rebar fabrication annual capacity; in addition to the opportunity to realize earnings through a full up cycle, the Harris Steel's original capacity of 1 million tons; the opportunity to realize earnings to a full up cycle in our Extended Metals Building businesses, which more than tripled in size at 465,000 tons of annual capacity with the Magnatrax acquisition and the Utah greenfield plant; our 50% interest in southern Europe's largest beam producer, Duferdofin-Nucor, and its recently expanded beam and bar annual capacity that now totals approximately 1.8 million tons; our 50% interest in NuMit and our Steel Technology Sheet Steel Processing businesses with 24 processing facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico and more on the way; our North Carolina plate mill's heat treat facility; and Canada's other product line expansions at our bar, beam, sheet and plate mills; and our Nucor Steel Louisiana directly reduced higher facility's first module currently under construction that will more than double our DRI annual production capacity to 4.5 million tons. The plans are more to come at our 4,000-acre site on the Mississippi River.
From 2007 to our expected 2011 capital spending plans, we have invested more than $6 billion of capital, including both capital expenditures and acquisitions. That is a lot of capital that Nucor shareholders will get paid for through attractive returns in the next up cycle. Our confidence has never been greater, and Nucor's best is yet to come. 
Our team thanks you very much for your interest in Nucor. We value your interest and support. And we would now be happy to take your questions."

I would say that starting with the positive, as we look at most of our product lines, plate, SBQ, we expect to remain strong through that period.

So the one market that we're going to keep a close eye on would be, as Dan addressed, our sheet businesses. And typically, as you come out of the second quarter and enter into the third quarter, you do see a seasonal slowdown that you usually generated as a result of the automotive shutdowns for retooling. Now this year, it's going to be much more difficult to predict the impact of that, that we feel the impact will be mitigated because of what's happening today, as Dan mentioned, with the supply of non-steel critical components into the automotive market from Japan. As a result, both the domestic and the new domestics production rates currently are down as they are waiting for those key raw materials. And when you look at, as we look at the fewer inventory days on hand, we see that they are dropping low, they're going down, and they're continuing to go down. When you look on the domestic side, on the domestic production side, you're looking at about 54 days, dealers days on hand, which is a low number. And with the new domestics, the number is even lower than that. So we see some pent-up demand in the automotive sector, which will release as these non-steel components become more available. And we believe that, that will mitigate the impact of the traditional seasonal slowdown that we see at the end of the second quarter and going into the third quarter."

We had said all along that things were improving. As we were going through the first quarter we expected to be getting price realizations that had lagged, the raw material increases that we had seen and it went through our cost structure. The problem in being more accurate, if we want to call it that, forecast, was that, that is a moving target, exactly where the pricing ended up depended upon how strong the shipments were and how strongly our customers were taking those shipments. And in all honestly, that March was a rollout month. It was a very strong month, particularly in reference to the first 2 months of the quarter. So it was better for us to, under those circumstances, with so many things floating out there in terms of where pricing would end up and how strong shipments would be in the month of March, the stronger the shipments, the further you go into getting the higher price increases. And all of that turned out to be very favorable on all the products, not just flat-roll, but in every product line."

Thank you for joining us on our conference call, and as always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. 
With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor senior management team: Our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Ferriola; our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice President, Jim Darsey, over our Long Pipes group; Keith Grass, over our Raw Materials group; Ladd Hall over our Flat Road group; Ham Lott over our Fabricated Products group; and Joe Stratman, is head of our Business Development group as well as our Beam and Plate business. 
First, and most importantly, I want to thank everyone in our team at Nucor and our steel and David J. Joseph operations for working safely working hard and working together. And the quarter marked by historically weak construction markets and severe weather issues have impacted a number of our facilities. You delivered impressive results to our customers and to our shareholders. The talent, dedication and can-do attitude that the Nucor team brings to work each day is an always will be our company's greatest competitive advantage. Thank you. 
Second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share were nearly double first quarter earnings of $0.50 per share and more than tripled year-ago second quarter earnings of $0.29 per share. We are certainly encouraged by this performance and especially the continued solid profitability of our combined construction products offerings from our products, steel mills and downstream fabrication businesses. These results reinforce our conviction as to the powerful earnings leverage we will see ahead of us once a sustainable economic recovery never begins. 
Our second quarter results also highlight Nucor's position of strength in North America in steel industry. We have a business model that is built around operational flexibility, product diversification, market leadership positions, financial strength and, most importantly, our unique culture. 
Compared to the advantages I just described to allow new quarter profit in a good way to both our core construction product businesses and from the strength found in the still depressed economy. Additionally, some of our major growth initiatives undertaken during the current economic downturn are beginning to contribute to Nucor's earnings. Our steel mills benefited from an upturn in pricing that began last winter and peak this spring. 
We also experienced steady to improving demand in several important entities of our markets such as energy, transportation, water heaters, HVAC. And there was a strong contribution from the new higher value-added profits that our sheet mill teams have penetrated in a good way. Our plate mills capitalized on both improved pricing and solid demand from a number of sectors, including heavy equipment, truck trailers, energy, mining and rail. And our recent product expansion to each -- continued to pay off in a good way. 
Our -- our special bar quality mills, including our newest, Memphis, benefited from extremely tightest market. STTs have been and continue to be successful in growing the core product range and market penetration. Our downstream cold finished bars and businesses achieved strong profit growth in the just completed quarter. 
More product mills are competing in very depressed construction markets. They, nevertheless, begin solid profits for the second quarter and first half of this year. The mills continue to benefit from the market leadership positions low cost reduction to unravel the breadth of product offering, which are complemented by our fabricated construction products and the coast-to-coast distribution capability. 
Quite frankly, when I review our second quarter and first half performance, I am very perplexed by how some financial market participants are so quick to claim that Nucor will underperform its steel industry peers due to our company's heavy participation in construction markets. Our results for the second quarter and over many economic cycles tell a very different story. Again, the future of our performance and most importantly, our ability to reward our shareholders is a flexibility, diversification and sustainability found in our business model. Even better, our business model allows us to focus on the long term and grow stronger during downturns. Such as what continues to face the U.S. economy today. 
Recent economic data are clear. The U.S. economy is still struggling to emerge from the great recession and unable to move to a path of vibrant and sustainable growth. 
In June, in Rio, our employment rate increase to 16.2% from 15.8% in May. Going back to March of this year, the number of unemployed people has increased by 545,000. And today's job numbers were no more encouraging. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit widened over $50 billion in May, its highest level in a more than 2.5 years. GDP growth for this year's first half is an abysmal rate of less than 2%. 
This economic performance or lack thereof is not surprising. Our nation implements real solutions to eliminate the unsustainable structural balances that are dragging our economy deeper and deeper into a hole of little or no growth and extreme debt. As our team stated in our previous calls and many other forms, the way forward though stronger and more sustainable American economy is straightforward. Our leaders need to focus on real solutions that eliminate the structural imbalances and at the same time create where economy needs most jobs, jobs and more jobs. This could be accomplished through a 3-point plan to achieve new energy independence, enforce rules base free trade and, thereby, revitalize US-based manufacturing and rebuild our company infrastructure. These steps, along with the more competitive global tax system, spending and unraveling of a massive volume of new revelations of the economic growth will lead to a significantly stronger economy and provide tax revenues needed to reduce our national debt and still provide for those commitments made by our government to the American people. No other solution will accomplishes and create the 25 to 30 million new jobs we need over the next 5 to 10 years. It's time to stop fiddling and to start doing the right things. 
The course of the overall economy and steel market conditions are beyond our control. However, one thing is for certain and under our control. The Nucor team will meet any and all challenges head-on and turn them into opportunities. This is exactly what our teams have been doing for more than 4 decades. 
At this time, I would now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our second quarter results. Following Jim's comments, President and COO John Ferriola will report on our financials and our growth initiatives. Jim?"

Second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 per share. Our results benefited from a stronger-than-expected increase in steel making metal margins. In the second quarter, the metal margin expanded to $447 per ton, a gain of $82 per ton for the first quarter and an increase of $127 per ton from the trough reached in last year's fourth quarter. This is consistent with the long established historical expense of our steel mills where rising scrap prices lead after short lag to higher metal margins. 
Our downstream fabricated construction products continue to operate in very depressed markets. Despite these difficult market conditions, metal margins improved our bar and beam mills as our competitive strengths overcame the effects of relatively low utilization rates. As Dan noted, we continue to generate solid profits in our combined steel and fabricated construction products businesses. 
In the second quarter, Nucor recorded a LIFO inventory charge of $32 million. That was in line with our first quarter LIFO charge of $31 million. Second quarter results also included $31 million of pre-operating and startup costs. That compares the first quarter cost of $128 million and $43 million in the prior year second quarter. 
Nucor's financial strength allowed us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. Okay, I'm sorry let me restate that. That compares to first quarter cost of $28 million and $43 million in the prior-year second quarter, and that's speaking to pre-operating and startup costs. 
Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest an attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. We view pre-operating startup costs as investments to grow our long-term earnings power. For example, the investments made during the current downturn in our Memphis SP2 mill. In our Kingman, Arizona wired mill contributed to new course improved profits in the quarter and first half of this year. 
The second quarter effective tax rate measured as a percent of earnings before income taxes and non-controlling interest was 32.6%. However, after adjusting our profits belonging to our noncontrolling interest business partners, the effective tax rate increases to 34.2%. 
Earnings per diluted share of $1.44 for the first half of 2011 represent a significant improvement of almost 4x from a year ago's earnings per share of $0.38. Nucor's annualized return on equity through this year's first half exceeds 12%. The Nucor team is achieving this performance in the marketplace where nonresidential construction square-foot for 2011 is forecasted to be 60% below the peak level reached in 2007. 
This return on equity performance is also achieved at the lowest financial leverage in the industry. We're excited by the opportunities ahead to deliver higher returns when the inevitable cyclical recovery finally arrives. 
At the close of the second quarter, cash in charge investments totaled $2.3 billion. In addition to that total, we hold $577 million of restricted cash on our balance sheet. The restricted cash is there to fund a significant portion of the $750 million plant we are building in Louisiana. 
Our healthy level of cash and short-term investments will also allow us to repay long-term debt maturities of $650 million in 2012 and $250 million in 2013. 
Further to Nucor strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and doe not mature until November 2012. We have no commercial paper outstanding. 
Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the second quarter for a gross debt to capital ratio of 36%. Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash and short-term investments balance over $1.2 billion. Using that methodology, our net debt-to-capital ratio is 30%, and that calculation is that the restricted cash. 
Standard & Poor's, in its July 1 report entitled U.S. and Canada Metals and Mining Companies Strong and Weakest again ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among the universe of 61 companies. Nucor was only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers. 
In 2011, we are continuing to invest in projects that will grow our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $500 million. John Ferriola will give you a overview of our capital project in his remarks. 
Our outlook for the third quarter is tempered by the impacted new domestic supply and increase imports in the sheet market. For that reason, we expect third quarter earnings to be lower than the second quarter. 
Overall demand in end-use market such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing remain relatively strong. Those markets mainly benefit our special bar quality sheet and plate notes. Markets for downstream fabricated construction products remain challenging but are slowly improving. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle of the final month of the quarter. 
We are very optimistic by Nucor's ability to continue building attractive and sustainable long-term value for our shoulders. We are confident that her team has the right people and the right business model to get the job done. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel bars team mates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and taking care of Nucor's customers. That commitment was severely tested in the second quarter with the major challenges presented by weather-related power outages and historic river flooding. Your response to these challenges again demonstrate that Nucor is North America's most reliable steel and steel products producer. Thank you, and keep up the great work. 
The impact of these disruptions is evidenced by the decline in our steel mill capacity utilization. It dropped to 70.7% in the second quarter, which is down from 79.6% in the first quarter. By far, the biggest challenge we faced was from the loss of full electrical power at Alabama sheet mill for 29 days f following the devastating tornadoes that hit that area in late April. 
But understanding our company and how our culture creates long term value, there's a much bigger story than any short-term loss on production, shipments and even earnings. The biggest story is how our team responded to take care of all of our customers during such a challenging period. 
Here's how the Nucor team, the one Nucor team responded. Immediately after power was lost, our dedicated team work with their respective sheet mill divisions to successfully move all the container to all the Nucor sheet mills. Those orders were then produced and delivered on time. And the change in production sourcing within the Nucor sheet mill group was seamless, if not invisible, to our customers. One order from a major world OEM customer, normally supplied by -- was deduced at out our Berkeley, South Carolina mill. It was then sent back into which had restored enough power to run the cold mill to its cold ruling. Following that, it was delivered on time to our customers at Alabama facility, and all of that took place within 11 days. 
There are many other stories similar to this that I could share with you about how the one Nucor team pulled together throughout our company. The bottom line is that we use Nucor's unrivaled position of strength and flexibility to take care of our customers. 
We also consider the community in which we live and work to be our valued customers. In the days immediately following the devastating tornadoes that hit Tuscaloosa, while those mills were without power to operate, our team from those facilities and many other Nucor facilities sprang into action. They worked tirelessly, many on a voluntary basis to assist in the rescue and recovery efforts taking place in those hard-hit communities. Using Nucor supply: Chainsaws, bobcats, generators and other equipment, much of which was sent from other Nucor divisions throughout the country, they proved through the actions Nucor's commitment to being a good stewards of the communities in which we live and work. I have never been more proud of the Nucor culture and of our Nucor team. Thank you all. 
Since 2008, Nucor has invested almost $5 billion of our shoulders valuable capital so that we can take care of our customers. Those investments enable us to take care of our customers with unrivaled operational flexibility, unmatched product diversification and an absolute commitment to always getting the job done. 
As Jim Frias noted, the returns from those investments are becoming more evident even in the current distressed economy. And the beat goes on with a number of major capital projects underway for 2011. 
Raw materials initiatives included our Louisiana directly sign for a DRI plant and our natural gas working interest drilling program. We expect our increased DRI production capacity, combined with control over the necessary supply of reductant, will establish a significant and sustainable competitive advantage to Nucor's steelmaking business. Also, the  David J. Joseph recycling operations are growing their earnings power with the addition of more nonferrous metal recovery capacity. 
On the steelmaking site, we continue to invest on projects that will further expand our product offerings and allow us to move further up to value chain. For example, we are installing gases at both our office in sheet mill and our North Carolina plate mill. 
I will close my report with our thoughts on the current market conditions. Overall, demand is best described as steady. Some markets are even experiencing some increased in real demand. The non-residential and residential construction markets continue to suffer from a recessionary levels of demand. Market improvements are slower at best but importantly, service under inventories remain at relatively low levels. 
Unfortunately, excess supply in the sheet market is pressuring pricing and margins. In addition to new domestic capacity, imports of sheet steel have increased significantly. Year-to-date, through May, imports of hot rolled and cold rolled sheet steel have increased by 18% over a year-ago level and is increased to 1.3 million tons. Unless these supply demand and pricing dynamics reverse themselves, the sheet market will be the most challenging for the entire industry in the third quarter. 
I will also note that we remain very concerned about imports across all product lines. It is important for the U.S. government to vigorously enforce the anti-dumping duty laws. No product line is immune from the negative impact of illegally traded -- of illegal trading, and is important that existing antidumping orders be maintained in the U.S. industry to remain viable. But whatever the direction these economy and the steel market take in the coming months, the Nucor team is prime and ready to grow stronger. 
So one Nucor grows stronger, we position our company for new high highs in cyclical earnings power once a sustainable economic recovery occurs. Our team thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Partic",338,"Well, certainly, a couple of questions there. I'll answer the last one first. Certainly, if you are in a position to be able to recover the lost volume due to weather-related issues and get more facility, your production costs improve dramatically. Particularly at the mill that was influenced most by the huge power outages that hit the Southeast, which was Alabama plant, which is down better part 5 weeks, I think 29, 30 days. And we lost a few also with our Tuscaloosa plate mill. We also had some impacts on shipping and raw material because of a clouding on the Mississippi that impacted not only some is the most but also some of our scrapyards. So anytime you can see that type of reversal and in a core net assuming weather patterns don't. We appear on a similar nature. They should have a positive impact on our cost structure. Having said that, at the end of the day, the strength of the market will dictate whether or not we're able to achieve those recoveries in volume or what exactly, what volumes we will see. We do see, as we already mentioned, a much more competitive environment going into the third quarter on sheet. And while we plan on bidding extremely competitor and not losing volume, whether or not there's additional volume to be gained is another matter. One other thing is that we do probably benefits from is the fact that the lead times are relatively short. With the publish, I'm not going to quote what our lead times are, but the industry's lead times are fairly well-known on the sheet side. And the scrap markets often, and that profit will pass through middle in the third quarter. And if there's any relief on pricing during the third quarter, that should flow through fairly quickly as well. But those are the potential positives. Right now, we are very cautious about outlook on the flatroll business for the third quarter. John, do you have anything you wan add?"

Thank you for joining us on our conference call and as always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. 
With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team, our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Ferriola; our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, over our Long Products group; Keith Grass, over our Raw Materials group; Ladd Hall, over our Flat-rolled and Direct Reduced Iron group; Ham Lott, over our Fabricated Products group; and Joe Stratman, who heads up our Business Development group, as well as our Beam and Plate business. 
First, and most importantly, I want to thank everyone in our team at Nucor and our Harris Steel and David J. Joseph operations for working safely, working hard and working together. And the quarter marked by historically weak construction markets and severe weather issues have impacted a number of our facilities, but you delivered impressive results to our customers and to our shareholders. The talent, dedication and can-do attitude that the Nucor team brings to work each day is and always will be our company's greatest competitive advantage. Thank you. 
The second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share were nearly double first quarter earnings of $0.50 per share, and more than triple the year-ago second quarter earnings of $0.29 per share. We are certainly encouraged by this performance, and especially the continued solid profitability of our combined construction products offerings from our Long Products, Steel Mills and Downstream Fabrication businesses. These results reinforce our conviction as to the powerful earnings leverage we will see ahead of us once the sustainable economic recovery never begins. 
Our second quarter results also highlight Nucor's position of strength in North America and the steel industry. We have a business model that is built around operational flexibility, product diversification, market leadership positions, financial strength and most importantly, our unique culture.  The competitive advantages I've just described allowed new quarter profit in a good way to both our core Construction Product businesses and from the pockets of strength found in the still depressed economy. Additionally, some of our major growth initiatives undertaken during the current economic downturn are beginning to contribute to Nucor's earnings. Our Sheet Mills benefited from an upturn in pricing that began last winter and peaked this spring. 
We also experienced steady to improving demand in several important end-use markets such as energy, transportation, water heaters, and HVAC. And there was a strong contribution from the new higher value-added products that our sheet mill teams have penetrated in a good way. Our plate mills capitalized on both improved pricing and solid demand from a number of sectors, including heavy equipment, truck trailers, energy, mining and rail, and our recent product expansion to each we play continued to pay off in a good way. 
Our SBQ, our special bar quality mills, including our newest, Memphis, benefited from an extremely tight SBQ market. Our SBQs have been and will continue to be successful in growing its coil product range and market penetration. Our downstream Cold Finished Bar and Fastener businesses achieved strong profitability in the just completed quarter, and Long Products mills are competing in very depressed construction markets. They, nevertheless, began to deliver solid profits for the second quarter and first half of this year. The coiled rebar mills and beam mills continued to benefit from the market leadership positions and low cost production to unravel the breadth of product offering, which are complemented by our fabricated construction products and their coast-to-coast distribution capability. 
Quite frankly, when I review our second quarter and first half performance, I am very perplexed by how some financial market participants are so quick to claim that Nucor will underperform its steel industry peers due to our company's heavy participation in construction markets. Our results for the second quarter and over many economic cycles tell a very different story. Again, the future of our performance and most importantly, our ability to reward our shareholders is the flexibility, diversification and sustainability found in our business model. Even better, our business model allows us to focus on the long term and grow stronger during downturns, such as what continues to face the U.S. economy today.  Recent economic data are clear. The U.S. economy is still struggling to emerge from the great recession, and unable to move to a path of vibrant and sustainable growth. 
In June, the real or U-6 unemployment rate increased to 16.2% from 15.8% in May. Going back to March of this year, the number of unemployed people has increased by 545,000. And today's job numbers were no more encouraging. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit widened over $50 billion in May, its highest level in more than 2.5 years. GDP growth for this year's first half is an abysmal rate of less than 2%.  This economic performance, or lack thereof, is not surprising. Our nation has failed to implement real solutions to eliminate the unsustainable structural imbalances that are dragging our economy deeper and deeper into a hole of little or no growth and extreme debt. 
As our team have stated in our previous calls and many other forms, the way forward through a stronger and more sustainable American economy is straightforward. Our leaders need to focus on real solutions that eliminate the structural imbalances and at the same time, create where economy needs most, jobs, jobs and more jobs. This could be accomplished through our 3-point plan to achieve new energy independence, enforce rules-based free trade and thereby, revitalize U.S-based manufacturing and rebuild our company infrastructure. These steps, along with the more competitive global tax system, spending on unraveling of the massive volume of new regulations of a strangling economic growth will lead to a significantly stronger economy, and provide the tax revenues needed to reduce our national debt, and still provide for those commitments made by our government to the American people. No other solution will accomplish this, and create the 25 to 30 million new jobs we need over the next 5 to 10 years. It is time to stop fiddling and to start doing the right things. 
The course of the overall economy and the steel market conditions are barely beyond our control. However, one thing is for certain and under our control. The Nucor team will meet any and all challenges head-on, and turn them into opportunities. This is exactly what our team has been doing for more than 4 decades. 
At this time, I would now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our second quarter results. Following Jim's comments, President and COO, John Ferriola, will report on our operations and interpretation of our growth initiatives. Jim?"
184945,136885995,144408,"Nucor Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. The second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 per share. Our results benefited from a stronger-than-expected increase in steel-making metal margins. In the second",889,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. The second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 per share. Our results benefited from a stronger-than-expected increase in steel-making metal margins. In the second quarter, the metal margin expanded to $447 per ton, a gain of $82 per ton from the first quarter, and an increase of $127 per ton from the trough reached in last year's fourth quarter. This is consistent with the long established historical experience of our steel mills, where rising scrap prices lead after a short lag to higher metal margins. 
Our downstream fabricated construction products continued to operate in very depressed markets. Despite these difficult market conditions, metal margins improved at our Bar and Beam mills as our competitive strengths overcame the effects of relatively low utilization rates. As Dan noted, we continue to generate solid profits in our combined Steel and Fabricated Construction Products businesses. 
In the second quarter, Nucor recorded a LIFO inventory charge of $32 million. That was in line with our first quarter LIFO charge of $31 million. Second quarter results also included $31 million of pre-operating and startup costs. That compares to first quarter cost of $128 million and $43 million in the prior year second quarter. 
Nucor's financial strength allowed us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle -- okay, I'm sorry let me restate that. That compares to first quarter cost of $28 million and $43 million in the prior-year second quarter, and that's speaking to pre-operating and startup costs.  Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. We view pre-operating startup costs as investments to grow our long-term earnings power. For example, the investments made during the current downturn in our Memphis SBQ mill, and our Kingman, Arizona wire rod mill contributed to Nucor's improved profits in the second quarter and first half of this year. 
The second quarter effective tax rate, measured as a percent of earnings before income taxes and non-controlling interest, was 32.6%. However, after adjusting our profits belonging to our non-controlling interest business partners, the effective tax rate increases to 34.2%. 
Earnings per diluted share of $1.44 for the first half of 2011 represent a significant improvement of almost 4x from a year ago's earnings per share of $0.38. Nucor's annualized return on equity through this year's first half exceeds 12%. The Nucor team is achieving this performance in a marketplace where non-residential construction square footage for 2011 is forecasted to be 60% below the peak level reached in 2007.  This return on equity performance is also achieved at the lowest financial leverage in the industry. We're excited by the opportunities ahead to deliver higher returns when the inevitable cyclical recovery finally arrives.  At the close of the second quarter, cash and short term investments totaled $2.3 billion. In addition to that total, we hold $577 million of restricted cash on our balance sheet. The restricted cash is there to fund a significant portion of the $750 million deal iron plant we are building in Louisiana.  Our healthy level of cash and short-term investments will also allow us to repay long-term debt maturities of $650 million in 2012 and $250 million in 2013. 
Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn, and does not mature until November 2012. We have no commercial paper outstanding.  Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the second quarter for a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 36%. Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash and short-term investments balance over $1.2 billion. Using that methodology, our net debt-to-capital ratio is 30%, and that calculation excludes the restricted cash. 
Standard & Poor's, in its July 1 report entitled U.S. and Canadian Metals and Mining Companies Strongest to Weakest again ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among the universe of 61 companies. Nucor was the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers.  In 2011, we are continuing to invest in projects that will grow our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $500 million. John Ferriola will give you an overview of our capital projects in his remarks. 
Our outlook for the third quarter is tampered by the impacted of new domestic supply and increased imports in the sheet market. For that reason, we expect third quarter earnings to be lower than the second quarter.  Overall demand in end-use market such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing remain relatively strong. Those markets mainly benefit our special bar quality sheet and plate mills. The markets for downstream fabricated construction products remained challenging, but are slowly improving. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle of the final month of the quarter. 
We are very optimistic by Nucor's ability to continue building attractive and sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. We are confident that our team has the right people and the right business model to get the job done. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel bar teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely, and of taking care of Nucor's customers. That commitment was severely tested in the second quarter, with the major challenges presented by weather-related power outages and historic river flooding. Your response to these challenges again demonstrate that Nucor is North America's most reliable steel and steel products producer. Thank you, and keep up the great work. 
The impact of these disruptions is evidenced by the decline in our steel mill capacity utilization. It dropped to 70.7% in the second quarter, which is down from 79.6% in the first quarter. By far, the biggest challenge we faced was from the loss of full electrical power at our Decatur, Alabama sheet mill for 29 days, following the devastating tornadoes that hit that area in late April. But in understanding our company and how our culture creates long term value, there's a much bigger story than any short-term loss on production, shipments and even earnings. The biggest story is how our team responded to take care of all of our customers during such a challenging period.  Here's how the Nucor team, the one Nucor team responded. Immediately, after the power was lost, our Decatur team worked with their sister Sheet mill divisions to successfully move all of Decatur's orders to other Nucor sheet mills. Those orders were then produced and delivered on time. And the change in production sourcing within the Nucor sheet mill group was seamless, if not, invisible, to our customers.  One order from a major coal railroad OEM customer, normally supplied by Decatur, was reduced out of hot-rolled coil at out our Berkeley, South Carolina mill. It was then sent back to Decatur, which had restored enough power to run the cold mill for its cold rolling. Following that, it was delivered on time to our customers in Alabama facility, and all of that took place within 11 days.  There are many other stories similar to this that I could share with you about how the one Nucor team hold together throughout our company. The bottom line is that we use Nucor's unrivaled position of strength and flexibility to take care of our customers. 
We also consider the communities in which we live and work to be our valued customers. In the days, immediately following the devastating tornadoes that hit Decatur and Tuscaloosa, while those mills were without power to operate, our teammates from those facilities and many other Nucor facilities sprang into action. They worked tirelessly, many on a voluntary basis to assist in the rescue and recovery efforts taking place in those hard-hit communities, using Nucor-supplied chainsaws, bobcats, generators and other equipment, much of which was sent from other Nucor divisions throughout the country. They proved through their actions Nucor's commitment to being a good steward of the communities in which we live and work. I have never been more proud of the Nucor culture and of our Nucor team. Thank you all. 
Since 2008, Nucor has invested over $5 billion of our shareholder's valuable capital, so that we can take care of our customers. Those investments enable us to take care of our customers with unrivaled operational flexibility, unmatched product diversification and an absolute commitment to always getting the job done.  As Jim Frias noted, the returns from those investments are becoming more evident even in the current distressed economy. And the beat goes on with a number of major capital projects underway for 2011. 
Raw materials initiatives, included our Louisiana  direct-reduced iron or our DRI plant, and our natural gas working interest drilling program. We expect our increased DRI production capacity, combined with control over the necessary supply of reductant, will establish a significant and sustainable competitive advantage to Nucor's steelmaking business. Also, the David J. Joseph recycling operations are growing their earnings power, with the addition of more non-ferrous metal recovery capacity.  On the steelmaking site, we continue to invest in projects that will further expand our product offerings, and allow us to move further up the value chain. For example, we are installing vacuum degassers at both our office on our sheet mill and our North Carolina plate mill. 
I will close my report with our thoughts on the current market conditions. Overall, demand is best described as steady. Some markets are even experiencing some increase in real demand. The non-residential and residential construction markets continue to suffer from recessionary levels of demand. Market improvements are slow at best but importantly, service under inventories remain at relatively low levels. 
Unfortunately, excess supply in the sheet market is pressuring pricing and margins. In addition to new domestic capacity, imports of sheet steel have increased significantly. Year-to-date, through May, imports of hot-rolled and cold-rolled sheet steel have increased by 18% over year-ago level, and is increased to 1.3 million tons. Unless these supply demand and pricing dynamics reverse themselves, the sheet market will be the most challenging for the entire industry in the third quarter. 
I will also note that we remain very concerned about imports across all product lines. It is important for the U.S. government to vigorously enforce the anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. No product line is immune from the negative impact of illegally traded -- of illegal trading, and it is important that existing anti-dumping orders be maintained in the U.S. industry to remain viable. But whatever direction the economy and the steel market take in the coming months, the Nucor team is prime and ready to grow stronger.  So when Nucor grows stronger, we position our company for new high highs in cyclical earnings power once a sustainable economic recovery occurs. Our team thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

I'll answer the last one first. Certainly, if you are in the position to be able to recover the lost volume due to weather-related issues and get more tons for your facility, your production cost improve dramatically. Particularly, at the mill, that was influenced most by the huge power outages that hit the southeast, which was our Decatur, Alabama plant, which is down for more than 5 weeks, I think 29, 30 days. And we lost a few days also with our Tuscaloosa plate mill. We also had some impacts on shipping and raw material flow because of the flooding on the Mississippi that were -- impacted not only some of the steel mills, but also some of our scrap yards. So anytime you can see that type of reversal in the core, assuming weather patterns don't reappear on a similar nature, they should have a positive impact on our cost structure. Having said that, at the end of the day, the strength of the market will dictate whether or not we're able to achieve those recoveries in volume or exactly, what volumes we will see. We do see, as we've already mentioned, a much more competitive environment going into the third quarter on Sheet. And while we plan on bidding extremely competitive and not losing volume, whether or not there's additional volume to be gained is another matter. One other thing is that we do, and probably the whole industry benefits from is the fact that lead times are relatively short. They've been published, so I'm not going to quote what our lead times are, but the industry's lead times are fairly well-known on the Sheet side. And the scrap markets softened, and that profit will pass through immediately middle in the third quarter. And if there's any relief on pricing during the third quarter, that should flow through fairly quickly as well. But those are the potential positives. Right now, we are very cautious about our outlook on the Flat-rolled business for the third quarter. John, do you have anything you want to add?"

As far as exports go, regardless of what's going on in the domestic market, we are active on the export front, always looking for opportunities. And particularly, and that even without the additional capacity coming on stream, the industry is not running at full capacity. So it's been a long-term focus of ours to grow our exports. We were working on that and exporting quite significantly '06, '07, '08, and it continues through this downturn as well.

Thank you for joining us for our conference call and as always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. 
With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Ferriola; our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, over our Long Products group; Keith Grass, over our Raw Materials group; Ladd Hall, over our Flat-rolled and Direct Reduced Iron group; Ham Lott, over our Fabricated Products group; and Joe Stratman, who heads up our Business Development group, as well as our Beam and Plate business. 
First, and most importantly, I want to thank everyone on our team at Nucor and our Harris Steel and David J. Joseph operations for working safely, working hard and working together. In a quarter marked by historically weak construction markets and severe weather issues have impacted a number of our facilities, you delivered impressive results to our customers and to our shareholders. The talent, dedication and can-do attitude that the Nucor team brings to work each day is, and always will be, our company's greatest competitive advantage. Thank you. 
The second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share were nearly double first quarter earnings of $0.50 per share, and more than triple year-ago second quarter earnings of $0.29 per share. We are certainly encouraged by this performance, and especially the continued solid profitability of our combined construction products offerings from our Long Products, Steel Mills and Downstream Fabrication businesses. These results reinforce our conviction as to the powerful earnings leverage we will see ahead of us once the sustainable economic recovery never begins. 
Our second quarter results also highlight Nucor's position of strength in North American steel industry. We have a business model that is built around operational flexibility, product diversification, market leadership positions, financial strength and most importantly, our unique culture.  The competitive advantages I've just described allowed new quarter profit in a big way in both our core Construction Product businesses and from the pockets of strength found in a still-depressed economy. Additionally, some of our major growth initiatives undertaken during the current economic downturn are beginning to contribute to Nucor's earnings. Our Sheet Mills benefited from an upturn in pricing that began last winter and peaked this spring. 
They also experienced steady to improving demand in several important end-use markets such as energy, transportation, water heaters, and HVAC. And there was a strong contribution from the new higher value-added products that our sheet mill teams have penetrated in a big way. Our plate mills capitalized on both improved pricing and solid demand from a number of sectors, including heavy equipment, truck trailers, energy, mining and rail, and our recent product expansion to heat treat plate continued to pay off in a big way. 
Our SBQ, our special bar quality mills, including our newest, Memphis, benefited from an extremely tight SBQ market. Our SBQs have been and will continue to be successful in growing the core product range and market penetration. Our downstream Cold Finished Bar and Fastener businesses achieved strong profitability in the just-completed quarter, and while our Long Products mills are competing in very depressed construction markets, they, nevertheless, again deliver solid profits for the second quarter and first half of this year. The coiled bar mills and beam mills continued to benefit from the market leadership positions and low-cost production to unravel the breadth of product offering, which are complemented by our fabricated construction products and their coast-to-coast distribution capability. 
Quite frankly, when I review our second quarter and first half performance, I am very perplexed by how some financial market participants are so quick to claim that Nucor will under-perform its steel industry peers due to our company's heavy participation in construction markets. Our results for the second quarter and over many economic cycles tell a very different story. Again, the key to our performance and most importantly, our ability to reward our shareholders is the flexibility, diversification and sustainability found in our business model. Even better, our business model allows us to focus on the long-term and grow stronger during downturns, such as what continues to face the U.S. economy today.  Recent economic data are clear. The U.S. economy is still struggling to emerge from the great recession, and unable to move to a path of vibrant and sustainable growth. 
In June, the real or U-6 unemployment rate increased to 16.2% from 15.8% in May. Going back to March of this year, the number of unemployed people has increased by 545,000. And today's job numbers were no more encouraging. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit widened to over $50 billion in May, its highest level in more than 2.5 years. GDP growth for this year's first half is an abysmal rate of less than 2%.  This economic performance, or lack thereof, is not surprising. Our nation has failed to implement real solutions to eliminate the unsustainable structural imbalances that are dragging our economy deeper and deeper into a hole of little or no growth and extreme debt. 
As our team has stated in our previous calls and in many other forms, the way forward through a stronger and more sustainable American economy is straightforward. Our leaders need to focus on real solutions that eliminate  structural imbalances and at the same time, create where economy needs most, jobs, jobs and more jobs. This could be accomplished with our 3-point plan to achieve new energy independence, enforce rules-based free trade and thereby, revitalize U.S.-based manufacturing and rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. These steps, along with a more competitive global tax system, and the unraveling of the massive vine of new regulations that are strangling economic growth will lead to a significantly stronger economy, and provide the tax revenues needed to reduce our national debt, and still provide for those commitments made by our government to the American people. No other solution will accomplish this, and create the 25 to 30 million new jobs we need over the next 5 to 10 years. It is time to stop fiddling and to start doing the right things. 
The course of the overall economy and the steel market conditions are undoubtedly beyond our control. However, one thing is for certain and under our control. The Nucor team will meet any and all challenges head-on, and turn them into opportunities. This is exactly what our team has been doing for more than 4 decades. 
At this time, I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our second quarter results. Following Jim's comments, President and COO, John Ferriola, will report on our operations and implementation of our growth initiatives. Jim?"

Second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 per share. Our results benefited from a stronger-than-expected increase in steel-making metal margins. In the second qua",884,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 per share. Our results benefited from a stronger-than-expected increase in steel-making metal margins. In the second quarter, the metal margin expanded to $447 per ton, a gain of $82 per ton from the first quarter, and an increase of $127 per ton from the trough reached in last year's fourth quarter. This is consistent with the long-established historical experience of our steel mills, where rising scrap prices lead after a short lag, to higher metal margins. 
Our downstream fabricated construction products continued to operate in very depressed markets. Despite these difficult market conditions, metal margins improved at our Bar and Beam mills as our competitive strengths overcame the effects of relatively low utilization rates. As Dan noted, we continue to generate solid profits in our combined Steel and Fabricated Construction Products businesses. 
In the second quarter, Nucor recorded a LIFO inventory charge of $32 million. That was in-line with our first quarter LIFO charge of $31 million. Second quarter results also included $31 million of pre-operating and startup costs. That compares to first quarter costs of $128 million and $43 million in the prior year second quarter. 
Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle -- okay, I'm sorry let me restate that. That compares to first quarter cost of $28 million and $43 million in the prior-year second quarter, and that's speaking to pre-operating and startup costs.  Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle. We view pre-operating startup costs as investments to grow our long-term earnings power. For example, the investments made during the current downturn in our Memphis SBQ mill, and our Kingman, Arizona wire rod mill contributed to Nucor's improved profits in the second quarter and first half of this year. 
The second quarter effective tax rate, measured as a percent of earnings before income taxes and non-controlling interest, was 32.6%. However, after adjusting out profits belonging to our non-controlling interests business partners, the effective tax rate increases to 34.2%. 
Earnings per diluted share of $1.44 for the first half of 2011 represent a significant improvement of almost 4x from a year ago's earnings per share of $0.38. Nucor's annualized return on equity through this year's first half exceeds 12%. The Nucor team is achieving this performance in a marketplace where non-residential construction square footage for 2011 is forecasted to be 60% below the peak level reached in 2007. This return on equity performance is also achieved at the lowest financial leverage in the industry. We're excited by the opportunities ahead to deliver higher returns when the inevitable cyclical recovery finally arrives.  At the close of the second quarter, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion. In addition to that total, we hold $577 million of restricted cash on our balance sheet. The restricted cash is there to fund a significant portion of the $750 million DRI plant we are building in Louisiana.  Our healthy level of cash and short-term investments will also allow us to repay long-term debt maturities of $650 million in 2012 and $250 million in 2013. 
Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn, and does not mature until November 2012. We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the second quarter for a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 36%. Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash and short-term investments balance over $1.2 billion. Using that methodology, our net debt-to-capital ratio is 30%, and that calculation excludes the restricted cash. 
Standard & Poor's, in its July 1 report entitled U.S. and Canadian Metals and Mining Companies Strongest to Weakest, again ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among the universe of 61 companies. Nucor was the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile, due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers.  In 2011, we are continuing to invest in projects that will grow our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $500 million. John Ferriola will give you an overview of our capital projects in his remarks. 
Our outlook for the third quarter is tempered by the impact of new domestic supply and increased imports in the sheet market. For that reason, we expect third quarter earnings to be lower than the second quarter. Overall demand in end-use market such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing remain relatively strong. Those markets mainly benefit our special bar quality sheet and plate mills. The markets for downstream fabricated construction products remained challenging, but are slowly improving. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle of the final month of the quarter. 
We are very optimistic by Nucor's ability to continue building attractive and sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. We are confident that our team has the right people and the right business model to get the job done. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmakings and steel bar teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely, and of taking care of Nucor's customers. That commitment was severely tested in the second quarter, with the major challenges presented by weather-related power outages and historic river flooding. Your response to these challenges again demonstrated that Nucor is North America's most reliable steel and steel products producer. Thank you, and keep up the great work. 
The impact of these disruptions is evidenced by the decline in our steel mill capacity utilization. It dropped to 70.7% in the second quarter, which is down from 79.6% in the first quarter. By far, the biggest challenge we faced was from the loss of full electrical power at our Decatur, Alabama sheet mill for 29 days, following the devastating tornadoes that hit that area in late April. But in understanding our company and how our culture creates long term value, there is a much bigger story than any short-term loss of production, shipments and even earnings. The biggest story is how our team responded to take care of all of our customers during such a challenging period. Here is how the Nucor team, or one Nucor team responded. Immediately, after power was lost, our Decatur team worked with their sister Sheet mill divisions to successfully move all of Decatur's orders to other Nucor sheet mills. Those orders were then produced and delivered on-time. And the change in production sourcing within the Nucor sheet mill group was seamless, if not, invisible, to our customers. One order from a major coal railroad OEM customer, normally supplied by Decatur, was produced as hot-rolled coil at out our Berkeley, South Carolina mill. It was then sent back to Decatur, which had restored enough power to run the cold mill for its cold rolling. Following that, it was delivered on-time to our customer’s Alabama facility, and all of that took place within 11 days.  There are many other stories similar to this that I could share with you about how the one Nucor team pulled together throughout our company. The bottom line is that we use Nucor's unrivaled position of strength and flexibility to take care of our customers. 
We also consider the communities in which we live and work to be our valued customers. In the days immediately following the devastating tornadoes that hit Decatur and Tuscaloosa, while those mills were without power to operate, our teammates from those facilities and many other Nucor facilities sprang into action. They worked tirelessly, many on a voluntary basis to assist in the rescue and recovery efforts taking place in those hard-hit communities, using Nucor-supplied chainsaws, bobcats, generators and other equipment, much of which was sent from other Nucor divisions throughout the country. They proved through their actions Nucor's commitment to being a good steward of the communities in which we live and work. I have never been more proud of the Nucor culture and of our Nucor team. Thank you all. 
Since 2008, Nucor has invested over $5 billion of our shareholder's valuable capital, so that we can take care of our customers. Those investments enable us to take care of our customers with unrivaled operational flexibility, unmatched product diversification and an absolute commitment to always getting the job done. As Jim Frias noted, the returns from those investments are becoming more evident even in the current distressed economy. And the beat goes on with a number of major capital projects underway for 2011. 
Raw materials initiatives, included our Louisiana direct-reduced iron or DRI plant, and our natural gas working interest drilling program. We expect our increased DRI production capacity, combined with control over the necessary supply of reductant, will establish a significant and sustainable competitive advantage to Nucor's steelmaking business. Also, the David J. Joseph recycling operations are growing their earnings power, with the addition of more non-ferrous metal recovery capacity. On the steelmaking site, we continue to invest in projects that will further expand our product offerings, and allow us to move further up the value chain. For example, we are installing vacuum degassers at both our Arkansas sheet mill and our North Carolina plate mill. 
I will close my report with our thoughts on the current market conditions. Overall, demand is best-described as steady. Some markets are even experiencing some increase in real demand. The non-residential and residential construction markets continue to suffer from recessionary levels of demand. Market improvements are slow at best but importantly, service under inventories remain at relatively low levels. 
Unfortunately, excess supply in the sheet market is pressuring pricing and margins. In addition to new domestic capacity, imports of sheet steel have increased significantly. Year-to-date, through May, imports of hot-rolled and cold-rolled sheet steel have increased by 18% over year-ago level, and is increased to 1.3 million tons. Unless these supply, demand and pricing dynamics reverse themselves, the sheet market will be the most challenging for the entire industry in the third quarter. 
I will also note that we remain very concerned about imports across all product lines. It is important for the U.S. government to vigorously enforce the anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. No product line is immune from the negative impact of illegally traded -- of illegal trading, and it is important that existing anti-dumping orders be maintained and the U.S. industry to remain viable. But whatever direction the economy and the steel markets take in the coming months, the Nucor team is primed and ready to grow stronger. When Nucor grows stronger, we position our company for new higher highs in cyclical earnings power once a sustainable economic recovery occurs. Our team thanks you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Certainly, if you are in the position to be able to recover lost volume due to weather-related issues and get more tons through your facility, your production costs improve dramatically. Particularly, at the mill that was influenced most by the huge power outages that hit the southeast, which was our Decatur, Alabama plant, was down for the better part of 5 weeks, I think 29, 30 days. And we lost a few days also at our Tuscaloosa plate mill. We also had some impacts on shipping and raw material flow because of the flooding on the Mississippi that were -- impacted not only some of the steel mills, but also some of our scrap yards. So anytime you can see that type of reversal in the core, assuming weather patterns don't reappear on a similar nature, it should have a positive impact on our cost structure. Having said that, at the end of the day, the strength of the market will dictate whether or not we're able to achieve those recoveries in volume or exactly, what volumes we will see. We do see, as we've already mentioned, a much more competitive environment going into the third quarter on Sheet. And while we plan on being extremely competitive and not losing volume, whether or not there's additional volume to be gained is another matter. One of the things that we do, and probably the whole industry benefits from, is the fact that lead times are relatively short. They've been published, so I'm not going to quote what our lead times are, but the industry's lead times are fairly well-known on the Sheet side. And if scrap markets soften, and that profit will pass through immediately in the third quarter. And if there's any relief on pricing during the third quarter, that should flow through fairly quickly as well. But those are the potential positives. Right now, we are very cautious about our outlook on the Flat-rolled business for the third quarter. John, do you have anything you want to add?"

I'll now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our second quarter results, following Jim's comments, President and COO, John Ferriola will report on our operations and implementation of our growth initiatives. As you listen to the reports, I believe there are 2 very important points you need to consider. First, our third quarter and first 9 months results benefited greatly from Nucor's position as North Americas most diversified steelmaker. Product diversification is a critical building block in Nucor's business model. And our business model, with its flexibility, diversification and sustainability, is what drives Nucor's industry-leading through the cycle return on capital performance. Second, Nucor's growing stronger during its downturn. Throughout Nucor, our teams are growing long-term earnings power, in upstream Raw Materials and steelmaking and in downstream steel products. How can we do that? How can we expand while others are focused on survival? The answer is simple. Our business model in our strong balance sheet allows us to focus on a long-term and grow stronger during the downturns. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Frias, our CFO for his comments. Jim?"

Third quarter 2011 earnings of $0.57 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per diluted share. Our results increased more than eightfold over third quarter of 2010 earnings, but decreased 39% from",1010,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Third quarter 2011 earnings of $0.57 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per diluted share. Our results increased more than eightfold over third quarter of 2010 earnings, but decreased 39% from second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share. The third quarter 2011 effective tax rate, measured as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, was 29.6%. However, after adjusting our profits belonging to our noncontrolling interests business partners, the effective tax rate was 31.7%. Excluding state income tax credits recorded during the quarter, the effective tax rate would have been about 34%. However, the positive impact on earnings from the state tax credits was essentially offset by other nonrecurring items recorded in the third quarter. As we expected, third quarter results and profits were below our second quarter results. The quarter-over-quarter decline was primarily due to lower prices and metal margins for Sheet Mill Group next. The sheet market has been severely impacted by new domestic supply and increased imports. Importantly, Nucor continues to benefit from a diversified product mix. In fact, our bar mills and deck fabricating plans delivered solid improvement over their second quarter profitability. Earnings in our plate mills were essentially flat with the second quarter. However, the trend for the plate mills was down through quarter due to the impact of higher imports. Our be downstream cold-finished bar businesses experienced the small decline in quarter-over-quarter results but continued to contributes solid profits. 
Earnings per diluted share of $2.02 for the 9 months of 2011 represents a dramatic improvement from the year ago periods earnings per share of $0.46. That's an increase of 340%. Cash generated from operations is also up strongly, nearly triple the prior year period. And Nucor's annualized return on equity through this year's first 9 months is a respectable 12%. The Nucor team is achieving this performance in an economy which nonresidential construction, square footage for 2011 is forecast to be more than 60% below the peak level reached in 2007. Our returns are also achieved at the lowest financial leverage in the industry. While construction remains our largest end-user market, Nucor's unrivaled combination of product diversification and operational flexibility allows us to grow our participation in other more robust markets. These include end-use market such as automotive, heavy equipment, energy and general manufacturing. Throughout Nucor, our team mates are enjoying tremendous success developing new products, as well as other continual improvement initiatives that both reduce costs and improve quality across our entire product portfolio. It goes back to Dan's point, our to the team uses economic downturns as opportunities to grow stronger. Emerging from downturn stronger than we enter them is how we build long-term value for our shareholders. We get stronger because our financial strength allows us to invest in an attractive growth opportunities throughout economic cycle. 
At the close of the third quarter, cash and short-term investments and restricted cash totaled over $3 billion. The restricted cash is available to fund a significant portion of the plant that we are building Louisiana. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until November 2012. We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, for a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 36%. Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash and short-term investments balance over $1.2 billion. Using that methodology, our net debt-to-capital ratio is 29%. That calculation excludes the restricted cash. 
Looking ahead, our debt-to-capital ratio is expected to decline as the result of upcoming long-term debt maturities of $650 million in 2012 and $250 million in 2013. We expect to fund those maturities by drawing on our healthy liquidity position and continued strong operating cash flows. Standard & Poor's in its October 4 report entitled, North American Metals and Mining Companies Strongest to Weakest, again ranked Nucor number 1 for credit rating and credit outlook among a universe of 64 companies. Nucor was also the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers. 
In 2011, we are continuing to invest in projects that will grow our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $475 million. That is down from our prior estimate mainly due to the timing of expenditures for equipment at Nucor Steel Louisiana. John Ferriola will give you an update on some of our more significant growth projects in his remarks. 
Our outlook for the fourth quarter is tempered by the expectation of further margin compression in the sheet market due to the supply side pressures from new domestic supply and imports. We also anticipate some margin compression in the plate market due to increased imports. This margin compression for sheet and plate products may be cushioned somewhat by trend of lower scrap prices we see beginning to emerge in October. Overall, we expect Nucor's fourth quarter earnings to decline from the third quarter level. Demand in end-use market such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing remains firm, but have shown very little improvement compared to the first half of 2011. Nucor's combined construction businesses, that's Long Products steel mills and downstream operations, are expected to continue to operate profitably. This profitability has been achieved even though we have seen no real improvement in nonresidential construction markets in 2011. 
Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle of the final month of the quarter. We are excited by the opportunities ahead to deliver higher highs in earnings when the inevitable cyclical recovery finally arrives. Again, the key to our performance, and most importantly, our ability to reward our shareholders is the flexibility, diversification and sustainability found in our business model. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel product teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and to taking care of Nucor's customers. When I visit our operations, I am always impressed, and quite frankly, inspired by the work of the more than 20,000 men and women of Nucor are doing everyday to profitably grow our business for the long-term. Thank you, and please, keep it going. 
Dan and Jim both mentioned the importance of Nucor's product diversification. This is highlighted by quarter-over-quarter changes in our average selling prices. Our third quarter sheet mill average selling price declined $94 per ton from the second quarter. By contrast, our composite steel mill average sales price decreased by just $44 per ton over this period. Traumatic price erosion in the sheet market was cushioned by greater stability and the selling prices of our other steel mill products. Our bar, Beam and Plate mills combined, provided 61% of Nucor's total steel mill shipments in the third quarter. And our downstream steel products businesses realized a $20 per ton increase and they are composite third quarter average selling price from the second quarter level. 
I want to reiterate an extremely important point that investors need to understand about Nucor. Our business model, with its flexibility, diversification and sustainability, is what drives Nucor's industry-leading through the cycle return on capital performance, and our business model is getting stronger during this downturn. I will provide brief updates on some of our initiatives to grow long-term earnings power. Our team at the Memphis SBQ mill set new shipment and profitability records in the third quarter, and Memphis continues to gain product qualifications and production volumes for OEMs in the construction equipment, automotive, heavy truck, farm equipment and energy markets. Our team at Nucor Steel Nebraska successfully started up a downstream processing line that provides new growth opportunities and even higher-quality SBQ products than they currently offer. Our Sheet Mill Group continues to be successful at introducing new Value Added Products for a variety of end-use markets such as heavy equipment, energy, automotive, railcar and metal framing. 
Additional value-added steelmaking capabilities are on the horizon for Nucor. Projects underway include a normalizing line in vacuum tank degas are at our North Carolina plate mill, an equipment upgraded will allow us to reduce lighter gauge and wider product at our South Carolina sheet mill and a vacuum tank to Gasser at our Arkansas sheet mill. 
Our team achieved record scrap export container shipments during the third quarter. And DJJ continues to grow its businesses in other areas as well. Nonferrous metal facilities are being added in Tampa, Florida and Louisville, Kentucky. 
Nucor's downstream businesses are gaining market share as the result of product innovations and commercial excellence in taking care of our customers. Examples include the Vulcraft Verco groups, 3-D Building Information Modeling and the proprietary Ecospan composite floor system. Nucor's Building Systems group is growing its distribution network both in terms of quantity and quality. And our Harris Steel Rebar Fabrication business continues to expand both its footprint and its product capabilities. Our Nucor Steel Louisiana team is on schedule with construction of our 2.5 million tons per year Direct Reduced Iron or DRI facility. Start up is expected in mid-2013. Combines with our new iron DRI facility in Trinidad, the first module at Louisiana will bring us to about 2/3 of our goal to control 6 million to 7 million tons of annual capacity and high-quality scrap substitutes. Rate of control of high quality iron used assumed that our steel mills will be a very high return investment for Nucor. The projects I just discussed and many others throughout our company demonstrate how downturns create opportunities for Nucor. Opportunities for our long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. That's the reason why we are very optimistic about our teams ability to deliver higher highs in earnings on an inevitable cyclical recovery arrives. Thank you for your interest in our company. Dan?"

This legislation is exactly the kind of strong and bipartisan action our government must take to hold China accountable for its protectionist trade policies. China's failure to engage in rules based trade, a commitment it agreed to when it became a member of the World Trade Organization and achieved favored nation trading status in the United States, has destroyed many years of good paying American jobs. It is now time for the United States House of Representatives to pass this bill. It will be a big step forward in restoring free and fair competition in our global trading system. The idea that somehow this action will create a trade war is both ludicrous and ignorant, with an emphasis on ignorant. Why? Because we have been in a trade war waged by the Chinese government for 16 years, except that our government has yet to join the fight and we're losing miserably. The evidence, you say, where is it? try a greater than a $2.2 trillion trade deficit with China over the last 11 years, greater than $2.2 trillion in manufactured goods over the last 11 years. American manufacturing, American jobs and the American middle class have borne the brunt of this trade war. It is time to say, enough is enough, and act legally to hold them accountable. This is one area that the current administration has done a better job of than the previous Clinton and Bush administrations, but is still way short of what is needed. 
The second development is the U.S. International Trade Commission's Sunset review of anti-dumping and counter duly orders on custom lend plate from India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and Korea. Maintaining these orders is critical to the health of the U.S. plate market. These orders will help to ensure that illegally traded plate imports from these countries do not return to the U.S. market as they once did. Free and fair trade in the U.S. plate market is an absolute requirement for Nucor to continue investing capital and adding jobs in this business. 
These are extremely challenging and uncertain times for the overall economy and the steel industry. However, one thing is for certain, and it is very much under our control. The Nucor team will meet any and all challenges head on and turn them into opportunities. We are primed and ready to continue growing stronger. That is exactly what our team is been doing for more than 4 decades. At this time, we'd be happy to take your questions."

That complete supply-demand situation is what is dictating pricing in the marketplace today more than raw materials because raw materials have been fairly steady over the past little while so that would be the only comment I would make on that."

And but there is something that we are seeing right now that we didn't see coming into the third quarter, and that is, there seems to be some moderation in scrap pricing that may continue throughout the quarter, which will help us on margin retention. But how that all shakes out? There's a lag time between what we purchase on scrap and the pricing we pay. And then what the usage numbers are and the cost for the scrap at shop, usually, there's a 2 to 4 week lag time between purchases and usage, depending upon the inventory levels at the mills themselves. So that's a little bit of an unknown. It's floating out there, but that should be an unknown that breaks in the positive direction rather than in a negative one. So maybe that's the reason for it, Tony."

Thank you for joining us for our conference call, and as always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Ferriola; our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our Executive Vice Presidents: Jim  Darsey, Keith Grass, Ladd Hall, Ham Lott and Joe Stratman. 
First, and most importantly, I want to thank everyone on our team at Nucor and our Harris Steel and David J. Joseph operations for their excellent work in economic environment that remains extremely challenging. You are working safely and, as always, you are working together as a team to take care of our customers and our shareholders. And your work goes far beyond the significant demands of getting the job done each quarter. You are successfully implementing numerous growth initiatives that are building a stronger Nucor. By a stronger Nucor, I am describing one positioned for new higher highs and cyclical earnings power once the sustainable economic recovery arrives. Thank you, all. 
I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our second quarter results. Following Jim's comments, President and COO, John Ferriola will report on our operations and implementation of our growth initiatives. As you listen to the reports, I believe there are 2 very important points you need to consider. First, our third quarter and first 9 months results benefited greatly from Nucor's position as North America's most diversified steelmaker. Product diversification is a critical building block in Nucor's business model. And our business model, with its flexibility, diversification and sustainability, is what drives Nucor's industry-leading through the cycle return on capital performance. Second, Nucor is growing stronger during this downturn. Throughout Nucor, our teams are growing long-term earnings power, in upstream raw materials and steelmaking and in downstream steel products. How can we do that? How can we expand while others are focused on survival? The answer is simple. Our business model and our strong balance sheet allows us to focus on the long term and grow stronger during the downturns. 
At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Frias, our CFO, for his comments. Jim?"

Third quarter 2011 earnings of $0.57 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per diluted share. Our results increased more than eightfold over third quarter of 2010 earnings, but decreased 39% from",1025,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Third quarter 2011 earnings of $0.57 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per diluted share. Our results increased more than eightfold over third quarter of 2010 earnings, but decreased 39% from second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share. 
The third quarter 2011 effective tax rate, measured as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, was 29.6%. However, after adjusting our profits belonging to our noncontrolling interests business partners, the effective tax rate was 31.7%. Excluding tax -- state income tax credits recorded during the quarter, the effective tax rate would have been above 34%. However, the positive impact on earnings from the state tax credits was essentially offset by other nonrecurring items recorded in the third quarter. 
As we expected, third quarter results and profits were below our second quarter results. The quarter-over-quarter decline was primarily due to lower prices and metal margins for sheet mill products. The sheet market has been severely impacted by new domestic supply and increased imports. 
Importantly, Nucor continues to benefit from a diversified product mix. In fact, our bar mills and deck fabricating plants delivered solid improvement over their second quarter profitability. 
Earnings at our plate mills were essentially flat with the second quarter. However, the trend for the plate mills was down through the quarter due to the impact of higher imports. Our beam mill and downstream cold-finished bar businesses experienced a small decline in quarter-over-quarter results but continued to contribute solid profits. 
Earnings per diluted share of $2.02 for the 9 months of 2011 represent a dramatic improvement from the year-ago period's earnings per share of $0.46. That's an increase of 340%. Cash generated from operations is also up strongly, nearly triple the prior year period. And Nucor's annualized return on equity through this year's first 9 months is a respectable 12%. 
The Nucor team is achieving this performance in an economy which nonresidential construction square footage for 2011 is forecast to be more than 60% below the peak level reached in 2007. Our returns are also achieved at the lowest financial leverage in the industry. While construction remains our largest end-use market, Nucor's unrivaled combination of product diversification and operational flexibility allows us to grow our participation in other more robust markets. These include end-use market such as automotive, heavy equipment, energy and general manufacturing. 
Throughout Nucor, our teammates are enjoying tremendous success developing new products, as well as other continual improvement initiatives that both reduce costs and improve quality across our entire product portfolio. It goes back to Dan's point, that our to the team uses economic downturns as opportunities to grow stronger. Emerging from downturn stronger than we enter them is how we build long-term value for our shareholders. We get stronger because our financial strength allows us to invest in an attractive growth opportunities throughout the economic cycle. 
At the close of the third quarter, cash and short-term investments and restricted cash totaled over $3 billion. The restricted cash is available to fund a significant portion of the DRI plant that we are building in Louisiana. 
Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until November 2012. We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the second quarter for a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 36%. Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash and short-term investments balance over $1.2 billion. Using that methodology, our net debt-to-capital ratio is 29%. That calculation excludes the restricted cash. 
Looking ahead, our debt-to-capital ratio is expected to decline as the result of upcoming long-term debt maturities of $650 million in 2012 and $250 million in 2013. We expect to fund those maturities by drawing on our healthy liquidity position and continued strong operating cash flows. Standard & Poor's in its October 4 report entitled, North American Metals and Mining Companies Strongest to Weakest, again ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among a universe of 64 companies. Nucor was also the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers. 
In 2011, we are continuing to invest in projects that will grow our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $475 million. That is down from our prior estimate mainly due to the timing of expenditures for equipment at Nucor Steel Louisiana. John Ferriola will give you an update on some of our more significant growth projects in his remarks. 
Our outlook for the fourth quarter is tempered by the expectation of further margin compression in the sheet market due to the supply side pressures from new domestic supply and imports. We also anticipate some margin compression in the plate market due to increased imports. This margin compression for sheet and plate products may be cushioned somewhat by trend of lower scrap prices we see beginning to emerge in October. 
Overall, we expect Nucor's fourth quarter earnings to decline from the third quarter level. Demand in end-use market such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing remains firm, but have shown very little improvement compared to the first half of 2011. Nucor's combined construction businesses, that's Long Products, Steel Mills and downstream operations, are expected to continue to operate profitably. This profitability has been achieved even though we have seen no real improvement in nonresidential construction markets in 2011. 
Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle of the final quarter -- excuse me, around the middle of the final month of the quarter. We are excited by the opportunities ahead to deliver higher highs and earnings when the inevitable cyclical recovery finally arrives. Again, the key to our performance, and most importantly, our ability to reward our shareholders is the flexibility, diversification and sustainability found in our business model. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel product teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and to taking care of Nucor's customers. When I visit our operations, I am always impressed and, quite frankly, inspired by the work of the more than 20,000 men and women of Nucor are doing every day to profitably grow our business for the long term. Thank you, and please, keep it going. 
Dan and Jim both mentioned the importance of Nucor's product diversification. This is highlighted by quarter-over-quarter changes in our average selling prices. Our third quarter sheet mill average selling price declined $94 per ton from the second quarter. By contrast, our composite steel mill average sales price decreased by just $44 per ton over this period. Traumatic price erosion in the sheet market was cushioned by greater stability and the selling prices of our other steel mill products. Our bar, beam and plate mills combined, provided 61% of Nucor's total steel mill shipments in the third quarter. And our downstream steel products businesses realized a $20 per ton increase and they are composite third quarter average selling price from the second quarter level. 
I want to reiterate an extremely important point that investors need to understand about Nucor. Our business model, with its flexibility, diversification and sustainability, is what drives Nucor's industry-leading through the cycle return on capital performance, and our business model is getting stronger during this downturn. I will provide brief updates on some of our initiatives to grow long-term earnings power. Our team at the Memphis SBQ mill set new shipment and profitability records in the third quarter, and Memphis continues to gain product qualifications and production volumes for OEMs in the construction equipment, automotive, heavy truck, farm equipment and energy markets. Our team at Nucor Steel Nebraska successfully started up a downstream processing line that provides new growth opportunities and even higher-quality SBQ products than they currently offer. Our Sheet Mill Group continues to be successful at introducing new value-added products for a variety of end-use markets such as heavy equipment, energy, automotive, railcar and metal framing. 
Additional value-added steelmaking capabilities are on the horizon for Nucor. Projects underway include a normalizing line and vacuum tank degasser at our North Carolina plate mill, an equipment upgrade that will allow us to reduce lighter gauge and wider product at our South Carolina sheet mill and a vacuum tank degasser at our Arkansas sheet mill. 
Our David J. Joseph team achieved record scrap export container shipments during the third quarter. And DJJ continues to grow its businesses in other areas as well. Nonferrous metals flotation facilities are being added in Tampa, Florida and Louisville, Kentucky. 
Nucor's downstream businesses are gaining market share as the result of product innovations and commercial excellence in taking care of our customers. Examples include the Vulcraft/Verco Groups, 3D Building Information Modeling and the proprietary Ecospan composite floor system. Nucor Building Systems group is growing its distribution network both in terms of quantity and quality. And our Harris Steel Rebar Fabrication business continues to expand both its footprint and its product capabilities. Our Nucor Steel Louisiana team is on schedule with the construction of our 2.5 million tons per year direct reduced iron or DRI facility. Start-up is expected in mid-2013. Combined with our new iron DRI facility in Trinidad, the first module at Louisiana will bring us to about 2/3 of our goal to control 6 million to 7 million tons of annual capacity in high-quality scrap substitutes. Greater control of high-quality iron use assumed that our steel mills will be a very high-return investment for Nucor. 
The projects I just discussed and many others throughout our company demonstrate how downturns create opportunities for Nucor; opportunities for our long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. That's the reason why we are very optimistic about our teams' ability to deliver higher highs and earnings when the inevitable, cyclical recovery arrives. Thank you for your interest in our company. Dan?"

It has been unable to move to a path of vibrant and sustainable growth. This is not surprising. Our nation has failed to implement real solutions to eliminate the unsustainable structural imbalances that are driving our economy deeper and deeper into a hole of little or no growth. Our team has been adamant, consistent over the past 3 years with our views on the way forward to a stronger and more sustainable American economy. And we require real solutions that eliminate the structural imbalances and, at the same time, create what our economy needs most, jobs, jobs and more jobs. This can be accomplished with a multi-pronged plan for the U.S. to achieve new energy independence, enforce rules-based trade, to build our crumbling infrastructure, reform and simplify the tax code and reduce the burden of excessive regulation on our economy. 
I would like to comment on 2 developments regarding enforcement of our nation's trade laws. First, the United States Senate last week passed a bipartisan currency exchange rate oversight reformat of 2011. This legislation is exactly the kind of strong and bipartisan action our government must take to hold China accountable for its protectionist trade policies. China's failure to engage in rules-based trade, a commitment it agreed to when it became a member of the World Trade Organization and achieved favored nation trading status in the United States, has destroyed millions of good paying American jobs. It is now time for the United States House of Representatives to pass this bill. It will be a big step forward in restoring free and fair competition in our global trading system. The idea that somehow this action will create a trade war is both ludicrous and ignorant, with an emphasis on ignorant. Why? Because we have been in a trade war waged by the Chinese government for 16 years, except that our government has yet to join the fight and we are losing miserably. The evidence, you say, where is it? Try a greater than a $2.2 trillion trade deficit with China over the last 11 years, greater than $2.2 trillion in manufactured goods over the last 11 years. American manufacturing, American jobs and the American middle class have borne the brunt of this trade war. It is time to say, enough is enough, and act legally to hold them accountable. This is one area that the current administration has done a better job of than the previous Clinton and Bush administrations, but it is still way short of what is needed. 
The second development is the U.S. International Trade Commission's Sunset Review of anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders on cut-to-length plate from India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and Korea. Maintaining these orders is critical to the health of the U.S. plate market. These orders will help to ensure that illegally traded plate imports from these countries do not return to the U.S. market as they once did. Free and fair trade in the U.S. plate market is an absolute requirement for Nucor to continue investing capital and adding jobs in this business. 
These are extremely challenging and uncertain times for the overall economy and the steel industry. However, one thing is for certain, and it is very much under our control. The Nucor team will meet any and all challenges head on and turn them into opportunities. We are primed and ready to continue growing stronger. That is exactly what our team has been doing for more than 4 decades. 
At this time, we'd be happy to take your questions."

And -- but there is something that we are seeing right now that we didn't see coming into the third quarter, and that is, there seemed to be moderation in the scrap pricing that may continue throughout the quarter, which will help us on margin retention. But how that all shakes out? There's a lag time between what we purchase on scrap and the pricing we pay and then what the usage numbers are and the costs for the scrap that show up. Usually, there's a 2- to 4-week lag time between purchases and usage, depending upon the inventory levels at the mills themselves. So that's a little bit of an unknown. It's floating out there, but that should be an unknown that breaks in a positive direction rather than in a negative one. So maybe that's the reason for it, Tony."

Thank you for joining us for our conference call, and as always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Ferriola; our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our Executive Vice Presidents: Jim  Darsey, Keith Grass, Ladd Hall, Ham Lott and Joe Stratman. 
First, and most importantly, I want to thank everyone on our teams at Nucor and our Harris Steel and David J. Joseph operations for their excellent work in economic environment that remains extremely challenging. You are working safely and, as always, you are working together as a team to take care of our customers and our shareholders. And your work goes far beyond the significant demands of getting the job done each quarter. You are successfully implementing numerous growth initiatives that are building a stronger Nucor. By a stronger Nucor, I am describing one positioned for new higher highs and cyclical earnings power once the sustainable economic recovery arrives. Thank you, all. 
I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our second quarter results. Following Jim's comments, President and COO, John Ferriola will report on our operations and implementation of our growth initiatives. As you listen to the reports, I believe there are 2 very important points you need to consider. First, our third quarter and first 9 months results benefited greatly from Nucor's position as North America's most diversified steelmaker. Product diversification is a critical building block in Nucor's business model. And our business model, with its flexibility, diversification and sustainability, is what drives Nucor's industry-leading through the cycle return on capital performance. Second, Nucor is growing stronger during this downturn. Throughout Nucor, our teams are growing long-term earnings power, in upstream raw materials and steelmaking and in downstream steel products. How can we do that? How can we expand while others are focused on survival? The answer is simple. Our business model and our strong balance sheet allows us to focus on the long term and grow stronger during the downturns. 
At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Frias, our CFO, for his comments. Jim?"
184945,141162411,175064,"Nucor Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Third quarter 2011 earnings of $0.57 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per diluted share. Our results increased more than eightfold over third quarter of 2010 earnings, but decreased 39% from",1023,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Third quarter 2011 earnings of $0.57 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per diluted share. Our results increased more than eightfold over third quarter of 2010 earnings, but decreased 39% from second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.94 per diluted share. 
The third quarter 2011 effective tax rate, measured as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, was 29.6%. However, after adjusting our profits belonging to our noncontrolling interests business partners, the effective tax rate was 31.7%. Excluding tax -- state income tax credits recorded during the quarter, the effective tax rate would have been above 34%. However, the positive impact on earnings from the state tax credits was essentially offset by other nonrecurring items recorded in the third quarter. 
As we expected, third quarter results and profits were below our second quarter results. The quarter-over-quarter decline was primarily due to lower prices and metal margins for sheet mill products. The sheet market has been severely impacted by new domestic supply and increased imports. 
Importantly, Nucor continues to benefit from a diversified product mix. In fact, our bar mills and deck fabricating plants delivered solid improvement over their second quarter profitability. 
Earnings at our plate mills were essentially flat with the second quarter. However, the trend for the plate mills was down through the quarter due to the impact of higher imports. Our beam mill and downstream cold-finished bar businesses experienced a small decline in quarter-over-quarter results but continued to contribute solid profits. 
Earnings per diluted share of $2.02 for the 9 months of 2011 represent a dramatic improvement from the year-ago period's earnings per share of $0.46. That's an increase of 340%. Cash generated from operations is also up strongly, nearly triple the prior year period. And Nucor's annualized return on equity through this year's first 9 months is a respectable 12%. 
The Nucor team is achieving this performance in an economy which nonresidential construction square footage for 2011 is forecast to be more than 60% below the peak level reached in 2007. Our returns are also achieved at the lowest financial leverage in the industry. While construction remains our largest end-use market, Nucor's unrivaled combination of product diversification and operational flexibility allows us to grow our participation in other more robust markets. These include end-use markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, energy and general manufacturing. 
Throughout Nucor, our teammates are enjoying tremendous success developing new products, as well as other continual improvement initiatives that both reduce costs and improve quality across our entire product portfolio. It goes back to Dan's point, that our team uses economic downturns as opportunities to grow stronger. Emerging from downturns stronger than we enter them is how we build long-term value for our shareholders. We get stronger because our financial strength allows us to invest in an attractive growth opportunities throughout the economic cycle. 
At the close of the third quarter, cash and short-term investments and restricted cash totaled over $3 billion. The restricted cash is available to fund a significant portion of the DRI plant that we are building in Louisiana. 
Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until November 2012. We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the second quarter for a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 36%. Moody's has reported that our debt-to-capital ratio will be viewed on a net debt basis for any cash and short-term investments balance over $1.2 billion. Using that methodology, our net debt-to-capital ratio is 29%. That calculation excludes the restricted cash. 
Looking ahead, our debt-to-capital ratio is expected to decline as a result of upcoming long-term debt maturities of $650 million in 2012 and $250 million in 2013. We expect to fund those maturities by drawing on our healthy liquidity position and continued strong operating cash flows. Standard & Poor's, in its October 4 report entitled ""North American Metals and Mining Companies Strongest to Weakest,"" again ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among a universe of 64 companies. Nucor was also the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers. 
In 2011, we are continuing to invest in projects that will grow our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2011 capital spending of approximately $475 million. That is down from our prior estimate mainly due to the timing of expenditures for equipment at Nucor Steel Louisiana. John Ferriola will give you an update on some of our more significant growth projects in his remarks. 
Our outlook for the fourth quarter is tempered by the expectation of further margin compression in the sheet market due to the supply side pressures from new domestic supply and imports. We also anticipate some margin oppression in the plate market due to increased imports. This margin oppression for sheet and plate products may be cushioned somewhat by trend of lower scrap prices we see beginning to emerge in October. 
Overall, we expect Nucor's fourth quarter earnings to decline from the third quarter level. Demand in end-use market such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing remains firm, but have shown very little improvement compared to the first half of 2011. Nucor's combined construction businesses, that's Long Products, Steel Mills and downstream operations, are expected to continue to operate profitably. This profitability has been achieved even though we have seen no real improvement in nonresidential construction markets in 2011. 
Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle of the final quarter -- excuse me, around the middle of the final month of the quarter. We are excited by the opportunities ahead to deliver higher highs and earnings when the inevitable cyclical recovery finally arrives. Again, the key to our performance, and most importantly, our ability to reward our shareholders is the flexibility, diversification and sustainability found in our business model. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?"

Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel product teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and to taking care of Nucor's customers. When I visit our operations, I am always impressed and, quite frankly, inspired by the work of the more than 20,000 men and women of Nucor are doing every day to profitably grow our business for the long term. Thank you, and please, keep it going. 
Dan and Jim both mentioned the importance of Nucor's product diversification. This is highlighted by quarter-over-quarter changes in our average selling prices. Our third quarter sheet mill average selling price declined $94 per ton from the second quarter. By contrast, our composite steel mill average sales price decreased by just $44 per ton over this period. Traumatic price erosion in the sheet market was cushioned by greater stability and the selling prices of our other steel mill products. Our bar, beam and plate mills, combined, provided 61% of Nucor's total steel mill shipments in the third quarter. And our downstream steel products businesses realized a $20 per ton increase and they are composite third quarter average selling price from the second quarter level. 
I want to reiterate an extremely important point that investors need to understand about Nucor. Our business model, with its flexibility, diversification and sustainability, is what drives Nucor's industry-leading through the cycle return on capital performance, and our business model is getting stronger during this downturn. I will provide brief updates on some of our initiatives to grow long-term earnings power. Our team at the Memphis SBQ mill set new shipment and profitability records in the third quarter, and Memphis continues to gain product qualifications and production volumes for OEMs in the construction equipment, automotive, heavy truck, farm equipment and energy markets. Our team at Nucor Steel Nebraska successfully started up a downstream processing line that provides new growth opportunities and even higher-quality SBQ products than they currently offer. Our Sheet Mill Group continues to be successful at introducing new value-added products for a variety of end-use markets such as heavy equipment, energy, automotive, railcar and metal framing. 
Additional value-added steelmaking capabilities are on the horizon for Nucor. Projects underway include a normalizing line and vacuum tank degasser at our North Carolina plate mill, an equipment upgrade that will allow us to produce lighter gauge and wider product at our South Carolina sheet mill and a vacuum tank degasser at our Arkansas sheet mill. 
Our David J. Joseph team achieved record scrap export container shipments during the third quarter. And DJJ continues to grow its businesses in other areas as well. Nonferrous metals flotation facilities are being added in Tampa, Florida and Louisville, Kentucky. 
Nucor's downstream businesses are gaining market share as the result of product innovations and commercial excellence in taking care of our customers. Examples include the Vulcraft/Verco Groups, 3D Building Information Modeling and the proprietary Ecospan composite floor system. Nucor Building Systems group is growing its distribution network both in terms of quantity and quality. And our Harris Steel Rebar Fabrication business continues to expand both its footprint and its product capabilities. Our Nucor Steel Louisiana team is on schedule with the construction of our 2.5 million tons per year direct reduced iron or DRI facility. Start-up is expected in mid-2013. Combined with our new iron DRI facility in Trinidad, the first module at Louisiana will bring us to about 2/3 of our goal to control 6 million to 7 million tons of annual capacity in high-quality scrap substitutes. Greater control of high-quality iron use consumed at our steel mills will be a very high-return investment for Nucor. 
The projects I just discussed and many others throughout our company demonstrate how downturns create opportunities for Nucor; opportunities for our long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. That's the reason why we are very optimistic about our teams' ability to deliver higher highs and earnings when the inevitable, cyclical recovery arrives. Thank you for your interest in our company. Dan?"

It has been unable to move to a path of vibrant and sustainable growth. This is not surprising. Our nation has failed to implement real solutions to eliminate the unsustainable structural imbalances that are driving our economy deeper and deeper into a hole of little or no growth. Our team has been adamant and consistent over the past 3 years with our views on the way forward to a stronger and more sustainable American economy. And we require real solutions that eliminate the structural imbalances and, at the same time, create what our economy needs most: jobs, jobs and more jobs. This can be accomplished with a multi-pronged plan for the U.S. to achieve new energy independence, enforce rules-based free trade, to build our crumbling infrastructure, reform and simplify the tax code and reduce the burden of excessive regulation on our economy. 
I would like to comment on 2 developments regarding enforcement of our nation's trade laws. First, the United States Senate last week passed a bipartisan currency exchange rate oversight reformat of 2011. This legislation is exactly the kind of strong and bipartisan action our government must take to hold China accountable for its protectionist trade policies. China's failure to engage in rules-based trade, a commitment it agreed to when it became a member of the World Trade Organization and achieved favored nation trading status in the United States, has destroyed millions of good paying American jobs. It is now time for the United States House of Representatives to pass this bill. It will be a big step forward in restoring free and fair competition in our global trading system. The idea that somehow this action will create a trade war is both ludicrous and ignorant, with an emphasis on ignorant. Why? Because we have been in a trade war waged by the Chinese government for 16 years, except that our government has yet to join the fight and we are losing miserably. The evidence, you say, where is it? Try a greater than a $2.2 trillion trade deficit with China over the last 11 years, greater than $2.2 trillion in manufactured goods over the last 11 years. American manufacturing, American jobs and the American middle class have borne the brunt of this trade war. It is time to say enough is enough, and act legally to hold them accountable. This is one area that the current administration has done a better job of than the previous Clinton and Bush administrations, but it is still way short of what is needed. 
The second development is the U.S. International Trade Commission's Sunset Review of anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders on cut-to-length plate from India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and Korea. Maintaining these orders is critical to the health of the U.S. plate market. These orders will help to ensure that illegally traded plate imports from these countries do not return to the U.S. market as they once did. Free and fair trade in the U.S. plate market is an absolute requirement for Nucor to continue investing capital and adding jobs in this business. 
These are extremely challenging and uncertain times for the overall economy and the steel industry. However, one thing is for certain, and it is very much under our control. The Nucor team will meet any and all challenges head on and turn them into opportunities. We are primed and ready to continue growing stronger. That is exactly what our team has been doing for more than 4 decades. 
At this time, we'd be happy to take your questions."

But how that all shakes out? There's a lag time between what we purchase on scrap and the pricing we pay and then what the usage numbers are and the costs for the scrap that show up. Usually, there's a 2- to 4-week lag time between purchases and usage, depending upon the inventory levels at the mills themselves. So that's a little bit of an unknown. It's floating out there, but that should be an unknown that breaks in a positive direction rather than in a negative one. So maybe that's the reason for it, Tony."

How far it actually takes us remains to be seen yet, and we are open to opportunities for growth both on the iron side and the DRI side and the scrap side. So that's really all I would want to comment on that right now in terms of what might be going on right now. When we have something to talk about, we're certainly present it."

I mean, obviously, if we were going to get into producing pipe products, seamless or otherwise, that would require new equipment because we're not in that business today.

So it's something that you constantly are looking at because the size of that, potential size of that market could be quite significant. So we haven't ruled out getting into that business ourselves.

So I would not say that it's in specific short terms related to what's going on in the equity markets. Certainly, what's going on in the equity markets and what's not going on with the leadership in our government and in Washington, that all weighs very heavily on the private sector, including the steel sector because as the economy goes, so does steel consumption. And in a very, very strong way, the additional increases of steel consumption don't take place until we're growing north of 2.5%. So that's the big issue. And the market -- the equity markets are just reacting to the tremendous uncertainty. And on top of that, it's more like the craps table at Vegas than it is a true investment situation in Wall Street anymore. So that adds its own degree of complexity in. Thank goodness that -- as rough as things are in the steel business, we haven't degenerated to that level yet."
