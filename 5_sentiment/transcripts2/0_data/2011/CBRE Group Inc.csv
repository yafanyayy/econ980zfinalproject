As dire as things appeared two years ago, they now seem equally positive and exciting. We’re at that point in the cycle when all fundamentals are positive and rapidly improving and when everything seems possible. On today’s call, we will discuss our very strong results for Q4 and full-year 2010.
It was undoubtedly one of the best years in CBRE’s 100-plus year history and at the moment our near-term future looks even brighter. I’m equally sure many of you would like us to comment on our current M&A activities. Like you, we have read the press speculation and heard the market rumors. However, we have had a longstanding policy not to discuss rumors and speculation on this topic. Accordingly, M&A is not a subject we can or will address today. In fairness to you, I want to make this statement upfront.
So, please turn to slide #4, for the fourth-quarter of 2010, we posted very strong revenue and earnings growth in our business. In fact, normalized EBITDA for Q4 2010 and for the full-year 2010 were the second best ever in company’s history. This performance was driven by the continued recovery of the commercial real estate services industry, combined with strong execution and our proven discipline in managing the return of related expenses.
Our fourth-quarter total revenue was $1.7 billion, a 27% increase over the fourth-quarter of 2009. As was the case, for most of 2010, our revenue growth was led by three lines of business.
Investment sales where revenues were up 40% in Q4 2010 with all regions posting double-digit growth, leasing revenue, which increased 35% led by activity in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and outsourcing, which posted a 10% revenue increase led by the Americas.
Total company normalized EBITDA was $253 million, a 27% increase over the fourth-quarter of 2009. This translated into a normalized EBITDA margin of 15.3% in the fourth-quarter of 2010. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth-quarter of 2010 increased 29% to $0.36 versus $0.28 in Q4 2009.
As we entered 2010, given our concerns around the economy and its impact on the performance of our business, we significantly reduced target bonus levels and 401(k) matching for 2010. Throughout the year, we did not restore these expenses even as our performance improved.
However, based on our performance this past quarter and full year performance, which significantly exceeded our original planning, in the fourth-quarter we substantially restored bonus target levels and also reinstated a partial 401(k) match for our employees retroactively for the full-year 2010. These actions resulted in additional expense of approximately $30.0 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth-quarter.
We believe that in light of the company’s superb financial performance this year, these actions were absolutely appropriate and necessary for our business and our employees who made significant personal sacrifices through the downturn to help us reduce $600 million of costs.
Many of the individuals benefited by bonus restoration are the same people who received no incentive compensation in 2008 and 50% of their target incentive compensation in 2009. Even with these actions, the company exceeded its financial goals for 2010 and increased its industry leading normalized EBITDA margin by 240 basis points for the full year.
I want to also note that our 2010 bonus expense was outsized, because our financial performance significantly exceeded plan due to the unanticipated rate of recovery for our business.
For 2011, we believe, US bonus expense is likely to be materially less than 2010 as bonus targets will take into account the anticipated improved financial performance of the business in a more hospitable environment. The amount of additional US bonus expense for 2010 due to over-performance was approximately $25.0 million.
On past calls we noted that as we felt more confident in the commercial real estate recovery, we would likely reinstate 20% to 25% of the $600 million in cost cuts we implemented through the downturn, including the bonus and benefit costs, which we brought back in the fourth-quarter, we have now restored about $1.0 million of the anticipated $120 million to $150 million of such costs.
Although we believe we’ll be prudent to reinstate the remaining $20.0 million to $50.0 million of these costs in order to drive our business, we will continue to control expenses commensurate with revenue growth to ensure we meet our financial goal of industry-leading EBITDA margins.
We are very pleased to be able to show such strong EBITDA and EPS performance for the fourth-quarter and the full-year 2010, while also being able to reward our employees for their terrific 2010 results and their dedication in bringing us out of the downturn a much stronger company.
Our strong performance in 2010 and the underlying momentum in the business increases our confidence that we are in the early days of what ought to be a protracted and healthy recovery an expansion cycle in commercial real estate. This firm, the preeminent firm in our industry, has never been positioned better to exploit a recovering marketplace.
Some of the more noteworthy transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are listed on slide #5. As usual I’ll not go through them individually, but we have included them to show some key business wins.
With that I’ll now turn the call over to Gil to go over our financial results in detail. Gil?

Revenue was $1.7 billion for the fourth-quarter of 2010, up 27% from last year, excluding discontinued operations. This increase resulted from improvements in sales, leasing, outsourcing, appraisal and valuation, and commercial mortgage brokerage activities. Normalized EBITDA was also up 27% to $253.1 million in the quarter from a $199 million in the fourth-quarter of 2009, delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 15.3% for the fourth-quarter of 2010.
Our cost of services as a percentage of revenue was up 80 basis points to 56.4% in the fourth-quarter of 2010 versus 55.6% in the fourth-quarter of last year. This increase mainly resulted from the full restoration of commission rates and salaries to pre-recession levels at the beginning of the third-quarter as well as selected hiring of key professionals as business improved.
In the fourth-quarter of 2010, operating expenses as a percent of total revenue dropped slightly by 10 basis points to 31.6% versus 31.7% in the fourth-quarter of 2009 despite the bonus and 401(k) restoration of approximately $30.0 million and carried interest compensation expense related to future periods of $13.8 million.
Fourth quarter 2010 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.30 versus $0.21 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.36, up 29% versus $0.28 in the fourth-quarter of 2009. Our fourth-quarter 2010 tax rate was 38%, driven by unanticipated true ups upon filing of certain state tax returns in the US and foreign statutory audit settlements.
Please turn to slide #7; leasing was our largest service line in the fourth-quarter of 2010 posting a 35% increase versus the fourth-quarter of 2009. It represented 37% of total company revenue in the current year quarter. Property and facilities management was our second largest service line in the fourth-quarter of 2010 representing 29% of total revenue in the quarter.
Sales revenue rose 40% in the fourth-quarter of 2010 versus a year ago following a strong increase posted in the fourth-quarter of 2009 of 24%. The continued strength of Class A property sales coupled with volume increases in other property classes fueled growth in the current year fourth-quarter.
Appraisal and valuation revenue was up 19% in the fourth-quarter of 2010 as compared to the fourth-quarter of 2009. This was driven by strong capital market’s activities in the quarter.
Commercial mortgage brokerage posted an increase of 233%, driven by loan originations and strong US government sponsored entity activity as well as improvement on the part of traditional and conduit lenders.
Global Investment Management revenue increased 87% year-over-year driven by all sources of revenue in that business including management fees, acquisition fees, and carried interest. Development services revenue was down 23%.
Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees, and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue represented approximately 50% of total revenue for the fourth-quarter of 2010.
Please turn to slide #8; the outsourcing business grew nicely in the fourth-quarter, with revenue rising 10%. This was driven by the strong new account growth and client expansion we experienced throughout 2010. In the fourth-quarter, we signed contracts with 18 new accounts. We renewed nine contracts and we expanded our service offering for seven existing outsourcing clients.
Our performance this quarter was led by the Americas, which posted its strongest growth rate in the last nine quarters. The total of 34 contracts again matches our strongest quarter ever for most contracts signed in a quarter, which was the second-quarter of 2010.
For the full year 2010, 121 total contracts were signed, up 38% from the 88 contracts signed in 2009. This included a record 62 new clients for the full year of 2010.
Overall, our global portfolio of commercial property and corporate facilities under management totaled 2.6 billion square feet at the end of the fourth-quarter, an increase of 18% for the full year 2010.
Slide #9 demonstrates the stabilizing or improving vacancy rates and absorption in 2010 and our forecasted improvements for 2011 and 2012. Average national cap rates improved meaningfully in 2010 driven by high profile and Class A property sales mostly in larger markets.
These top-tier assets are trading actively at cap rates between 4.75% and 6% and financing is available at attractive rates. This strength is also spreading to other property classes as invested appetite for yield has increased.
Please turn to slide #10, the recovery of the US sales market continued in the fourth-quarter of 2010 as our Americas sales revenue for the quarter increased 66% on a year-over-year basis.
Our market share totaled 14.8% of all activity for the full year 2010 which gave us the top position for the tenth year in a row according to real capital analytics.
Our Americas leasing revenue posted a tremendous 45% increase in the fourth-quarter of 2010 as compared to the fourth-quarter of 2009, increasing to $419 million. Nationally, the office vacancy rate decreased by 20 basis points to 16.4%. Net absorption in US office product was positive for the third straight quarter.
Please turn to slide #11, our investment sales revenue in EMEA increased by 19% in the fourth-quarter of 2010 as compared to the fourth-quarter of 2009. This increase comes on top of a 29% investment sales increase from the fourth-quarter of 2008 to the fourth-quarter of 2009. Actively here was led by the U.K. and France.
CBRE’s revenue from leasing in EMEA grew 6% in the fourth-quarter of 2010 versus the fourth-quarter of 2009. This is consistent with relatively modest economic growth in the euro zone in the fourth-quarter. Activity here was led by the U.K.
Please turn to slide #12, CBRE sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased by 12% in the fourth-quarter of 2010 versus the fourth-quarter of 2009. The increase was notable, given it was made on top of an 88% increase from the fourth-quarter of 2009 versus the fourth-quarter of 2008. CBRE’s leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew 34% in the fourth-quarter versus the fourth-quarter of 2009. The strongest growth came from Australia, China, India, and Japan.
Please turn to slide #13; revenue for the Development Services segment was $19.6 million in the fourth-quarter of 2010 versus $24.5 million in the fourth-quarter of 2009, partially due to lower rental revenues resulting from asset dispositions.
Operating results for the fourth-quarter of 2010 for this segment included normalized EBITDA of $8.6 million and a meaningful improvement over the fourth-quarter of 2009 normalized EBITDA of $6.3 million. This improvement in normalized EBITDA was driven by gains from property sales.
At December 31, 2010, in-process development totaled $4.9 billion even with the $4.9 billion at September 30, 2010, and up slightly from $4.7 billion at year-end 2009.
The pipeline at December 31, 2010, totaled $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion at September 30, 2010, and $900 million at year-end 2009. The combined total of $6.1 billion is up 9% from year-end 2009. At the end of the fourth-quarter, our equity co-investments in the Development Services business totaled $62 million.
Please turn to slide #14; Global Investment Management revenue was up 106% to $79.8 million in the fourth-quarter of 2010 from $38.7 million in the fourth-quarter of 2009.
The company realized $19.9 million of carried interest revenue in the fourth-quarter from a liquidating fund versus no carried interest revenue in the fourth-quarter of 2009. Higher acquisition fees and fees for assets under management also contributed to the revenue increase.
Assets under management totaled $37.6 billion at the end of the fourth-quarter 2010, which was up 8% compared to the fourth-quarter 2009 and 5% versus the third-quarter of 2010.
During the fourth-quarter, we completed $1.3 billion of acquisitions, $0.5 billion of portfolio takeovers, and approximately $1.1 billion of dispositions globally. Currency fluctuations decreased the portfolio by $200 million.
Year-to-date 2010, we have raised new capital of approximately $4.8 billion and had approximately $2 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our current investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $99 million.
Our Global Investment Management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on slide #15. In the fourth-quarter of 2010, we wrote down only $1.2 million of investments.
In the fourth-quarter of 2010 we recognized $19.8 million of carried interest expense of which $6 million pertain to the fund that liquidated during the quarter with the remainder relating to future periods. In the fourth-quarter of 2009, we reversed a net $200 million of carried interest compensation expense accrual, that’s $200,000 of carried interest compensation expense accrual.
As of December 31, 2010, the company maintained a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $20 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue.
EBITDA was positively impacted by carried interest revenue, higher acquisitions fees, and fees for assets under management, a reverse provision for doubtful accounts related to a specific fund as well as approximately $7.6 million associated with the consolidation of several properties due to a change in accounting regulations effective January 1, 2010, which had no bottom-line impact. This business operated at a normalized EBITDA margin of 52% for the fourth-quarter of 2010 and 32% for the full year of 2010.
Please turn to slide #16; the left side of slide #16 shows our amortization and debt maturity schedule for the period ended September 30, 2010. The right side of the slide illustrates our outstanding debt following our debt refinancing in the fourth-quarter.
During the fourth-quarter we retired all prior outstanding term loans using new term loans A due in 2015 and term loans B due in 2016 totaling $650 million, $350 million of senior and secured noted maturing in 2020, and approximately $475 million of cash. We also increased the revolving credit facility to $700 million and extended its maturity to May 2015.
Please turn to slide #17, excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and mortgage brokerage warehouse facility, our total net debt at the end of 2010 was $943 million. This represents a reduction of 33% or $461 million since December 31, 2009.
At December 31, 2010, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 6.5%, which came down from approximately 7% at the end of the third-quarter benefiting from our refinancing activities during the fourth-quarter.
Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 0.94 times at the end of the fourth-quarter of 2010. Our total company net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 1.37 times, which remains below our current target of two times.
I’ll now turn the call back over to Brett.

We believe we are in the early stages of recovery in the commercial real estate cycle. It is reasonable to expect meaningful growth in 2011, although we do not expect growth rates comparable to those experienced in 2010 as we bounced off an abnormally little bottom in this cycle.
Investment sales and leasing should continue to show year-over-year improvements, although comparisons of course will be a bit tougher. Outsourcing growth trends and our accelerated contract win rate leads us quite optimistic for 2011. We are now more optimistic regarding our expectations for Global Investment Management.
Based on the rate at which we brought back cost in 2010, we expect the growth in cost to be much slower in 2011. We are committed to managing cost commensurate with revenue growth to ensure we maintained industry leading margins.
We know there is significant operating leverage in our business and still believe getting to our goal of 20% EBITDA margins at the peak of the cycle, is quite achievable. We intend to actively manage the business to get there.
Taking all this into account, for the full-year 2011, the second year of what we expect to be a multi-year recovery, we expect earnings to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.05 per share.
And operator, with that we’ll now open for questions.

All the fundamentals that you and I watched are certainly pointing now strong positive and we’ll get even more indications from the business everyday that this business is really in a pretty terrific place right now, so, that should without any extraneous negative impacts on the business should allow us to accrete margins fairly handsomely year-over-year through the cycle and that would be our expectation for 2011.
We mentioned in our deck that we had some items come through in Q4, which brought down margins a bit, notwithstanding, of course, I know it’s not lost on our collars, we continue both in the down market over the last four years and the up market the last year and a half to have industry leading margins by quite a distance, something that we intend to hold on for a long time.

But those segments that we do participate in, we believe and the number show that we actually increased our distance in share year-over-year, and we intend to continue to do so.
On the investment property side, this is the business that has gone through a historic and I think once in a life time unraveling. And really as we all saw, that business went from a peak activity that was astounding to really zero activity two years later.
And the onboarding of costs in that business fortunately for us will come as a direct result of the onboarding of revenues. During that down cycle we didn’t release any of our investment property producers. I don’t think any of them left. They’re also here working way real hard. They just didn’t make a lot of money during the downturn.
Now, as the property markets pick up, the capacity that those (inaudible) have to onboard revenue is very, very significant, and I don’t think you’re going to see us doing much to add new personnel to add to those businesses around the world, we really don’t need them. And at this point, it’s really just a matter of riding the market backup and continue to take share where we can.
Really unlike our other property business lines, this is the business that has some really terrific what I’d describe as niche competitors and in the states clearly, those are Eastdil Secured and Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, those are our two big competitors in the state, they are fantastic firms, this is all they do. That’s where the battles are, it’s those two firms and us and we like that battle.

Probably, the most important thing we did in the fourth-quarter was, refinancing of our balance sheet. That refinancing, which we believe was market setting. It substantially improved our covenants in terms of maturities and flexibility. We got the first non-investment grade revolver without a floor in this sector this year or last year.
We had the first term B in any sector with any credit without a floor last year. And we have the first-ever (inaudible) expandable reusable accordion. The reason that so important and I know you appreciate this is it gave us enormous amount of capacity to make acquisitions and to take advantage of this marketplace.
And as I said last quarter, those opportunities will come two ways. The first is there will simply be firm like in any year that has made a decision they’re trying to compete against the global multinationals. It’s just too hard a road to slog and they’ll look to a roll up of some sort, and we’ll be looking at those firms as we always do as good opportunities if priced right and if we think we can integrate them.
But as I also mentioned last quarter, this market down cycle has brought to the market once in a life time opportunities that frankly I don’t know that we’ll ever see again. Those once in a life time opportunities come in a couple flavors; first and foremost is the investment management space and we talked about that last quarter.
There have been a number of investment management platforms in the pension fund advisory business that have gone to market either through very public auctions or very quite one-off trades. That isn’t going to happen again likely in my life time. And so, we are keenly interested in watching those opportunities as they come through the marketplace, and we’re positioned and poised to go after any of them we think are good for our business and suitable for the business.
We’ll also see those once in a life time opportunities come through, we believe, in some of the more traditional multi-service platforms in the commercial real estate service space. This downturn wreaked a lot of havoc and a lot of pain on some of the smaller firms.
I think that it’s very clear to us that some of those firms as good as they are have just come to the conclusion that being a tweener in this industry is just not a good place to be. And some of those firms also are now, we’re finding interested in having discussions they’ve never been interested in having before.
So, I think the right answer to your question is, this is a very, very unique time. We went through a lot of work in the last 18 months to get this company ready for coming out of this downturn so that we could make strategic acquisitions.
Our balance sheet has never been healthier, in better shape, and more flexible than it is now. We’re aggressively looking throughout the marketplace for these once in a life time opportunities, I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to bring some of them to closure.

I think this will be helpful. If you look at US leasing and I use office as a proxy for the market, I think that’s a fair proxy. Velocity are number of transactions was up 18% in the fourth-quarter over prior and 20% for the year. Lease term barely moved. It was up 2% for the fourth-quarter and 6% for the year. Square footage also barely moved. It was up 1% for the fourth-quarter and 4% for the year. Average commission per transaction, however, was up quite strong. It was up 11% for the quarter and 19% for the full-year, and of course those two numbers relate to the harder compare you’re going to get to later in 2010. Now, what all that tells us is you’re seeing a lot more transactions come to the marketplace at a higher price, which is, of course, indicative of a recovering marketplace.
In the leasing business, both here in Europe, in Asia, we are the dominant player in that brokerage work out in the marketplace and because of that we do tend to accrete more share in a recovering marketplace we believe than do our competitors. I believe that the numbers are showing that’s indeed what happened in 2010 and what I’d expect to happen in 2011.
For our business this is a very, very good time for our leasing professionals. For really 2.5 years, they’ve been working with companies as they went down into the bunker and stayed in the bunker and they’re now working with those same companies as their CFOs and Treasurers and CEOs become much more optimistic about their future are now working on what we’d consider to be much more traditional or normal business plans as it pertains to taking on new space.
The price differential you saw here, average commission difference that you saw year-over-year is also indicative of the quality of space that tenants are now going after. Average rents didn’t go up as much as the numbers I gave you. What that means is that there’s less leasing occurring in the, what I would call, sublet or shadow space market and a lot more leasing incurring in high quality product, again, very indicative of a recovering market and that bodes very, very well for our leasing business.
These are the transactions where our margins are quite strong. It’s transactions where our producers and our leasing businesses tend to do very, very well. So that business line perhaps as much as any other we have right now isn’t one we’re probably most excited about as we came out of 2010.

And here is what I think we’re seeing we talked about this last quarter. If you look at the broad economic data, you would be very puzzled by these numbers, because as good as these numbers are, it really is hard to define any strength in the overall US or global economy. It’s really a very anemic recovery from that respect and certainly in terms of job growth.
But what these numbers tell us and we talked about this last quarter as well, our clients, the folks who are occupying space on the marketplace, frankly at the moment, are not very interested in the current economic numbers and indicators. What they are doing is they are making decisions on their view of the mid-term and long-term right now.
I would say across the board, if you were to pull the top 100 or 200 space occupiers in the States or in Europe, you would find that the vast majority of them, probably over 90% of them believe that the prospects for their business were strongly more positive looking forward than they’ve been. That’s what they are using to make their space decisions.
And so, all that to say that the occupier market is a bit ahead of the economic recovery and that makes sense. They are taking the space they need to hire. They need to do that before they hire the bodies and our expectation is, by the way, from these numbers is the job growth is right around the corner. Certainly, what our clients were telling us is that they believe they will be expanding their businesses, they believe they will be hiring and therefore, they need more space.

The revenue growth comes, of course, as we are either reimbursed for employees or we put on these accounts where we earn fees its management contract or incentive fees or project fees around the contract.
We can on board a lot of square footage and in fact we did the last three years without a lot of incremental margin or profitability and that’s fairly typical for a difficult marketplace for these large corporate customers are not particularly active in the market. There’s no question there’s been fee pressures throughout that business the last three years on the downside of the economy, yet, fee pressure still exist, although my expectation is it will loosen up a bit in 2011 and 2012.
But for us, the way we think about that business, Anthony, is the growth of that business starts with the onboarding of the contract and the onboarding of square footage. That gives us control of the business. Now, as the markets improve and as those customers become more active again, we now have them as a captive customer, and we will onboard those revenues as they become more active.
So, we like the statistics, we like the fact that that business is growing in terms of number of clients and square footage managed, and we’re patient, but, of course, expecting for transaction fees and incentive fees and other fees to come through those contracts as the economy improves.
The big outsourcing customers are probably the most conservative customers we have in terms of moving forward with an optimistic view. These are big, big companies who outsource for cost efficiency and they tend to be a bit more conservative around taking new space and expanding their capital budget, but they will. And I think what you will find and certainly what we expect is, the onboarding of square footage we’ve done in the last few years as the market continues to improve will pay big dividend.

When you look at our press release first of all if you just calculate the tax rate, it’s only on the continuing operations and on a GAAP basis in the Development business we had some discontinued operations that actually had a tax benefit.
So if you’ll take my word, on a normalized basis, it was 38% in the fourth-quarter. We did have some foreign audit, small but they affected rates, small audit settlements in a couple of countries. We also had some true-ups with state taxes in the US. So that did impact the rate in the quarter a little bit, they were discrete to the quarter.
I think mostly importantly is what do we think the tax rate will be next year, and I’m going to tell you, I think it’s going to be around 38%, 39%. If revenue shift to the US, which it may well do in 2011 a little bit then that would impact the tax rate by having it go up a little, so, I’m going to go with 38% to 39% on a normalized basis for ‘11.

As you know, we have no gaps in the market. We’re the dominant player in virtually every city.

It goes up or down a couple percentage points, but it’s generally a net zero.
I think we’ve talked about this before, Will, we believe by far the longest tenure of our sales folks in the industry. People don’t leave here when they get here. So, our issue is really are not needing to go out to the competitive marketplace and hire folks.
We do that very, very selectively, but really more to bring in young people, get them trained up in our firm and then slowly inculcate into the market to replace those folks that are leaving for retirement. We have no initiatives of any real size to speak of right now to bulk up fee earners anywhere in world.

I think, as you know, in the US the management bonuses are based on an EBITDA target number, so, beginning of the year, we set a budget. That budget number becomes an EBITDA target.
Our management will pay the bonus based on if they miss or beat that target. Because of the way 2010 played out, it maxed out all the bonus plans. In fact, it was a highest percentage bonuses paid to many of our managers ever, at least it won’t happen probably for a long time. So that overage which I believe Gil characterized is $25 million is unlikely to be seen again in 2011 in those bonus plans, so you only have the impact of two things there.
You had some reinstatement of cost, but you also have this once in a long time event where our managers actually received a very outsized bonus. God knows they deserved it. But the way our programs work, it’s highly, highly unlikely they would repeat that in the near-term.

The point we’re trying to make, however, is first of all, that in the broad scheme of things it doesn’t really matter. I’d remind you and all of our callers that our margins, it really is an amazing thing, our margins through the down cycle and now through the recovery cycle were markedly better than any other major player in this industry.
Our current margin is over almost 200 basis points higher than next largest competitor. This is the company that has a proven and unique ability to convert revenue to profit. And we’re going to continue to do that. And we are not going to onboard expense as a determent of our margins. In this case, we’re able to do something we felt was appropriate and actually morally correct for employees and still preserve a wide delta on our operating profitabilities from those we compete against and that is a main story.

It’s something we think about quite a bit. Here’s the answer we would have or we do have today.

It’s something we think about quite a bit. Here’s the answer we would have or we do have today. First, keep in mind that the damage done to the capital markets from all the things that has happened in the last four years, not just the sovereign debt issues, but also really disappearance of the capital markets for a period of time and the problem with lenders. That damage to the financial system has not been repaired, not even remotely been repaired. And the activity you see in the capital markets is in spite of that.
In other words, the fuel behind our capital markets business right now is not the robust return to commercial lending. In fact, there isn’t. Notwithstanding what all our great client banks tell us how actively they are lending, we don’t see it. The underwriting criteria being used by the banks today is severe and really beyond the reach of most traditional investors.
So the activity we see in the marketplace today is being done around that problem rather than be done because those problems been fixed and I say all that because another shock to the financial system I don’t think would have a significant impact on the overall capital markets business.
What’s fueling that investment property business, the capital markets business right now is a desire by capital to be invested in the asset class and the ability of capital to find new sources of lending to get those transactions done. It’s not being done because your firm or other great clients we have, have rushed back into the commercial property sector, in fact, that’s (technical difficulty) the opposite.
So that gives some comfort that if we see a sovereign debt issue in Europe or we see a further deterioration in the US residential market they will not have as large an impact on that business as they typically would because that impact has already worked in to the system.
So, as we think about our forecast going forward, we feel pretty good about them. I think the risks to the forecast really are around jobs and job growth. I think that, if in all 2011 we see no job growth, which is where installed the last 18 months, I think there is some risk to these forecasts. The market that we’re dealing with, the occupiers that we are dealing with anticipate job growth. And something that would shut that down would be a more real risk factor I think to the forecast than a shock to the financial system.

That line item is by and large driven by that business.
But to give you further specific commentary is difficult to do because, as you know, that business is dependent and that line item in particularly is dependent on sales activity, and it depends what type of sales we have. If we have a sale of a joint venture than the ‘gain’ which show up through equity earnings, if we have a consolidated sale of the consolidated property it shows through that line. So, to analyze that line is pretty tough. I think you’ve got to look at the development business as a whole and make some assumptions, each and all of our assumptions will be different as to what is a consolidated sale, what we’re predicting what it’s going to be versus equity earnings. So, I agree with you. It’s very tough and therefore I’m not able to put a prediction on what exactly would flow through that line. And again, I would refer you to the business in total.

This past quarter we purchased very strong revenue and earnings growth across our business, with revenue gains of 16% for the company and much better growth in normalized EBITDA. Our revenue growth was aided by the continued recovery in the commercial real estate market and continued strong fundamental in our outsourcing business.
Normalized EBITDA grew 38% in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010 and diluted adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2011 was $0.13 as compared to $0.01 for the first quarter of 2010.
As you might recall from our fourth quarter 2010 earnings call, in the second half of 2010, we restored a significant portion of our US based compensation related expenses that were cut during the downturn due a stronger than expected first year recovery. In addition, in EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2010 and continuing in the first quarter of 2011, we have aggressively hired producers and related support in anticipation of improving transaction based revenues. We believe that these personnel addition will serve as well in future quarters as our revenue pipelines are generally strong and operating leverage in this region should improve as the year progresses. 
Our principal businesses performed very well during the quarter, with strong revenue increases accompanied by lower expenses in Investment Management and gains of $12.9 million of the sale of three properties in the Development business. The recovery and expansion in the global commercial real estate market continued at the rate consistent with early stage recovery in prior cycles. We like what we see in the market and are very excited about our opportunity to leverage our unique and industry-leading platform to produce outside gain for our investors and terrific outcomes for our clients.
Some of the more note worthy transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are listed in slide#5. As usual I will not go through them individually, but have included down to show some business wins.

This increase resulted from improvement in nearly all business lines. Normalized EBITDA was up 38% to $120.6 million in the quarter from $87.5 million in the first quarter of 2010 delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 10.2%, a 170 basis point increase versus the first quarter of 2010.
Our cost of services as a percentage of revenue remained almost even at 60.2% in the first quarter of 2011 versus 60% in the first quarter of 2010 primarily due to compensation re-instatements in the US and a notable hiring in EMEA in anticipation of improving transaction base revenues that Brett alluded to earlier.
In the first quarter of 2011, operating expenses as a percent of total revenue dropped by a 120 basis points to 31.8% versus 32% in the first quarter of 2010 despite 2010 restatements affecting this line item, which is indicative of effective cost control in the indirect and support areas of our business.
Over the past two years we have spoken with you about our expectation of adding back a projected $120 million to $150 million to our run rate cost structure against our 2007 base as revenue increases during the recovery. Cumulatively since the first quarter of 2010, we have added back approximately $135 million of such cost and it is likely that we will exceed the upper end of our projected range in 2011 as revenues which these cost support have already increase significantly more than what we anticipated when we originally made the projection. However, the incremental costs should have minimal bottom line impact as they were mitigated by the revenue growth they support.
Interest expense decrease by $16.1 million in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010 due to a net reduction in outstanding debt in the second half of 2010.  Our first quarter 2011 tax rate was approximately 41% and we expect it to be slightly below to this full year 2011.  First quarter 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.11 versus a loss of $0.02 last year.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.13 versus $0.01 cent in the first quarter of 2010. 
Please turn to slide 7.  Property and Facility Management was our largest service line in the first quarter of 2011 representing 40% of total revenue in the quarter inline with the prior first quarter.  Leasing was our second largest service line in the first quarter of 2011 posting an 8% increase versus the first quarter of 2010.  It represented 30% percent of total company revenue in the first quarter of 2011.
Sales revenue continued its strong recovery with a growth of 34% in the first quarter of 2011, a significant increase following an increase of 51% in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009.  This resulted from the continued strength of Class A property sales along with noticeable improvement in the sales of other property classes and more favorable financing conditions.
Appraisal & Valuation revenue was up 8% in the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the first quarter of 2010.  This was driven by continued strength in capital market activities in the quarter.
Global Investment Management revenue increased 26% year-over-year driven by increases in asset management and acquisition fees.
Commercial Mortgage Brokerage posted an increase of 79% driven loan originations for US government sponsored enterprises as well as significant improvement on the part of traditional and conduit lenders.
Development services fee revenue was down 2%.  Revenue from property and service management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring  This revenue represented approximately 60% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2011.
Please turn to slide 8.  The outsourcing business growth rate accelerated this quarter posting an increase of 14% versus the first quarter of 2010, the strongest year-over-year quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2008.  This was driven by the strong new account growth and client expansion we experienced throughout 2010.
In the first quarter a record of 44 total long term contract was signed. This far exceeds the previous quarterly record which was 34.  We signed 13 new accounts, 22 renewals, and 9 expansions.  Our performance this quarter was strong across all geographies of all regions posting double digits percentage revenue gain. Fundamentals in this business continue to be favorable with increasing corporate spending and a start of job growth evidence.  The resulting revenue pipeline is healthy with a focus on global portfolios and penetration in to new segments such as healthcare and government.
Overall our global portfolio of commercial property and corporate facilities under management totaled 2.7 billion square feet at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 17% from the first quarter of 2010.
Slide 9 demonstrates the stabilizing or improving vacancy rates and absorption through first quarter of 2011 and our forecasted improvements for full year 2011 and 2012.  Average national CAP rates improved meaningfully in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010 driven by Class A property sale.  These top tier assets continue to trade actively at CAP rate between 4.75% and 6%, while financing has also continued to improve.
Please turn to slide 10.  The recovery of America sales market continued in the first quarter of 2011 as our revenue for the first quarter increased 38% on a year-over-year basis after 51% increase in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009.  Our market share totaled 15.3% of all activity for the first quarter of 2011 ranking at no. 1 according to Real Capital Analytics.
Our Americas leasing revenue posted an 8% increase in the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the first quarter of 2010.  This comes on the heels of 20% increase in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter for 2009.  The US office vacancy rate decreased by 10 basis point to 16.4% from the fourth quarter of 2010.  Net absorption in US office product was possible again and this had a slightly positive impact on vacancy rate.
Please turn to slide 11. Our investment sales revenue in EMEA increased by 12% in the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the first quarter of 2010.  Activity was led by France and Germany.  In the United Kingdom, sales revenue was slightly down from the first quarter of 2010 in part due to the timing of several deals shifting to the second quarter.
CBRE’s revenue from leasing and EMEA grew modest 1% in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010.  This was respectable considering the fiscal strain that continues within the euro zone and given the 25% increase in leasing revenue in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009.
Please turn to slide 12. CBRE sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased by 57% in the first quarter of 2011 versus the first quarter of 2010.  The increase was especially notable given it was generated on top of a 123% increase in the fist quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009.
Our leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew 15% in the first quarter versus the first quarter of 2010.  The strongest growth came from Australia and New Zealand, China, India as well as Japan.  The region suffered its share of natural disasters this quarter with floods in Australia and the Japanese earthquakes.  It proved surprisingly resilient from a financial performance standpoint, and while we remain cautious with regard to our near term expectations for the locations directly affected we do not believe that a future material may have impact on company performance is likely.
Please turn to slide 13. Revenue for the Development Services segment was $19.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 versus $18.3 million in the first quarter of 2010.  Operating is also the first quarter of 2011 for this segment included normalized EBITDA of $13.5 million, a substantial improvement over the first quarter of 2010 normalized EBITDA of $5.6 million.
The improvement in normalized EBITDA was driven by gains from several property sales.  At March 31, 2011 in process development totaled $4.9 billion unchanged from December 31, 2010 and up $200 million from the $4.7 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2010.
The pipeline at March 31, 2011 increased to $1.5 billion, up $300 million from year end 2010 and $600 million from the end of the first quarter of 2010, which is an early sign of an improving environment.  At the end of the first quarter our equity co-investments in the development services business totaled $71.2 million.
Please turn to slide 14. The Global Investment Management segment's revenue was up 30% to $51.4 million in the first quarter of 2011 from $39.4 million in the first quarter of 2010 including revenue from discontinued operations of $1 million in the first quarter of 2011.  Increased fees for assets under management, acquisition fees and rental income all contributed to the revenue increase.
Assets under management totaled $37.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2011, which was slightly higher than the $37.6 billion under management at the year-end 2010.
During the first quarter, we competed approximately $900 million of acquisitions and approximately $300 million of dispositions globally.  Currency fluctuations increased the portfolio by approximately $500 million.
Year-to-date 2011, we have raised new capital of approximately $200 million and had approximately $1.7 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the quarter.  Our current investments in this business at the end of the quarter total $98.5 million.
As it relates the ING REIM, we have made very good progress reluctant to closing requirements for the transaction, the process of obtaining partner and lender consensus well underway.  All anti-trust (inaudible).  The proposed senior leadership structure has been established and we continue to expect the transaction with close in the second half of the year.

In the first quarter of 2011, we incurred $7.5 million of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisition, predominantly for legal and other professional services.  In the first quarter of 2011, we reported $1 million of carried interest compensation expense which relates to the gains expected in future period.  As of March 31, 2011, the company maintains a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $21 million which (inaudible) the anticipated future carried interest revenue.
EBITDA was positively impacted by higher fees for assets under management, acquisition fees and lower expenses.  Prior EBITDA included $4.5 million of net non-cash right down of property investments.  This business operated at a normalized EBITDA margin of 28% for the first quarter of 2011.
Please turn to slide 16.  Slide 16 shows an amortization and debt maturity reschedule for all outstanding debt.  During the first quarter of 2011, we entered into various six month forward stock interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $400 million. This action is intended to hedge against the variable interest rates of our term loan facilities.  These swap agreements will terminate in 2018 and 2019 and have a weighted average effective interest rate of approximately 6.4%.
Debt financing for ING REIM was completed in the first quarter with two delayed draw tranches of debt each totaling $400 million with terms of LIBOR 3.25 and 3.50 respectively, and no LIBOR floor.  The new tranche C is due in 2018, and the new tranche D is due in 2019. They both amortize at 1% per annum.  We are still evaluating whether or not we will utilize the ATM equity raise authorized by our board of directors for the ING REIM acquisition.  As you can see, we have and we will continue to have post the ING financing a very balanced maturity schedule that has not become meaningful until 2015.
Please turn to slide 17.  Excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and mortgage brokerage warehouse facility, our total net debt at the end of the first quarter of 2011 was $1.1 billion.  This represents an increase from year end 2010 primarily due to seasonal needs driven by incentive compensation payments.
At March 31, 2011 our weighted average interest rate was approximately 6.4%, slightly lower than the 6.5% at the end of 2010.  Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.07 times at the end of the first quarter of 2011 on a trailing twelve months basis.  Our total company net debt to EBITDA stood at 1.49 times which remains below our current target of 2 times.
I will now turn the call back over to Brett.

Leasing continues to post solid growth on top of a stellar recovery in 2010, during which we believe we increased our share of market.  We are now more optimistic regarding our expectations for the global investment management and development services businesses.
We continue to target peak of cycle EBITDA margin of 20% for the company and will actually manage the business to get there.  We continue to expect earnings to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.05 per share for the full year 2011.

So, I don’t want to say that one goes up one goes down because I think they both go up but certainly in this environment you put your finger on a very valid point, which is there's a lot of refinancing going on in a market with out a lot of sales and as sales pick while the refinancings go away those sales of current mortgages as well.

We’re a big company firm. We do exceptionally well working with large institutions, we have great relationships there; and that shift continues in the investment property sales business and accelerated I believe in the last twelve months as there has been an almost complete lack of financing available. That has really knocked out of the business the mid-tier players, the high net worth individuals who require financing and at the same time has highly advantaged the large institutions that can either create greater financing, bridge financing or don’t need financing.  So that’s what the long term trend that’s been the standard for business for many years, that’s also been accelerated the last couple of years.
As the market stabilizes as financing becomes available then you should see a larger entry back in investment property space of high net worth individuals, partnerships and so forth.  Just to be clear, REITs and corporations are a very small component of the overall investment property market.  It’s really all about institutional investors and owners.

This last current cycle or the current cycle that we were in for the US, as I mentioned earlier, DC, Northern Virginia was exceptionally strong given the growth of government, but there is no question that we saw leasing recover first in the big markets New York City, Washington DC, Northern Virginia and some of the West Coast markets Chicago and so forth.  That improvement is here I can tell you for certain is between January 1, 2011 and January 1, 2013, that improvement will move from a small number of large markets to virtually every market.

In fact I made this comment before.  If you look at a long-term study of our broker headcount what you would find is that our broker headcount in United States for example is actually down from where it was many years ago on a normalized basis for acquisitions. The reason for that is as the business has matured over many years the quality of brokers has increased and firms like ours and other have been able to migrate towards higher quality, higher more productive brokers every year and to weed out those are less productive because the more productive ones can take on all their business and more.
The productivity of the brokers right now and may be another way to say your question is the capacity of those brokers to do additional work. I do not want to put a percent capacity that are right now, but I think it is fare to say that there has an enormous amount of capacity in the system right now to onboard additional revenues.  If you think about this way the think about a high-ticket broker in New York City who last year billed $10 million in fees that if they are a sale broker that might have been 10 or 12 transactions,  they are leasing broker that may be was 15 or 20.  The amount of work that would be required to add four deals on the investment property side or four deals on the leasing side, incrementally is not that significant and those brokers do not require much of any additional support to do those transactions.  So, all that to say, that we have never in our history have way we thought with maximum capacity of our sales force. I do not know what that number would be we have never seen it.  They always have an ability to do more and I would just say that we are on a long ways away from that point at the movement.

It’s a very incremental process there’s been no great change and the fourth quarter other than its a little bit better and the fourth quarter was a little bit better than third quarter and so on and so forth. The return of credit to the commercial real estate asset class is going to be a slow process and yet it’s a process that I don’t believe can be diverted. In other words credible continue to loosen and lending will continue to improve in the commercial real estate asset class as the health of the asset class improves.
Frankly, it's quite impressive to see the amount of business occurring in the sales side of that outside class given how difficult the credit is to obtain, the underwriting is incredibly stringent. It really eliminates the majority of borrower from being able to tap the credit market. So, as I mentioned earlier, you see a investment property market right now dominated by firms who are not dependent on easy credit. Those firms that are really not active at the moment. This is the trend that will continue to improve over time, but I think an improvement take an other two or three years to get back to what we will consider a normal set of play. Also begun contact 2007 and 2006 was not normal, normal state of play is something tighter in terms of lending standards that we saw then, but something much, much more benevolent or support that we don’t see right now.

Please turn to slide four. This quarter, our strong performance in evidence of the continued commercial real estate recovery comes against the backdrop of persistent sovereign debt concerns in Europe and tepid economic unemployment growth in the U.S.
Revenue growth for CBRE was strong in the third quarter. Total company revenue was over $1.5 billion, representing a 21% increase over the third quarter of 2010. This growth was balanced across all geographies in most service lines. Leasing revenue increased 19% in the third quarter of 2011 with all regions increasing by double digits in the quarter. The largest percentage gains in Leasing were in Asia Pacific and EMEA.
Outsourcing revenue accelerated significantly in the third quarter of 2011 with growth of 19%. All geographies had double-digit growth with EMEA leading the other two regions.
Investment Sales growth was 23% for the total company entirely driven by the Americas as EMEA and Asia Pacific were essentially flat. Investment Management revenue showed a significant increase from higher asset management fees primarily driven by CBRE Clarion Securities, which we acquired on July 1st, as well as higher incentive fees.
Normalized EBITDA increased to $194.8 million from $175.5 million. Our normalized EBITDA margin was 12.7% versus 13.9% in the third quarter of 2010. This margin comparison is impacted by an unfavorable variance of 60 basis points resulting from an increase in net carried interest compensation expense in our Investment Management business this year versus last. Another 60 basis point unfavorable variance was due to increased legal reserves associated with two unrelated cases and insurance reserves on claims within our Appraisal & Valuation business, which date back to the downturn.
Despite these variances as well as higher Outsourcing business mix and increased staffing in EMEA, which also contributed to lower operating leverage in the quarter, we are still not satisfied with the overall EBITDA margin result and fully expect our cost production measures to show greater impact in the fourth quarter of 2011. Because of this, we reiterate our expectation that full year 2011 normalized EBITDA margin will exceed full year 2010 normalized EBITDA margin.
Some of the most significant transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown here on slide five. As usual, I will not go through them individually but we have included them for your review.

This increase resulted from strong growth in all business lines with the exception of development services. Normalized EBITDA was up 11% to a $194.8 million in the third quarter of 2011 from a $175.5 million in the third quarter of 2010, delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 12.7%. Without the impact of the $7.4 million of carried interest compensation expense this year versus a reversal of $1.4 million last year and the $8.6 million impact of legal and insurance reserves taken in the quarter that Brett just mentioned, normalized EBITDA would have grown by about 21% and normalized EBITDA margin would have been almost flat compared to last year.
Our cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased very slightly to 58.3% in the third quarter of 2011 versus 58.1% in the third quarter of 2010. Third quarter 2011 operating expenses as a percent of total revenue increased by a 100 basis points to 30.6% versus 29.6% in the third quarter of 2010. This was driven by the aforementioned carried interest expense, legal and insurance reserves as well as the inclusion of CBRE Clarion Securities expenses, all of which flowed through operating expense as opposed to cost of services.
Interest expense decreased by $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower interest rates resulting from our refinancing activities in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Our third quarter 2011 normalized tax rate was approximately 40% and we also expect it to be approximately 40% for the full year 2011. Third quarter 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.20 versus $0.18 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.24 as compared to $0.20 in the third quarter of 2010.
Please turn to slide seven. Property & Facilities Management was again our largest service line in the third quarter of 2011, representing 34% of total revenue in the quarter after growing 19% versus the third quarter of 2010.
Leasing was our second largest service line in the third quarter of 2011, also reporting a 19% revenue increase versus the third quarter of 2010, which experienced a 27% increase over the third quarter of 2009. Leasing represented 32% of total company revenue in the third quarter of 2011. Investment Sales growth slowed a bit but was still strong with an increase of 23% in the third quarter of 2011, another meaningful improvement following a gain of 63% in the third quarter of 2010 versus the third quarter of 2009.
Appraisal & Valuation revenue improved 26% in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010. This was driven by large portfolio assignments globally, continued strength in U.S. capital market activities and an acquisition in Asia Pacific in the second quarter of 2011. Global Investment Management revenue increased 93% quarter-over-quarter driven by increases in asset management and incentive fees. Commercial Mortgage Brokerage revenue increased 32% driven by solid cash flow availability, favorable interest rates and the continued search for yield by investors.
Development Services revenue was down 21% primarily due to lower rental revenue resulting from property dispositions.
Revenue from Property & Facilities Management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 58% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2011.
Please turn to slide eight. The Outsourcing business growth rate accelerated this quarter, with revenue up 19% versus the third quarter of 2010. This was driven by record setting new account growth, continued strong client renewals and expansions, and acquisitions in EMEA. Strong performance is evident across all regions with EMEA posting the largest revenue increase.
In the third quarter, we set another record and signed 49 total long-term contracts. This exceeds the previous quarterly record, which was 47, in the second quarter of 2011. This is also the third straight record setting quarter in which we signed 20 new accounts, which is itself a record, 17 renewals and 12 expansions.
The revenue and RFP pipelines in this business continue to be very healthy with more assignments that are global in nature. Robust activity has helped us add nearly 1 billion square feet job portfolio in just two years.
Slide nine demonstrates the stabilized or improving vacancy rates and positive absorption in the third quarter of 2011 for all three market sectors depicted, along with our forecasted improvement in all three areas for 2012. Average national office cap rates remained stable in the third quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2011 and showed improvement versus the third quarter of 2010 driven by core and Class A property sales.
Please turn to slide 10. Sales revenue in the Americas continued to be strong with a 42% increase in the third quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2010. Our U.S. Investment Sales market share totaled 14.3% for the third quarter of 2011 according to real capital analytics. This share was more than 470 basis points larger than our nearest competitor.
Our Americas Leasing revenue grew 11% in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010, which grew 36% over the third quarter of 2009. Fundamentals remained solid despite challenges experienced in the U.S. economic recovery. During the third quarter of 2011, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained unchanged at 16.2%.
Given the increased weighting of Outsourcing overall and the particular growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific in the last few years, we have decided to add regional color on Outsourcing in each of our regional revenue slides. The Americas Outsourcing business grew a strong 13% in the third quarter of 2011, which is consistent with its year-to-date 2011 growth rate.
Please turn to slide 11. Our Investment Sales revenue in EMEA eased by 3% in the third quarter of 2011 attributable to cautious trading linked to concerns of the sovereign debt challenges. Despite this, strong sales were evident in France and Germany. CBRE’s EMEA Leasing revenue posted excellent growth with a 33% improvement in the third quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2010. These positive results came despite macro issues and were driven by the UK, France and Germany. Outsourcing contributed more than $30 million of the revenue improvement in EMEA’s third quarter 2011 results and represented an impressive 48% increase for the quarter driven by new assignments.
Second quarter 2011 acquisitions in Central and Eastern Europe and Switzerland also made positive contributions to revenue growth this quarter. The revenue mix this quarter with Outsourcing accounting for 5 percentage points more total revenue and sales declining by a light percentage had a notable negative impact on EBITDA margins quarter-over-quarter. However, the absolute quarter-over-quarter EBITDA growth was pleasing in such a tough economic environment.
Please turn to slide 12. CBRE sales revenue in Asia Pacific was essentially flat in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010. CBRE’s Leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew by a dramatic 41% in the third quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2010. The strongest gains came from Australia, China and Singapore. Outsourcing growth in Asia Pacific was a solid 21% in the third quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2010, as Outsourcing continues to gain adoption in this region.
Please turn to slide 13. Revenue for the Development Services segment was $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2011 versus $22 million in the third quarter of 2010. Operating results for the third quarter of 2011 for this segment included normalized EBITDA of $5.2 million as compared to $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2010. Third quarter 2010 EBITDA benefited from higher gains in the sale of properties, primarily reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and income from discontinued operations on our income statements.
At September 30, 2011, In Process development totaled $5.1 billion, up $200 million from both December 31, 2010 and the end of the third quarter of 2010. The pipeline at September 30, 2011 rose to $1.5 billion, up $300 million from year-end 2010 and up $400 million from the end of the third quarter of 2010, which indicates continued improvement in this sector. At the end of the third quarter, our equity client investments in the Development Services business totaled $81.6 million.
Please turn to slide 14. On July 1, 2011, we closed the ING Clarion real estate securities portion of the ING Real Estate Investment Management or ING REIM as transaction for consideration of approximately $324 million. We also acquired core investment positions of approximately $59 million in select sponsored funds.
On October 3rd, just after the third quarter ended, we closed on the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for consideration of approximately $45 million and core investments of approximately $17 million. We remain on schedule to close ING REIM Europe by the end of the year.
In the third quarter of 2011, our Global Investment Management segment’s revenue was up 56% to $77.4 million from $49.5 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees primarily stemming from the ING Clarion Securities acquisition and higher incentive fees.
Assets under management or AUM totaled $53.5 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2011, up 42% from year-end 2010 and 50% higher than at the end of the third quarter of 2010. The third quarter 2011 total includes listed securities of $18.5 billion.
Changes in market valuation and net redemptions in the securities portfolio decreased assets under management by $4.6 billion in the quarter versus the second quarter of 2011. In addition, a change in our calculation methodology to confirm reporting between CBRE investors and ING REIM decreased AUM in the direct real estate business by $1.6 billion during the quarter versus the second quarter of 2011. Currency fluctuations further lowered total assets by $600 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. The third quarter of 2011 total does not include $5 billion of AUM acquired from ING REIM in Asia on October 3, 2011.
During the third quarter, we completed approximately $900 million of acquisitions and approximately $800 million of dispositions globally. Year-to-date 2011, we have raised new capital of approximately $1.5 billion and had approximately $2.1 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our core investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled a $157.2 million.
Our Global Investment Management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on slide 15. In the third quarter of 2011, we incurred $9.4 billion of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisition, primarily for legal and other professional services. During the quarter we also wrote down the value of two core investments for a total of $4.5 million. In the third quarter of 2011, we reported $7.4 million of carried interest compensation expense, which relates to expected future periods carried interest revenue
As of September 30, 2011, the company maintains a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $33 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated as a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 35% for the third quarter of 2011.
Please turn to slide 16. Slide 16 shows our amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. During the third quarter of 2011, we drew down our $400 million Term Loan C to fund the closing of ING REIM Asia and then preparation for closing ING REIM Europe. The terms are liable plus 325 with 1% annual amortization and maturity in 2018. We previously announced that we will not be using equity to fund this acquisition.
On October 18, 2011 we entered into discussions with our vendors for a new incremental senior secured sterling denominated term loan A1 facility in the amount of approximately $250 million, due in May 2016. With a term substantially similar to our existing term loan A facility.
To-date we have commitments from our bank partners to fund over 90% of those $250 million facility. We remain very comfortable with our balanced debt maturity profile, with no meaningful maturities until 2015. We’re also pleased with our strong overall balance sheet positions as a provider of the necessary flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they appear in this early stage of the commercial real estate recovery.
Please turn to slide 17. Excluding our non-recourse real estate loans, mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities and cash within consolidated funds at other entities but not available for company use. Our total net debt at the end of the third quarter of 2011 was approximately $1.5 billion. This represents an increase from year-end 2010 primarily due to term loan borrowings to finance the acquisition of ING Clarion Securities. During the third quarter, the company also used $12 million to fund two in-field acquisitions in Europe, a retail services business in the United Kingdom and a shopping center management business in the Netherlands. We will continue to see consolidation pressure in the industry which we believe may present good opportunities for more acquisitions at attract the evaluations.
At September 30th 2011, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.5% compared to 6.2% at the end of the second quarter of 2011. The lower average interest rate was primarily driven by a larger portion of lower interest rate debt due to the term loan borrowings to fund our ING REIM at the end of the second and in the third quarter.
Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.55 times at the end of the third quarter of 2011 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to EBITDA stood at 1.98 times, which remains just below our current target of 2 times. We continue to anticipate that this ratio will be approximately 2.5 times post the acquisition of all of ING REIM.
I will now turn the call back over to Brett.

Despite foreign debt challenges in Europe and uncertainty in the economic recovery in the U.S., we continue to believe that we are in the early stages of a cyclical recovery. Outsourcing fundamentals remained very strong as evidenced by the strong growth this quarter and revenues should continue to grow in the double digits for the intermediate term. The ING REIM acquisition will provide another significant source of stable, growing revenue that will be accretive to our overall EBITDA margin. In addition, we expect to see increased revenue flowing to our other lines of business as the ING REIM operations are integrated. The final piece of the ING REIM acquisition will close as scheduled during the fourth quarter. When it does, we will hold a special call to discuss that business in much more detail.
Investment Sales should continue to grow due to financing availability for core assets, investor appetite per yield and attractiveness of the asset class as an inflation hedge. Leasing growth rate should revert to historical norms as the economy begins to stabilize. We remain focused on margins balanced with strategic recruiting in the appropriate service lines and geographies. We continue to expect EPS to be within our initial guidance range of $0.95 to a $1.05 for the full year. Our full year normalized EBITDA margin should exceed prior year.
And with that, operator, we’d like to take questions.

When you look at the third quarter numbers, it’s striking to me that both leasing and sales globally showed good increase, sales only in the U.S. but Leasing in all three geographies. And again as I think as you know you Anthony, if there’s one good leading indicator of job growth and of growth I think in the revenues for this industry, you probably pick Leasing because these are large corporate customers, entering the marketplace committing to long term space leases. So, we like what we saw on the third quarter. We particular like that the Leasing numbers held up quite well and that’s about as far as I think I can take that.

You may recall Anthony or perhaps you don’t but Trammell Crow had a very deep and very specific healthcare outsourcing business. They did Baylor down in Texas, they still have that account and that expertise really jump-started our firms exploitation of that market.
As it pertains to outside the United States in terms of why that growth rate is high and what we expect for the future, remember first of all, there’s been virtually no outsourcing in those two geographies historically. I think the seminal point here or the data point that’s most interesting to us is that it appears that this is a trend that has now caught on and we saw some very large pieces of business in those geographies, led of course by our Pru business in the UK. But, I think that we’re finally at that point, where large European and it’s primarily European, lesser extent Asian customers are embracing the concept.

In Outsourcing those structural margins you see in Outsourcing of low teens are probably close to what they probably are, what the incremental margins are or less as because as I said many times you onboard the cost before you get the revenues. But though that having been said, if you just keep in your model margins for general outsourcing in the low double-digits, you’re going to get it right.

If it’s the bid ask, if it’s an event of some sort, in this case the sovereign debt issues in Europe, capital markets move very quickly. You can cancel the sales in one minute phone call and once that uncertainty goes away, it doesn’t really matter directionally where it goes, once buyers and sellers believe that they can forecast their future a bit better, typically and historically that capital markets business returns. So, if I just use history as a lesson or a guide here, I would say that there’s more certainty now that this can’s been kicked down the road a bit, maybe not sold forever but sold for a while and that should bring some enthusiasm back to that European sale market.

So, there is something very fundamental going on in this Outsourcing business and I think its two things.
One, I think that in difficult markets and we kind of went from enthusiasm in the markets to despair this year, in difficult markets there is a real momentum around Outsourcing to reduce cost. The second I think more important dynamic here is that we believe and of course everyone else will say it’s about their firm, but we believe we have a clear competitive advantage in this business than we’ve had in the past and our win rate which is close to a 100%, I think demonstrates that.

So, I’ll be learning and Gil and our team will be learning a lot more over the next month, month and half about how our - each country, each city feels in Europe about that question. I would say, in absence of that data which we don’t have yet, it would - I think be logical to forecast that we’re going to go back to this incremental recovery that we talked about at the last five quarters on this call, that incremental recovery being probably something that’s a growth rate less than the hockey stick but growth nonetheless. And that’s as far as I want to take it right now because we’re, as I said, we don’t have the data yet and maybe we should wait till we see what those pipelines look like before we give an answer to that specifically.

So, and let me be more clear, if we’re looking at a transformative acquisition which we have lots of experience in, and we were dead certain what the expense synergies would be and what the cash flow from that acquisition would be, we’d probably comfortable in levering up to make that acquisition. With the construct, we would de-lever as fast as we could. And that’s been our model, Sloan, which is we’re not afraid to lever up to get the right kind of acquisition but there’s very few acquisitions of any size that we would probably do right now to take at sort of that level of net debt-to-EBITDA. Our sweet spot, what we want to maintain over the long-term our net debt to EBITDA something between 1.5 and 2 times and so we levered up a bit for ING. In the absence of a transformative acquisition, you should expect that ratio be coming down until we hit our comfort range again. I’d also tell that, Sloan, we’re not any more the company that’s comfortable with four times which we were back at the MBO and back in 2001. I think those days are far behind us.

So, valuations at the moment for those kinds of businesses after the synergies will be extracted from them you should expect those to be in the single digits. Some we’re looking at right now are coming in low, call it the five, six range. Others that are more mature business, more stable type of cash flow are coming at the higher end of that single-digit range.
But the M&A market at the moment is surprisingly active at the small end. I mean I think we all get it at the big end there are some really distressed companies out there in our space but at the small end there seem to be more and more small companies that are concluding that it just isn’t possible to compete any more as a small company and joining the large firm, whether it’s us Sir Jones Lang or somebody else, it’s probably a better way to take care of their customers. I would tell you the total amount we spent on those in-fields was $12 million. Gil just pointed out to me, it’s actually in his script for the call. So, I guess we did call that out and it’s $12 million.

Please turn to Slide 4. This quarter, our strong performance in evidence of the continued commercial real estate recovery comes against the backdrop of persistent sovereign debt concerns in Europe and tepid economic unemployment growth in the U.S.
Revenue growth for CBRE was strong in the third quarter. Total company revenue was over $1.5 billion, representing a 21% increase over the third quarter of 2010. This growth was balanced across all geographies in most service lines. leasing revenue increased 19% in the third quarter of 2011, with all regions increasing by double digits in the quarter. The largest percentage gains in leasing were in Asia Pacific and EMEA.
outsourcing revenue accelerated significantly in the third quarter of 2011 with growth of 19%. All geographies had double-digit growth with EMEA leading the other 2 regions.
Investment sales growth was 23% for the total company, entirely driven by the Americas as EMEA and Asia Pacific were essentially flat. Investment Management revenue showed a significant increase from higher asset management fees primarily driven by CBRE Clarion Securities, which we acquired on July 1st, as well as higher incentive fees.
Normalized EBITDA increased to $194.8 million from $175.5 million. Our normalized EBITDA margin was 12.7% versus 13.9% in the third quarter of 2010. This margin comparison is impacted by an unfavorable variance of 60 basis points resulting from an increase in net carried interest compensation expense in our Investment Management business this year versus last. Another 60 basis point unfavorable variance was due to increased legal reserves associated with 2 unrelated cases and insurance reserves on claims within our Appraisal & Valuation business, which date back to the downturn.
Despite these variances as well as higher outsourcing business mix and increased staffing in EMEA, which also contributed to lower operating leverage in the quarter, we are still not satisfied with the overall EBITDA margin result and fully expect our cost reduction measures to show greater impact in the fourth quarter of 2011. Because of this, we reiterate our expectation that full year 2011 normalized EBITDA margin will exceed full year 2010 normalized EBITDA margin.
Some of the most significant transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown here on Slide 5. As usual, I will not go through them individually, but we have included them for your review.
I will now turn the call over to Gil to go over financial results in detail."

This increase resulted from strong growth in all business lines with the exception of development services. Normalized EBITDA was up 11% to $194.8 million in the third quarter of 2011 from a $175.5 million in the third quarter of 2010, delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 12.7%. Without the impact of the $7.4 million of carried interest compensation expense this year versus a reversal of $1.4 million last year and the $8.6 million impact of legal and insurance reserves taken in the quarter that Brett just mentioned, normalized EBITDA would have grown by about 21% and normalized EBITDA margin would have been almost flat compared to last year.
Our cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased very slightly to 58.3% in the third quarter of 2011 versus 58.1% in the third quarter of 2010. Third quarter 2011 operating expenses as a percent of total revenue increased by a 100 basis points to 30.6% versus 29.6% in the third quarter of 2010. This was driven by the aforementioned carried interest expense, legal and insurance reserves as well as the inclusion of CBRE Clarion Securities expenses, all of which flowed through operating expense as opposed to cost of services.
Interest expense decreased by $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower interest rates resulting from our refinancing activities in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Our third quarter 2011 normalized tax rate was approximately 40%, and we also expect it to be approximately 40% for the full year 2011. Third quarter 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.20 versus $0.18 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.24 as compared to $0.20 in the third quarter of 2010.
Please turn to Slide 7. Property & Facilities Management was again our largest service line in the third quarter of 2011, representing 34% of total revenue in the quarter after growing 19% versus the third quarter of 2010.
leasing was our second largest service line in the third quarter of 2011, also reporting a 19% revenue increase versus the third quarter of 2010, which experienced a 27% increase over the third quarter of 2009. leasing represented 32% of total company revenue in the third quarter of 2011. 
Investment sales growth slowed a bit but was still strong with an increase of 23% in the third quarter of 2011, another meaningful improvement following a gain of 63% in the third quarter of 2010 versus the third quarter of 2009.
Appraisal & Valuation revenue improved 26% in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010. This was driven by large portfolio assignments globally, continued strength in U.S. capital market activities and an acquisition in Asia Pacific in the second quarter of 2011. 
Global Investment Management revenue increased 93% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in asset management and incentive fees. Commercial Mortgage Brokerage revenue increased 32% driven by solid capital availability, favorable interest rates and the continued search for yield by investors.
Development Services revenue was down 21%, primarily due to lower rental revenue resulting from property dispositions.
Revenue from Property & Facilities Management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 58% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 8. The outsourcing business growth rate accelerated this quarter, with revenue up 19% versus the third quarter of 2010. This was driven by record setting new account growth, continued strong client renewals and expansions, and acquisitions in EMEA. Strong performance is evident across all regions with EMEA posting the largest revenue increase.
In the third quarter, we set another record and signed 49 total long-term contracts. This exceeds the previous quarterly record, which was 47, in the second quarter of 2011. This is also the third straight record setting quarter in which we signed 20 new accounts, which is itself a record, 17 renewals and 12 expansions.
The revenue and RFP pipelines in this business continue to be very healthy with more assignments that are global in nature. Robust activity has helped us add nearly 1 billion square feet job portfolio in just 2 years.
Slide 9 demonstrates the stabilized or improving vacancy rates and positive absorption in the third quarter of 2011 for all 3 market sectors depicted, along with our forecasted improvement in all 3 areas for 2012. Average national office cap rates remained stable in the third quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of 2011 and showed improvement versus the third quarter of 2010 driven by core and class A property sales.
Please turn to Slide 10. Sales revenue in the Americas continued to be strong with a 42% increase in the third quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2010. Our U.S. investment sales market share totaled 14.3% for the third quarter of 2011 according to real capital analytics. This share was more than 470 basis points larger than our nearest competitor.
Our Americas leasing revenue grew 11% in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010, which grew 36% over the third quarter of 2009. Fundamentals remained solid despite challenges experienced in the U.S. economic recovery. During the third quarter of 2011, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained unchanged at 16.2%.
Given the increased weighting of outsourcing overall and the particular growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific in the last few years, we have decided to add regional color on outsourcing in each of our regional revenue slides. The Americas outsourcing business grew a strong 13% in the third quarter of 2011, which is consistent with its year-to-date 2011 growth rate.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our investment sales revenue in EMEA eased by 3% in the third quarter of 2011, attributable to cautious trading linked to concerns of the sovereign debt challenges. Despite this, strong sales were evident in France and Germany. CBRE’s EMEA leasing revenue posted excellent growth with a 33% improvement in the third quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2010. These positive results came despite macro issues and were driven by the UK, France and Germany. outsourcing contributed more than $30 million of the revenue improvement in EMEA’s third quarter 2011 results and represented an impressive 48% increase for the quarter driven by new assignments.
Second quarter 2011 acquisitions in Central and Eastern Europe and Switzerland also made positive contributions to revenue growth this quarter. The revenue mix this quarter, with outsourcing accounting for 5 percentage points more of total revenue and sales declining by a light percentage, had a notable negative impact on EBITDA margins quarter-over-quarter. However, the absolute quarter-over-quarter EBITDA growth was pleasing in such a tough economic environment.
Please turn to Slide 12. CBRE sales revenue in Asia Pacific was essentially flat in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010. CBRE’s leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew by a dramatic 41% in the third quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2010. The strongest gains came from Australia, China and Singapore. outsourcing growth in Asia Pacific was a solid 21% in the third quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2010 as outsourcing continues to gain adoption in this region.
Please turn to Slide 13. Revenue for the Development Services segment was $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2011 versus $22 million in the third quarter of 2010. Operating results for the third quarter of 2011 for this segment included normalized EBITDA of $5.2 million as compared to $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2010. Third quarter 2010 EBITDA benefited from higher gains from the sale of properties, primarily reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and income from discontinued operations on our income statements.
At September 30, 2011, in process development totaled $5.1 billion, up $200 million from both December 31, 2010, and the end of the third quarter of 2010. The pipeline at September 30, 2011, rose to $1.5 billion, up $300 million from year-end 2010 and up $400 million from the end of the third quarter of 2010, which indicates continued improvement in this sector. At the end of the third quarter, our equity client investments in the development services business totaled $81.6 million.
Please turn to Slide 14. On July 1, 2011, we closed the ING Clarion real estate securities portion of the ING Real Estate Investment Management, or ING REIM, as transaction for consideration of approximately $324 million. We also acquired core investment positions of approximately $59 million in select sponsored funds.
On October 3, just after the third quarter ended, we closed on the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for consideration of approximately $45 million and core investments of approximately $17 million. We remain on schedule to close ING REIM Europe by the end of the year.
In the third quarter of 2011, our Global Investment Management segment’s revenue was up 56% to $77.4 million from $49.5 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees primarily stemming from the ING Clarion Securities acquisition and higher incentive fees.
Assets under management or AUM totaled $53.5 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2011, up 42% from year-end 2010 and 50% higher than at the end of the third quarter of 2010. The third quarter 2011 total includes listed securities of $18.5 billion.
Changes in market valuation and net redemptions in the securities portfolio decreased assets under management by $4.6 billion in the quarter versus the second quarter of 2011. In addition, a change in our calculation methodology to confirm reporting between CBRE investors and ING REIM decreased AUM in the direct real estate business by $1.6 billion during the quarter versus the second quarter of 2011. Currency fluctuations further lowered total assets by $600 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. The third quarter of 2011 total does not include $5 billion of AUM acquired from ING REIM in Asia on October 3, 2011.
During the third quarter, we completed approximately $900 million of acquisitions and approximately $800 million of dispositions globally. Year-to-date 2011, we have raised new capital of approximately $1.5 billion and had approximately $2.1 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our core investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled a $157.2 million.
Our Global Investment Management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on Slide 15. In the third quarter of 2011, we incurred $9.4 billion of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisition, primarily for legal and other professional services. During the quarter, we also wrote down the value of 2 core investments for a total of $4.5 million. In the third quarter of 2011, we reported $7.4 million of carried interest compensation expense, which relates to expected future periods carried interest revenue.
As of September 30, 2011, the company maintains a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $33 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated as a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 35% for the third quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 16. Slide 16 shows our amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. During the third quarter of 2011, we drew down our $400 million Term Loan C to fund the closing of ING REIM Asia and in preparation for closing ING REIM Europe. The terms are LIBOR plus 3.25% with 1% annual amortization and maturity in 2018. We previously announced that we will not be using equity to fund this acquisition.
On October 18, 2011, we entered into discussions with our vendors for a new incremental senior secured sterling denominated term loan A-1 facility in the amount of approximately $250 million due in May 2016 with a term substantially similar to our existing term loan A facility. To date, we have commitments from our bank partners to fund over 90% of this $250 million facility. 
We remain very comfortable with our balanced debt maturity profile, with no meaningful maturities until 2015. We’re also pleased with our strong overall balance sheet position as a provider of the necessary flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they appear in this early stage of the commercial real estate recovery.
Please turn to Slide 17. Excluding our nonrecourse real estate loans, mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities and cash within consolidated funds at other entities but not available for company use, our total net debt at the end of the third quarter of 2011 was approximately $1.5 billion. This represents an increase from year-end 2010 primarily due to term loan borrowings to finance the acquisition of ING Clarion Securities. During the third quarter, the company also used $12 million to fund 2 in-field acquisitions in Europe, a retail services business in the United Kingdom and a shopping center management business in the Netherlands. We will continue to see consolidation pressure in the industry which we believe may present good opportunities for more acquisitions at attract the evaluations.
At September 30th 2011, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.5% compared to 6.2% at the end of the second quarter of 2011. The lower average interest rate was primarily driven by a larger portion of lower interest rate debt due to the term loan borrowings to fund our ING REIM at the end of the second and in the third quarter.
Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.55x at the end of the third quarter of 2011 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to EBITDA stood at 1.98x, which remains just below our current target of 2x. We continue to anticipate that this ratio will be approximately 2.5x post the acquisition of all of ING REIM.
I will now turn the call back over to Brett."

And please turn to Slide 18. Despite foreign debt challenges in Europe and uncertainty in the economic recovery in the U.S., we continue to believe that we are in the early stages of a cyclical recovery. outsourcing fundamentals remained very strong as evidenced by the strong growth this quarter and revenues should continue to grow in the double digits for the intermediate term. The ING REIM acquisition will provide another significant source of stable, growing revenue that will be accretive to our overall EBITDA margin. In addition, we expect to see increased revenue flowing to our other lines of business as the ING REIM operations are integrated. The final piece of the ING REIM acquisition will close as scheduled during the fourth quarter. When it does, we will hold a special call to discuss that business in much more detail.
Investment sales should continue to grow due to financing availability for core assets, investor appetite per yield and attractiveness of the asset class as an inflation hedge. leasing growth rate should revert to historical norms as the economy begins to stabilize. We remain focused on margins balanced with strategic recruiting in the appropriate service lines and geographies. We continue to expect EPS to be within our initial guidance range of $0.95 to a $1.05 for the full year. Our full year normalized EBITDA margin should exceed prior year.

It’s higher than our full year margin for 2010. And you can do any kind of math you want to do. But you’re right, that would imply that we are fairly confident around the business lines at the moment and we are. When you look at the third quarter numbers, it’s striking to me that both leasing and sales globally showed good increase, sales only in the U.S. but leasing in all 3 geographies. And again, as I think as you know, Anthony, if there’s one good leading indicator of job growth and of growth, I think, in the revenues for this industry, you probably pick leasing because these are large corporate customers entering the marketplace committing to long-term space leases. So we like what we saw on the third quarter. We particular like that the leasing numbers held up quite well and that’s about as far as I think I can take that."

These are massive, massive opportunities both here in United States and outside the States. And I will say that the outsourcing of that type of work, we’ve just begun the scratch the surface.

You may recall Anthony or perhaps you don’t, but Trammell Crow had a very deep and very specific healthcare outsourcing business. They get Baylor [ph] down in Texas, they still have that account. And that expertise really jump-started our firm's exploitation of that market. Now as it pertains to outside United States in terms of why that growth rate is high and what we expect for the future, remember first of all, there’s been virtually no outsourcing in those 2 geographies historically. I think the seminal point here or the data point that’s most interesting to us is that it appears that this is a trend that has now caught on. And we saw some very large pieces of business in those geographies led, of course, by our PRU [ph] business in the U.K.. But, I think that we’re finally at that point, where large European -- and it’s primarily European, lesser extent Asian, customers are embracing the concept."

If it’s the bid ask, if it’s an event of some sort, in this case the sovereign debt issues in Europe, capital markets move very quickly. You can cancel a sale in a 1-minute phone call. And once that uncertainty goes away, it doesn’t really matter directionally where it goes, once buyers and sellers believe that they can forecast their future a bit better, typically and historically that capital markets business returns. So if I just use history as a lesson or a guide here, I would say that there’s more certainty now that this can’s been kicked down the road a bit, maybe not sold forever but sold for a while and that should bring some enthusiasm back to that European sale market."

The second I think more important dynamic here is that we believe, and of course everyone else will say it’s about their firm, but we believe we have a clear competitive advantage in this business than we’ve had in the past.

With the construct, we would de-lever as fast as we could. And that’s been our model, Sloan, which is we’re not afraid to lever up to get the right kind of acquisition, but there’s very few acquisitions of any size that we would probably do right now to take at sort of that level of net debt-to-EBITDA. Our sweet spot, what we want to maintain over the long-term, our net debt to EBITDA something between 1.5 and 2x. And so we levered up a bit for ING.
