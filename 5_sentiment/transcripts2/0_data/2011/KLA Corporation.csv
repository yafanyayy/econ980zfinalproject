Thank you all for joining our call today. I'll focus commentary my on summary highlights of our December quarter results and then provide guidance for March, then I'll turn the call over to Mark for a more detailed review of the financials, and we'll conclude with M&A. 
KLA-Tencor ended calendar year 2010 with an outstanding December quarter. We delivered record shipments, revenue and non-GAAP net income. And we begin 2011 with good momentum as we head into the year. These achievements are the results of the company's technology and market leadership, our growth from adoption and new markets. It also demonstrates great execution by the KLA-Tencor team in meeting customer needs and driving operational excellence in a very healthy industry cycle environment. 
Here are some highlights of the Q2 results. New bookings in the December quarter came in at $725 million. Shipments increased 22% to a record $828 million in Q2. Over the past several years, we have transitioned the manufacturing and multiple products to facilities in Singapore and Israel and these operations continue to perform at a very high level and yield significant cost advantages. Revenues grew 12% sequentially in December to a record $766 million, significantly above the range of guidance. And excluding some one-time charges, we achieved a new high in non-GAAP net income of $187 million or $1.10 per diluted share in Q2. Finally, cash flow from operations was also very strong in Q2, coming in at $194 million and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and investments. These results show clearly that our long-term strategies are working, our business model is showcasing its strong profit and cash generation ability. 
Turning now into some specifics on the current demand picture, Q2 orders reflected another quarter of high demand from the foundries, with foundry bookings at 72% of total new orders in the December quarter. The foundries are investing at a very high level to advance their technology roadmaps and to add capacity and to keep pace with the rapid growth in advanced tablet designs. Logic was 8% of bookings in December, driven by the continued migration to 22 nanometers. Recent commentary from our leading Logic customers point to an anticipated significant increase in CapEx budget for calendar 2011 in order to further expand their global manufacturing capabilities. Finally, bookings from memory customers were 20% of the total in the December quarter. While Q2 memory demand was below the recent trend lines due to some shifts in order timing, we expect memory orders to recover in the March quarter, driven by an increase in NAND flash investment. 
Let me turn my focus to our view of what's in store for calendar 2011. Current external market estimates have semiconductor revenues forecasted to grow in the mid-single digits for calendar 2011. It the recently announced increase in some of our foundry and logic customers CapEx forecast for the year, SEMICON equipment fundamentals appear solid, with a positive outlook for growth in equipment spending in the year ahead. In the memory market, while DRAM pricing continues to lay on the industry, industry forecasts call for a significant increase in NAND flash capital investment in 2011 in order to support bit growth rate projections in the range of 80% to 90% for the year. As our customers execute their investment strategies at the leading edge, each successive generation of new technology is characterized by increasing process complexity, shorter market windows and more challenging yield requirement. Process controls on the critical path for successful management of these complex technical challenges and as the market leader, KLA-Tencor's position to continue to benefit from higher adoption of inspection and measurement as our customers move ahead with their advanced technology roadmaps. 
To summarize, the December quarter was an outstanding finish to a very successful calendar year 2010 for KLA-Tencor. Our numbers show the company is operating at a very high level, delivering record results in a period of very strong market demand. This performance also illustrates the strength of our long-term strategies, the value of our market leadership and the significant leverage in our industry-leading business model. 
Moving now to the March quarter guidance. Gross bookings are projected to be up 5% to up 25% in the third quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $780 million to $830 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.15 to $1.30 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the financial results for the quarter. Mark?"
282225,118354678,96301,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in the non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, e",1153,"Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in the non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses, which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Both in my prepared remarks on operations, we'll refer to non-GAAP information but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available on our website. The differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are: Acquisition-related amortization charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes; a $4 million non-cash tax credit for intra-year recovery of our cumulative shortfall position in employee stock activity; removing this credit from GAAP earnings reduced our non-GAAP earnings by $0.02 per share. We had about $1 million in restatement-related charges and about $1 million of other GAAP only gains, which offset each other and had no impact on EPS. Q2 new orders were $725 million. Net orders were $726 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter to quarter changed distribution order as follows. U.S. was 19% of new systems orders in Q2, down from 21% in the September quarter. Europe was 10% of new systems orders, up from 4% in Q1. Japan was 5%, down from 7% last quarter. Korea was 15%, down from 24% last quarter. Taiwan was 45%, up from 34% last quarter and the rest of Asia was 5%, down from 10% in Q1. 
Q2 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter to quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection was 30% compared with 49% last quarter; reticle inspection was 26%, up from 11% last quarter; metrology was 20%, up from 17% in prior quarter. Server, storage, LED and other non-semi was 5%, down from 6% last quarter. And services were 19% of new orders in Q2, up from 17% last quarter. 
Foundry customers comprised 72% of semiconductor systems orders in Q2 versus 44% in Q1. Logic customers were 8% of new systems orders in Q2 versus 18% in Q1. And memory systems orders were 20% in Q2, down from 38% in Q1. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q3 will be within a range of up 5% to up 25% from the December quarter. In Q2, we shipped $828 million versus $677 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both systems shipments and services revenue and we expect a similar shipment level for Q3. The backlog at the end of Q2 decreased slightly from September 30 and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in total systems backlog. Backlog at December 31, 2010, included $396 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that had not yet shipped. 
Total revenue for Q2 was $766 million, up 12% from $682 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q2 was up 14% to $628 million compared with $551 million in Q1. And services revenue was $138 million in Q2, up about $7 million from Q1. Our expectation for total revenue in Q3 is a range between $780 million and $830 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60% in the December quarter, down two percentage points from September. Gross margin percentage decrease from last quarter was largely a function of product mix. For Q3, we are modeling a gross margin percentage improvement a little better than our long-term model of 57% incremental margin improvement on the expected Q3 revenue increase. 
Operating expenses were $184 million, up about $4 million from the September quarter and we expect a small increase in our operating expenses in Q3. OIE was a net $18 million expense in Q2, about $6 million higher than Q1. The OIE increase over last quarter was largely attributable to writing down an equity investment in our venture portfolio. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $30 million in Q3. 
In Q2, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $72 million or 28% of pretax income versus $63 million in Q1, which is 27% of pretax income. The tax rate increase largely arose from a change in the distribution of earnings between U.S. and lower-taxed international operations, offset by the effects of reinstating the R&D Tax Credit during Q2. Non-GAAP net income was $187 million or $1.10 per share in Q2. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share would've been $1.07 per share. The revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q3 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.15 and $1.30 per share. 
The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q2 were 169.5 million versus 169.8 million in Q1. During Q2, we spent $58 million repurchasing about 1.6 million shares and as of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 1.7 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the March quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q3. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, up about $100 million from the end of September. Cash generated from operations was $194 million in Q2 compared with $96 million in Q1. The improved operating cash generation largely resulted from $140 million more in customer collections and the collections increase was offset by higher income tax payments and their semiannual interest payment. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $531 million, up from $500 million at September 30. DSOs were 63 at December 31 versus 67 at the end of September. Both DSO figures are net of allowance from uncollectible accounts and factory. Net inventories increased by $41 million from September 30 and ended the quarter at $505 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP posted revenues was 2.6 turns in Q2 versus 2.3 turns in Q1. Capital expenditures were $12 million in Q2 versus $11 million in Q1 and we completed the sale of our vacated, which resulted in $18 million of net cash proceeds. Total headcount at December 31 was 5,267, up from 5,180 at December 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q3. In summary, our guidance for Q3 is: New orders up 5% to 25% from Q2; total revenue between $780 million and $830 million; non-GAAP EPS between $1.15 and $1.30. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

In foundry, there continues to be strong investment in foundry and I think we'll see that in the first half. But there's also projects that we see on the books now for second half.

You have to have been on the street to meet the demand.

So we're pretty confident that foundry's going to continue to be robust through 2011."

One, foundry is going through a couple of changes, I think if you look fundamentally over the last few quarters. One is they're finally having to add technology and capacity to compensate for IBM's having shipped to a lot of their manufacturing in the foundries. So that was one trend driving intensity. The other trend that drives it for us is the fact that they need to be able to handle multiple process flows and they need to have the ability to get a better handle on their yields. So they don't start too many wafers there. They start too few and so that drives it for us and we benefited from that. And then the other factor I guess is there's increased competition now. So overall, I think the intensity is going up because there's multiple players trying to get part of that growth segment. So all of those are favorable factors. Memory on the other hand, it had probably as we know had more capacity than the market could support. And so that certainly didn't drive intensity up and they don't have some of the same dynamics quite yet. So I model overall PDC, we're very conservative in our modeling but it probably is flat to up slightly in terms of overall adoption over the next couple of years. But really, we think if anything, that's the upside in our earnings model and as we review it out for the next five years, we think there's good chance we just have to make it happen in terms of making sure our products provide that value for our customers. But all the drives are driving more intensity and that favors us if we can continue to execute on our product roadmap."

Part of the reason that you can get a quarter to quarter mix phenomenon is just the way we do some of the cost accounting on when we ship a tool. The customer orders are based tool now with an option to upgrade. We basically cost out the entire cost of the tool, both the base tool today and the option upgrade in the future. So when we get that order in the future with the upgrade that comes in at almost 100% margin. So when we say product mix, it's more complex than just coming out of this family or that family. It actually can get into what is actually the nature of the order. So if there's enough new tools going out with future options in them, you're actually going to get a relatively lower margin operating quarter, with the knowledge that at some point in the future, you're going to get margin rich revenue coming through.

And we began 2011 with good momentum as we head into the year. These achievements are the results of the company's technology and market leadership, our growth from adoption and new markets. It also demonstrates great execution by the KLA-Tencor team in meeting customer needs and driving operational excellence in a very healthy industry cycle environment. 
Here are some highlights of the Q2 results. New bookings in the December quarter came in at $725 million. Shipments increased 22% to a record $828 million in Q2. Over the past several years, we have transitioned the manufacturing of multiple products to facilities in Singapore and Israel, and these operations continue to perform at a very high level and yield significant cost advantages. Revenues grew 12% sequentially in December to a record $766 million, significantly above the range of guidance. And excluding some one-time charges, we achieved a new high in non-GAAP net income of $187 million or $1.10 per diluted share in Q2. Finally, cash flow from operations was also very strong in Q2, coming in at $194 million, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and investments. These results show clearly that our long-term strategies are working, our business model is showcasing its strong profit and cash generation ability. 
Turning now into some specifics on the current demand picture. Q2 orders reflected another quarter of high demand from the foundries, with foundry bookings at 72% of total new orders in the December quarter. The foundries are investing at a very high level to advance their technology roadmaps and to add capacity and to keep pace with the rapid growth in advanced tablet designs. Logic was 8% of bookings in December, driven by the continued migration to 22 nanometers. Recent commentary from our leading Logic customers point to an anticipated significant increase in CapEx budget for calendar 2011 in order to further expand their global manufacturing capabilities. Finally, bookings from Memory customers were 20% of the total in the December quarter. While Q2 Memory demand was below the recent trend lines due to some shifts in order timing, we expect Memory orders to recover in the March quarter, driven by an increase in NAND flash investment. 
Let me turn my focus to our view of what's in store for calendar 2011. Current external market estimates have semiconductor revenues forecasted to grow in the mid- ingle digits for calendar 2011. And with recently announced increase in some of our Foundry and Logic customers' CapEx forecast for the year, semi cap equipment market fundamentals appear solid, with a positive outlook for growth in equipment spending in the year ahead. In the memory market, while DRAM pricing continues to weight on the industry, industry forecasts call for a significant increase in NAND flash capital investment in 2011 in order to support bit growth rate projections in the range of 80% to 90% for the year. As our customers execute their investment strategies at the leading edge, each successive generation of new technology is characterized by increasing process complexity, shorter market windows and more challenging yield requirement. Process control's on the critical path for successful management of these complex technical challenges. And as the market leader, KLA-Tencor is positioned to continue to benefit from higher adoption of inspection and measurement as our customers move ahead with their advanced technology roadmaps. 
To summarize, the December quarter was an outstanding finish to a very successful calendar year 2010 for KLA-Tencor. Our numbers show the company is operating at a very high level, delivering record results in a period of very strong market demand. This performance also illustrates the strength of our long-term strategies, the value of our market leadership and the significant leverage in our industry-leading business model. 
Moving now to the March quarter guidance. Gross bookings are projected to be up 5% to up 25% in the third quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $780 million to $830 million, and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.15 to $1.30 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the financial results for the quarter. Mark?"
282225,118354678,96599,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats: One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, exp",1162,"Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats: One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses, which are outside of our core operations such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations, we'll refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. 
The differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are: Acquisition-related amortization charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes; a $4 million non-cash tax credit for inter-year recovery of our cumulative shortfall position in employee stock activity, removing this credit from GAAP earnings reduced our non-GAAP earnings by $0.02 per share. We had about $1 million in restatement-related charges and about $1 million of other GAAP only gains, which offset each other and had no impact on EPS. Q2 new orders were $725 million. Net orders were $726 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter to quarter changed the distribution order as follows: The U.S. was 19% of new systems orders in Q2, down from 21% in the September quarter; Europe was 10% of new systems orders, up from 4% in Q1; Japan was 5%, down from 7% last quarter; Korea was 16%, down from 24% last quarter; Taiwan was 45%, up from 34% last quarter and; the rest of Asia was 5%, down from 10% in Q1. 
Q2 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter to quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection was 30% compared with 49% last quarter; reticle inspection was 26%, up from 11% last quarter; metrology was 20%, up from 17% in prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 5%, down from 6% last quarter; and services were 19% of new orders in Q2, up from 17% last quarter.  Foundry customers comprised 72% of semiconductor systems orders in Q2 versus 44% in Q1. Logic customers were 8% of new systems orders in Q2 versus 18% in Q1. And Memory systems orders were 20% in Q2, down from 38% in Q1. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q3 will be within a range of up 5% to up 25% from the December quarter. 
In Q2, we shipped $828 million versus $677 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both systems shipments and services revenue and we expect a similar shipment level for Q3. The backlog at the end of Q2 decreased slightly from September 30, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in total systems backlog. Backlog at December 31, 2010 included $396 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced, but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped. 
Total revenue for Q2 was $766 million, up 12% from $682 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q2 was up 14% to $628 million compared with $551 million in Q1. And services revenue was $138 million in Q2, up about $7 million from Q1. Our expectation for total revenue in Q3 is a range between $780 million and $830 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60% in the December quarter, down two percentage points from September. Gross margin percentage decrease from last quarter was largely a function of product mix. For Q3, we are modeling a gross margin percentage improvement a little better than our long-term model of 60% to 70% incremental margin improvement on the expected Q3 revenue increase. 
Operating expenses were $184 million, up about $4 million from the September quarter and we expect a small increase in our operating expenses in Q3. OIE was a net $18 million expense in Q2, about $6 million higher than Q1. The OIE increase over the last quarter was largely attributable to writing down an equity investment in our venture portfolio. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $30 million in Q3. 
In Q2, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $72 million or 28% of pretax income versus $63 million in Q1, which is 27% of pretax income. The tax rate increase largely arose from a change in the distribution of earnings between U.S. and lower-taxed international operations, offset by the effects of reinstating the R&D Tax Credit during Q2. Non-GAAP net income was $187 million or $1.10 per share in Q2. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share would've been $1.07 per share. The revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q3 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.15 and $1.30 per share. 
The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q2 were 169.5 million versus 169.8 million in Q1. During Q2, we spent $58 million repurchasing about 1.6 million shares and as of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 1.7 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the March quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q3. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, up about $100 million from the end of September. Cash generated from operations was $194 million in Q2 compared with $96 million in Q1. The improved operating cash generation largely resulted from $140 million more in customer collections, and the collections increase was offset by higher income tax payments and their semiannual interest payment. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $531 million, up from $500 million at September 30. DSOs were 63 at December 31 versus 67 at the end of September. Both DSO figures are net of allowance from uncollectible accounts and factory. Net inventories increased by $41 million from September 30 and ended the quarter at $505 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.6 turns in Q2 versus 2.3 turns in Q1. Capital expenditures were $12 million in Q2 versus $11 million in Q1, and we completed the sale of our vacated San Jose campus, which resulted in $18 million in net cash proceeds.  Total headcount at December 31 was 5,267, up from 5,180 at December 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q3. 
In summary, our guidance for Q3 is: new orders up 5% to 25% from Q2; total revenue between $780 million and $830 million; non-GAAP EPS between $1.15 and $1.30. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

You have to have feet on the street to meet the demand.

One, Foundry is going through a couple of changes, I think, if you look fundamentally over the last few quarters. One is they're finally having to add technology and capacity to compensate for iDMs having shifted a lot of their manufacturing to the foundries. So that was one trend driving intensity. The other trend that drives it for us is the fact that they need to be able to handle multiple process flows and they need to have the ability to get a better handle on their yields. So they don't start too many wafers,  they start too few and so that drives it for us and we benefited from that. And then the other factor, I guess, is there's increased competition now. So overall, I think the intensity is going up because there's multiple players trying to get part of that growth segment. So all those are favorable factors. Where Memory, on the other hand, it had probably as we know had more capacity than the market could support. And so that certainly didn't drive intensity up, and they don't have some of the same dynamics quite yet. So I model, overall PDC, we're very conservative in our modeling, but it probably is flat to up slightly in terms of overall adoption over the next couple of years. But really we think, if anything, that's the upside in our earnings model, and as we review it out for the next five years, we think there's good chance we just have to make it happen in terms of making sure our products provide that value for our customers. But all the drivers are driving more intensity and that favors us if we can continue to execute on our product roadmap."

Part of the reason that you can get a quarter-to-quarter mix phenomenon is just the way we do some of the cost accounting on when we ship a tool. The customer orders a base tool now with an option to upgrade. We basically cost out the entire cost of the tool, both the base tool today and the option upgrade in the future. So when we get that order in the future with the upgrade, that comes in at almost 100% margin. So when we say product mix, it's more complex than just it's coming out of this family or that family. It actually can get into what is actually the nature of the order. So if there's enough new tools going out with future options on them, you're actually going to get a relatively lower margin operating quarter, with the knowledge that at some point in the future, you're going to get margin rich revenue coming through. So that's an example. So when we say product mix, it's a pretty complex answer actually"

KLA-Tencor ended calendar year 2010 with an outstanding December quarter. We delivered record shipments, revenue and non-GAAP net income. And we began 2011 with good momentum as we head into the year. This achievement’s the result of the company's technology and market leadership, our growth from adoption and new markets. It also demonstrates great execution by the KLA-Tencor team in meeting customer needs and driving operational excellence in a very healthy industry cycle environment. 
Here are some highlights of the Q2 results. New bookings in the December quarter came in at $725 million. Shipments increased 22% to a record $828 million in Q2. Over the past several years, we have transitioned the manufacturing of multiple products to facilities in Singapore and Israel, and these operations continue to perform at a very high level and yield significant cost advantages. Revenues grew 12% sequentially in December to a record $766 million, significantly above the range of guidance. And excluding some one-time charges, we achieved a new high in non-GAAP net income of $187 million or $1.10 per diluted share in Q2. Finally, cash flow from operations was also very strong in Q2, coming in at $194 million, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and investments. These results show clearly that our long-term strategies are working, our business model is showcasing its strong profit and cash generation ability. 
Turning now into some specifics on the current demand picture. Q2 orders reflected another quarter of high demand from the foundries, with foundry bookings at 72% of total new orders in the December quarter. The foundries are investing at a very high level to advance their technology roadmaps and to add capacity and to keep pace with the rapid growth in advanced tablet [ph] designs. Logic was 8% of bookings in December, driven by the continued migration to 22 nanometers. Recent commentary from our leading Logic customers point to an anticipated significant increase in CapEx budget for calendar 2011 in order to further expand their global manufacturing capabilities. Finally, bookings from Memory customers were 20% of the total in the December quarter. While Q2 Memory demand was below the recent trend lines due to some shifts in order timing, we expect Memory orders to recover in the March quarter, driven by an increase in NAND flash investment. 
Let me turn my focus to our view of what's in store for calendar 2011. Current external market estimates have semiconductor revenues forecasted to grow in the mid-single digits for calendar 2011. And with recently announced increase in some of our Foundry and Logic customers' CapEx forecast for the year, semi cap equipment market fundamentals appear solid, with a positive outlook for growth in equipment spending in the year ahead. In the Memory market, while DRAM pricing continues to weigh on the industry, industry forecasts call for a significant increase in NAND flash capital investment in 2011 in order to support bit growth rate projections in the range of 80% to 90% for the year. As our customers execute their investment strategies at the leading edge, each successive generation of new technology is characterized by increasing process complexity, shorter market windows and more challenging yield requirement. Process control's on the critical path for successful management of these complex technical challenges. And as the market leader, KLA-Tencor is positioned to continue to benefit from higher adoption of inspection and measurement as our customers move ahead with their advanced technology roadmaps. 
To summarize, the December quarter was an outstanding finish to a very successful calendar year 2010 for KLA-Tencor. Our numbers show the company is operating at a very high level, delivering record results in a period of very strong market demand. This performance also illustrates the strength of our long-term strategies, the value of our market leadership and the significant leverage in our industry-leading business model. 
Moving now to the March quarter guidance. Gross bookings are projected to be up 5% to up 25% in the third quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $780 million to $830 million, and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.15 to $1.30 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the financial results for the quarter. Mark?"

Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats: One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, exp",1156,"Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats: One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options-related litigation and certain costs and expenses, which are outside of our core operations such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. 
The differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are: Acquisition-related amortization charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes; a $4 million non-cash tax credit for inter-year recovery of our cumulative shortfall position in employee stock activity, removing this credit from GAAP earnings reduced our non-GAAP earnings by $0.02 per share; we had about $1 million in restatement-related charges and about $1 million of other GAAP only gains, which offset each other and had no impact on EPS. Q2 new orders were $725 million. Net orders were $726 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter changed the distribution order as follows: The U.S. was 19% of new systems orders in Q2, down from 21% in the September quarter; Europe was 10% of new systems orders, up from 4% in Q1; Japan was 5%, down from 7% last quarter; Korea was 16%, down from 24% last quarter; Taiwan was 45%, up from 34% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 5%, down from 10% in Q1. 
Q2 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection was 30% compared with 49% last quarter; Reticle inspection was 26%, up from 11% last quarter; Metrology was 20%, up from 17% in prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 5%, down from 6% last quarter; and services were 19% of new orders in Q2, up from 17% last quarter.  Foundry customers comprised 72% of semiconductor systems orders in Q2 versus 44% in Q1. Logic customers were 8% of new systems orders in Q2 versus 18% in Q1. And Memory systems orders were 20% in Q2, down from 38% in Q1. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q3 will be within a range of up 5% to up 25% from the December quarter. 
In Q2, we shipped $828 million versus $677 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both systems shipments and services revenue, and we expect a similar shipment level for Q3. The backlog at the end of Q2 decreased slightly from September 30, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in total systems backlog. Backlog at December 31, 2010 included $396 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced, but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped. 
Total revenue for Q2 was $766 million, up 12% from $682 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q2 was up 14% to $628 million compared with $551 million in Q1. And services revenue was $138 million in Q2, up about $7 million from Q1. Our expectation for total revenue in Q3 is a range between $780 million and $830 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60% in the December quarter, down two percentage points from September. Gross margin percentage decrease from last quarter was largely a function of product mix. For Q3, we are modeling a gross margin percentage improvement a little better than our long-term model of 60% to 70% incremental margin improvement on the expected Q3 revenue increase. 
Operating expenses were $184 million, up about $4 million from the September quarter and we expect a small increase in our operating expenses in Q3. OIE was a net $18 million expense in Q2, about $6 million higher than Q1. The OIE increase over last quarter was largely attributable to writing down an equity investment in our venture portfolio. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $13 million in Q3. 
In Q2, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $72 million or 28% of pretax income versus $63 million in Q1, which is 27% of pretax income. The tax rate increase largely arose from a change in the distribution of earnings between U.S. and lower-taxed international operations, offset by the effects of reinstating the R&D Tax Credit during Q2. Non-GAAP net income was $187 million or $1.10 per share in Q2. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share would've been $1.07 per share. The revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q3 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.15 and $1.30 per share. 
The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q2 were 169.5 million versus 169.8 million in Q1. During Q2, we spent $58 million repurchasing about 1.6 million shares, and as of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 1.7 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the March quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q3. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, up about $100 million from the end of September. Cash generated from operations was $194 million in Q2 compared with $96 million in Q1. The improved operating cash generation mostly resulted from $140 million more in customer collections, and the collections increase was offset by higher income tax payments and their semiannual interest payments. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $531 million, up from $500 million at September 30. DSOs were 63 at December 31 versus 67 at the end of September. Both DSO figures are net of allowance from uncollectible accounts and factory. Net inventories increased by $41 million from September 30 and ended the quarter at $505 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.6 turns in Q2 versus 2.3 turns in Q1. Capital expenditures were $12 million in Q2 versus $11 million in Q1, and we completed the sale of our vacated San Jose campus, which resulted in $18 million in net cash proceeds.  Total headcount at December 31 was 5,267, up from 5,180 at September 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q3. 
In summary, our guidance for Q3 is: new orders up 5% to 25% from Q2; total revenue between $780 million and $830 million; non-GAAP EPS between $1.15 and $1.30. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

In Foundry, there continues to be strong investment in Foundry, and I think we'll see that in the first half. But there's also projects that we see on the books now for second half.

You have to have feet on the street to meet the demand.

One, Foundry is going through a couple of changes, I think, if you look fundamentally over the last few quarters. One is they're finally having to add technology and capacity to compensate for iDMs having shifted a lot of their manufacturing to the foundries. So that was one trend driving intensity. The other trend that drives it for us is the fact that they need to be able to handle multiple process flows and they need to have the ability to get a better handle on their yields so they don't start too many wafers or start too few. And so that drives it for us, and we benefited from that. And then the other factor, I guess, is there's increased competition now. So overall, I think the intensity is going up because there's multiple players trying to get part of that growth segment. So all those are kind of favorable factors. Where Memory, on the other hand, it had probably as we know, had more capacity than the market could support. And so that certainly didn't drive intensity up, and they don't have some of the same dynamics quite yet. So I model, overall PDC, we're very conservative in our modeling, but it probably is flat to up slightly in terms of overall adoption over the next couple of years. But really, we think, if anything, that's the upside in our earnings model, and as we review it out for the next five years, we think there's good chance, we just have to make it happen in terms of making sure our products provide that value for our customers. But all the drivers are driving more intensity, and that favors us if we can continue to execute on our product roadmap."

Part of the reason that you can get a quarter-to-quarter mix phenomenon is, is just the way we do some of the cost accounting on when we ship a tool. The customer orders a base tool now with an option to upgrade. We basically cost out the entire cost of the tool, both the base tool today and the option to upgrade in the future. So when we get that order in the future with the upgrade, that comes in at almost 100% margin. So when we say product mix, it's more complex than just it's coming out of this family or that family. It actually can get into what is actually the nature of the order. So if there's enough new tools going out with future options on them, you're actually going to get a relatively lower margin operating quarter, with the knowledge that at some point in the future, you're going to get margin rich revenue coming through. So that's an example. So when we say product mix, it's a pretty complex answer, actually."

KLA-Tencor's March results features another quarter of high levels of demand, record quarterly revenue and earnings and strong cash flows. These results showcase the KLA-Tencor's market technology leadership and dedication of our global workforce, driven by our culture of innovation and focus on the customer. They also demonstrate the strength of our business model and its profit and cash generation ability, as well as our continued commitment to delivering industry-leading financial performance. That performance enables us to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases at a level that sets the company apart from our technology peers.
Here are some highlights of the Q3 results. New bookings grew 18% sequentially to finish at $853 million, representing the second-highest quarterly bookings level in company history. On our January earnings call, we gave an initial range of bookings guidance for the March quarter to be flat to up 20% then in February, we updated that view by observing the bookings we're trending to the top of the range or above. The final bookings results came in just below our updated outlook due in part to order timing issues that emerged late in the quarter. 
Third quarter revenue grew 9% compared with December, ending above the guidance range at a record $834 million. And we ended Q3 with over $1.4 billion in total backlog, positioning the company to continue to deliver revenue and profitability at historically high levels as we move ahead.
We also achieved a new high in quarterly non-GAAP net income of $225 million or $1.31 per diluted share in Q3. Underlying these record earnings were gross margins of 61.3% and record operating margins of 38.6%. Clearly the value we are creating for our customers and in helping them solve their most complex yield challenges is being reflected in the strong adoption and record financial performance we're reporting today. 
Cash flow from operations was at a healthy $244 million in Q3 and our balance sheet is strong ending the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and investments. And consistent with our continued commitment to return value to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $58 million of our stock in Q3 in addition to paying our regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. 
Turning now to some specifics on the current demand picture, orders in March quarter demonstrated the continuing trend of high demand we're experiencing in the cycle. In fact, in the past four quarters, KLA-Tencor has booked over $3.3 billion of new orders for an average of about $830 million per quarter. This amounts to 14% growth over the previous four-quarter company high for new orders set in the 2006 to 2007 timeframe. This growth is a result of our market leadership, strong adoption in the quarter, growth in services and the addition of new markets. The order book for March is another strong quarter from the foundries, the Foundry bookings at 50% of total new orders. Foundry and demand remained at a high level as increased technical complexity at the leading edge, intense competitive dynamics and rapid growth of new fabless designs are all driving very strong adoption of process control. Bookings for Memory customers grew to 27% of the total in the March quarter demand accounting by 73% of memory orders in the quarter. And logic was 50% of bookings in March driven by requirements to support 22-nanometer production ramps this year and in 2012.
Though there are some uncertainty clouding short-term visibility in the marketplace today, overall market fundamentals remain healthy and the market leaders are reporting strong revenue growth  and profitably. It is our view that the industry is in a multiyear growth cycle, fueled by customer adoption of new, breakthrough products and services that leverage the convergence of computing, the Internet and mobility. In this dynamic environment, our leading-edge customers continue to invest at a high level to advance Moore's Law to leverage the competitive and cost advantages of having world-class manufacturing capabilities at the leading-edge.  As a result, industry capital intensity is on the rise. And with the increasingly more complex technical challenges that our customers are facing as they evaluate multiple options for driving Moore's Law, we're also assessing higher adoption of process control. These conditions play into our strength as a market leader, and with our backlog, industry-leading business model and strong balance sheet, KLA-Tencor is well-positioned to continue to drive superior financial performance and shareholder returns as we advance through this cycle.
Moving now to June quarter guidance, gross bookings are projected to be flat to down 20% in the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $900 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.28 to $1.44 per share. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the financial results of the quarter.Mark?"

Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats. one under U.S. GAAP and one in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expense",1149,"thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats. one under U.S. GAAP and one in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but only our reference GAAP numbers I'll make the distinction.  A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP income statement is attached  to our press release and available on our website.
There was a $0.09 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, the difference consisted of acquisition-related amortization charges at $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes, continuing expenses related to indemnification obligations of former corporate officers related to stock option stock litigation of about $3 million before taxes or $0.01 per share after taxes and an $8 million non-cash tax charge resulting from a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings increased our non-GAAP earnings by $0.05 per share.
Q3 new orders were $853 million and net orders were over $856 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter to quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q3, up from 19% in the December quarter; Europe was 16% of new systems orders, up from 10% in Q2; Japan was 17%, up from 5% last quarter; Korea was 9%, down from 16% last quarter; Taiwan was 23%, down from 45% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, up from 5% in Q2.  The Q3 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter to quarter change in distribution were as follows. Wafer inspection was 48% compared with 30% last quarter; Reticle Inspection was 10%, down from 26% last quarter; metrology was down 19%, down from 20% the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 6%, up from 5% last quarter; and services were 17% of new the orders in Q3 down from 19% last quarter.
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the approximate distribution of new orders by market was 58% of new orders in Q3 were for Foundry customers versus 72% in Q2, project customers for 15% of orders in Q3 versus 8% in Q2, and memory orders were 27% in Q3 up from 20% in Q2.  Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q4 will be within a range of flat to down 20% from Q3 new orders, order range of approximately $680 million to $855 million.
In Q3, we shipped $823 million versus $828 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments in the $850 million to $900 million in Q4. Total backlog at the end of Q3 increased slightly from December 31 and we ended the quarter with $1.4 million in total systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2011 include: $383 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue; and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped.
Total revenue for Q3 was $834 million, up 9% from $766 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q3 was up 10% to $691 million, compared with $628 million in Q2 and services revenue was $143 million in Q3 up about $4 million from Q2. Our expectation for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $840 million and $900 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.3% in the March quarter, up 1.2 percentage points from December. Gross margin percentage improvement from last quarter was largely a function of volume increase in systems revenue mix. For Q4, we are expecting gross margin improvement, consistent with our long-term model of 60% to 70% incremental margin on the Q4 revenue increase.
Operating expenses were $190 million in Q4 and were split evenly between R&D and SG&A. OpEx was up about $6 million from the December quarter, mostly for variable compensation, and we expect a small increase in our operating expenses in Q4.
OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q3, about $7 million lower than Q2. The OIE decrease from last quarter followed a write-down of an equity investment in our venture portfolio during Q2. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be an expense of approximately $11 million in Q4.
In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $87 million or 28% of pretax income versus $72 million in Q2 which was also 20% of pretax income.
Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.31 per share in Q3, up from $1.10 last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 30% our Q3 non-GAAP earnings would've been $1.27 per share.  At the revenue range we previously mentioned, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.28 and $1.44 per share.  The weighted average shares EPS and Q3 were $171.3 million versus $169.5 million in Q2. Our average share count rose in Q3 because the diluted share count was based on a higher stock price. 
During Q3, we spent about $58 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of March 31, 2011, we had approximately 10.4 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the June quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling the same average share count as Q3.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.8 million, up about $200 million from the end of December. Cash generated from operations was $244 million in Q3 compared with $194 million in Q2. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $566 million, up from $531 billion in December. DSOs were 62 days at March 31 versus 63 days at the end of December. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts factored.
Net inventories increased by $52 million run December 31 and ended the quarter at $557 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.5 turns in Q3 versus 2.6 in Q2. Capital expenditures were $14 million in Q3 versus $12 million in Q2. Total headcount at March 31 was 5,386, up from 5,267 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4. 
In summary, our guidance for Q4 is new orders flat to down 20% from Q3; total revenue between $840 million and $900 million; and non-GAAP EPS between $1.28 and $1.44. 
This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call over to Ed to begin Q&A."

So I expect and what we're modeling is a couple of quarters of digestion of all the capacity that's been purchased. But then a resurgence and then for us because KLA-Tencor still leverage against the challenges of Moore's Law, we're seeing now in memory some of the early phenomena we saw in Foundry which is the need for more inspection measurement as people push on their design rules. So as I said, I think we see probably a couple of quarters and then growth returning. Customers are still talking about a lot of Projects later in the year and I just think there's a momentary delay in that."

It's not just one or two, there are four players that are actively investing in Foundry and we're still seeing that level of investment although there has been some caution recently.

I think the challenge with the EUV, there's plenty of challenges that's already driving business for us in the reticle inspection expecting blank as well as inspecting the early layers. Double patterning push is very hard on some of our metrology capabilities, specifically overlay. I think the other trend that's out there frankly is we continue to get pushed, there will be more and more interest going into 450 as a way to reduce cost and I would say that I'm far more of the believe that that's going to happen in the last six months that I was in the last year before that. I just think there's going to be a desire for productivity which is good for KT but on a different timeframe. So as well as forward, we're definitely getting business out of the EUV investment that's going on, but we are benefiting from double patterning. So I don't think it really swings too much on us either way. In terms of push outs, we've seen the same impact others have seen. I don't think it's limited to one or two customers. I think there is a broader sense out there of a pause and I think that's part of what we're seeing as a general pause in the market and as people try to assess the impact a lot of it is second order I don't think that there necessarily seeing it on their own. They're just trying to wait and see what happens. Our estimate is that we're about six weeks through since the initial events in Japan. I'd say the next six  week we'll get a lot more clarity as we get later towards the end of the June quarter."

These are high dollar, low number of tools. So incremental movement is a big, big shift. The other thing I think that happens is along the same lines when there's technology transitions, the EUV, for example, you'll see initial investment associated with being able to handle that transition. So we kind of get in both, but it's more related to what's going on in the design front and to some degree capacity of advanced masks. And when that happens then we see trigger.

Thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our March quarter results and provide guidance for June.

I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our March quarter results and provide guidance for June. Then I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of the financials and will conclude with Q&A.
KLA-Tencor's March results features another quarter of high levels of demand, record quarterly revenue and earnings and strong cash flows. These results showcase the KLA-Tencor's market technology leadership and dedication of our global workforce, driven by our culture of innovation and focus on the customer. They also demonstrate the strength of our business model and its profit and cash generation ability, as well as our continued commitment to delivering industry-leading financial performance. That performance enables us to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases at a level that sets the company apart from our technology peers.
Here are some highlights of the Q3 results. New bookings grew 18% sequentially to finish at $853 million, representing the second-highest quarterly bookings level in company history. On our January earnings call, we gave an initial range of bookings guidance for the March quarter to be flat to up 20% then in February, we updated that view by observing the bookings we're trending to the top of the range or above. The final bookings results came in just below our updated outlook due in part to order timing issues that emerged late in the quarter. 
Third quarter revenue grew 9% compared with December, ending above the guidance range at a record $834 million. And we ended Q3 with over $1.4 billion in total backlog, positioning the company to continue to deliver revenue and profitability at historically high levels as we move ahead.
We also achieved a new high in quarterly non-GAAP net income of $225 million or $1.31 per diluted share in Q3. Underlying these record earnings were gross margins of 61.3% and record operating margins of 38.6%. Clearly the value we are creating for our customers and in helping them solve their most complex yield challenges is being reflected in the strong adoption and record financial performance we're reporting today. 
Cash flow from operations was at a healthy $244 million in Q3 and our balance sheet is strong ending the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and investments. And consistent with our continued commitment to return value to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $58 million of our stock in Q3 in addition to paying our regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. 
Turning now to some specifics on the current demand picture, orders in March quarter demonstrated the continuing trend of high demand we're experiencing in the cycle. In fact, in the past four quarters, KLA-Tencor has booked over $3.3 billion of new orders for an average of about $830 million per quarter. This amounts to 14% growth over the previous four-quarter company high for new orders set in the 2006 to 2007 timeframe. This growth is a result of our market leadership, strong adoption in the quarter, growth in services and the addition of new markets. The order book for March is another strong quarter from the foundries, the Foundry bookings at 50% of total new orders. Foundry and demand remained at a high level as increased technical complexity at the leading edge, intense competitive dynamics and rapid growth of new fabless designs are all driving very strong adoption of process control. Bookings for Memory customers grew to 27% of the total in the March quarter demand accounting by 73% of memory orders in the quarter. And logic was 50% of bookings in March driven by requirements to support 22-nanometer production ramps this year and in 2012.
Though there are some uncertainty clouding short-term visibility in the marketplace today, overall market fundamentals remain healthy and the market leaders are reporting strong revenue growth  and profitably. It is our view that the industry is in a multiyear growth cycle, fueled by customer adoption of new, breakthrough products and services that leverage the convergence of computing, the Internet and mobility. In this dynamic environment, our leading-edge customers continue to invest at a high level to advance Moore's Law to leverage the competitive and cost advantages of having world-class manufacturing capabilities at the leading-edge.  As a result, industry capital intensity is on the rise. And with the increasingly more complex technical challenges that our customers are facing as they evaluate multiple options for driving Moore's Law, we're also assessing higher adoption of process control. These conditions play into our strength as a market leader, and with our backlog, industry-leading business model and strong balance sheet, KLA-Tencor is well-positioned to continue to drive superior financial performance and shareholder returns as we advance through this cycle.
Moving now to June quarter guidance, gross bookings are projected to be flat to down 20% in the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $900 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.28 to $1.44 per share. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the financial results of the quarter.Mark?"
282225,129890308,120058,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats. one under U.S. GAAP and one in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expense",1149,"thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in two formats. one under U.S. GAAP and one in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but only our reference GAAP numbers I'll make the distinction.  A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP income statement is attached  to our press release and available on our website.
There was a $0.09 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, the difference consisted of acquisition-related amortization charges at $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes, continuing expenses related to indemnification obligations of former corporate officers related to stock option stock litigation of about $3 million before taxes or $0.01 per share after taxes and an $8 million non-cash tax charge resulting from a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings increased our non-GAAP earnings by $0.05 per share.
Q3 new orders were $853 million and net orders were over $856 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter to quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q3, up from 19% in the December quarter; Europe was 16% of new systems orders, up from 10% in Q2; Japan was 17%, up from 5% last quarter; Korea was 9%, down from 16% last quarter; Taiwan was 23%, down from 45% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, up from 5% in Q2.  The Q3 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter to quarter change in distribution were as follows. Wafer inspection was 48% compared with 30% last quarter; Reticle Inspection was 10%, down from 26% last quarter; metrology was down 19%, down from 20% the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 6%, up from 5% last quarter; and services were 17% of new the orders in Q3 down from 19% last quarter.
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the approximate distribution of new orders by market was 58% of new orders in Q3 were for Foundry customers versus 72% in Q2, project customers for 15% of orders in Q3 versus 8% in Q2, and memory orders were 27% in Q3 up from 20% in Q2.  Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q4 will be within a range of flat to down 20% from Q3 new orders, order range of approximately $680 million to $855 million.
In Q3, we shipped $823 million versus $828 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments in the $850 million to $900 million in Q4. Total backlog at the end of Q3 increased slightly from December 31 and we ended the quarter with $1.4 million in total systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2011 include: $383 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue; and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped.
Total revenue for Q3 was $834 million, up 9% from $766 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q3 was up 10% to $691 million, compared with $628 million in Q2 and services revenue was $143 million in Q3 up about $4 million from Q2. Our expectation for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $840 million and $900 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.3% in the March quarter, up 1.2 percentage points from December. Gross margin percentage improvement from last quarter was largely a function of volume increase in systems revenue mix. For Q4, we are expecting gross margin improvement, consistent with our long-term model of 60% to 70% incremental margin on the Q4 revenue increase.
Operating expenses were $190 million in Q4 and were split evenly between R&D and SG&A. OpEx was up about $6 million from the December quarter, mostly for variable compensation, and we expect a small increase in our operating expenses in Q4.
OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q3, about $7 million lower than Q2. The OIE decrease from last quarter followed a write-down of an equity investment in our venture portfolio during Q2. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be an expense of approximately $11 million in Q4.
In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $87 million or 28% of pretax income versus $72 million in Q2 which was also 20% of pretax income.
Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.31 per share in Q3, up from $1.10 last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 30% our Q3 non-GAAP earnings would've been $1.27 per share.  At the revenue range we previously mentioned, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.28 and $1.44 per share.  The weighted average shares EPS and Q3 were $171.3 million versus $169.5 million in Q2. Our average share count rose in Q3 because the diluted share count was based on a higher stock price. 
During Q3, we spent about $58 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of March 31, 2011, we had approximately 10.4 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the June quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling the same average share count as Q3.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.8 million, up about $200 million from the end of December. Cash generated from operations was $244 million in Q3 compared with $194 million in Q2. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $566 million, up from $531 billion in December. DSOs were 62 days at March 31 versus 63 days at the end of December. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts factored.
Net inventories increased by $52 million run December 31 and ended the quarter at $557 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.5 turns in Q3 versus 2.6 in Q2. Capital expenditures were $14 million in Q3 versus $12 million in Q2. Total headcount at March 31 was 5,386, up from 5,267 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4. 
In summary, our guidance for Q4 is new orders flat to down 20% from Q3; total revenue between $840 million and $900 million; and non-GAAP EPS between $1.28 and $1.44. 
This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call over to Ed to begin Q&A."

And I think that, that put the brakes on what was otherwise a still tremendous demand out there. So I expect and what we're modeling is a couple of quarters of digestion of all the capacity that's been purchased. But then a resurgence and then for us because KLA-Tencor still leverage against the challenges of Moore's Law, we're seeing now in memory some of the early phenomena we saw in Foundry which is the need for more inspection measurement as people push on their design rules. So as I said, I think we see probably a couple of quarters and then growth returning.

Double patterning push is very hard on some of our metrology capabilities, specifically overlay. I think the other trend that's out there frankly is we continue to get pushed, there will be more and more interest going into 450 as a way to reduce cost and I would say that I'm far more of the believe that that's going to happen in the last six months that I was in the last year before that. I just think there's going to be a desire for productivity which is good for KT but on a different timeframe. So as well as forward, we're definitely getting business out of the EUV investment that's going on, but we are benefiting from double patterning. So I don't think it really swings too much on us either way. In terms of push outs, we've seen the same impact others have seen. I don't think it's limited to one or two customers. I think there is a broader sense out there of a pause and I think that's part of what we're seeing as a general pause in the market and as people try to assess the impact a lot of it is second order I don't think that there necessarily seeing it on their own.

It may occasionally look at you map it out that it's based upon some kind of correlation, but I think there are a couple of driving tractors. One has to do with advanced design starts when those increase in people to capacity point where they need an incremental number of tools you see big movement. These are high dollar, low number of tools. So incremental movement is a big, big shift. The other thing I think that happens is along the same lines when there's technology transitions, the EUV, for example, you'll see initial investment associated with being able to handle that transition. So we kind of get in both, but it's more related to what's going on in the design front and to some degree capacity of advanced masks. And when that happens then we see trigger. And the other thing that haven't been introduced to capability, we typically create demand for that and you'll see that we get a large number of orders and that largely work its way through in revenue which is part of where our strength and our backlog is and why we're at $1.4 billion backlog with some of those radical tools that came out last year have booked but we're still working on deliveries  on them."

I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our March quarter results and provide guidance for June. Then I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of the financials, and we'll conclude with Q&A.
KLA-Tencor's March results features another quarter of high levels of demand, record quarterly revenue and earnings and strong cash flows. These results showcase KLA-Tencor's market and technology leadership and the dedication of our global workforce, driven by our culture of innovation and focus on the customer. They also demonstrate the strength of our business model and its profit and cash generation ability, as well as our continued commitment to delivering industry-leading financial performance. That performance enables us to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases at a level that sets the company apart from our technology peers.
Here are some highlights of the Q3 results. New bookings grew 18% sequentially to finish at $853 million, representing the second-highest quarterly bookings level in company history. On our January earnings call, we gave an initial range of bookings guidance for the March quarter to be flat to up 20%. Then in February, we updated that view by observing the bookings we're trending to the top of the range or above. The final bookings results came in just below our updated outlook due in part to order timing issues that emerged late in the quarter. 
Third quarter revenue grew 9% compared with December, ending above the guidance range at a record $834 million. And we ended Q3 with over $1.4 billion in total backlog, positioning the company to continue to deliver revenue and profitability at historically high levels as we move ahead.
We also achieved a new high in quarterly non-GAAP net income of $225 million or $1.31 per diluted share in Q3. Underlying these record earnings were gross margins of 61.3% and record operating margins of 38.6%. Clearly, the value we are creating for our customers and in helping them solve their most complex yield challenges is being reflected in the strong adoption and record financial performance we're reporting today. 
Cash flow from operations was at the healthy $244 million in Q3, and our balance sheet is strong ending the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and investments. And consistent with our continued commitment to return value to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $58 million of our stock in Q3 in addition to paying our regularly quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. 
Turning now to some specifics on the current demand picture. Orders in March quarter demonstrated the continuing trend of high demand we're experiencing in the cycle. In fact, in the past 4 quarters, KLA-Tencor has booked over $3.3 billion of new orders for an average of about $830 million per quarter. This amounts to 14% growth over the previous 4-quarter company high for new orders set in the 2006 to 2007 timeframe. This growth is a result of our market leadership, strong adoption in the quarter, growth in services and the addition of new markets. The order book for March is another strong quarter from the foundries, with foundry bookings at 58% of total new orders. Foundry demand remained at a high level as increased technical complexity at the leading edge, intense competitive dynamics and rapid growth of new fabless designs are all driving very strong adoption of process control. Bookings from memory customers grew to 27% of the total in the March quarter demand accounting for 73% of memory orders in the quarter. And logic was 15% of bookings in March driven by requirements to support 22-nanometer production ramps this year and in 2012.
Though there are some uncertainty clouding short-term visibility in the marketplace today, overall market fundamentals remain healthy and the market leaders are reporting strong revenue growth  and profitably. It is our view that the industry is in a multiyear growth cycle, fueled by customer adoption of new, breakthrough products and services that leverage the convergence of computing, the Internet and mobility. In this dynamic environment, our leading-edge customers continue to invest in a high level to advance Moore's Law to leverage the competitive and cost advantages of having world-class manufacturing capabilities at the leading edge. As a result, industry capital intensity is on the rise. And with the increasingly more complex technical challenges our customers are facing as they evaluate multiple options for driving Moore's Law, we're also seeing higher adoption of process control. These conditions play into our strength as a market leader. And with our backlog, industry-leading business model and strong balance sheet, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to continue to drive superior financial performance and shareholder returns as we advance through this cycle.
Moving now to June quarter guidance. Gross bookings are projected to be flat to down 20% in the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $900 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.28 to $1.44 per share. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the financial results of the quarter. Mark?"

Consistent with our recent history, we will present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which exclude amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, an",1153,"Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we will present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which exclude amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.
There was a $0.09 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. The difference consisted of: Acquisition-related amortization charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes; continuing expenses related to indemnification obligations of former corporate officers related to stock options backdating litigation of about $3 million before taxes or $0.01 per share after taxes; and an $8 million noncash tax charge resulting from a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings increased our non-GAAP earnings by $0.05 per share.
Q3 new orders were $853 million and net orders were over $856 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q3, up from 19% in the December quarter; Europe was 16% of new systems orders, up from 10% in Q2; Japan was 17%, up from 5% last quarter; Korea was 9%, down from 16% last quarter; Taiwan was 23%, down from 45% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, up from 5% in Q2.  The Q3 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection was 48% compared with 30% last quarter; Reticle Inspection was 10%, down from 26% last quarter; metrology was 19%, down from 20% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other nonsemi was 6%, up from 5% last quarter; and services were 17% of new orders in Q3, down from 19% last quarter.
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the approximate distribution of new orders by market was: 58% of orders in Q3 were for foundry customers versus 72% in Q2; logic customers were 15% of orders in Q3 versus 8% in Q2; and memory orders were 27% in Q3, up from 20% in Q2. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q4 will be within a range of flat to down 20% from Q3 new orders, order range of approximately $680 million to $855 million.
In Q3, we shipped $823 million versus $828 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments in the $850 million to $900 million in Q4. 
Total backlog at the end of Q3 increased slightly from December 31, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 million in total systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2011, include: $383 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue; and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped.
Total revenue for Q3 was $834 million, up 9% from $766 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q3 was up 10% to $691 million, compared with $628 million in Q2. And services revenue was $143 million in Q3, up about $4 million from Q2. Our expectation for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $840 million and $900 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.3% in the March quarter, up 1.2 percentage points from December. Gross margin percentage improvement from last quarter was largely a function of volume increase in systems revenue mix. For Q4, we are expecting gross margin improvement, consistent with our long-term model of 60% to 70% incremental margin on the Q4 revenue increase.
Operating expenses were $190 million in Q4 and were split evenly between R&D and SG&A. OpEx was up about $6 million from the December quarter, mostly for variable compensation, and we expect a small increase in our operating expenses in Q4.
OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q3, about $7 million lower than Q2. The OIE decrease from last quarter followed a write-down of an equity investment in our venture portfolio during Q2. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q4.
In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $87 million or 28% of pretax income versus $72 million in Q2, which was also 28% of pretax income.
Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.31 per share in Q3, up from $1.10 last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q3 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.27 per share. At the revenue range we had previously mentioned, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.28 and $1.44 per share. The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q3 were $171.3 million versus $169.5 million in Q2. Our average share count rose in Q3 because the diluted share count was based on a higher stock price. 
During Q3, we spent about $58 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of March 31, 2011, we had approximately 10.4 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the June quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling the same average share count as Q3.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.8 million, up about $200 million from the end of December. Cash generated from operations was $244 million in Q3 compared with $194 million in Q2. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $566 million, up from $531 million in December. DSOs were 62 days at March 31 versus 63 days at the end of December. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factory.
Net inventories increased by $52 million from December 31 and ended the quarter at $557 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.5 turns in Q3 versus 2.6 in Q2. Capital expenditures were $14 million in Q3 versus $12 million in Q2. Total headcount at March 31 was 5,386, up from 5,267 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4. 
In summary, our guidance for Q4 is: New orders, flat to down 20% from Q3; total revenue between $840 million and $900 million; and non-GAAP EPS between $1.28 and $1.44. 
This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

And I think that, that put the brakes on what was otherwise a still tremendous demand out there. So I expect and what we're modeling is a couple of quarters of digestion of all the capacity that's been purchased, but then a resurgence. And for us because KLA-Tencor still leveraged against the challenges of Moore's Law, we're seeing now in memory some of the early phenomena we saw in Foundry which is the need for more inspection measurement as people push on their design rules. So as I said, I think we see probably a couple of quarters and then growth returning. Customers are still talking about a lot of projects later in the year and I just think it's a momentary delay in that."

So some opportunity, we don't give it a particular dollar size. The wafer component of our business is meaningful, but I would say it's still, on a relative basis, reasonably small for the overall K-T footprint."

And we expect even in the June quarter, our reliance on foundries are reduced down to the 50% and obviously, we are at 72% if you go back to December. So we are seeing the other segments increased for us. I think foundry, there's a couple of factors that are having to be taken into account right now. It's not just 1 or 2, there are 4 players that are actively investing in foundry, and we're still seeing that level of investment although there has been some caution recently. So I would say if there's upside to our overall fiscal, I'm sorry, the rest of the calendar year, it would be that the foundries actually increased their investment off of what we're modeling. We're modeling that perhaps a good part, I wouldn't say 2/3 of the overall, but a good part has been committed already."

The first one on litho, we're relatively agnostic. I think that the challenge with the EUV, there's plenty of challenges that's already driving business for us in the Reticle Inspection even for expecting blanks as well as inspecting the early layers. Double patterning pushes very hard on some of our metrology capabilities, specifically overlay. I think the other trend that's out there frankly is if EUV continues to get pushed, there will be more and more interest in going to 450 as a way to reduce cost. And I would say that I'm far more on the belief that that's going to happen in the last 6 months than I was in the last year before that. I just think there's going to be a desire for productivity which is good for K-T but in a different timeframe. So as it goes forward, we're definitely getting business out of the EUV investment that's going on, but we are benefiting from double patterning. So I don't think it really swings too much on us either way. In terms of pushouts, we've seen the same impact others have seen. I don't think it's limited to 1 or 2 customers. I think there is a broader sense out there of a pause and I think that's a part of what we're seeing as a general pause in the market as people try to assess the impact. A lot of it's second order. I don't think that they're necessarily seeing it on their own. They're just trying to wait and see what happens. Our estimate is we're about 6 weeks through since the initial events in Japan. I'd say in the next 6 weeks, we'll get a lot more clarity as we get later towards the end of the June quarter."

But I think there are a couple of driving factors. One has to do with advanced design starts. When those increase and people reach a capacity point where they need an incremental number of tools, you'll see big movement. These are high-dollar, low-number of tools. So incremental movement is a big, big shift. The other thing I think that happens is along the same lines when there's technology transitions, the EUV, for example, you'll see initial investment associated with being able to handle that transition. So we kind of get in, in both, but it's more related to what's going on in the design front and to some degree capacity of advanced masks. And when that happens, then we see trigger. The other thing that happens is when we introduce new capability, we typically create demand for that and you'll see that we get a large number of orders and that will actually work its way through in revenue, which is part of where our strength in our backlog is and why we're at $1.4 billion backlog, and some of those reticle tools that came out last year have booked but we're still working on deliveries on them."

I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our March quarter results and provide guidance for June. Then I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of the financials, and we'll conclude with Q&A.
KLA-Tencor's March results features another quarter of high levels of demand, record quarterly revenue and earnings and strong cash flows. These results showcase KLA-Tencor's market and technology leadership and the dedication of our global workforce, driven by our culture of innovation and focus on the customer. They also demonstrate the strength of our business model and its profit and cash generation ability, as well as our continued commitment to delivering industry-leading financial performance. That performance enables us to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases at a level that sets the company apart from our technology peers.
Here are some highlights of the Q3 results. New bookings grew 18% sequentially to finish at $853 million, representing the second-highest quarterly bookings level in company history. On our January earnings call, we gave an initial range of bookings guidance for the March quarter to be flat to up 20%. Then in February, we updated that view by observing the bookings we're trending to the top of the range or above. The final bookings results came in just below our updated outlook due in part to order timing issues that emerged late in the quarter. 
Third quarter revenue grew 9% compared with December, ending above the guidance range at a record $834 million. And we ended Q3 with over $1.4 billion in total backlog, positioning the company to continue to deliver revenue and profitability at historically high levels as we move ahead.
We also achieved a new high in quarterly non-GAAP net income of $225 million or $1.31 per diluted share in Q3. Underlying these record earnings were gross margins of 61.3% and record operating margins of 38.6%. Clearly, the value we are creating for our customers and in helping them solve their most complex yield challenges is being reflected in the strong adoption and record financial performance we're reporting today. 
Cash flow from operations was at a healthy $244 million in Q3, and our balance sheet is strong ending the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and investments. And consistent with our continued commitment to return value to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $58 million of our stock in Q3 in addition to paying our regularly quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. 
Turning now to some specifics on the current demand picture. Orders in March quarter demonstrated the continuing trend of high demand we're experiencing in the cycle. In fact, in the past 4 quarters, KLA-Tencor has booked over $3.3 billion of new orders for an average of about $830 million per quarter. This amounts to 14% growth over the previous 4-quarter company high for new orders set in the 2006 to 2007 timeframe. This growth is a result of our market leadership, strong adoption in the core, growth in services and the addition of new markets. The order book for March shows another strong quarter from the foundries, with foundry bookings at 58% of total new orders. Foundry demand remained at a high level as increased technical complexity at the leading edge, intense competitive dynamics and rapid growth of new fabless designs are all driving very strong adoption of process control. Bookings from memory customers grew to 27% of the total in the March quarter, with NAND accounting for 73% of memory orders in the quarter. And logic was 15% of bookings in March driven by requirements to support 22-nanometer production ramps this year and in 2012.
Though there are some uncertainty clouding short-term visibility in the marketplace today, overall market fundamentals remain healthy and the market leaders are reporting strong revenue growth  and profitably. It is our view that the industry is in a multiyear growth cycle, fueled by customer adoption of new, breakthrough products and services that leverage the convergence of computing, the Internet and mobility. In this dynamic environment, our leading-edge customers continue to invest at a high level to advance Moore's Law to leverage the competitive and cost advantages of having world-class manufacturing capabilities at the leading edge. As a result, industry capital intensity is on the rise. And with the increasingly more complex technical challenges our customers are facing as they evaluate multiple options for driving Moore's Law, we're also seeing higher adoption of process control. These conditions play into our strength as a market leader. And with our backlog, industry-leading business model and strong balance sheet, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to continue to drive superior financial performance and shareholder returns as we advance through this cycle.
Moving now to June quarter guidance. Gross bookings are projected to be flat to down 20% in the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $900 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.28 to $1.44 per share. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the financial results of the quarter. Mark?"

Consistent with our recent history, we will present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which exclude amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.
There was a $0.09 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. The difference consisted of: Acquisition-related amortization charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes; continuing expenses related to indemnification obligations of former corporate officers related to stock options backdating litigation of about $3 million before taxes or $0.01 per share after taxes; and an $8 million noncash tax charge resulting from a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings increased our non-GAAP earnings by $0.05 per share.
Q3 new orders were $853 million and net orders were $856 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q3, up from 19% in the December quarter; Europe was 16% of new systems orders, up from 10% in Q2; Japan was 17%, up from 5% last quarter; Korea was 9%, down from 16% last quarter; Taiwan was 23%, down from 45% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, up from 5% in Q2.  The Q3 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection was 48% compared with 30% last quarter; Reticle Inspection was 10%, down from 26% last quarter; metrology was 19%, down from 20% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 6%, up from 5% last quarter; and services were 17% of new orders in Q3, down from 19% last quarter.
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the approximate distribution of new orders by market was: 58% of orders in Q3 were for foundry customers versus 72% in Q2; logic customers were 15% of orders in Q3 versus 8% in Q2; and memory orders were 27% in Q3, up from 20% in Q2. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q4 will be within a range of flat to down 20% from Q3 new orders, order range of approximately $680 million to $855 million.
In Q3, we shipped $823 million versus $828 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments of $850 million to $900 million in Q4. 
Total backlog at the end of Q3 increased slightly from December 31, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 million in total systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2011, include: $383 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue; and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped.
Total revenue for Q3 was $834 million, up 9% from $766 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q3 was up 10% to $691 million, compared with $628 million in Q2. And services revenue was $143 million in Q3, up about $4 million from Q2. Our expectation for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $840 million and $900 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.3% in the March quarter, up 1.2 percentage points from December. Gross margin percentage improvement from last quarter was largely a function of volume increase in systems revenue mix. For Q4, we are expecting gross margin improvement, consistent with our long-term model of 60% to 70% incremental margin on the Q4 revenue increase.
Operating expenses were $190 million in Q4 and were split evenly between R&D and SG&A. OpEx was up about $6 million from the December quarter, mostly for variable compensation, and we expect a small increase in our operating expenses in Q4.
OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q3, about $7 million lower than Q2. The OIE decrease from last quarter followed a write-down of an equity investment in our venture portfolio during Q2. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q4.
In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $87 million or 28% of pretax income versus $72 million in Q2, which was also 28% of pretax income.
Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.31 per share in Q3, up from $1.10 last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q3 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.27 per share. At the revenue range we had previously mentioned, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.28 and $1.44 per share. The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q3 were 171.3 million versus 169.5 million in Q2. Our average share count rose in Q3 because the diluted share count was based on a higher stock price. 
During Q3, we spent about $58 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of March 31, 2011, we had approximately 10.4 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the June quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling the same average share count as Q3.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.8 million, up about $200 million from the end of December. Cash generated from operations was $244 million in Q3 compared with $194 million in Q2. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $566 million, up from $531 million in December. DSOs were 62 days at March 31 versus 63 days at the end of December. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factory.
Net inventories increased by $52 million from December 31 and ended the quarter at $557 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.5 turns in Q3 versus 2.6 in Q2. Capital expenditures were $14 million in Q3 versus $12 million in Q2. Total headcount at March 31 was 5,386, up from 5,267 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4. 
In summary, our guidance for Q4 is: New orders, flat to down 20% from Q3; total revenue between $840 million and $900 million; and non-GAAP EPS between $1.28 and $1.44. 
This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

And I think that, that put the brakes on what was otherwise a still tremendous demand out there. So I expect and what we're modeling is a couple of quarters of digestion of all the capacity that's been purchased, but then a resurgence. And for us because KLA-Tencor is so leveraged against the challenges of Moore's Law, we're seeing now in memory some of the early phenomena we saw in Foundry which is the need for more inspection measurement as people push on their design rules. So as I said, I think we see probably a couple of quarters and then growth returning. Customers are still talking about a lot of projects later in the year and I just think it's a momentary delay in that."

So we are seeing the other segments increased for us. I think foundry, there's a couple of factors that are having to be taken into account right now. It's not just 1 or 2, there are 4 players that are actively investing in foundry, and we're still seeing that level of investment although there has been some caution recently. So I would say if there's upside to our overall fiscal, I'm sorry, the rest of the calendar year, it would be that the foundries actually increased their investment off of what we're modeling.

The first one on litho, we're relatively agnostic. I think that the challenge with the EUV, there's plenty of challenges that's already driving business for us in the Reticle Inspection even for expecting blanks as well as inspecting the early layers. Double patterning pushes very hard on some of our metrology capabilities, specifically overlay. I think the other trend that's out there frankly is if EUV continues to get pushed, there will be more and more interest in going to 450 as a way to reduce cost. And I would say that I'm far more of the belief that that's going to happen in the last 6 months than I was in the last year before that. I just think there's going to be a desire for productivity which is good for K-T but in a different timeframe. So as it goes forward, we're definitely getting business out of the EUV investment that's going on, but we are benefiting from double patterning. So I don't think it really swings too much on us either way. In terms of pushouts, we've seen the same impact others have seen. I don't think it's limited to 1 or 2 customers. I think there is a broader sense out there of a pause and I think that's a part of what we're seeing as a general pause in the market as people try to assess the impact. A lot of it's second order. I don't think that they're necessarily seeing it on their own. They're just trying to wait and see what happens. Our estimate is we're about 6 weeks through since the initial events in Japan. I'd say in the next 6 weeks, we'll get a lot more clarity as we get later towards the end of the June quarter."

But I think there are a couple of driving factors. One has to do with advanced design starts. When those increase and people reach a capacity point where they need an incremental number of tools, you'll see big movement. These are high-dollar, low-number of tools. So incremental movement is a big, big shift. The other thing I think that happens is along the same lines when there's technology transitions, the EUV, for example, you'll see initial investment associated with being able to handle that transition. So we kind of get it in both, but it's more related to what's going on in the design front and to some degree capacity of advanced masks. And when that happens, then we see trigger. The other thing that happens is when we introduce new capability, we typically create demand for that and you'll see that we get a large number of orders and that will actually work its way through in revenue, which is part of where our strength in our backlog is and why we're at $1.4 billion backlog, is some of those reticle tools that came out last year have booked but we're still working on deliveries of them."

I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our March quarter results and provide guidance for June. Then I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of the financials, and we'll conclude with Q&A.
KLA-Tencor's March results features another quarter of high levels of demand, record quarterly revenue and earnings and strong cash flows. These results showcase KLA-Tencor's market and technology leadership and the dedication of our global workforce, driven by our culture of innovation and focus on the customer. They also demonstrate the strength of our business model and its profit and cash generation ability, as well as our continued commitment to delivering industry-leading financial performance. That performance enables us to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases at a level that sets the company apart from our technology peers.
Here are some highlights of the Q3 results. New bookings grew 18% sequentially to finish at $853 million, representing the second-highest quarterly bookings level in company history. On our January earnings call, we gave an initial range of bookings guidance for the March quarter to be flat to up 20%. Then in February, we updated that view by observing the bookings we're trending to the top of the range or above. The final bookings results came in just below our updated outlook due in part to order timing issues that emerged late in the quarter. 
Third quarter revenue grew 9% compared with December, ending above the guidance range at a record $834 million. And we ended Q3 with over $1.4 billion in total backlog, positioning the company to continue to deliver revenue and profitability at historically high levels as we move ahead.
We also achieved a new high in quarterly non-GAAP net income of $225 million or $1.31 per diluted share in Q3. Underlying these record earnings were gross margins of 61.3% and record operating margins of 38.6%. Clearly, the value we are creating for our customers and in helping them solve their most complex yield challenges is being reflected in the strong adoption and record financial performance we're reporting today. 
Cash flow from operations was at a healthy $244 million in Q3, and our balance sheet is strong ending the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and investments. And consistent with our continued commitment to return value to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $58 million of our stock in Q3 in addition to paying our regularly quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. 
Turning now to some specifics on the current demand picture. Orders in March quarter demonstrated the continuing trend of high demand we're experiencing in the cycle. In fact, in the past 4 quarters, KLA-Tencor has booked over $3.3 billion of new orders for an average of about $830 million per quarter. This amounts to 14% growth over the previous 4-quarter company high for new orders set in the 2006 to 2007 timeframe. This growth is a result of our market leadership, strong adoption in the core, growth in services and the addition of new markets. The order book for March shows another strong quarter from the foundries, with foundry bookings at 58% of total new orders. Foundry demand remained at a high level as increased technical complexity at the leading edge, intense competitive dynamics and rapid growth of new fabless designs are all driving very strong adoption of process control. Bookings from memory customers grew to 27% of the total in the March quarter, with NAND accounting for 73% of memory orders in the quarter. And logic was 15% of bookings in March driven by requirements to support 22-nanometer production ramps this year and in 2012.
Though there are some uncertainty clouding short-term visibility in the marketplace today, overall market fundamentals remain healthy and the market leaders are reporting strong revenue growth  and profitably. It is our view that the industry is in a multiyear growth cycle, fueled by customer adoption of new, breakthrough products and services that leverage the convergence of computing, the Internet and mobility. In this dynamic environment, our leading-edge customers continue to invest at a high level to advance Moore's Law to leverage the competitive and cost advantages of having world-class manufacturing capabilities at the leading edge. As a result, industry capital intensity is on the rise. And with the increasingly more complex technical challenges our customers are facing as they evaluate multiple options for driving Moore's Law, we're also seeing higher adoption of process control. These conditions play into our strength as a market leader. And with our backlog, industry-leading business model and strong balance sheet, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to continue to drive superior financial performance and shareholder returns as we advance through this cycle.
Moving now to June quarter guidance. Gross bookings are projected to be flat to down 20% in the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $900 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.28 to $1.44 per share. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the financial results of the quarter. Mark?"
282225,129890308,121537,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2011",2011-04-28,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we will present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which exclude amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, an",1151,"Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we will present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which exclude amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.
There was a $0.09 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. The difference consisted of: Acquisition-related amortization charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes; continuing expenses related to indemnification obligations of former corporate officers related to stock options backdating litigation of about $3 million before taxes or $0.01 per share after taxes; and an $8 million noncash tax charge resulting from a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings increased our non-GAAP earnings by $0.05 per share.
Q3 new orders were $853 million and net orders were $856 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q3, up from 19% in the December quarter; Europe was 16% of new systems orders, up from 10% in Q2; Japan was 17%, up from 5% last quarter; Korea was 9%, down from 16% last quarter; Taiwan was 23%, down from 45% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, up from 5% in Q2.  The Q3 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection was 48% compared with 30% last quarter; Reticle Inspection was 10%, down from 26% last quarter; metrology was 19%, down from 20% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 6%, up from 5% last quarter; and services were 17% of new orders in Q3, down from 19% last quarter.
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the approximate distribution of new orders by market was: 58% of orders in Q3 were for foundry customers versus 72% in Q2; logic customers were 15% of orders in Q3 versus 8% in Q2; and memory orders were 27% in Q3, up from 20% in Q2. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q4 will be within a range of flat to down 20% from Q3 new orders, order range of approximately $680 million to $855 million.
In Q3, we shipped $823 million versus $828 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments of $850 million to $900 million in Q4. 
Total backlog at the end of Q3 increased slightly from December 31, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 million in total systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2011, include: $383 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue; and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped.
Total revenue for Q3 was $834 million, up 9% from $766 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q3 was up 10% to $691 million, compared with $628 million in Q2. And services revenue was $143 million in Q3, up about $4 million from Q2. Our expectation for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $840 million and $900 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.3% in the March quarter, up 1.2 percentage points from December. Gross margin percentage improvement from last quarter was largely a function of volume increase in systems revenue mix. For Q4, we are expecting gross margin improvement, consistent with our long-term model of 60% to 70% incremental margin on the Q4 revenue increase.
Operating expenses were $190 million in Q4 and were split evenly between R&D and SG&A. OpEx was up about $6 million from the December quarter, mostly for variable compensation, and we expect a small increase in our operating expenses in Q4.
OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q3, about $7 million lower than Q2. The OIE decrease from last quarter followed a write-down of an equity investment in our venture portfolio during Q2. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q4.
In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $87 million or 28% of pretax income versus $72 million in Q2, which was also 28% of pretax income.
Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.31 per share in Q3, up from $1.10 last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q3 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.27 per share. At the revenue range we had previously mentioned, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.28 and $1.44 per share. The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q3 were 171.3 million versus 169.5 million in Q2. Our average share count rose in Q3 because the diluted share count was based on a higher stock price. 
During Q3, we spent about $58 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of March 31, 2011, we had approximately 10.4 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the June quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling the same average share count as Q3.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.8 million, up about $200 million from the end of December. Cash generated from operations was $244 million in Q3 compared with $194 million in Q2. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $566 million, up from $531 million in December. DSOs were 62 days at March 31 versus 63 days at the end of December. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factory.
Net inventories increased by $52 million from December 31 and ended the quarter at $557 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.5 turns in Q3 versus 2.6 in Q2. Capital expenditures were $14 million in Q3 versus $12 million in Q2. Total headcount at March 31 was 5,386, up from 5,267 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4. 
In summary, our guidance for Q4 is: New orders, flat to down 20% from Q3; total revenue between $840 million and $900 million; and non-GAAP EPS between $1.28 and $1.44. 
This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

And I think that, that put the brakes on what was otherwise a still tremendous demand out there. So I expect and what we're modeling is a couple of quarters of digestion of all the capacity that's been purchased, but then a resurgence. And for us because KLA-Tencor is so leveraged against the challenges of Moore's Law, we're seeing now in memory some of the early phenomena we saw in Foundry which is the need for more inspection measurement as people push on their design rules. So as I said, I think we see probably a couple of quarters and then growth returning. Customers are still talking about a lot of projects later in the year and I just think it's a momentary delay in that."

And we expect even in the June quarter, our reliance on foundries are reduced down to the 50% and obviously, we are at 72% if you go back to December. So we are seeing the other segments increased for us. I think foundry, there's a couple of factors that are having to be taken into account right now. It's not just 1 or 2, there are 4 players that are actively investing in foundry, and we're still seeing that level of investment although there has been some caution recently. So I would say if there's upside to our overall fiscal, I'm sorry, the rest of the calendar year, it would be that the foundries actually increased their investment off of what we're modeling.

The first one on litho, we're relatively agnostic. I think that the challenge with the EUV, there's plenty of challenges that's already driving business for us in the Reticle Inspection even for expecting blanks as well as inspecting the early layers. Double patterning pushes very hard on some of our metrology capabilities, specifically overlay. I think the other trend that's out there frankly is if EUV continues to get pushed, there will be more and more interest in going to 450 as a way to reduce cost. And I would say that I'm far more of the belief that that's going to happen in the last 6 months than I was in the last year before that. I just think there's going to be a desire for productivity which is good for K-T but in a different timeframe. So as it goes forward, we're definitely getting business out of the EUV investment that's going on, but we are benefiting from double patterning. So I don't think it really swings too much on us either way. In terms of pushouts, we've seen the same impact others have seen. I don't think it's limited to 1 or 2 customers. I think there is a broader sense out there of a pause and I think that's a part of what we're seeing as a general pause in the market as people try to assess the impact. A lot of it's second order. I don't think that they're necessarily seeing it on their own. They're just trying to wait and see what happens. Our estimate is we're about 6 weeks through since the initial events in Japan. I'd say in the next 6 weeks, we'll get a lot more clarity as we get later towards the end of the June quarter."

But I think there are a couple of driving factors. One has to do with advanced design starts. When those increase and people reach a capacity point where they need an incremental number of tools, you'll see big movement. These are high-dollar, low-number of tools. So incremental movement is a big, big shift. The other thing I think that happens is along the same lines when there's technology transitions, the EUV, for example, you'll see initial investment associated with being able to handle that transition. So we kind of get it in both, but it's more related to what's going on in the design front and to some degree capacity of advanced masks. And when that happens, then we see trigger. The other thing that happens is when we introduce new capability, we typically create demand for that and you'll see that we get a large number of orders and that will actually work its way through in revenue, which is part of where our strength in our backlog is and why we're at $1.4 billion backlog, is some of those reticle tools that came out last year have booked but we're still working on deliveries of them."

Then Mar",782,"Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us on our call today. Given that we provide a thorough business update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary today on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then Mark will follow with a more detailed review of the financial. 
KLA-Tencor delivered record revenue earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2011, demonstrating our continued strong market leadership and successful execution of our long-term strategies for customer focus , growth and operations excellence in a period of robust industry growth. Bookings for the June quarter were $853 million, flat compared with March and in the upper end of the range of guidance. And in the fourth quarter, we experienced strong demand in each of our major end markets. 
Looking to our record, $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2011, 14% above the previous fourth quarter high that we set back in fiscal year 2007, driven by higher adoption and process control, growth in services business the addition of a new market 
June quarter revenue grew 7% to a record $892 million, coming in at the upper end of the range of guidance and the non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.50 in Q4, above the range of guidance for the quarter. Contributing to these results in Q4 were record operating margin of 40.1%. Today, KLA-Tencor is reporting margin significantly above our baseline model reflecting our cost discipline, and the value that we bring to our customers. 
Finally, cash flow from operations was a record $290 million in Q4. And we were active in returning value to shareholders, repurchasing 1.4 million shares in the quarter for $58 million, and of course,, paying our are regularly quarterly dividend. In fiscal year 2011, we repurchased a total of 6.2 million shares for $433 million. Also, as we announced on July 12, our Board of Directors have authorized an increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, which is scheduled to take effect beginning with our dividend to be declared next month. 
This move reflects management and the board's confidence in a long-term outlook for the company, as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment. So clearly, our results indicate another very strong performance for KLA-Tencor in Q4, capping a record year for the company and showcasing the strength of our market leadership and our industry-leading business model. 
Of course,, the driving force behind our success remains the strong effort in collaboration with our customers and business partners, as well as great execution of the worldwide workforce. And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank each of our employees for their contribution in helping KLA-Tencor excel in this environment and in shaping our future success. 
Shifting our focus now to the current period and our view of the near-term outlook. As reported at SEMICON West 2 weeks ago, the near-term industry demand environment has cooled off significantly of late, with customers reassessing their capacity expansion plans and timeline. And in light of persistent weakness in the microeconomic environment and lackluster PC sales. However, looking past the current environment, we believe the drivers underlying long-term growth in our industry remained intact. 
With economic expansion in the emerging markets, the rapid proliferation of new end products featuring high IC content and increasing complexity as the leading edge, all pointing to have long-term but different. And we further believe better customers remain committed to their roadmap towards shrinking device sizes and other technology investments are driving future competitive differentiation and to lower cost. This technology focus plays in the market leader process control as we play a critical role in helping our customers address the increasing more difficult starches and symptoms of an improving yield and lowering costs a leading-edge. In this environment, the long-term outlook for process control investment remains solid.
Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.  For bookings. We have adjusted our internal forecast to reflect further deterioration in the market environment subsequent to SEMICON West. And we now expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of to 35% in the quarter, plus or minus 10% and bookings in the second half of 2011 to be down more than the 15% to 20% range we originally indicated. Guidance for revenue in September is in the range of $770 million to $820 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.24 in the quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?"

Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in 2 formats: One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses, which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. 
There was a $0.07 a share difference between this year's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.
Q4 new orders were $853 million, essentially flat with last quarter. And net orders were $847 million down slightly from $856 million last quarter. The regional distribution businesses orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. is 32% of systems orders in Q4, up from 25% in March quarter. Europe was 8% of new systems orders, down from 16 % in Q3, Japan was 22%, often 17% last quarter; Korea was 13%, up from 9% last quarter; Taiwan was 21%, down from 23% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 4%, down from 10% in Q3. 
The Q4 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and a quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection was 42% compared to 48% last quarter; Reticle Inspection was 17% up from 10% last quarter; metrology was 18%, down slightly from 19% in the prior quarter, solar, storage, LED and other non-semi were 6%, even with last quarter and services was 17% of new orders in Q4, also even with last quarter.
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by market and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were: 43% of new systems order in Q4 for foundry customers versus 58% in Q3; logic customers were 27% of orders in Q4 versus 15% in Q3 and; and member orders were 30% in Q4, up from 27% last quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q1 will be down by 35% plus or minus 10% from Q4 new orders or a range of $470 million to $640 million.
In Q4, we shipped $892 million versus $823 million last quarter. The shipment number includes shipments and services revenue, and that's bit shipment between $725 million and $750 million in Q1. Total backlog at the end of Q4 decreased slightly as of March 31, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in systems backlog. Backlog at June 30, 2011, included: $382 million of revenue backlog or product that have been shipped and enlisted but have not yet been recognized as revenue and a little under $1 billion in systems orders that have not shipped.
Total revenue for Q4 was $892 million, up 7% from $834 million last quarter systems revenue for Q4 was up 8% to $744 million, compared to $691 million from Q3. And services revenue was $149 million in Q4, up about $6 million in Q3. Our expectation for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $770 million and $820 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.7% in the June quarter, down from 61.3% in March. Gross margin percentage declined from last quarter was due to higher parts cost in our Services business. For Q1, we are expecting gross margin of approximately 60%. Operating expenses were $184 million in Q4, with the research and development component of $99 million and selling, general and administrative expenses at $85 million. OpEx was down about $6 million from Q3 because we received the $10 million came in Q4 from the trustee of expansion in Japan following their bankruptcy in our fiscal 2009. 
Without this statement, OpEx would've been approximately $194 million and our EPS would have been $0.04 lower. We expect operating expenses to increase to about $197 million in Q1. OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q4, about even with Q3. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q1 as well. In Q4, our non-GAAP income tax expense as $92 million or 26% of pretax income versus $87 million in Q3 which is 28% of pretax income.
The Q4 tax expense percentage was lower than Q3 in part due to the release of certain tax reserves in Q4.
Non-GAAP net income was $256 million or $1.50 per share in Q4, up from $1.31 last quarter. If we apply on a tax rate of 30%, Q4 our non-GAAP earnings would've been $1.42 per share. At the revenue range we have previously mentioned, and using them on a way for income taxes of 26%, we would expect our Q1 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.10 and $1.24 per share. At this point I would like to add some comments during our go forward non-GAAP tax rate pick. As you know that it has every as we ended the 30% modeling rate for non-GAAP income taxes. 30% net was based on analysis and forecast several years ago and on today's call, we are updating that trade 26%. The new modeling rate is that the plant tax planning decisions we have implemented financiers an estimated income projections for the next few Euros which includes assumptions about the distribution of earnings between a U.S. and international locations PBS's rates among the major nomad different rates understate is where we operate, an accounting rule for income taxes and related reserves are complex, our expectation is that actual quarterly rates will almost never exactly matched 26% However for purposes of ensuring that as a guidance forward, we can expect us to use the 26% rate as most of you are aware specific factors that suggest another rate. The weighted average share is used to compute EPS in Q4 were $170.9 million versus $171.3 million in Q3. During Q4, we spent $58 million, repurchasing about 1.4 million shares, and as of June 30, 2011, we had approximately 9 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares as well as paying quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share beginning in Q1. For guidance purposes, we are monitoring the same average the share count with Q4.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2 billion, up about $200 million from the end of March. Cash generated from operations was $290 million in Q4 compared with $244 million in Q3. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $583 million, up from $566 million at the end of March. DSOs were 59 days at June 30 versus 62 days in March. Both DSO figures are net of a balance for uncollectible accounts and factoring.
Net inventories increased by $19 million from March 31 and ended the quarter at $576 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues as 2.5x in Q4 which is the flat in Q3. Capital expenditures were $15 million in Q4, about the same as Q3. The total headcount at June 30 was 5,492, up from 5,386 at March 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q1. 
In summary, our guidance for Q1 is: New orders down between the 25% and 45% from Q4. Total revenue between $770 million and $820 million; and non-GAAP EPS between $1.10 and $1.24 assuming a tax rate of 26%.
This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

Memory is kind of a different factor and I think in the DRAM case, with concerns about PC and flash, I think there is just some general conservative -- but you have to look kind of customer-by-customer, but I'd say mostly softening in foundry right now and there should be some recovery as we go forward after the September quarter."

I'm talking industry-wide, if you have a 25% down in September followed by a 5% up in December, you still have 5% up overall. So you still have an industry growth. Now the question was during the year, there was a range of 0% to 10% and early in the year people thought 5% to up 10% and towards the middle it looked like 10% and now I think it's kind of right now the current view that we're modeling for industry is probably in the up 5% range. So you'd look year-on-year, but that doesn't mean that the second-half in that case is down actually 25% from the first half on average even though for a year you're up. Does that make sense to you?  That's kind of -- but i think it's early to call whether we really say down 25% in September or not or -- and if we see the bounce back after that."

Now they're a little more aware of the challenges but we're getting pushed very hard to bring out our latest capability and technology to get it in line because I think our customers are pretty aware that they're missing criticality defects in areas that are going to cost problems for them and there's also a metrology challenges.

We do have some additional kickers, which help us in memory, and they're not perhaps as obvious as you might think, because we have some market share wins in areas recently in memory, things like OCD, which I think help provide additional catalyst. We've got areas like overlay where we're strong and so you have to kind of look broadly across the portfolio to see the opportunities for us. But there's no question that the softening right now or the current market environment, our foundry is a little bit softer and we're working hard in a manner that we're seeing some wins there. But overall, I think that if you consider that we probably outran the industry, we're talking about industry growth in 2010 of maybe 5% CapEx and we're probably 20%, I wouldn't expect a 15% delta from overall industry, but I could envision us outgrowing the industry 5% kind of target range. But I think it's hard to get at 15% without the foundry intensity where it was. That said, the foundries, as we talked before on the 28 nanometer yield, we think that t the adoption in those is going to continue to be strong as a percent of overall CapEx based on their needs. But it's not -- I agree, the intensity level is hard to make math work if you have a soft Q1 with a slightly recovering Q2 for us."

That sort of depends to help our down Q3 is. But we actually hit in the backlog a little bit this quarter. We needed to do that a little bit just because we have built so much, we needed to ship it out. And it continues to profile out that most of the backlog should ship out over the next 6 to 9 months. If we are in a prolonged down, we will even do it pretty considerably, but if it's just a temporary low in the demand, there's a good chance of the dealing with a sizable amount of backlog in the next year."

So we have businesses that would benefit from that trend and we're already seeing -- I think there's a bifurcation by the way where EUV based on its current trajectory gets used for some layers, and say DRAM first, but they're still additional exotic lithography technologies. They're going to push our ability and in metrology businesses in particular. So we're seeing benefits from that. I think that continues.

So we're basing it on plans that people have in place and discussions, but I don't think we're going to really know a lot about December until we get through. Frankly, until early September is my expectation because I think there's just enough uncertainty out there right now. But yes, when we model it -- in our view, remember, modeling bookings for us is a different level of scrutiny that needs to go into that because of the backlog that we have and for people that book shipped it's a different game and we're able to run revenue significantly above bookings based on the backlog that we've got.

But what's Interesting is the soft part of the foundry utilization is not in the capitally intensive part of foundries which is -- it's the 65-nanometer and plus, it's where the utilization has softened and that's not where the business is for us. The question then is, does it slow the adoption of the tape-outs that are being done and have been done at 28 and right now the number of tape-outs is still significantly larger at this point in the cycle for 28 than it was for 40 or 45 at the same point in their relative history. So I think it has to do with the confidence of the customers of the foundries to go ahead and place big orders for that, and I think that there's a little bit of waiting time in that to see. So we have different scenarios and you're right, you have to model that into your assumptions. But in the end, you could try to be as precise as you want, but these things swing in big ways."

So I think there's a little bit of softness in that. Were benefiting in the wafer because we've introduced new products and new technologies. We talked about the SP3 at SEMICON West as a great example of a product that will sell into a market even if it's not expanding because of the technological capability and the push that our wafer customers are getting from their customers to make sure that they meet the levels of these activity that they can really only ensure what's with the new product. So I think we've got some -- in addition to the traditional capacity sales in the wafer market, I think we have the technology sales to go along with that.

KLA-Tencor delivered record revenue earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter and for fiscal year  2011, demonstrating our continued strong market leadership and successful execution of our long-term strategies for customer focus, growth and operations excellence in a period of robust industry growth. Bookings for the June quarter were $853 million, flat compared with March and at the upper end of the range of guidance. And in the fourth quarter, we experienced strong demand in each of our major end markets. 
Looking to our record, $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2011, 14% above the previous fourth quarter high that we set back in fiscal year 2007, driven by higher adoption of process control, growth in our services business and the addition of new markets.
June quarter revenue grew 7% to a record $892 million, coming in at the upper end of the range of guidance. And the non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.50 in Q4, above the range of guidance for the quarter. Contributing to these results in Q4 were record operating margin of 40.1%. Today, KLA-Tencor is reporting margins significantly above our baseline model, reflecting our cost discipline and the value that we bring to our customers. 
Finally, cash flow from operations was a record $290 million in Q4. And we were active in returning value to shareholders, purchasing -- repurchasing 1.4 million shares in the quarter for $58 million, and of course, paying our are regularly quarterly dividend. In fiscal year 2011, we repurchased a total of 6.2 million shares for $233 million. Also, as we announced on July 12, our Board of Directors have authorized an increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, which is scheduled to take effect beginning with our dividend to be declared next month. 
This move reflects management and the board's confidence in our long-term outlook for the company, as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment. So clearly, our results indicate another very strong performance for KLA-Tencor in Q4, capping a record year for the company and showcasing the strength of our market leadership and our industry-leading business model. Of course,, the driving force behind our success remains the strong effort in collaboration with our customers and business partners, as well as great execution of the worldwide workforce. And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank each and every employee for their contribution in helping KLA-Tencor excel in this environment and in shaping our future success. 
Shifting our focus now to the current period and our view of the near-term outlook, as reported at SEMICON West 2 weeks ago, the near-term industry demand environment has cooled off significantly of late with customers reassessing their capacity expansion plans and timelines and in light of persistent weakness in the macroeconomic environment and lackluster PC sales. However, looking past the current environment, we believe the drivers underlying long-term growth in our industry remained intact. 
With economic expansion in the emerging markets, the rapid proliferation of new end products featuring high IC content and increasing complexity as the bleeding edge, all pointing to healthy long-term equipment demand. And we further believe that our customers remain committed to their roadmap towards shrinking device sizes and other technology advancements as a means for driving future competitive differentiation and to lower cost. This technology focused plays in the K-T strength as the market leader in process control, as we play a critical role in helping our customers address the increasingly more difficult challenges associated with improving yields and lowering costs of the leading edge. In this environment, the long-term outlook for process control investment remains solid.
Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. For bookings. We have adjusted our internal forecast to reflect further deterioration in the market environment subsequent to SEMICON West. And we now expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of down 35% in the quarter, plus or minus 10% and bookings in the second half of 2011 to be down more than the 15% to 20% range we originally indicated. Guidance for revenue in September is in the range of $770 million to $820 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.24 in the quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?"

Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options-related litigation and certain costs and expenses, which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. 
There was a $0.07 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.
Q4 new orders were $853 million, essentially flat with last quarter. And net orders were $847 million, down slightly from $856 million last quarter. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distributions were as follows: the U.S. was 32% of new systems orders in Q4, up from 25% in the March quarter; Europe was 8% of new systems orders, down from 16 % in Q3; Japan was 22%, up from 17% last quarter; Korea was 13%, up from 9% last quarter; Taiwan was 21%, down from 23% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 4%, down from 10% in Q3. 
The Q4 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 42% compared to 48% last quarter; reticle inspection was 17%, up from 10% last quarter; metrology was 18%, down slightly from 19% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi were 6%, even with last quarter; and services was 17% of new orders in Q4, also even with the last quarter.
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by market and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were: 43% of new systems orders in Q4 were for foundry customers versus 58% in Q3; logic customers were 27% of orders in Q4 versus 15% in Q3; and memory orders were 30% in Q4, up from 27% last quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q1 will be down by 35% plus or minus 10% from Q4 new orders, or a range of $470 million to $640 million.  In Q4, we shipped $892 million versus $823 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both systems shipments and services revenue. And we expect shipments between $725 million and $750 million in Q1. Total backlog at the end of Q4 decreased slightly for March 31, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in systems backlog. Backlog at June 30, 2011 included $382 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and a little under $1 billion in system orders that have not yet shipped.
Total revenue for Q4 was $892 million, up 7% from $834 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q4 was up 8% to $744 million, compared with $691 million from Q3 and services revenue was $149 million in Q4, up about $6 million from Q3. Our expectation for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $770 million and $820 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.7% in the June quarter, down from 61.3% in March. The gross margin percentage decline from last quarter was due to higher parts cost in our services business. For Q1, we are expecting gross margins of approximately 60%. Operating expenses were $184 million in Q4, with the research and development component at $99 million and selling, general and administrative expenses at $85 million. OpEx was down about $6 million from Q3 because we received a $10 million payment in Q4 from the trustee expense in Japan following their bankruptcy in our fiscal 2009. 
Without this statement, OpEx would have been approximately $194 million, and our EPS would have been $0.04 lower. We expect operating expenses to increase to about $197 million in Q1. OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q4, about even with Q3. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q1 as well. In Q4, our non-GAAP income tax expense is $92 million or 26% of pretax income versus $87 million in Q3, which was 28% of pretax income. The Q4 tax expense percentage was lower than Q3 in part due to the release of certain tax reserves in Q4.
Non-GAAP net income was $256 million or $1.50 per share in Q4, up from $1.31 last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.42 per share. At the revenue range I've have previously mentioned and using a modeling rate for income taxes of 26%, we would expect our Q1 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.10 and $1.24 per share. 
At this point I would like to add some commentary on our go-forward, non-GAAP tax rate. As you know, for the past several years, we have used a 30% modeling rate for non-GAAP income taxes. 30% estimate was based on analysis and forecast from several years ago. And on today's call, we are updating this rate to 26%. The new modeling rate is based upon tax planning decisions we have implemented during the last few years and our estimated income projections for the next few years, which includes assumptions about the distribution of earnings between our U.S. and international locations. 
Because this rate is an amalgamation of many different rates from jurisdictions where we operate, and accounting rules for income taxes and related reserves are complex, our expectation is that the actual quarterly rate will almost never exactly match 26%. However, for purposes of issuing financial guidance moving forward, you can expect us to use the 26% rate, unless we are aware of specific factors that suggest another rate. 
The weighted average share that's used to compute EPS in Q4 were $170.9 million versus $171.3 million in Q3. During Q4, we spent $58 million, repurchasing about 1.4 million shares. And as of June 30, 2011, we had approximately 9 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share beginning in Q1. For guidance purposes, we are modeling in the same average the share count as Q4.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2 billion, up about $200 million from the end of March. Cash generated from operations was $290 million in Q4 compared with $244 million in Q3. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $583 million, up from $566 million at the end of March. DSOs were 59 days at June 30 versus 62 days in March. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring.
Net inventories increased by $19 million from March 31 and ended the quarter at $576 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.5 turns in Q4, which is flat with Q3. Capital expenditures were $15 million in Q4, about the same as Q3. The total headcount at June 30 was 5,492, up from 5,386 at March 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q1. 
In summary, our guidance for Q1 is: new orders down between the 25% and 45% from Q4, total revenue between $770 million and $820 million and non-GAAP EPS between $1.10 and $1.24 assuming a tax rate of 26%.
This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A."

Now the question was, during the year, there was a range of 0% to 10%. And then early in the year, people thought 5% to up 10%, and then towards the middle, it looked more like up 10%. And now, I think, it's kind of -- right now the current view that we're modeling for industry is probably in the up 5% range.

Now they're a little more aware of the challenges, but we're getting pushed very hard to bring out our latest capability and technology to get it in line because I think our customers are pretty aware that they're missing critical defects in areas that are going to cost problems for them. And there's also a metrology challenges. So I think more difficult and a lot of interest in technology buys.

So curious whether you agree with that and then if you do, whether you can grow as fast as the industry based on either growth in adjacent businesses like LED, et cetera, or increasing capital intensity at the 28-nanometer node will drive higher spend for process control from foundry and/or increasing intensity on the NAND side.

We do have some additional kickers, which help us in memory, and they're not perhaps as obvious as you might think, because we also have some market share wins in areas recently in memory, things like OCD, which I think helped provide additional catalyst. We've got areas like overlay, where we're strong. And so you have to kind of look broadly across the portfolio to see the opportunities for us. But there's no question that the softening right now or the current market environment, our foundry is a little bit softer. And we're working hard in the NAND, that we're seeing some wins there. But overall, I think that if you consider that we probably outran the industry -- we're talking about industry growth in 2010 of maybe 5% CapEx, and we are probably 20%, I wouldn't expect a 15% delta from overall industry. But I could envision us outgrowing the industry in a 5% kind of target range. But I think it will be hard to get that 15% without the foundry intensity where it was. That said, the foundries, as we talked before on the 28 nanometer yield, we think that the adoption in those, that is going to continue to be strong as a percent of overall CapEx based on their needs.

It sort of depends on how far down Q3 is. But we actually ate in the backlog a little bit this quarter. We needed to do that a little bit just because we had built so much, we needed to ship it out. And it continues to profile out, but most of the backlog should ship out over the next 6 to 9 months. If we were in a prolonged down, we will eat into it pretty considerably.

And we're already seeing -- I think there's a bifurcation, by the way, where EUV, based on its current trajectory, gets used for some layers, and say DRAM first. But there's still additional exotic lithography technologies. They're going to push our ability in metrology businesses, in particular. So we are seeing benefit from that. I think that continues.

Frankly, it's until early September is my expectation because I think there's just enough uncertainty out there right now. But, yes. I mean, When we model it -- and our view is, remember, modeling bookings for us is that different  level of scrutiny needs to go into that because of the backlog that we have and for people that are book shipped, it's a different game. And we're able to run revenues significantly above bookings based on the backlog that we've got. And so we do some back-of-the-envelope calculations.

And right now the number of tape-outs is still significantly larger at this point in the cycle for 28 than it was for 40 or 45 at the same point in their relative history. So I think it has to do with the confidence of the customers of the foundries to go ahead and place big orders for that. And I think that there's a little bit of waiting time in that to see.

And I do think they've had a signal to back off a little bit as people figure out exactly whether capacity orders and levels are going to be. So I think there's a little bit of softness in that. Were benefiting in the wafer because we've introduced new products and new technologies. And we talked about the SP3 at SEMICON West as a great example of a product that will sell into a market even if it's not expanding because of the technological capability and the push that our wafer customers are getting from their customers to make sure that they meet the levels of these activity that they can really only ensure with the new product. So I think we've got some -- in addition to the traditional capacity sales in the wafer market, I think we have some technology sales to go along with that.

And we don't want aggregate it, but if you ask me, a year from now, do I think foundries are going to be investing heavily? I think if you believe that we're in a long-term positive cycle then, of course, you'd see the foundries come back after what would be a very reasonable kind of adjustment after a prolonged long period of investment.

Thank you all for joining us for our call today. Given that we provided a thorough business update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary today on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then M",793,"Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. Given that we provided a thorough business update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary today on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then Mark will follow with a more detailed review of the financials. 
KLA-Tencor delivered record revenue earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2011, demonstrating our continued strong market leadership and successful execution of our long-term strategies for customer focus, growth and operations excellence in a period of robust industry growth. Bookings for the June quarter were $853 million, flat compared with March and at the upper end of the range of guidance. And in the fourth quarter, we experienced strong demand in each of our major end markets, looking for a record $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2011, 14% above the previous fourth quarter high that we set back in fiscal year 2007, driven by higher adoption of process control, growth in our services business and the addition of new markets.
June quarter revenue grew 7% to a record $892 million, coming in at the upper end of the range of guidance. And the non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.50 in Q4, above the range of guidance for the quarter. Contributing to these results in Q4 were record operating margin of 40.1%. Today, KLA-Tencor is reporting margins significantly above our baseline model, reflecting our cost discipline and the value that we bring to our customers. 
Finally, cash flow from operations was a record $290 million in Q4. And we were active in returning value to shareholders, purchasing -- repurchasing 1.4 million shares in the quarter for $58 million, and of course, paying our are regularly quarterly dividend. In fiscal year 2011, we repurchased a total of 6.2 million shares for $233 million. Also, as we announced on July 12, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, which is scheduled to take effect beginning with our dividend to be declared next month. 
This move reflects management and the board's confidence in our long-term outlook for the company, as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment. So clearly, our results indicate another very strong performance for KLA-Tencor in Q4, capping a record year for the company and showcasing the strength of our market leadership and our industry-leading business model. Of course, the driving force behind our success remains the strong effort in collaboration with our customers and business partners, as well as great execution of the worldwide workforce. And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank each and every employee for their contribution in helping KLA-Tencor excel in this environment and in shaping our future success. 
Shifting our focus now to the current period and our view of the near-term outlook, as we reported at SEMICON West 2 weeks ago, the near-term industry demand environment has cooled off significantly of late with customers reassessing their capacity expansion plans and timelines and in light of persistent weakness in the macroeconomic environment and lackluster PC sales. However, looking past the current environment, we believe the drivers underlying long-term growth in our industry remain intact. 
With economic expansion in the emerging markets, the rapid proliferation of new end products featuring high IC content and increasing complexity as the leading edge, all pointing to healthy long-term equipment demand. And we further believe that our customers remain committed to their roadmap towards shrinking device sizes and other technology advancements as a means for driving future competitive differentiation and to lower cost. This technology focus plays in the K-T strength as the market leader in process control, as we play a critical role in helping our customers address the increasingly more difficult challenges associated with improving yields and lowering costs of leading edge. In this environment, the long-term outlook for process control investment remains solid.
Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. For bookings, we have adjusted our internal forecast to reflect further deterioration in the market environment subsequent to SEMICON West. And we now expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of down 35% in the quarter, plus or minus 10% and bookings in the second half of 2011 to be down more than the 15% to 20% range we originally indicated. Guidance for revenue in September is in the range of $770 million to $820 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.24 in the quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?"
282225,137578001,148367,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any e",1298,"Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options-related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. 
There was a $0.07 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.
Q4 new orders were $853 million, essentially flat with last quarter. And net orders were $847 million, down slightly from $856 million last quarter. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distributions were as follows: the U.S. was 32% of new systems orders in Q4, up from 25% in the March quarter; Europe was 8% of new systems orders, down from 16% in Q3; Japan was 22%, up from 17% last quarter; Korea was 13%, up from 9% last quarter; Taiwan was 21%, down from 23% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 4%, down from 10% in Q3. 
The Q4 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 42% compared to 48% last quarter; reticle inspection was 17%, up from 10% last quarter; metrology was 18%, down slightly from 19% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi were 6%, even with last quarter; and services was 17% of new orders in Q4, also even with the last quarter.
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by market and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were: 43% of new systems orders in Q4 were for foundry customers versus 58% in Q3; logic customers were 27% of orders in Q4 versus 15% in Q3; and memory orders were 30% in Q4, up from 27% last quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q1 will be down by 35% plus or minus 10% from Q4 new orders, or a range of $470 million to $640 million.  In Q4, we shipped $892 million versus $823 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both systems shipments and services revenue. And we expect shipments between $725 million and $750 million in Q1. Total backlog at the end of Q4 decreased slightly for March 31, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in systems backlog. Backlog at June 30, 2011 included $382 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and a little under $1 billion in system orders that have not yet shipped.
Total revenue for Q4 was $892 million, up 7% from $834 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q4 was up 8% to $744 million, compared with $691 million from Q3 and services revenue was $149 million in Q4, up about $6 million from Q3. Our expectation for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $770 million and $820 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.7% in the June quarter, down from 61.3% in March. The gross margin percentage decline from last quarter was due to higher parts cost in our services business. For Q1, we are expecting gross margins of approximately 60%. Operating expenses were $184 million in Q4, with the research and development component at $99 million and selling, general and administrative expenses at $85 million. OpEx was down about $6 million from Q3 because we received a $10 million payment in Q4 from the trustee expense in Japan following their bankruptcy in our fiscal 2009. 
Without this statement, OpEx would have been approximately $194 million, and our EPS would have been $0.04 lower. We expect operating expenses to increase to about $197 million in Q1. OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q4, about even with Q3. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q1 as well. In Q4, our non-GAAP income tax expense is $92 million or 26% of pretax income versus $87 million in Q3, which was 28% of pretax income. The Q4 tax expense percentage was lower than Q3 in part due to the release of certain tax reserves in Q4.
Non-GAAP net income was $256 million or $1.50 per share in Q4, up from $1.31 last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.42 per share. At the revenue range I've have previously mentioned and using a modeling rate for income taxes of 26%, we would expect our Q1 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.10 and $1.24 per share. 
At this point I would like to add some commentary on our go-forward, non-GAAP tax rate. As you know, for the past several years, we have used a 30% modeling rate for non-GAAP income taxes. 30% estimate was based on analysis and forecast from several years ago. And on today's call, we are updating this rate to 26%. The new modeling rate is based upon tax planning decisions we have implemented during the last few years and our estimated income projections for the next few years, which includes assumptions about the distribution of earnings between our U.S. and international locations. 
Because this rate is an amalgamation of many different rates from jurisdictions where we operate, and accounting rules for income taxes and related reserves are complex, our expectation is that the actual quarterly rate will almost never exactly match 26%. However, for purposes of issuing financial guidance moving forward, you can expect us to use the 26% rate, unless we are aware of specific factors that suggest another rate. 
The weighted average share that's used to compute EPS in Q4 were $170.9 million versus $171.3 million in Q3. During Q4, we spent $58 million, repurchasing about 1.4 million shares. And as of June 30, 2011, we had approximately 9 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share beginning in Q1. For guidance purposes, we are modeling in the same average the share count as Q4.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2 billion, up about $200 million from the end of March. Cash generated from operations was $290 million in Q4 compared with $244 million in Q3. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $583 million, up from $566 million at the end of March. DSOs were 59 days at June 30 versus 62 days in March. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring.
Net inventories increased by $19 million from March 31 and ended the quarter at $576 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.5 turns in Q4, which is flat with Q3. Capital expenditures were $15 million in Q4, about the same as Q3. The total headcount at June 30 was 5,492, up from 5,386 at March 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q1. 
In summary, our guidance for Q1 is: new orders down between the 25% and 45% from Q4, total revenue between $770 million and $820 million and non-GAAP EPS between $1.10 and $1.24 assuming a tax rate of 26%.
This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A."

Just the reduced marginality and the process window associated with 28 and 20 nanometers creates opportunities for us. And also in -- and generally, and the overlay constraints are creating opportunities, too.

So, I'd say, probably more predominately foundry than the other segments. Logic continues to be pretty strong. Memory is kind of a different factor, more associated, I think, in the DRAM case, with concerns about PC. And flash, I think, there is just some general conservatism.

Now the question was, during the year, there was a range of 0% to 10%. And then early in the year, people thought 5% to up 10%, and then towards the middle, it looked more like up 10%. And now, I think it's kind of -- right now the current view that we're modeling for industry is probably in the up 5% range.

So curious whether you agree with that and then if you do, whether you can grow as fast as the industry based on either growth in adjacent businesses like LED, et cetera, or increasing capital intensity at the 28-nanometer node will drive higher spend for process control from foundry and/or increasing intensity on the NAND side. We'd love to hear your thoughts."

Sure, C.J. Great question. I think that -- there is no question, we're seeing a -- maybe a consolidation in terms of the spending that was made in foundry and people are dealing with the digestion, which means for the next 4 quarters, our view is foundry intensity versus the last 4 is going to be lower, even though we think it's probably lowest in the next quarter and then we see some improvement as we go out. We do have some additional kickers which help us in memory, and they're not perhaps as obvious as you might think because we also have some market share wins in areas recently in memory, things like OCD, which I think helped provide additional catalyst. We've got areas like overlay, where we're strong. And so you have to kind of look broadly across the portfolio to see the opportunities for us. But there's no question that the softening right now in the current market environment, our foundry is a little bit softer. And we're working hard in the NAND and we're seeing some wins there. But overall, I think that if you consider that we probably outran the industry -- we're talking about industry growth in 2010 of maybe 5% CapEx and we are probably 20%, I wouldn't expect a 15% delta from overall industry. But I could envision us outgrowing the industry in a 5% kind of target range. But I think it will be hard to get that 15% without the foundry intensity where it was. That said, the foundries, as we talked before on the 28-nanometer yield, we think that the adoption in those is going to continue to be strong as a percent of overall CapEx based on their needs. But it's not. I agree, the intensity level -- it's just hard to make the math work if you have a soft Q1 with a slightly recovering Q2 for us."

It sort of depends on how far down Q3 is. But we actually ate into the backlog a little bit this quarter. We needed to do that a little bit just because we had built so much we needed to ship it out. And it continues to profile out, but most of the backlog should ship out over the next 6 to 9 months. If we were in a prolonged down, we will eat into it pretty considerably.

But there's still additional exotic lithography technologies that are going to push our ability in metrology businesses, in particular. So we are seeing benefit from that. I think that continues.

The question then is, does it slow the adoption of the tape-outs that are being done and have been done at 28? And right now the number of tape-outs is still significantly larger at this point in the cycle for 28 than it was for 40 or 45 at the same point in their relative history. So I think it has to do with the confidence of the customers of the foundries to go ahead and place big orders for that. And I think that there's a little bit of waiting time in that to see.

Were benefiting in the wafer because we've introduced new products and new technologies. We talked about the SP3 at SEMICON West as a great example of a product that will sell into a market even if it's not expanding because of the technological capability and the push that our wafer customers are getting from their customers to make sure that they meet the levels of these activities that they can really only ensure with the new product.

And we don't want aggregate it, but if you ask me a year from now do I think foundries are going to be investing heavily?

September quarter results executing well in a difficult industry environment capitalizing on our market leadership and strong business model to deliver solid operating performance and return significant cash to our shareholders. Revenue was $796 million in Q1, just above the midpoint of guidance, and non-GAAP net income per share was right at the midpoint of guidance of $1.17. We generated $219 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, paid our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, reflecting the increase in our dividend level announced in July and repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock, ending the quarter with a healthy $2.1 billion in cash and securities. 
Looking at the September demand environment, persistent economic weakness compounded the normal cyclical factors facing our industry. Leading customers to scale back or delay capacity expansion plans. Spending was concentrated among the market leaders and focused primarily on supporting technology development at the leading edge. New orders for KLA-Tencor in Q1 were $486 million, down 43% sequentially. This result was in line with our revised outlook we gave on September 8, and reflects the general demand climate I just outlined. Although overall order levels were low in Q1 as expected, the end market story is highlighted by relative strength from the foundries in the quarter. Foundries bookings were 57% in new orders in Q1, and we're expecting growth from the foundries to continue in Q2 with demand coming from selected market leaders investing to ramp their 28-nanometer designs to enable advanced technology development at the next notes. Bookings from logic customers were 22% of the total in September quarter, and memory orders were low at 21% of the total. 
Setting aside the macroeconomic and cyclical factors currently impacting the industry, we look ahead to 2012 with a good deal of optimism as the forces that propel KLA-Tencor's growth and market leadership remains solid. Though overall equipment demand is experiencing a cyclical pause, technology investment remains a priority for the market leader as they execute competitive strategies at the leading edge. This technology focus is favorable for KLA-Tencor as process controls plays a critical role in helping IC manufacturers address the increasingly more complex yield challenges associated in qualifying new technologies and this is driving higher adoption in our core markets. 
Given KLA-Tencor's market leadership, strong new product acceptance and industry-leading business model, we think the stage is set for the company to outperform in 2012. 
Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter. We exited Q1 with new orders picking up in the final base of the quarter. We expect this momentum to continue in Q2, highlighted by strength from the Tier 1 foundries and growing adoption of our latest generation bright LED technology and leading edge memory. December bookings are expected to be up 35%, plus or minus 10%, compared with September. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be between $600 million and $650 million with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.56 per share to $0.72 per share. With $1.1 billion in backlog as of September 30, and our anticipated order growth in Q2, we expect revenue growth to resume in the first quarter of calendar 2012. I will now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark?"

The structure related charges and credits and any cost for credits goods which are outside of our core operations including unusual tax items. There was a $0.04 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. A balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks in GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make a distinction. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. 
Q1 new orders were $486 million and net orders were $481 million. Both order figures were down about 43% from last quarter. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 32% in the June quarter. Europe was 7% of new systems orders, down from 8% in Q4. Japan was 8%, down from 22% last quarter, up from 13% last quarter, 22%, up from 21% last quarter, and the rest of Asia was 9% up from 4% in Q4. The distribution in new systems and services orders by product family in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution orders are as follows: Wafer inspection is 28%, compared with 42% last quarter; critical inspection was 18% up from 17% last quarter; metrology was 14%, down from 18% the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 9%, up from 6% last quarter, and service was 31% of new orders in Q1, up from 17% last quarter. Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by product in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: 57% of new systems orders in Q1 were from foundry customers, up from 43% in Q4; logic customers were 22% of new orders in Q1, versus 27% in Q4; and memory orders were 21% in Q1, down from 30% last quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q2 will be up by 35%, plus or minus 10% from Q1 new orders or a range of about $605 million to $705 million. 
In Q1, we shipped $690 million versus $892 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue and we expect the shipments between $650 million and $700 million in Q2. Total backlog at the end of Q1 decreased by $316 million from June 30 and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in systems backlog. The backlog in September 30, 2011, included $275 million of revenue backlog of products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet recognized as revenue and about $780 million in systems orders that were not yet shipped. 
Total revenue for Q1 was $796 million, down 11% from $892 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q1 was down 13% to $650 million, and services revenue was $146 million, down about $3 million. Our expectation for total revenue in Q2 is a range between $600 million and $650 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 58% in September quarter, down from 60.7% in June. About half of the quarter-to-quarter decline in margin percentage was attributable to higher excess inventory reserves in excess capacity and a portion related to the lower revenue buy. For Q2, we are expecting gross margins between 57% and 58%. 
Operating expenses were $198 million in Q1, compared with $184 billion in Q4, which was benefited by a $10 million payment following their bankruptcy in 2009. Research and development expenses were $105 million in Q1, and selling, general and administrative expenses were $93 million. We expect operating expenses to be about $200 million to $205 million in Q2. 
OIE was a net $7 million expense in Q1, down about $3 million from Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q2. 
In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $59 million or 23% of pre-tax income versus 26% rate in Q4. The Q1 tax expense percentage was lower in Q4, in part due to a favorable resolution of U.S. federal tax audit during Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $198 million or $1.17 per share in Q4, down from $1.50 last quarter. If you apply cluttered if it by our model tax rate of 26%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings would've been $1.12 per share. And the revenue range as previously mentioned, I'm using a tax rate of 26%. We would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.72 per share. 
Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were $169.8 million, which is $170.9 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $67 million repurchasing about $1.8 million shares and as of September 30, 2011, we had approximately 7.3 million shares available our current repurchase authorization. We also paid. $58 million in dividends during Q1. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in Q2. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of $169 million for Q2. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, up about $62 million from the end of June. Cash generated from operations was $219 million in Q1, compared with $290 million in Q4. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter with $53 million, down from $583 million at the end of June. DSOs were 53 days at September 30 versus 59 days at June. Both DSO figures, are net of allowance of uncollectible accounts factoring. Net inventories increased by $37 million from June 30 and ended the quarter at $613 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.2 turns in Q1, was 2.5 turns in Q4. Capital expenditures were $12 million in Q1, down $3 million from Q4. 
Total headcount as of September 30 was 5,047, up from 5,492 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2. 
In summary, our guidance for Q2 is new orders up between 25% and 45% from Q1, total revenue between $600 million and $650 million, and non-GAAP earnings between $0.56 and $0.72 per share with a tax rate of 26%. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter, and we'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

But since the manufacturing ramp right now is happening in 28, and as people see the latest technology, that's really where the main application is . But I would say, a year ago we had people buying our technology that we had available then, trying to do 28. What happened is they realized that they are critical defect types and measurements they can't make with the -- can't make as well. And so they're always buying out, but they don't often realize the value of the utility until they get a comparison. And so often we are competing with our own generation -- prior generation and we have to show the differentiation which is happening now. But they want insight into R&D staff as well."

We were surprised, as I mentioned earlier, in the market interest in some of our advanced technologies, most specifically wafer inspection seems a real strong demand. But also some of that is new penetration, so we had a real nice evening review business that's picked up and gained some real good share and that's partly contributing to it as we are seeing more market share than depict some of that up as I said review. And that's based on the capability we have to review the defects that our advance inspectors find, the unique capability. So part of it is adoption of advanced technology, part of it is share, and part of it frankly is there are more foundry players struggling with their yield issues at 28. And I think it's still relatively early in that, and so we modeled the rest of -- as we look at the next several quarters, we think that the bookings, the bottom for bookings was September quarter and through our fiscal year we can see continued strength based on the challenges people are having, not just in the foundries but also some of the things we think are coming along in memory, too.

And I think we've got pretty good approaches to that. And then there's a defect inspection which I feel pretty good about our position there. But anytime there's major process architecture change, 2 things happen. One, we have to make sure our existing technology can support that change and the other is our customers tend to go through integration issues which cost yield problems which can accelerate their need for inspection measurements. So as long as we're able to capitalize it, I think it creates great opportunity for us but at the same time, until it plays out, we don't know that.

And I think it's similar in terms of the challenge, and I think once again caught many of our customers by surprise, because they thought they had dialed and perhaps what they saw in prototyping they though would extend the manufacturing and that's not what's happening. So it's a good opportunity for us. The great -- the biggest part of that though is the new technologies that were brought to market suddenly give us something to share that customers that switched their buying philosophy from interesting to I must have it, when can I get my spot, why I don't have a slot, why can't you give me more slots which are really -- we want to help our customers, support them, but it's challenge for us to be able to ramp up.

September quarter results, show KLA-Tencor, executing well in a difficult industry environment. Capitalizing on our market leadership and strong business model, to deliver solid operating performance and return significant cash to our shareholders. Revenue was $796 million in Q1, just above the midpoint of guidance, and non-GAAP net income per share was right at the midpoint of guidance of $1.17. 
We generated $219 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, paid our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, reflecting the increase in our dividend level announced in July, and repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock, ending the quarter with a healthy $2.1 billion in cash and securities. 
Looking at the September demand environment, persistent economic weakness, compounded the normal cyclical factors facing our industry. Leading customers to scale back or delay capacity expansion plans. Spending was concentrated among the market leaders, and focused primarily, on supporting technology development at the leading edge. New orders for KLA-Tencor in Q1 were $486 million, down 43% sequentially. 
This result was in line with our revised outlook we gave on September 8, and reflects the general demand climate I just outlined. Although overall order levels were low in Q1, as expected, the end market story is highlighted by relative strength from the foundries in the quarter. Foundry bookings were 57% in new orders in Q1, and we are expecting growth from the foundries to continue in Q2, with demand coming from selected market leaders, investing to ramp their 28-nanometer designs, to enable advanced technology development at the next nodes. Bookings from logic customers were 22% of the total in September quarter, and memory orders were low at 21% of the total. 
Setting aside the macroeconomic and cyclical factors currently impacting the industry, we look ahead to 2012, with a good deal of optimism, as the forces that propel KLA-Tencor's growth and market leadership remains solid. Though overall equipment demand is experiencing a cyclical pause, technology investment remains a priority for the market leader, as they execute their competitive strategies at the leading edge. This technology focus is favorable for KLA-Tencor, as process controls plays a critical role in helping IC manufacturers address the increasingly more complex yield challenges, associated to qualifying new technologies, and this is driving higher adoption in our core markets. 
Given KLA-Tencor's market leadership, strong new product acceptance, and industry-leading business model, we think the stage is set for the company to outperform in 2012. 
Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter. We exited Q1 with new orders picking up in the final days of the quarter. We expect this momentum will continue in Q2, highlighted by strength from the Tier 1 foundries and growing adoption of our latest generation Brightfield technology and leading-edge memory. 
December bookings are expected to be up 35%, plus or minus 10%, compared with September. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be between $600 million and $650 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.56 per share to $0.72 per share. With $1.1 billion in backlog as of September 30, and our anticipated order growth in Q2, we expect revenue growth to resume in the first quarter of calendar 2012. I will now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark?"

One under U.S. GAAP, and the other in the non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions. Restructuring-related charges and credits and any cost or credits, which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. There was a $0.04 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. A balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks are on GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. 
Q1 new orders were $486 million and net orders were $481 million. Both order figures were down about 43% from last quarter. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 32% in the June quarter; Europe was 7% of new systems orders, down from 8% in Q4; japan was 8%, down from 22% last quarter, up from 13% last quarter; and [ph] was 22%, up from 21% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 9% up from 4% in Q4. 
The distribution in new systems and services orders by product family in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection is 28%, compared with 42% last quarter; critical reticle inspection was 18%, up from 17% last quarter; metrology was 14%, down from 18% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 9%, up from 6% last quarter; and service was 31% of new orders in Q1, up from 17% last quarter. 
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution in new orders by product and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: 57% of new systems orders in Q1 were from foundry customers, up from 43% in Q4; logic customers were 22% of new orders in Q1, versus 27% in Q4; and memory orders were 21% in Q1, down from 30% last quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q2 will be up by 35%, plus or minus 10% from Q1 new orders or a range of about $605 million to $705 million. In Q1, we shipped $690 million versus $892 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $650 million and $700 million in Q2. 
Total backlog at the end of Q1 decreased by $316 million from June 30, and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at September 30, 2011, included $275 million of revenue backlog, of products that have been shipped and invoiced, but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and about $780 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped. 
Total revenue for Q1 was $796 million, down 11% from $892 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q1 was down 13% to $650 million, and services revenue was $146 million, down about $3 million  [indiscernible]. Our expectation for total revenue in Q2 is a range between $600 million and $650 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 58% in the September quarter, down from 60.7% in June. About half of the quarter-to-quarter decline in margin percentage, was attributable to higher excess inventory reserves and excess capacity, and a portion related to the lower revenue volume. For Q2, we are expecting gross margins between 57% and 58%. 
Operating expenses were $198 million in Q1, compared with $184 billion in Q4, which was benefited by a $10 million payment from extension following their bankruptcy in 2009. Research and development expenses were $105 million in Q1, and selling, general and administrative expenses were $93 million. We expect operating expenses to be about $200 million to $205 million in Q2. 
OIE was a net $7 million expense in Q1, down about $3 million from Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q2. 
In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $59 million or 23% of pre-tax income versus a 26% rate in Q4. The Q1 tax expense percentage was lower than in Q4, in part due to a favorable resolution of a U.S. federal tax audit during Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $198 million or $1.17 per share in Q4, down from $1.50 last quarter. If we apply our modeled tax rate of 26%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings would've been $1.12 per share. At the revenue range I had previously mentioned, and using a tax rate of 26%, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.72 per share. 
Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were $169.8 million, versus $170.9 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $67 million repurchasing about $1.8 million shares, and as of September 30, 2011, we had approximately 7.3 million shares available, our current repurchase authorization. We also paid. $58 million in dividends during Q1. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in Q2. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of $169 million for Q2. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, up about $62 million from the end of June. Cash generated from operations was $219 million in Q1, compared with $290 million in Q4. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter with $62 million, down from $583 million at the end of June. DSOs were 53 days at September 30 versus 59 days at June. Both DSO figures, are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories increased by $37 million from June 30 and ended the quarter at $613 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.2 turns in Q1, versus 2.5 turns in Q4. Capital expenditures were $12 million in Q1, down $3 million from Q4. 
Total headcount at September 30, was 5,047, up from 5,492 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2. 
In summary, our guidance for Q2 is, new orders up between 25% and 45% from Q1, total revenue between $600 million and $650 million, and non-GAAP earnings between $0.56 and $0.72 per share, with a tax rate of 26%. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter, and we'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

And as I said, e-Beam review. And that's based on the capability we have to review the defects that our advance inspectors find, the unique capability. So part of it is adoption of advanced technologies, part of it is share, and part of it, frankly, is there are more foundry players struggling with their yield issues at 28. And I think it's still relatively early in that, and so we modeled the rest of -- as we look out the next several quarters, we think that the bookings, the bottom for bookings was September quarter, and through our fiscal year, we can see continued strength based on the challenges people are having, not just in the foundries, but also some of the things we think are coming along in memory, too.

But we don't -- we're not guiding past December, but we do see encouraging signs. This is truly the bottom in terms of bookings in September, then of course, you'd see a resumption of an increasing trend. Although it can increase for awhile, and still not get back to the peaks of the prior cycle that we just went through. So we are coming off a relatively low base in September."

Yes, we're hearing very much the same thing and we have a lot of conversations about that when we meet with customers.

As I mentioned, a lot of interest in that, and we're seeing a strong adoption, and we feel very fortunate about our position there and think that'll continue to grow. The same is true for our narrowband tool, our Darkfield tool. We're seeing a lot of adoption, particularly, when we think about some of the opportunities we have in memory, that product is strong. And then the other product that complements those tools, our e-Beam review, where we're seeing a continued gain in market share, because we've got the only review tool in the market that's capable of reviewing the defects that our advanced inspectors find in a fast and efficient manner, and it makes everything more valuable, it makes our Brightfield, and Darkfield more valuable for our customers. Even our bare wafer benefits from it. And our customers find that with that insight as to what their problems are, they have a better shot at fixing them. So I think all those products should continue to be strong, and we're seeing very much the same thing from our customers that you're hearing from them. They need to find and fix these critical defects, is the only way they can ramp these advanced technology nodes."

I think there has been the area where frankly, we've had more challenges with lower-cost competitors, is in DRAM in particular. And part of that is -- I think the challenge that we have in DRAM is that you got redundancy, and so people can -- they don't need quite as pure a process to be able to survive. But that said, I think people are really dealing with the challenges. And lithography is one area where, because of multiple patterning, some of the challenges people face on just look of constraints, we have strong business in the metrology. And I'd say defect inspection, we've got some new product offerings that we think should position us well from a competitive standpoint. But we've got work to do to demonstrate the capability to be able to drive adoption out. And clearly, DRAM market in general is not a particularly, fast-growing market. So I think frankly, NAND has more promise in terms of getting a larger percent of the CapEx, as we go forward."

September quarter results, show KLA-Tencor, executing well in a difficult industry environment. Capitalizing on our market leadership and strong business model, to deliver solid operating performance and return significant cash to our shareholders. Revenue was $796 million in Q1, just above the midpoint of guidance, and non-GAAP net income per share was right at the midpoint of guidance of $1.17. 
We generated $219 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, paid our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, reflecting the increase in our dividend level announced in July, and repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock, ending the quarter with a healthy $2.1 billion in cash and securities. 
Looking at the September demand environment, persistent economic weakness, compounded the normal cyclical factors facing our industry. Leading customers to scale back or delay capacity expansion plans. Spending was concentrated among the market leaders, and focused primarily, on supporting technology development at the leading edge. New orders for KLA-Tencor in Q1 were $486 million, down 43% sequentially. 
This result was in line with our revised outlook we gave on September 8, and reflects the general demand climate I just outlined. Although overall order levels were low in Q1, as expected, the end market story is highlighted by relative strength from the foundries in the quarter. Foundry bookings were 57% in new orders in Q1, and we are expecting growth from the foundries to continue in Q2, with demand coming from selected market leaders, investing to ramp their 28-nanometer designs, to enable advanced technology development at the next nodes. Bookings from logic customers were 22% of the total in September quarter, and memory orders were low at 21% of the total. 
Setting aside the macroeconomic and cyclical factors currently impacting the industry, we look ahead to 2012, with a good deal of optimism, as the forces that propel KLA-Tencor's growth and market leadership remains solid. Though overall equipment demand is experiencing a cyclical pause, technology investment remains a priority for the market leaders, as they execute their competitive strategies at the leading edge. This technology focus is favorable for KLA-Tencor, as process controls plays a critical role in helping IC manufacturers address the increasingly more complex yield challenges associated with qualifying new technologies, and this is driving higher adoption in our core markets. 
Given KLA-Tencor's market leadership, strong new product acceptance, and industry-leading business model, we think the stage is set for the company to outperform in 2012. 
Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter. We exited Q1 with new orders picking up in the final days of the quarter. We expect this momentum will continue in Q2, highlighted by strength from the Tier 1 foundries and growing adoption of our latest generation Brightfield technology and leading-edge memory. 
December bookings are expected to be up 35%, plus or minus 10%, compared with September. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be between $600 million and $650 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.56 per share to $0.72 per share. With $1.1 billion in backlog as of September 30, and our anticipated order growth in Q2, we expect revenue growth to resume in the first quarter of calendar 2012. I will now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark?"

As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats. One under U.S. GAAP, and the other in the non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions. Restructuring-related charges and credits and any cost or credits, which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. There was a $0.04 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks are on GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. 
Q1 new orders were $486 million and net orders were $481 million. Both order figures were down about 43% from last quarter. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 32% in the June quarter; Europe was 7% of new systems orders, down from 8% in Q4; Japan was 8%, down from 22% last quarter, up from 13% last quarter; and [ph] was 22%, up from 21% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 9% up from 4% in Q4. 
The distribution in new systems and services orders by product family in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection is 28%, compared with 42% last quarter; reticle inspection was 18%, up from 17% last quarter; metrology was 14%, down from 18% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 9%, up from 6% last quarter; and service was 31% of new orders in Q1, up from 17% last quarter. 
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution in new orders by product and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: 57% of new systems orders in Q1 were from foundry customers, up from 43% in Q4; logic customers were 22% of new orders in Q1, versus 27% in Q4; and memory orders were 21% in Q1, down from 30% last quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q2 will be up by 35%, plus or minus 10% from Q1 new orders or a range of about $605 million to $705 million. In Q1, we shipped $690 million versus $892 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $650 million and $700 million in Q2. 
Total backlog at the end of Q1 decreased by $316 million from June 30, and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at September 30, 2011, included $275 million of revenue backlog, of products that have been shipped and invoiced, but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and about $780 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped. 
Total revenue for Q1 was $796 million, down 11% from $892 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q1 was down 13% to $650 million, and services revenue was $146 million, down about $3 million  [audio gap]. Our expectation for total revenue in Q2 is a range between $600 million and $650 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 58% in the September quarter, down from 60.7% in June. About half of the quarter-to-quarter decline in margin percentage, was attributable to higher excess inventory reserves and excess capacity, and a portion related to the lower revenue volume. For Q2, we are expecting gross margins between 57% and 58%. 
Operating expenses were $198 million in Q1, compared with $184 billion in Q4, which was benefited by a $10 million payment from expansion [ph] following their bankruptcy in 2009. Research and development expenses were $105 million in Q1, and selling, general and administrative expenses were $93 million. We expect operating expenses to be about $200 million to $205 million in Q2. 
OIE was a net $7 million expense in Q1, down about $3 million from Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q2. 
In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $59 million or 23% of pre-tax income versus a 26% rate in Q4. The Q1 tax expense percentage was lower than in Q4, in part due to a favorable resolution of a U.S. federal tax audit during Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $198 million or $1.17 per share in Q4, down from $1.50 last quarter. If we apply our modeled tax rate of 26%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings would've been $1.12 per share. At the revenue range I had previously mentioned, and using a tax rate of 26%, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.72 per share. 
Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were $169.8 million, versus $170.9 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $67 million repurchasing about $1.8 million shares, and as of September 30, 2011, we had approximately 7.3 million shares available, our current repurchase authorization. We also paid. $58 million in dividends during Q1. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in Q2. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of $169 million for Q2. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, up about $62 million from the end of June. Cash generated from operations was $219 million in Q1, compared with $290 million in Q4. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter with $62 million, down from $583 million at the end of June. DSOs were 53 days at September 30 versus 59 days at June. Both DSO figures, are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories increased by $37 million from June 30 and ended the quarter at $613 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.2 turns in Q1, versus 2.5 turns in Q4. Capital expenditures were $12 million in Q1, down $3 million from Q4. 
Total headcount at September 30, was 5,047, up from 5,492 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2. 
In summary, our guidance for Q2 is, new orders up between 25% and 45% from Q1, total revenue between $600 million and $650 million, and non-GAAP earnings between $0.56 and $0.72 per share, with a tax rate of 26%. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter, and we'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

One is it's really -- the foundries tend to be pushing more leading edge, than they were. At that time, they weren't leading as much, and technology as they're now, and that's driven by their customer needs. If you look back in time too, there wasn't the -- back then, just take one company like a TI, had their own fab capability. And now, they might be ordering and they don't. So the fabless community has increased. And there's more intensity for advanced designs. The other thing we're seeing, there are actually more design starts at this point in the cycle at 28 nanometer, than they were, even at 45. So there's definitely a lot of customer interest in that capability."

And as I said, e-Beam review. And that's based on the capability we have to review the defects that our advance inspectors find, the unique capability. So part of it is adoption of advanced technologies, part of it is share, and part of it, frankly, is there are more foundry players struggling with their yield issues at 28. And I think it's still relatively early in that, and so we modeled the rest of -- as we look out the next several quarters, we think that the bookings, the bottom for bookings was September quarter, and through our fiscal year, we can see continued strength based on the challenges people are having, not just in the foundries, but also some of the things we think are coming along in memory, too.

And I think, it's similar in terms of the challenge, and I think once again, caught many of our customers by surprise, because they thought they had it dialed and perhaps, what they saw in prototyping, they thought would extend the manufacturing, and that's not what's happening. So it's a good opportunity for us. The great part -- the biggest part of that though, is the new technologies that were brought to market, suddenly give us something to show to customers that switched their buying philosophy from, ""Boy, that's interesting."" To, ""I must have it, when can I get my spot? Why don't I have a slot? Why can't you give me more slots?"" Which are really -- we want to help our customers, support them, but it's a challenge for us to be able to ramp up. So I think good opportunity for us at 28.

September quarter results, show KLA-Tencor, executing well in a difficult industry environment. Capitalizing on our market leadership and strong business model, to deliver solid operating performance and return significant cash to our shareholders. Revenue was $796 million in Q1, just above the midpoint of guidance, and non-GAAP net income per share was right at the midpoint of guidance of $1.17. 
We generated $219 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, paid our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, reflecting the increase in our dividend level announced in July, and repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock, ending the quarter with a healthy $2.1 billion in cash and securities. 
Looking at the September demand environment, persistent economic weakness, compounded the normal cyclical factors facing our industry. Leading customers to scale back or delay capacity expansion plans. Spending was concentrated among the market leaders, and focused primarily, on supporting technology development at the leading edge. New orders for KLA-Tencor in Q1 were $486 million, down 43% sequentially. 
This result was in line with our revised outlook we gave on September 8, and reflects the general demand climate I just outlined. Although overall order levels were low in Q1, as expected, the end market story is highlighted by relative strength from the foundries in the quarter. Foundry bookings were 57% in new orders in Q1, and we are expecting growth from the foundries to continue in Q2, with demand coming from selected market leaders, investing to ramp their 28-nanometer designs, to enable advanced technology development at the next nodes. Bookings from logic customers were 22% of the total in September quarter, and memory orders were low at 21% of the total. 
Setting aside the macroeconomic and cyclical factors currently impacting the industry, we look ahead to 2012, with a good deal of optimism, as the forces that propel KLA-Tencor's growth and market leadership remains solid. Though overall equipment demand is experiencing a cyclical pause, technology investment remains a priority for the market leaders, as they execute their competitive strategies at the leading edge. This technology focus is favorable for KLA-Tencor, as process controls plays a critical role in helping IC manufacturers address the increasingly more complex yield challenges associated with qualifying new technologies, and this is driving higher adoption in our core markets. 
Given KLA-Tencor's market leadership, strong new product acceptance, and industry-leading business model, we think the stage is set for the company to outperform in 2012. 
Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter. We exited Q1 with new orders picking up in the final days of the quarter. We expect this momentum will continue in Q2, highlighted by strength from the Tier 1 foundries and growing adoption of our latest generation Brightfield technology and leading-edge memory. 
December bookings are expected to be up 35%, plus or minus 10%, compared with September. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be between $600 million and $650 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.56 per share to $0.72 per share. With $1.1 billion in backlog as of September 30, and our anticipated order growth in Q2, we expect revenue growth to resume in the first quarter of calendar 2012. I will now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark?"

The distribution in new systems and services orders by product family in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection is 28%, compared with 42% last quarter; reticle inspection was 18%, up from 17% last quarter; metrology was 14%, down from 18% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 9%, up from 6% last quarter; and service was 31% of new orders in Q1, up from 17% last quarter. 
Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution in new orders by product and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: 57% of new systems orders in Q1 were from foundry customers, up from 43% in Q4; logic customers were 22% of new orders in Q1, versus 27% in Q4; and memory orders were 21% in Q1, down from 30% last quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q2 will be up by 35%, plus or minus 10% from Q1 new orders or a range of about $605 million to $705 million. In Q1, we shipped $690 million versus $892 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $650 million and $700 million in Q2. 
Total backlog at the end of Q1 decreased by $316 million from June 30, and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at September 30, 2011, included $275 million of revenue backlog, of products that have been shipped and invoiced, but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and about $780 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped. 
Total revenue for Q1 was $796 million, down 11% from $892 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q1 was down 13% to $650 million, and services revenue was $146 million, down about $3 million [indiscernible]. Our expectation for total revenue in Q2 is a range between $600 million and $650 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 58% in the September quarter, down from 60.7% in June. About half of the quarter-to-quarter decline in margin percentage, was attributable to higher excess inventory reserves and excess capacity, and a portion related to the lower revenue volume. For Q2, we are expecting gross margins between 57% and 58%. 
Operating expenses were $198 million in Q1, compared with $184 billion in Q4, which was benefited by a $10 million payment from expansion [ph] following their bankruptcy in 2009. Research and development expenses were $105 million in Q1, and selling, general and administrative expenses were $93 million. We expect operating expenses to be about $200 million to $205 million in Q2. 
OIE was a net $7 million expense in Q1, down about $3 million from Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q2. 
In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $59 million or 23% of pre-tax income versus a 26% rate in Q4. The Q1 tax expense percentage was lower than in Q4, in part due to a favorable resolution of a U.S. federal tax audit during Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $198 million or $1.17 per share in Q4, down from $1.50 last quarter. If we apply our modeled tax rate of 26%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings would've been $1.12 per share. At the revenue range I had previously mentioned, and using a tax rate of 26%, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.72 per share. 
Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were $169.8 million, versus $170.9 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $67 million repurchasing about $1.8 million shares, and as of September 30, 2011, we had approximately 7.3 million shares available, our current repurchase authorization. We also paid. $58 million in dividends during Q1. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in Q2. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of $169 million for Q2. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, up about $62 million from the end of June. Cash generated from operations was $219 million in Q1, compared with $290 million in Q4. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter with $62 million, down from $583 million at the end of June. DSOs were 53 days at September 30 versus 59 days at June. Both DSO figures, are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories increased by $37 million from June 30 and ended the quarter at $613 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.2 turns in Q1, versus 2.5 turns in Q4. Capital expenditures were $12 million in Q1, down $3 million from Q4. 
Total headcount at September 30, was 5,047, up from 5,492 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2. 
In summary, our guidance for Q2 is, new orders up between 25% and 45% from Q1, total revenue between $600 million and $650 million, and non-GAAP earnings between $0.56 and $0.72 per share, with a tax rate of 26%. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter, and we'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

So part of it is adoption of advanced technologies, part of it is share, and part of it, frankly, is there are more foundry players struggling with their yield issues at 28.

I think that LED, we have an interesting play there, because we're a leader in the inspection of the epi wafers. So we've got a good position, but it's relatively small. We saw some around 10% percent of our business was non-semi, and the September quarter and even the December that drops down to 7%-ish and it was 6% back in June. So we continue to be hopeful that those businesses will grow, but right now, there's still a reasonably small part of our overall business. And I think throughout 2012, on a relative basis, we hope to see some growth. But solar has got to recover first, and that's going to be a few quarters away at least."

I think there was a speed bump everybody hit, and it was interesting because they thought on 40 and 45. Actually, what happened really, is they jumped from 45 to 40, hit some integration problems and we suddenly watched as order levels with foundry shot up, as a result. Kind  of the same phenomena happening in 28. I would say it depends that there's a range of spectrum of yields on 28, depending on which fab line you're in and who's managing that. And I think, it's similar in terms of the challenge, and I think once again, caught many of our customers by surprise, because they thought they had it dialed and perhaps, what they saw in prototyping, they thought would extend the manufacturing, and that's not what's happening. So it's a good opportunity for us. The great part -- the biggest part of that though, is the new technologies that were brought to market, suddenly give us something to show to customers that switched their buying philosophy from, ""Boy, that's interesting."" To, ""I must have it, when can I get my spot? Why don't I have a slot? Why can't you give me more slots?"" Which are really -- we want to help our customers, support them, but it's a challenge for us to be able to ramp up. So I think good opportunity for us at 28. And I think the world just gets harder as you go down. And the challenge for us is to make sure we've got the technology to support the advance nodes, which in fact, to Mark's point, why we're going to keep investing."

I think there has been the area where frankly, we've had more challenges with lower-cost competitors, as in DRAM in particular. And part of that is -- I think the challenge that we have in DRAM is that you got redundancy, and so people can -- they don't need quite as pure a process to be able to survive. But that said, I think people are really dealing with the challenges. And lithography is one area where, because of multiple patterning, some of the challenges people face on just look of constraints, we have strong business in the metrology. And I'd say defect inspection, we've got some new product offerings that we think should position us well from a competitive standpoint. But we've got work to do to demonstrate the capability to be able to drive adoption up. And clearly, DRAM market in general is not a particularly, fast-growing market. So I think frankly, NAND has more promise in terms of getting a larger percent of the CapEx, as we go forward."
