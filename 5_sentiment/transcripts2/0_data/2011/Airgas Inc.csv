Our strong third quarter results serve to reinforce the message we have expressed for some time now, that Airgas shareholders are just beginning to reap significant benefits as the economy recove",1310,"Thanks, Jay. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Our strong third quarter results serve to reinforce the message we have expressed for some time now, that Airgas shareholders are just beginning to reap significant benefits as the economy recovers from a recession. We have proven year after year our ability to create real shareholder value and we think this quarter is another indication of a very bright future. Before reviewing our earnings results, I'd like to briefly address the Air Products unsolicited offer. On December 9, Air Products announced their revised tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Airgas at $70 per share, which is characterized as its best and final offer. On December 13, we announced that the nine independent directors of the Airgas board had unanimously selected Cr√©dit Suisse as the third independent financial adviser to the Airgas board. In evaluating the offer with its independent financial and legal advisors, the board considered the factors later described in our amended scheduled 14D-9, including improvements in the company's business, in the market performance of our business sector and in the operating and economic environment. On December 22, we announced that our board had unanimously rejected the Air Products offer as clearly inadequate and affirmed the view that the value of Airgas and its sale at this time is at least $78 per share. Each of the three independent financial advisers provided the board with an opinion that the price offered by Air Products was inadequate. To sum it up, that's 10 out of 10 directors and three out of three investment banks. There have been many important developments since the date of the initial Air Products public offer, including improvements in the U.S. economy, improved performance by our company and other companies in our industry and expansion in the market multiples of other companies in our industry. As we have described in our prior filings, these factors all support our view that the Air Products offer represents a small premium to what we believe would be our undisturbed trading range, certainly not enough to earn control of the largest packaged gas company in the world, with growth opportunities and a track record of performance like ours. We strongly recommend that Airgas stockholders not tender their shares to the Air Products' revised offer. 
Since Air Products commenced its tender offer, we've delivered excellent results and economic conditions have continued to improve. We have reduced our adjusted debt by $255 million since Air Products approached us with a $62 offer in December 2009 and we have delivered a tremendous increase in earnings. We are now in the early stages of economic recovery, with significant potential for sales growth in front of us. Our strategy through the downturn was to position Airgas to emerge from the recession as an even stronger company and our results demonstrate our success. Next week, the Delaware Chancery Court will hold a hearing related to the validity of Airgas' shareholders rights plan, an important element of our corporate governance structure that protects stockholders from an inadequate offer to acquire the company. We expect a ruling from the court on this matter at the end of this month or early next month. 
With that, I want to turn to the matter at hand today, our strong financial and operational performance this past quarter. Please turn to Slide 2. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the third quarter were up 23% from the prior year, a strong showing given the early stages of the economic recovery. Total sales in the quarter were $1 billion, driven by a robust same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 11%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%. We see long, good, steady, solid growth going forward for the U.S. economy. We are seeing improvement across the country, with robust results in our Great Lakes, Mid South and Southwest regions. Growth is now accelerating in our core business, on strength in our manufacturing, utilities and petrochemicals customer segments, as well as in repair and maintenance activities. In particular, our largest customers are rebounding well. Although we have yet to see meaningful recovery in energy and infrastructure construction, the outlook is improving and our Rental Welder business is poised to return to positive same-store sales growth in our fourth quarter. Our core distribution business continues to reflect the improving U.S. industrial conditions I just noted. Distribution segment same-store sales increased 9% over last year and daily sales were up 2% sequentially. Hardgoods growth continues to outpace gas and rent, consistent with the early stages of an economic recovery. Sales growth is translating into solid operating gains. Our adjusted operating margin of 12.2% is 110 basis points above last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $419 million of adjusted cash flow from operations, yielding $255 million of free cash flow. We reduced adjusted debt by $178 million this fiscal year to $1.6 billion at the end of December and are pleased to increase our dividend to $0.29 per share on the strength of our outstanding performance, cash flows and future prospects. Our acquisition activity has historically slowed during recessions and then accelerated during the recovery phase of the business cycle, as owners are more interested in selling their businesses during strong performance. We are indeed seeing our acquisition pipeline improve as the economy recovers. Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April, we have acquired seven businesses, with $20 million in annual revenues, including Connolly Gas, a supplier of the pure gases to the Specialty Gas industry. We anticipate a more robust acquisition environment in the coming quarters. 
Looking forward, in fourth quarter, we expect another sequential improvement in daily sales. While December exhibited a steady in light of the holidays, severe winter weather across the country has trended early results in January but now we're seeing a rebound. We believe that U.S. manufacturing will continue its recovery and will continue to outpace GDP as it has this year and many customers have indicated to us that they will be expanding their workforce in the first half of calendar 2011. 
Our updated fiscal 2011 adjusted earnings guidance of $3.28 to $3.32 per share represents a year-over-year increase of 22% to 24% over fiscal '10 and a 26% to 28% increase in underlying earnings before $0.10 of SAP costs. As I mentioned earlier, our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery and our results are a testament to the success of that strategy. 
As you can see on Slide 3, our revenues and earnings are resilient given the severity of the downturn and now, we are running very close to record earnings while our revenues have yet to recover to pre-recession levels. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive. I'm encouraged by the positive attitude of our associates, the broad-based recovery we are seeing and the improved levels of business spending, which has the potential to lead to many new projects for Airgas. There is a growing list of prospects for us in packaged, bulk and on-site gas customers. It matches nicely with the enhanced collaboration we have between our regional companies and our adjacent business units to bring the full benefit of the Airgas offering to our customers. The alignment of our sales and marketing efforts with customer segments has yielded results nationally and locally in both field and strategic account sales. And importantly, it is good to be working on an improving acquisition pipeline. We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position Airgas to drive significant shareholder value creation during the recovery. Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operations."

As Peter mentioned, our core business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is continuing to gather momentum in the economic recovery. This morning, I'll give you a few examples of business metrics that",987,"Thank you, Peter and good morning, everyone. As Peter mentioned, our core business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is continuing to gather momentum in the economic recovery. This morning, I'll give you a few examples of business metrics that illustrate this momentum. Then we'll review our operating results and I'll finish with a brief update on our SAP implementation. As in the second quarter, equipment sales growth in the third quarter outpaced growth in total hardgoods sales, both sequentially and year-over-year. Equipment, which consists primarily of welding and cutting machines, represents a capital purchase for our customers and equipment sales tend to rise as customers recapitalize for future production. Filler metals volume growth accelerated in the third quarter, a sign of increasing production activity in our core manufacturing customer base. 
One of our key metrics in our gas business relates to the number of cylinders in our customers' possession, referred to as utilized cylinders. The number of utilized cylinders increased slightly on a sequential basis for the second consecutive quarter, an indication that increased working stocks of cylinders are needed to support growing customer demand. Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on segment alignment, also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts Program, with the strategy originated and was already underway in the Medical and Construction segments. For the third quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 9% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and increased activity in our existing metal fabrication, materials and conglomerates and petrochemical customer bases. Strategic Accounts present tremendous cross-selling opportunities, both in terms of product lines and locations and now represents more than 20% of sales. 
Turning to Slide 4, sales of our strategic products, which combine to make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 6% for the quarter. Years ago, we identified these products as strategic given their long-term growth profiles, driven by favorable end market exposure, application development, regulatory climate and cross sell opportunities. They also tend to be noncyclical, which explains why the overall growth in Strategic Products this quarter was below our total same-store sales rate as our core products are accelerating at this stage of the economic recovery. Safety Products sales, which still represent a strong cross sell opportunity for us as our customers realize good value in vendor consolidation, grew 8% year-over-year in the quarter, reflecting the improving manufacturing environment. On a sequential basis, daily sales of safety products declined by 1%, reflecting inventory stocking by resale customers in our second quarter. Bulk gas sales were up 10% compared to prior year as bulk sales to industrial manufacturing, petrochemical and oil wells serviced customers continue to recover. The slight sequential decline in bulk sales reflects the impacts of the holidays and bulk deliveries. Medical sales, which were resilient throughout the downturn, were up 3% compared to prior year. Specialty gas sales increased 6% year-over-year. The growing demand for core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of our market position and EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures, as well as improving conditions in petrochemical markets, offset by the impact of spot sales of certain rare gases in the second quarter. Year-over-year growth in our CO2 and dry ice business, driven by higher volumes and new customer wins, was hampered by the loss of a major food processing customer emerging from bankruptcy. Our Radnor private label products were up 15% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products. Our operating efficiency programs, which focus on cylinder maintenance and testing, distribution of field plant logistics, freight and fuel management, are progressing according to schedule. At our December 2009 analyst meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings. Over the next four years, driven largely by logistics, plant studies and similar testings. We are on track to deliver the $10 million of those savings that are included in our fiscal 2011 guidance. I'd like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. The commencement of our planned phase rollout whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in three key areas. Accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these three areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis. And we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses. This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform and we are excited about its game changing implications. We are on track for our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, to go live on SAP on April 1, 2011. As I highlighted for you in our last earnings call, we expect full implementation at nearly all of our regional distribution companies, with the majority of the benefits are expected to be realized to occur by summer 2012, with implementation reaching all remaining business units by December 31, 2012. Based on our experience to date, we're confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits detailed in our August 31 announcement will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in aggregate annual run rate benefits in operating income, with the likelihood that these benefits will reach or exceed $125 million in the aggregate. Now, Bob will give our financial review of the quarter."

As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 13 through 18. Sales",1517,"Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 13 through 18. Sales increased to $1.03 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of a 7% increase in gas and rent and an 11% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 6% and price was up 3%. Sequentially, daily sales increased by 1%. Daily sales for both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially, with hardgoods slightly outpacing gas and rent. Consistent with the year-to-date results, gas and rent represented approximately 64% of our sales mix. The gas and rent mix was slightly higher last year at 65%. Gross margin was 55.7%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, gross margin expended by 60 basis points, primarily driven by a favorable mix within gases. Excluding a pretax charge of approximately $18 million related to the Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $126 million, up 20% from last year. Our performance is impressive, particularly in light of the significant year-over-year headwinds from increased variable compensation expense and incremental SAP costs. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.2%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by operating leverage on sales growth, which more than overcame the expense headwinds I just mentioned. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 in the third quarter were at the top of our guided range and excluded $0.13 related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and a one-time interest penalty of $0.02 related to the late removal of a restrictive legend on our 7 1/8% senior subordinated notes. In issuing those notes, we utilized a newly available technology that had since gone obsolete, wherein it was incumbent upon Airgas to remove the restrictive legend from the notes at the end of the restricted transfer period. Failure to do so required the payment of an interest penalty to bondholders, which we promptly paid when we identified the oversight in this quarter. There were approximately 86 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Return on capital, which is a trailing four quarters calculation, was 11.3%, an improvement of 110 basis points over last year and 40 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income as the recovery continues and our business benefits from the significant capital investments we have made in the past few years, including new air separation plants, build plant upgrades and SAP. 
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates and DSO for the quarter improved slightly year-over-year and were relatively consistent with the second quarter. Inventory turns held consistent with recent trends, reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels during the significant uptick in hardgoods sales. Year-to-date, we generated strong free cash flow of $255 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $419 million, and reflecting the increase in working capital associated with higher sales compared to the prior year. On the strength of our earnings, continued strong cash flow and the outlook for the future, we increased our fourth quarter dividend by 16% to $0.29 per share. We have reduced our adjusted debt by $178 million fiscal year-to-date to $1.6 billion at December 31. Over the past 12 months, we have reduced adjusted debt by more than $255 million. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was 54% fixed and our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2%, at the low end of our revised target range of 2% to 3%. 
Now, turning to Slide 6, we look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 10% versus the prior year to $937 million, with same-store sales up 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up, 11% with pricing up 3%, driven by our price increase last spring. On a sequential basis, daily sales in the Distribution segment increased by 2%, reflecting improvements in both hardgoods and gas and rent sales. Distribution gross margin was 56.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points in the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 60 basis points from the second quarter. As in the second quarter, gas and rent represented close to 60% of distribution sales in the third quarter. Adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment increased 21% year-over-year to $114 million and adjusted operating margin improved 120 basis points to 12.2%, reflecting the same factors noted in my comments on consolidated results. All Other Operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, Refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 10% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher ammonia volumes as 2010 was the first year that many large utilities were required by law to run their NOx abatement systems year round, instead of only during the summer months. Sequentially, daily sales in the All Other Operations segment declined 13%, driven by the effective seasonality in our Refrigerants, CO2 and dry ice businesses from our second quarter to our third quarter. Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 130 basis points from the prior year, and 80 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by higher costs in the ammonia business relative to pricing. Adjusted operating income for All Other Operations was $12 million and adjusted operating margin of 11.1% was flat year-over-year as operating leverage on sales growth in our Refrigerants and CO2 business more than offset the impact of the slight gross margin compression in our ammonia business. Sequentially, the decline in adjusted operating margin is primarily attributable to the effective seasonality on our sales in our refrigerants, CO2 and dry ice businesses. 
Slide 7 presents the quarterly trend of key metrics. This quarter represented the third consecutive quarter of strong positive same-store sales growth and sales per day continued to show sequential improvement. We preserved our EBITDA margins in a difficult economy and posted very strong EBITDA margins in this year's first quarter as we emerged from the recession. The trend continued in our third quarter, which reflected the highest EBITDA margin in Airgas history achieved on a revenue base that is still well below pre-recession levels. And a strong stable free cash flow continues to be one of the defining characteristics of the Airgas business model. 
Please turn to Slide 8, capital expenditures. We have continued to be disciplined in our capital spending this year, as reflected in the 90 basis point year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as a percent of sales to 5.7%. Cylinders and bulk tanks are the only asset category with year-over-year growth in spending as improving gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue-generating assets. 
Slide 9 presents our fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and updated full-year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.82 to $0.86, an increase of 19% to 25% over the prior year. Excluding the estimate of $0.04 of incremental SAP cost, our guidance represents a 25% to 30% improvement over the prior year. For the full year, we are updating our adjusted earnings per share expectations to be in the range of $3.28 to $3.32, up 22% to 24% over adjusted EPS for fiscal 2010, which includes the significant year-over-year impact of increased variable compensation expense and SAP costs. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high single digits for the full fiscal year and operating margin is expected to be in the 12% to 12.5% range. Our guidance excludes debt extinguishment charges, multiemployer pension withdrawal charges, cost and charges related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and the one-time interest penalty. 
Slide 10 presents a walk through the primary elements of our fourth quarter guidance, using third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.80 as a starting point. In the fourth quarter, the addition of two selling days and the loss of a negative third quarter impact of the holidays should provide $0.05 to $0.06 of benefit to EPS. Seasonality in our CO2, dry ice and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a headwind and preparation for the implementation of SAP at our first regional distribution company on April 1 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03 relative to the third quarter. We expect our core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.02 to $0.04 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and solid execution of our operating efficiency programs. The resulting updated full-year guidance of $3.28 to $3.32 represents year-over-year growth of 22% to 24%. And now, I'll turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session."

The adjacencies that we do have continued to improve operationally and the cooperation between the adjacencies and our regional companies is better than it's ever been. And we continue to look for opportunistic situations overseas. But I wouldn't say our priorities have changed, but we're best positioned I would say to acquire companies in the U.S. and we really like what we're seeing in the U.S. economy, and especially with the research and submanufacturing and new plants going in."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Our strong third quarter results serve to reinforce the message we have expressed for some time now, that Airgas shareholders are just beginning to reap significant benefits as the economy recovers from a recession. We have proven year after year our ability to create real shareholder value, and we think this quarter is another indication of a very bright future. Before reviewing our earnings results, I'd like to briefly address the Air Products unsolicited offer. On December 9, Air Products announced a revised tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Airgas at $70 per share, which it characterized as its best and final offer. On December 13, we announced that the nine independent directors of the Airgas board had unanimously selected Cr√©dit Suisse as the third independent financial adviser to the Airgas board. In evaluating the offer with its independent financial and legal advisers, the board considered the factors later described in our amended scheduled 14D-9, including improvements in the company's business, in the market performance of our business sector and in the operating and economic environment. On December 22, we announced that our board had unanimously rejected the Air Products' offer as clearly inadequate and affirmed the view that the value of Airgas and its sale at this time is at least $78 per share. Each of the three independent financial advisers provided the board with an opinion that the price offered by Air Products was inadequate. To sum it up, that's 10 out of 10 directors and three out of three investment banks. There have been many important developments since the date of the initial Air Products public offer, including improvements in the U.S. economy, improved performance by our company and other companies in our industry and expansion in the market multiples of other companies in our industry. As we have described in our prior filings, these factors all support our view that the Air Products' offer represents a small premium to what we believe would be our undisturbed trading range, certainly not enough to earn control of the largest packaged gas company in the world, with growth opportunities and a track record of performance like ours. We strongly recommend that Airgas stockholders not tender their shares into the Air Products' revised offer. 
Since Air Products commenced its tender offer, we have delivered excellent results and economic conditions have continued to improve. We have reduced our adjusted debt by $255 million since Air Products approached us with a $62 offer in December 2009, and we have delivered a tremendous increase in earnings. We are now in the early stages of economic recovery, with significant potential for sales growth in front of us. Our strategy through the downturn was to position Airgas to emerge from the recession as an even stronger company and our results demonstrate our success. Next week, the Delaware Chancery Court will hold a hearing related to the validity of Airgas' shareholders rights plan, an important element of our corporate governance structure that protects stockholders from an inadequate offer to acquire the company. We expect a ruling from the court on this matter at the end of this month or early next month. 
With that, I want to turn to the matter at hand today, our strong financial and operational performance this past quarter. Please turn to Slide 2. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the third quarter were up 23% from the prior year, a strong showing given the early stages of the economic recovery. Total sales in the quarter were $1 billion, driven by a robust same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 11%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%. We see long, good, steady, solid growth going forward for the U.S. economy. We are seeing improvement across the country, with robust results in our Great Lakes, Mid South and Southwest regions. Growth is now accelerating in our core business, on strength in our Manufacturing, Utilities and Petrochemical Customer segments, as well as in repair and maintenance activities. In particular, our largest customers are rebounding well. Although we have yet to see meaningful recovery in energy and infrastructure construction, the outlook is improving and our Rental Welder business is poised to return to positive same-store sales growth in our fourth quarter. Our core Distribution business continues to reflect the improving U.S. industrial conditions I just noted. Distribution segment same-store sales increased 9% over last year and daily sales were up 2% sequentially. Hardgoods growth continues to outpace gas and rent, consistent with the early stages of an economic recovery. Sales growth is translating into solid operating gains. Our adjusted operating margin of 12.2% is 110 basis points above last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $419 million of adjusted cash flow from operations, yielding $255 million of free cash flow. We reduced adjusted debt by $178 million this fiscal year to $1.6 billion at the end of December, and are pleased to increase our dividend to $0.29 per share on the strength of our outstanding performance, cash flows and future prospects. Our acquisition activity has historically slowed during recessions and then accelerated during the recovery phase of the business cycle, as owners are more interested in selling their businesses during strong performance. We are indeed seeing our acquisition pipeline improve as the economy recovers. Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April, we have acquired seven businesses with $20 million in annual revenues, including Conley Gas, a supplier of the pure gases to the specialty gas industry. We anticipate a more robust acquisition environment in the coming quarters. 
Looking forward, in fourth quarter, we expect another sequential improvement in daily sales. While December exhibited a steady finish in light of the holidays, severe winter weather across the country has trimmed early results in January, but now we're seeing a rebound. We believe that U.S. manufacturing will continue its recovery and will continue to outpace GDP as it has this year, and many customers have indicated to us that they will be expanding their workforce in the first half of calendar 2011. 
Our updated fiscal 2011 adjusted earnings guidance of $3.28 to $3.32 per share represents a year-over-year increase of 22% to 24% over fiscal '10 and a 26% to 28% increase in underlying earnings before $0.10 of SAP costs. As I mentioned earlier, our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery and our results are a testament to the success of that strategy. 
As you can see on Slide 3, our revenues and earnings were resilient, given the severity of the downturn. And now we are running very close to record earnings while our revenues have yet to recover to pre-recession levels. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive. I'm encouraged by the positive attitude of our associates, the broad-based recovery we are seeing and the improved levels of business spending, which has the potential to lead to many new projects for Airgas. There is a growing list of prospects for us in packaged, bulk and on-site gas customers. It matches nicely with the enhanced collaboration we have between our regional companies and our adjacent business units to bring the full benefit of the Airgas offering to our customers. The alignment of our sales and marketing efforts with customer segments has yielded results nationally and locally in both field and strategic account sales. And importantly, it is good to be working on an improving acquisition pipeline. We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position Airgas to drive significant shareholder value creation during the recovery. Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operations."

As Peter mentioned, our core business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is continuing to gather momentum in the economic recovery. This morning, I'll give you a few examples of business metrics that",983,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. As Peter mentioned, our core business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is continuing to gather momentum in the economic recovery. This morning, I'll give you a few examples of business metrics that illustrate this momentum. Then we'll review our operating results, and I'll finish with a brief update on our SAP implementation. As in the second quarter, equipment sales growth in the third quarter outpaced growth in total hardgoods sales, both sequentially and year-over-year. Equipment, which consists primarily of welding and cutting machines, represent the capital purchase for our customers and equipment sales tend to rise as customers recapitalize for future production. Filler metals volume growth accelerated in the third quarter, a sign of increasing production activity in our core manufacturing customer base. 
One of our key metrics in our gas business relates to the number of cylinders in our customers' possession, referred to as utilized cylinders. The number of utilized cylinders increased slightly on a sequential basis for the second consecutive quarter, an indication that increased working stocks of cylinders are needed to support growing customer demand. Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on segment alignment, also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts Program, where this strategy originated, and was already underway in the Medical and Construction segments. For the third quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 9% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and increased activity in our existing Metal Fabrication, Materials and Conglomerates and Petrochemical Customer bases. Strategic Accounts present tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines and locations, and now represent more than 20% of sales. 
Turning to Slide 4, sales of our strategic products, which combine to make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 6% for the quarter. Years ago, we identified these products as strategic given their long-term growth profiles, driven by favorable end market exposure, application development, regulatory climate and cross-sell opportunities. They also tend to be non-cyclical, which explains why the overall growth in Strategic Products this quarter was below our total same-store sales rate, as our core products are accelerating at this stage of the economic recovery. Safety Products sales, which still represent a strong cross-sell opportunity for us as our customers realize good value in vendor consolidation, grew 8% year-over-year in the quarter, reflecting the improving manufacturing environment. On a sequential basis, daily sales of Safety Products declined by 1%, reflecting inventory stocking by resale customers in our second quarter. Bulk gas sales were up 10% compared to prior year, as bulk sales to industrial manufacturing, petrochemical and oil well-serviced customers continue to recover. The slight sequential decline in bulk sales reflects the impacts of the holidays and bulk deliveries. Medical sales, which were resilient throughout the downturn, were up 3% compared to prior year. Specialty gas sales increased 6% year-over-year. The growing demand for core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of our market position and EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures, as well as improving conditions in petrochemical markets, offset by the impact of spot sales of certain rare gases in the second quarter. Year-over-year growth in our CO2 and dry ice business, driven by higher volumes and new customer wins, was hampered by the loss of a major food processing customer emerging from bankruptcy. Our Radnor private label products were up 15% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products. Our operating efficiency programs, which focus on cylinder maintenance and testing, distribution of field plant logistics, freight and fuel management, are progressing according to schedule. At our December 2009 analyst meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by logistics, plant studies and cylinder testings. We are on track to deliver the $10 million of those savings that are included in our fiscal 2011 guidance. I'd like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in three key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these three areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis. And we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses. This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform, and we are excited about its game-changing implications. We are on track for our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, to go live on SAP on April 1, 2011. As I highlighted for you in our last earnings call, we expect full implementation at nearly all of our regional distribution companies, with the majority of the benefits are expected to be realized to occur by summer 2012, with implementation reaching all remaining business units by December 31, 2012. Based on our experience to date, we're confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits detailed in our August 31 announcement will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in aggregate annual run rate benefits in operating income, with the likelihood that these benefits will reach or exceed $125 million in the aggregate. Now, Bob will give our financial review of the quarter."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 13 through 18. Sale",1518,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 13 through 18. Sales increased to $1.03 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of a 7% increase in gas and rent and an 11% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 6% and price was up 3%. Sequentially, daily sales increased by 1%. Daily sales for both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially, with hardgoods slightly outpacing gas and rent. Consistent with the year-to-date results, gas and rent represented approximately 64% of our sales mix. The gas and rent mix was slightly higher last year at 65%. Gross margin was 55.7%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower-margin hardgoods. Sequentially, gross margin expended by 60 basis points, primarily driven by a favorable mix within gases. Excluding a pretax charge of approximately $18 million related to the Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $126 million, up 20% from last year. Our performance is impressive, particularly in light of the significant year-over-year headwinds from increased variable compensation expense and incremental SAP costs. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.2%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by operating leverage on sales growth, which more than overcame the expense headwinds I just mentioned. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 in the third quarter were at the top of our guided range, and excluded $0.13 related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and a one-time interest penalty of $0.02 related to the late removal of a restrictive legend on our 7 1/8% senior subordinated notes. In issuing those notes, we utilized a newly available technology that had since gone obsolete, wherein it was incumbent upon Airgas to remove the restrictive legend from the notes at the end of the restricted transfer period. Failure to do so required the payment of an interest penalty to bondholders, which we promptly paid when we identified the oversight in this quarter. There were approximately 86 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Return on capital, which is a trailing four quarters calculation, was 11.3%, an improvement of 110 basis points over last year and 40 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income, as the recovery continues and our business benefits from the significant capital investments we have made in the past few years, including new air separation plants, Bill Plant upgrades and SAP. 
 
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates and DSO for the quarter improved slightly year-over-year and were relatively consistent with the second quarter. Inventory turns held consistent with recent trends, reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels during the significant uptick in hardgoods sales. Year-to-date, we generated strong free cash flow of $255 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $419 million, and reflecting the increase in working capital associated with higher sales compared to the prior year. On the strength of our earnings, continued strong cash flow and the outlook for the future, we increased our fourth quarter dividend by 16% to $0.29 per share. We have reduced our adjusted debt by $178 million fiscal year-to-date to $1.6 billion at December 31. Over the past 12 months, we have reduced adjusted debt by more than $255 million. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was 54% fixed and our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2%, at the low end of our revised target range of 2% to 3%. 
Now turning to Slide 6, we'll look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 10% versus the prior year to $937 million, with same-store sales up 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up, 11%, with pricing up 3%, driven by our price increase last spring. On a sequential basis, daily sales in the Distribution segment increased by 2%, reflecting improvements in both hardgoods and gas and rent sales. Distribution gross margin was 56.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points in the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower-margin hardgoods. Sequentially, Distribution gross margin increased by 60 basis points from the second quarter. As in the second quarter, gas and rent represented close to 60% of Distribution sales in the third quarter. Adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment increased 21% year-over-year to $114 million, and adjusted operating margin improved 120 basis points to 12.2%, reflecting the same factors noted in my comments on consolidated results. All Other Operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 10% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher Ammonia volumes, as 2010 was the first year that many large utilities were required by law to run their nitrogen oxide abatement systems year-round, instead of only during the summer months. Sequentially, daily sales in the All Other Operations segment declined 13%, driven by the effect of seasonality in our Refrigerants, CO2 and Dry Ice businesses from our second quarter to our third quarter. Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 130 basis points from the prior year, and 80 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by higher costs in the Ammonia business relative to pricing. Adjusted operating income for All Other Operations was $12 million and adjusted operating margin of 11.1% was flat year-over-year, as operating leverage on sales growth in our Refrigerants and CO2 business more than offset the impact of the slight gross margin compression in our Ammonia business. Sequentially, the decline in adjusted operating margin is primarily attributable to the effect of seasonality on our sales in our Refrigerants, CO2 and Dry Ice businesses. 
Slide 7 presents a quarterly trend of key metrics. This quarter represented the third consecutive quarter of strong positive same-store sales growth and sales per day continued to show sequential improvement. We preserved our EBITDA margins in a difficult economy and posted very strong EBITDA margins in this year's first quarter as we emerged from the recession. The trend continued in our third quarter, which reflected the highest EBITDA margin in Airgas history achieved on a revenue base that is still well below pre-recession levels. And a strong stable free cash flow continues to be one of the defining characteristics of the Airgas business model. 
Please turn to Slide 8, capital expenditures. We have continued to be disciplined in our capital spending this year, as reflected in the 90 basis point year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as a percent of sales to 5.7%. Cylinders and bulk tanks are the only asset category with year-over-year growth in spending, as improving gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue-generating assets. 
Slide 9 presents our fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and updated full year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single-digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.82 to $0.86, an increase of 19% to 25% over the prior year. Excluding the estimate of $0.04 of incremental SAP cost, our guidance represents a 25% to 30% improvement over the prior year. For the full year, we are updating our adjusted earnings per share expectations to be in the range of $3.28 to $3.32, up 22% to 24% over adjusted EPS for fiscal 2010, which includes the significant year-over-year impact of increased variable compensation expense and SAP costs. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high single-digits for the full fiscal year and operating margin is expected to be in the 12% to 12.5% range. Our guidance excludes debt extinguishment charges, multi-employer pension withdrawal charges, cost and charges related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and the one-time interest penalty. 
Slide 10 presents a walk through the primary elements of our fourth quarter guidance, using third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.80 as a starting point. In the fourth quarter, the addition of two selling days and the loss of the negative third quarter impact of the holidays should provide $0.05 to $0.06 of benefit to EPS. Seasonality in our CO2, Dry Ice and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a headwind. And preparation for the implementation of SAP at our first regional distribution company on April 1 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03 relative to the third quarter. We expect our core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.02 to $0.04 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and solid execution of our operating efficiency programs. The resulting updated of full year guidance of $3.28 to $3.32 represents year-over-year growth of 22% to 24%. And now I'll turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Our strong third quarter results serve to reinforce the message we have expressed for some time now, that Airgas shareholders are just beginning to reap significant benefits as the economy recovers from a recession. We have proven year after year our ability to create real shareholder value, and we think this quarter is another indication of a very bright future. Before reviewing our earnings results, I'd like to briefly address the Air Products unsolicited offer. On December 9, Air Products announced a revised tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Airgas at $70 per share, which it characterized as its best and final offer. On December 13, we announced that the nine independent directors of the Airgas board had unanimously selected Cr√©dit Suisse as the third independent financial adviser to the Airgas board. In evaluating the offer with its independent financial and legal advisers, the board considered the factors later described in our amended scheduled 14D-9, including improvements in the company's business, in the market performance of our business sector and in the operating and economic environment. On December 22, we announced that our board had unanimously rejected the Air Products' offer as clearly inadequate and affirmed the view that the value of Airgas and its sale at this time is at least $78 per share. Each of the three independent financial advisers provided the board with an opinion that the price offered by Air Products was inadequate. To sum it up, that's 10 out of 10 directors and three out of three investment banks. There have been many important developments since the date of the initial Air Products public offer, including improvements in the U.S. economy, improved performance by our company and other companies in our industry and expansion in the market multiples of other companies in our industry. As we have described in our prior filings, these factors all support our view that the Air Products' offer represents a small premium to what we believe would be our undisturbed trading range, certainly not enough to earn control of the largest packaged gas company in the world, with growth opportunities and a track record of performance like ours. We strongly recommend that Airgas stockholders not tender their shares into the Air Products' revised offer. 
Since Air Products commenced its tender offer, we have delivered excellent results and economic conditions have continued to improve. We have reduced our adjusted debt by $255 million since Air Products approached us with a $62 offer in December 2009, and we have delivered a tremendous increase in earnings. We are now in the early stages of economic recovery, with significant potential for sales growth in front of us. Our strategy through the downturn was to position Airgas to emerge from the recession as an even stronger company and our results demonstrate our success. Next week, the Delaware Chancery Court will hold a hearing related to the validity of Airgas' shareholders rights plan, an important element of our corporate governance structure that protects stockholders from an inadequate offer to acquire the company. We expect a ruling from the court on this matter at the end of this month or early next month. 
With that, I want to turn to the matter at hand today, our strong financial and operational performance this past quarter. Please turn to Slide 2. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the third quarter were up 23% from the prior year, a strong showing given the early stages of the economic recovery. Total sales in the quarter were $1 billion, driven by a robust same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 11%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%. We see long, good, steady, solid growth going forward for the U.S. economy. We are seeing improvement across the country, with robust results in our Great Lakes, Mid South and Southwest regions. Growth is now accelerating in our core business, on strength in our Manufacturing, Utilities and Petrochemical Customer segments, as well as in repair and maintenance activities. In particular, our largest customers are rebounding well. Although we have yet to see meaningful recovery in energy and infrastructure construction, the outlook is improving and our Rental Welder business is poised to return to positive same-store sales growth in our fourth quarter. Our core Distribution business continues to reflect the improving U.S. industrial conditions I just noted. Distribution segment same-store sales increased 9% over last year and daily sales were up 2% sequentially. Hardgoods growth continues to outpace gas and rent, consistent with the early stages of an economic recovery. Sales growth is translating into solid operating gains. Our adjusted operating margin of 12.2% is 110 basis points above last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $419 million of adjusted cash flow from operations, yielding $255 million of free cash flow. We reduced adjusted debt by $178 million this fiscal year to $1.6 billion at the end of December, and are pleased to increase our dividend to $0.29 per share on the strength of our outstanding performance, cash flows and future prospects. Our acquisition activity has historically slowed during recessions and then accelerated during the recovery phase of the business cycle, as owners are more interested in selling their businesses during strong performance. We are indeed seeing our acquisition pipeline improve as the economy recovers. Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April, we have acquired seven businesses with $20 million in annual revenues, including Conley Gas, a supplier of the pure gases to the specialty gas industry. We anticipate a more robust acquisition environment in the coming quarters. 
Looking forward, in fourth quarter, we expect another sequential improvement in daily sales. While December exhibited a steady finish in light of the holidays, severe winter weather across the country has trimmed early results in January, but now we're seeing a rebound. We believe that U.S. manufacturing will continue its recovery and will continue to outpace GDP as it has this year, and many customers have indicated to us that they will be expanding their workforce in the first half of calendar 2011. 
Our updated fiscal 2011 adjusted earnings guidance of $3.28 to $3.32 per share represents a year-over-year increase of 22% to 24% over fiscal '10 and a 26% to 28% increase in underlying earnings before $0.10 of SAP costs. As I mentioned earlier, our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery and our results are a testament to the success of that strategy. 
As you can see in Slide 3, our revenues and earnings were resilient, given the severity of the downturn. And now we are running very close to record earnings while our revenues have yet to recover to pre-recession levels. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive. I'm encouraged by the positive attitude of our associates, the broad-based recovery we are seeing and the improved levels of business spending, which has the potential to lead to many new projects for Airgas. There is a growing list of prospects for us in packaged, bulk and on-site gas customers. It matches nicely with the enhanced collaboration we have between our regional companies and our adjacent business units to bring the full benefit of the Airgas offering to our customers. The alignment of our sales and marketing efforts with customer segments has yielded results nationally and locally in both field and strategic account sales. And importantly, it is good to be working on an improving acquisition pipeline. We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position Airgas to drive significant shareholder value creation during the recovery. Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operations."

As Peter mentioned, our core business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is continuing to gather momentum in the economic recovery. This morning, I'll give you a few examples of business metrics that illustrate this momentum. Then we'll review our operating results, and I'll finish with a brief update on our SAP implementation. As in the second quarter, equipment sales growth in the third quarter outpaced growth in total hardgoods sales, both sequentially and year-over-year. Equipment, which consists primarily of welding and cutting machines, represent the capital purchase for our customers and equipment sales tend to rise as customers recapitalize for future production. Filler metals volume growth accelerated in the third quarter, a sign of increasing production activity in our core manufacturing customer base. 
One of our key metrics in our gas business relates to the number of cylinders in our customers' possession, referred to as utilized cylinders. The number of utilized cylinders increased slightly on a sequential basis for the second consecutive quarter, an indication that increased working stocks of cylinders are needed to support growing customer demand. Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on segment alignment, also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts Program, where this strategy originated, and was already underway in the Medical and Construction segments. For the third quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 9% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and increased activity in our existing Metal Fabrication, Materials and Conglomerates and Petrochemical Customer bases. Strategic Accounts present tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines and locations, and now represent more than 20% of sales. 
Turning to Slide 4, sales of our strategic products, which combine to make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 6% for the quarter. Years ago, we identified these products as strategic given their long-term growth profiles, driven by favorable end market exposure, application development, regulatory climate and cross-sell opportunities. They also tend to be non-cyclical, which explains why the overall growth in Strategic Products this quarter was below our total same-store sales rate, as our core products are accelerating at this stage of the economic recovery. Safety Products sales, which still represent a strong cross-sell opportunity for us as our customers realize good value in vendor consolidation, grew 8% year-over-year in the quarter, reflecting the improving manufacturing environment. On a sequential basis, daily sales of Safety Products declined by 1%, reflecting inventory stocking by resale customers in our second quarter. Bulk gas sales were up 10% compared to prior year, as bulk sales to industrial manufacturing, petrochemical and oil well-serviced customers continue to recover. The slight sequential decline in bulk sales reflects the impacts of the holidays and bulk deliveries. Medical sales, which were resilient throughout the downturn, were up 3% compared to prior year. Specialty gas sales increased 6% year-over-year. The growing demand for core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of our market position and EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures, as well as improving conditions in petrochemical markets, offset by the impact of spot sales of certain rare gases in the second quarter. Year-over-year growth in our CO2 and dry ice business, driven by higher volumes and new customer wins, was hampered by the loss of a major food processing customer emerging from bankruptcy. Our Radnor private label products were up 15% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products. Our operating efficiency programs, which focus on cylinder maintenance and testing, distribution of field plant logistics, freight and fuel management, are progressing according to schedule. At our December 2009 analyst meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by logistics, plant studies and cylinder testings. We are on track to deliver the $10 million of those savings that are included in our fiscal 2011 guidance. I'd like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in three key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these three areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis. And we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses. This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform, and we are excited about its game-changing implications. We are on track for our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, to go live on SAP on April 1, 2011. As I highlighted for you in our last earnings call, we expect full implementation at nearly all of our regional distribution companies, with the majority of the benefits are expected to be realized to occur by summer 2012, with implementation reaching all remaining business units by December 31, 2012. Based on our experience to date, we're confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits detailed in our August 31 announcement will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in aggregate annual run rate benefits in operating income, with the likelihood that these benefits will reach or exceed $125 million in the aggregate. Now, Bob will give our financial review of the quarter."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 13 through 18. Sales increased to $1.03 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of a 7% increase in gas and rent and an 11% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 6% and price was up 3%. Sequentially, daily sales increased by 1%. Daily sales for both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially, with hardgoods slightly outpacing gas and rent. Consistent with the year-to-date results, gas and rent represented approximately 64% of our sales mix. The gas and rent mix was slightly higher last year at 65%. Gross margin was 55.7%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower-margin hardgoods. Sequentially, gross margin expended by 60 basis points, primarily driven by a favorable mix within gases. Excluding a pretax charge of approximately $18 million related to the Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $126 million, up 20% from last year. Our performance is impressive, particularly in light of the significant year-over-year headwinds from increased variable compensation expense and incremental SAP costs. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.2%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by operating leverage on sales growth, which more than overcame the expense headwinds I just mentioned. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 in the third quarter were at the top of our guided range, and excluded $0.13 related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and a one-time interest penalty of $0.02 related to the late removal of a restrictive legend on our 7 1/8% senior subordinated notes. In issuing those notes, we utilized a newly available technology that had since gone obsolete, wherein it was incumbent upon Airgas to remove the restrictive legend from the notes at the end of the restricted transfer period. Failure to do so required the payment of an interest penalty to bondholders, which we promptly paid when we identified the oversight in this quarter. There were approximately 86 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Return on capital, which is a trailing four quarters calculation, was 11.3%, an improvement of 110 basis points over last year and 40 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income, as the recovery continues and our business benefits from the significant capital investments we have made in the past few years, including new air separation plants, Bill Plant upgrades and SAP. 
 
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates and DSO for the quarter improved slightly year-over-year and were relatively consistent with the second quarter. Inventory turns held consistent with recent trends, reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels during the significant uptick in hardgoods sales. Year-to-date, we generated strong free cash flow of $255 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $419 million, and reflecting the increase in working capital associated with higher sales compared to the prior year. On the strength of our earnings, continued strong cash flow and the outlook for the future, we increased our fourth quarter dividend by 16% to $0.29 per share. We have reduced our adjusted debt by $178 million fiscal year-to-date to $1.6 billion at December 31. Over the past 12 months, we have reduced adjusted debt by more than $255 million. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was 54% fixed and our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2%, at the low end of our revised target range of 2% to 3%. 
Now turning to Slide 6, we'll look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 10% versus the prior year to $937 million, with same-store sales up 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up, 11%, with pricing up 3%, driven by our price increase last spring. On a sequential basis, daily sales in the Distribution segment increased by 2%, reflecting improvements in both hardgoods and gas and rent sales. Distribution gross margin was 56.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points in the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower-margin hardgoods. Sequentially, Distribution gross margin increased by 60 basis points from the second quarter. As in the second quarter, gas and rent represented close to 60% of Distribution sales in the third quarter. Adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment increased 21% year-over-year to $114 million, and adjusted operating margin improved 120 basis points to 12.2%, reflecting the same factors noted in my comments on consolidated results. All Other Operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 10% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher Ammonia volumes, as 2010 was the first year that many large utilities were required by law to run their nitrogen oxide abatement systems year-round, instead of only during the summer months. Sequentially, daily sales in the All Other Operations segment declined 13%, driven by the effect of seasonality in our Refrigerants, CO2 and Dry Ice businesses from our second quarter to our third quarter. Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 130 basis points from the prior year, and 80 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by higher costs in the Ammonia business relative to pricing. Adjusted operating income for All Other Operations was $12 million and adjusted operating margin of 11.1% was flat year-over-year, as operating leverage on sales growth in our Refrigerants and CO2 business more than offset the impact of the slight gross margin compression in our Ammonia business. Sequentially, the decline in adjusted operating margin is primarily attributable to the effect of seasonality on our sales in our Refrigerants, CO2 and Dry Ice businesses. 
Slide 7 presents a quarterly trend of key metrics. This quarter represented the third consecutive quarter of strong positive same-store sales growth and sales per day continued to show sequential improvement. We preserved our EBITDA margins in a difficult economy and posted very strong EBITDA margins in this year's first quarter as we emerged from the recession. The trend continued in our third quarter, which reflected the highest EBITDA margin in Airgas history achieved on a revenue base that is still well below pre-recession levels. And a strong stable free cash flow continues to be one of the defining characteristics of the Airgas business model. 
Please turn to Slide 8, capital expenditures. We have continued to be disciplined in our capital spending this year, as reflected in the 90 basis point year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as a percent of sales to 5.7%. Cylinders and bulk tanks are the only asset category with year-over-year growth in spending, as improving gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue-generating assets. 
Slide 9 presents our fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and updated full year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single-digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.82 to $0.86, an increase of 19% to 25% over the prior year. Excluding the estimated $0.04 of incremental SAP cost, our guidance represents a 25% to 30% improvement over the prior year. For the full year, we are updating our adjusted earnings per share expectations to be in the range of $3.28 to $3.32, up 22% to 24% over adjusted EPS for fiscal 2010, which includes the significant year-over-year impact of increased variable compensation expense and SAP costs. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high single-digits for the full fiscal year and operating margin is expected to be in the 12% to 12.5% range. Our guidance excludes debt extinguishment charges, multi-employer pension withdrawal charges, cost and charges related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and the one-time interest penalty. 
Slide 10 presents a walk through the primary elements of our fourth quarter guidance, using third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.80 as a starting point. In the fourth quarter, the addition of two selling days and the loss of the negative third quarter impact of the holidays should provide $0.05 to $0.06 of benefit to EPS. Seasonality in our CO2, Dry Ice and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a headwind. And preparation for the implementation of SAP at our first regional distribution company on April 1 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03 relative to the third quarter. We expect our core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.02 to $0.04 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and solid execution of our operating efficiency programs. The resulting updated of full year guidance of $3.28 to $3.32 represents year-over-year growth of 22% to 24%. And now I'll turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session."

We delivered record adjusted earnin",949,"Thanks, Jay. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Please turn to Slide 2. Fiscal 2011 was a remarkable year primarily due to the tireless efforts and can-do attitude of our more than 14,000 Airgas Associates. We delivered record adjusted earnings of $3.34 per diluted share on sales of $4.3 billion and adjusted operating margins of 12.2% generating tremendous free cash flow of $387 million driven by adjusted cash flow from operations of $617 million. Most impressive is that we delivered these results on sales that were still below prerecession levels and in the year where we incurred $0.08 of incremental expense related to the SAP implementation and associated depreciation. We also delivered record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.88 in the fourth quarter, a 28% increase over the prior year. On sales that are still below prerecession level and while incurring $0.03 of incremental expense related to the SAP implementation and depreciation. Fourth-quarter sales of $1.1 billion marked by a strong same-store sales increased of 11%, gas and rent same-store sales increased 9% and hardgoods, 14%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%. 
The Manufacturing recovery that began in the central regions of the U.S. among larger customers is now evident more broadly throughout the country and in smaller manufacturers. Our medical business began to accelerate this quarter and encouraging trend continued in utility and petrochemical markets as well as customers using our products for repair and maintenance operations. We continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platforms at sales volumes improved and adjusted operating margins for the quarter increased 140 basis points year-over-year to 12.1%. During fiscal 2011, we acquired only 8 businesses with $21 million in annual revenues. But our acquisition activity typically begins to generate on the heels of the recovery phase of the business cycle. We recently signed an agreement to apply our Payne Enterprises Inc., a producer and distributor of carbon dioxide and dry ice throughout the Midwest. Payne, established in 1957, is based in Indiana and has more than 20 locations and 140 employees and generated revenue of $33 million in calendar '10. Payne's business is well with our carbonic and dry ice network and we expect to close the transaction within a few days. We have recently experienced a renewed level of interest of possible sellers and we expect our acquisition pipeline to continue to improve. 
During the fourth quarter, we announced and completed a $300 million share repurchase program buying $4.78 million Airgas shares on the open market at an average price of $62.76, which we expect will provide attractive earnings accretion for our shareholders. This morning, we announced a new $300 million share repurchase program, which reflects our continuing confidence in the future. Our business is strengthening, our balance sheet is solid and we continue to generate strong cash flow. Accordingly, we are able to repurchase shares and realize attractive earnings accretion while funding our growth strategies. When completed, the share repurchase programs announced today will result in total shares outstanding about equal to 2004, 2005 levels. Looking forward, we're pleased to announce earnings guidance for next year that represents 12% to 17% growth over fiscal 2011 and 17% to 21% growth after accounting for the SAP headwind noted in our guidance. Our customers are exhibiting an improved degree of confidence in the future investing capital and adding staff. 
April sales were as expected based on historical trends and the timing of the Easter holiday, slightly below March but well above January and February and consistent with today's guidance. Our strategy was the position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery and we are realizing the success of that strategy. As you can see in Slide 3, our revenues and earnings were resilient given the severity of the downturn. And now, we are delivering record earnings while our revenues have yet to recover to pre-recession level. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive. 
Turning to Slide 4. Cash flow continues to be 1 of the strengths of our business model. We generated $617 million of adjusted operating cash flow in fiscal '11 representing a 17% compounded annual growth rate since fiscal 2001. The modest increase from fiscal 2010 was driven by a working capital builds to support robust sales growth. We held capital spending roughly flat year-to-year leveraging our significant asset base in sales volume strengthen. Because of the huge investment in capital expenditures, approximately $2.5 billion that we've made since 2007 and because of that debt of the recession, Airgas still has unused capacity in many of our asset classes and that bodes well for our EBITDA pull-through in fiscal '12.
Free cash flow of $378 million for fiscal '11 was about 9% of sales. There's tremendous opportunity for Airgas stockholders to benefit from the future value of the execution of our business strategies. Our industry is still very fragmented and we have build the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offering. The benefits of our customer centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will yield an even greater value for our customers, more than 1 million strong to our selected Airgas at their supplier of choice. Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. We are well-positioned at the U.S. economy revised with the emergence of the stronger manufacturing base. And further opportunity beckons in spending to rebuild America's infrastructure begins to materialize. As I love to remind people, the best time for Airgas is now. Mike will give us a review of market strategy in operation."

As Peter mentioned, our core business is continuing to gain momentum at the U.S. Manufacturing recovery expense geographically and into smaller customers as well. Our sales and marketing strategy focus on segment alignment also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our strategic accounts program with the strategy originated and is already underway in medical and Construction segments. with the fourth quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 13% from the prior year, driven by new accounts signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing Metal Fabrication materials and conglomerates Healthcare and petrochemical customer bases. Strategic Accounts represents tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product line and locations and currently it represents more than 20% of sales. I encourage you to review our Strategic Products line and the appendix in detail after our call but an interest of time will provide you with an overview of the fourth quarter. Strategic Products, which combined make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 10% for the quarter. Each of our strategic categories experienced strong year-over-year growth this quarter with the exception of CO2 and dry ice, which experienced normal seasonal declines and further impact of a loss of certain locations of a major food processing customer emerging from bankruptcy. Each strategic product category also continued to improve sequentially compared to the third quarter. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 19% for the quarter, a long term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products. Before I update you on the SAP implementation, I'd like to review an incident that is having an industry-wide impact on the availability of the acetylene gas in United States.
In late March, a catastrophic explosion occurred at 1 of 2 plants of the nation's primary supplier of calcium carbide, which is the raw material used in the generation of acetylene gas. The implications for industry-wide availability of acetylene are significant. The supply disruption in the United States is expected to last for sometime and details are still unfolding. In response to this disruption, Airgas is utilizing a combination of alternatives in attempt to compensate for the lack of carbide. Including increased use of chemical acetylene, reallocation of available calcium carbide and potential sourcing of calcium carbide from outside the United States. We're also encouraging customers to adopt the use of alternative fuel such as propylene or plasma technology were appropriate. While we are working across our national infrastructure to optimize every element of our acetylene supply chain, cost as a result of the calcium carbide shortage are now escalating due to both rising raw materials and distribution costs. Airgas and its subsidiaries have declared force majeure for all bulk cylinder acetylene, product allocations and product surcharges are already in effect to help mitigate the financial impact to Airgas. This is a fluid situation however, and we could be facing a miles earning headwind in the near-term as a result.
I would now like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 6. The commencement of our plants face rolled out whereby business unit implement the new SAP system in succession marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits we expected to achieve in 3 key areas, accelerated sales growth through expansion of telesales platform, price management and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis and we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses. This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform and we are excited about its gain changing implications. 
Our hardgood infrastructure businesses including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and distribution centers have been running successfully on SAP since going live in July, 2010. All fulfillment metrics have been at or above preconversion levels. Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP on April 4, 2011, We trained than 850 Associates at over 120 locations and together with the hardgoods infrastructure converted in July of last year now have about a 1,800 active SAP users. All major processes are working on SAP at Airgas South. We experienced no system downtime in making the switch to SAP from CEU and all of interbranch and customer shipments were on scheduled day 1 of the conversion. We've measured 25 key metrics on a daily basis to assess our performance pre- and post-conversion and all of these metrics at Airgas South have been within the expected tolerance levels. Much like our experience with the hardwood infrastructure conversion helpdesk tickets were backed to expected levels within 2 weeks following the conversion. As with any project with this magnitude and complexity, you expect to learn from your experiences early on and adjust your approach accordingly. In fact, our phase approach was specifically designed with this in mind. 1 of the lessons we learned with the Airgas South conversion is that we need to enhance our training program for our plant Associates to better prepare them for the changes and inventory processing and other plant records that come with a new system. We've already begun to address this issue and are incorporating necessary enhancements into the training program for the conversion of our next regional distribution company, Airgas Great Lakes. We are scheduled for the conversion of Great Lakes for September 1, 2011. Our implementation schedule accelerates thereafter and we expect our distribution business with the majority of benefits are expected to be realized to be fully converted to SAP by the summer of 2012. 
Based on our experience to date, we are confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits detailed in our August 31 announcement will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in aggregate annual run rate benefit in operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will reach or exceed $125 million in the aggregate. 
The graph presented on Slide 7 depicts our SAP implementation cost, depreciation expense and operating income benefit projections by fiscal year as well as the net EPS impact in each year. The red bar is to note implementation cost, the gold bars the note SAP-related depreciation expense and the green bar is to note benefits to be realized at the operating income line. We expect fiscal 2012 to be the heaviest net expense year related to the SAP implementation as the majority of our regional distribution companies will be converted to SAP during the fiscal year. This is a necessary cost to bear before we can begin to realize any benefits from the new platform. In fiscal 2013, we began to accrue benefits at the operating income line at the latter part of the year, partially offsetting implementation cost and depreciation during the year. By the third quarter of fiscal 2014, which is December, 2013, we expect to have achieved our run rate operating income benefits target between $75 and $125 million with approximately $17 million flowing through the financials in fiscal 2014 based on achieving the midpoint of the target benefits range. In fiscal 2015, we're estimating that we will have surpassed the midpoint of our target benefit range with at least $100 million of benefits flowing through operating income for that year. Note that the only expenses incurred related to.

The expense amounts presented in excluded the depreciation of the related capitalized costs. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our new divisional alignment and business support centers which will result in restructuring charges in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Currently, each of our 12 regional distribution companies operates with it's own regional accounting groups and administrative functions such as IT. In order to better utilize our resources across regional company boundaries, we will realigned our original company support functions including accounting and certain administrative functions into 4 divisional business support centers. Restructuring our regional company support functions at this time, in the evolution of Airgas is ideal at the conversion to a single data center across our regional distribution companies, which will take place as part of the SAP implementation enables consolidation of many administrative functions. Charges, associated with these restructuring, includes severance, transition staffing, relocation, recruiting and other costs. In fiscal 2012, we expect to incur pretax restructuring charges of $21 million, of which $13 million will occur in the first quarter primarily related to severance. Restructure will be completed in fiscal 2013 during which we will incur pretax restructuring charges of approximately $6 million primarily related to transition staffing, relocation and recruiting. Bob will now give our financial review for the quarter and provide guidance for next year."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 10. Sales increased to $1.1 billion reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 11% comprised of a 9% increase in gas and rent and a 14% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 6% and price was up 5%. Sequentially, total sales increased 7% from the third quarter and sales per day increased 3%. 
Daily sales for both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter slightly lower than last year's gas and rent net of 64%. Gross margin was 54.2%, a decline of 20 basis points from the prior year reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Excluding a pretax charge of approximately $18 million related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $134 million up 27% from last year. Our performance is impressive particularly in light of the year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP cost of $12 million. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.1%, 140 basis point improvement over the prior year driven by operating leverage on sales growth. SAP cost decreased adjusted operating margin by 50 basis point in the current quarter. Excluding $0.14 related to Air Products takeover attempt, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 28% to $0.88 in the fourth quarter. There were approximately 84 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down slightly year-over-year and down nearly 2% sequentially driven by the share repurchase authorization announced and completed in the fourth quarter. Return on capital, which is trailing fourth quarter calculation was 11.9%, an improvement of 190 basis points over last year and 60 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital talk to continue to expand with operating income as the recovery continues and our business benefits from the significant capital investments we have made in the past few years, including new air separation plants, Bill Plant upgrades and SAP. 
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates and our DSO of 46 days improved slightly year-over-year and we're relatively consistent with the third quarter. Inventory turns now consistent with recent trends reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels as hardgoods sales has accelerated. For the full year, we generated a strong free cash flow of $387 million driven by adjusted cash from operations of $617 million and reflecting the increase in working capital associated with higher sales compared to the prior year. On the strength of our earnings, continued strong cash flow and outlook for the future, we increased our dividend payout by 33% during the year. Total debt was approximately $1.9 billion at March 31, reflecting debt reduction of more than $250 million during the year offset by share repurchases. Our fixed low debt ratio of the end of March was about 48% fixed and our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.4 comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. 
Turning now to Slide 11, we'll look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 12% versus the prior year to $997 million with same-store sales up 11%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 8% and hardgoods were up 14% with pricing up 4% and volumes up 7%. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 6% in total and by 3% on a daily basis with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 55.1%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year primarily reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 100 basis points from the third quarter reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods as well as seasonal increases in propane and other fuel gases that carry lower margins, partially offset by the underlying improvement in gas margins from our March price increase. Gas and rent represented 59% of distribution sales in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter. Operating income in the distribution segment increased 29% year-over-year to $130 million and operating margin improved 170 basis points to 13.1% driven by operating leverage and sales growth. All other operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, Refrigerants ammonia and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 12% from the prior year driven primarily by higher pricing in Ammonia and volumes in our CO2 and dry ice businesses. Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations segment increased by 7% in total from the third quarter and by 3% on a daily basis at higher Refrigerants and Ammonia sales more than offset the effects of seasonality in our CO2 and dry ice businesses from our third quarter to our fourth quarter. 
Gross margin for other operations was down 50 basis points from the prior year. Sequentially the 510 basis point decline in gross margins from the third quarter is attributable to the fact that the seasonality on sales in our CO2 and dry ice businesses, higher cost in the Ammonia business relative to pricing and higher sales of lower margin refrigerants. Operating income for All Other Operations was $9 million and operating margin of 7.6% was up 200 basis points year-over-year driven by operating leverage on sales growth in our CO2 and dry ice businesses. Sequentially, the decline in operating margin is attributable to seasonality in CO2 and dry ice, as well as higher sales of lower margin refrigerants. 
Please turn to Slide 12, capital expenditures. We were disciplined in capital spending in fiscal 2011 as reflected in the 50 basis point year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to 6% particularly in light of our strong organic sales growth. Cylinders in both tanks are the asset categories with the highest year-over-year growth and spending has improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand of our core revenue-generating assets. 
Slide 13 presents our fiscal 2012 first quarter and full-year guidance. For the first quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.92 to $0.97, an increase of 11% to 17% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense, $0.05 of which is incremental over the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of the increase in SAP cost, the guidance range represents a 16% to 22% year-over-year increase. For the full year, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.75 to $3.90, up 12% to 17% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation and depreciation expense, 18 of which is incremental over last year. Excluding the impact of the increase in SAP cost, the guidance range represents a 17% to 21% year-over-year increase. Operating margin is expected to be in the 12.3% to 12.8% range and includes the dilutive impact of the increased SAP cost. Incremental SAP cost reduced this range by approximately 50 basis points. 
CapEx is expected to be about 6% of sales. Our fiscal 2012 guidance excludes the impact of the business support center restructuring charges, which are expected to be $0.10 per diluted share in the first quarter and $0.17 per diluted share for the full year. Slide 14% presents a walk through the primary elements of our first quarter and full-year guidance using fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.88 and fiscal 2011 adjusted EPS of $3.34 respectively at the starting point. 
In the first quarter, we expect headwind of $0.05 related to stock-based compensation as the largest portion of our full-year stock-based compensation falls in the first quarter. $0.03 due to incremental SAP implementation cost and $0.01 due to the incremental depreciation of capitalized SAP cost. We expect seasonality in our CO2, dry ice, Refrigerants and Red-D-Arc businesses to provide a tailwind of $0.06 to $0.08 and the impact of the share repurchase program announced and completed in the fourth quarter net of stock plan issuance to provide a $0.02  benefit. We expect the core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.5 to $0.08 on 2 months of additional impact from our most recent price increase, continued improvement in daily sales volume and solid execution of our operating efficiency programs. I'll now turn the it back to Jay to begin the Q&A session."

But you have to be on SAP and you have to be stable on SAP before you can actually start to work on those pieces. And I'll take the price piece first. We have extensive discussions with our implementation partner Doyle. They have done extensive work with other companies on using SAP extensive price management and research tool with other companies in improving margins and particularly the more, the broader your product line and the broader the number of customers you have and the higher the number of smaller dollar invoice as you deliver and the more decentralized you are in the way you manage pricing, the higher, the greater, the opportunity at the end of the rainbow. And they did a price study with us on real data from 1 of our companies. And sure enough, everything I just described is exactly what we found. And so we were very conservative in that benefit for that piece that we identified, we are very conservative and what we came out with publicly based on -- compared to what the study indicated the potential range of benefits was. So we feel pretty good about that 1. However, you can't really start using the tools and mining the data and taking the actions until you're on SAP and stable on SAP, which we've assume is probably at least 6 months after you've been on it before you can even start working on it. So that's what that means. Feel pretty good about that. The other 1 is that for 12 years, we've owned a Safety Telesales business. That has been growing at dramatically higher rates compounded annually then the safety business is growing in the United States. And it's a business today is couple $200 and something million dollars of sales. We have about 185 people on the phones that manage 75,000 customers strictly through a phone relationship. And many of their customers are small. Customers that you can afford to target or approach with a field sales personnel in a company car. Up until now, we piloted for a number of years where we've taken some of these telesales people. We sent them to welding school, we trained them to weld and we've turn them loose on some exiting Airgas customers. And the sales have grown significantly. We've turned them loose on some target customers and sales have grown significantly. Using this channel as the vehicle to reach customers that we haven't been able to reach. So the data is very compelling. Now the problem has always been that they have always been on a separate computer platform than the rest of our distribution companies where on. So the ability to utilize their capabilities and utilize our hardgoods distribution centers and utilize our branches for making deliveries of gases or allowing customers to pick things up at stores et cetera, we can do it. We were system limited because the platforms really didn't communicate with each other. So we're now in the process of ramping up the telesales group and I think our first new 20 telesales people have just completed welding school. And come this summer, there will be a new channel, competing in the U.S. market for customers that have many cases it's really never heard from a sales person before. And we expect it to be pretty exciting. And that's that story."

They're psyched up. It's going to be a great motivator for a long time and Airgas that this is the way it happens.

So they want to go to smaller delivery cylinders and tanks. And we're on into the last 9 months, our costs have been increasing and when that happens, you scurry like hell to keep up with them and pass along and then when the cost ammonia prices fall, you're left with all this additional volume and you benefit from declining of cost of goods sold. So I think we've done a very good job growing our business under difficult circumstances that is constantly rising ammonia prices over the last 12 months.

Fiscal 2011 was a remarkable year primarily due to the tireless efforts and can-do attitude of our more than 14,000 Airgas Associates. We delivered record adjusted earnings of $3.34 per diluted share on sales of $4.3 billion and adjusted operating margins of 12.2% generating tremendous free cash flow of $387 million driven by adjusted cash flow from operations of $617 million. Most impressive is that we delivered these results on sales that were still below prerecession levels and in the year where we incurred $0.08 of incremental expense related to the SAP implementation and associated depreciation. 
We also delivered record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.88 in the fourth quarter, a 28% increase over the prior year. On sales that are still below prerecession level and while incurring $0.03 of incremental expense related to the SAP implementation and depreciation. 
Fourth-quarter sales of $1.1 billion marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 11%, gas and rent same-store sales increased 9% and hardgoods, 14%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%. 
The Manufacturing recovery that began in the central regions of the U.S. among larger customers is now evident more broadly throughout the country and in smaller manufacturers. Our Medical business began to accelerate this quarter and encouraging trends continued in utilities of petrochemical markets as well as customers using our products for repair and maintenance operations. 
We continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platforms as sales volumes improved and adjusted operating margins for the quarter increased 140 basis points year-over-year to 12.1%. During fiscal 2011, we acquired only 8 businesses with $21 million in annual revenues. But our acquisition activity typically begins to accelerate on the heels of the recovery phase of the business cycle. We recently signed an agreement to apply our Pain Enterprises Inc., a producer and distributor of carbon dioxide and dry ice throughout the Midwest. Pain, established in 1957, is based in Bloomington, Indiana and has more than 20 locations and 140 employees and generated revenue of $33 million in calendar '10. Pain's business fits well with our carbonic and dry ice network and we expect to close the transaction within a few days. We have recently experienced a renewed level of interest from possible sellers and we expect our acquisition pipeline to continue to improve. 
During the fourth quarter, we announced and completed a $300 million share repurchase program buying $4.78 million Airgas shares on the open market at an average price of $62.76, which we expect will provide attractive earnings accretion for our shareholders. This morning, we announced a new $300 million share repurchase program, which reflects our continuing confidence in the future. Our business is strengthening, our balance sheet is solid and we continue to generate strong cash flow. Accordingly, we are able to repurchase shares and realize attractive earnings accretion while funding our growth strategies. When completed, the share repurchase program announced today will result in total shares outstanding about equal to 2004, 2005 levels. 
Looking forward, we're pleased to announce earnings guidance for next year that represents 12% to 17% growth over fiscal 2011 and 17% to 21% growth after accounting for the SAP headwind noted in our guidance. Our customers are exhibiting an improved degree of confidence in the future investing capital and adding staff. 
April sales were as expected based on historical trends and the timing of the Easter holiday, slightly below March but well above January and February and consistent with today's guidance. Our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery and we are realizing the success of that strategy. As you can see in Slide 3, our revenues and earnings were resilient, given the severity of the downturn. And now, we are delivering record earnings while our revenues have yet to recover to pre-recession levels. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive. 
Turning to Slide 4. Cash flow continues to be 1 of the strengths of our business model. We generated $617 million of adjusted operating cash flow in fiscal '11 representing a 17% compounded annual growth rate since fiscal 2001. The modest increase from fiscal 2010 was driven by our; working capital builds to support robust sales growth. We held capital spending roughly flat year-to-year leveraging our significant asset base in sales volume to strengthen. Because of the huge investment in capital expenditures, approximately $2.5 billion that we've made since 2007 and because of the depth of the recession, Airgas still has unused capacity in many of our asset classes and that bodes well for our EBITDA pull-through in fiscal '12.
Free cash flow of $378 million for fiscal '11 was about 9% of sales. There is tremendous opportunity for Airgas stockholders to benefit from the future value of the execution of our business strategies. Our industry is still very fragmented and we have built the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offering. The benefits of our customer centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will yield even greater value for our customers, more than 1 million strong who have selected Airgas as their supplier of choice. 
Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. We are well-positioned as the U.S. economy revised with the emergence of a stronger manufacturing base. And further opportunity beckons in spending to rebuild America's infrastructure begins to materialize. As I love to remind people, the best time for Airgas is now. Mike is here to give us a review of market strategy in operations."

Please turn to Slide 5. As Peter mentioned, our core business is continuing to gain momentum at the U.S. Manufacturing recovery expense geographically and into smaller customers as well. Our sales and marketin",1620,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Peter mentioned, our core business is continuing to gain momentum at the U.S. Manufacturing recovery expense geographically and into smaller customers as well. Our sales and marketing strategy focus on segment alignment also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts program where the strategy originated and was already underway in Medical and Construction segments. 
With the fourth quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 13% from the prior year, driven by new accounts signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing Metal Fabrication, Materials and Conglomerates, Healthcare and Petrochemical Customer bases. Strategic Accounts represent tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and locations and currently represent more than 20% of sales. 
I encourage you to review our Strategic Products slide in the appendix in detail after our call, but in the interest of time will provide you with an overview of the fourth quarter. Strategic Products, which combined, make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 10% for the quarter. Each of our strategic product categories experienced strong year-over-year growth this quarter with the exception of CO2 and Dry Ice, which experienced normal seasonal declines and further impact of the loss of certain locations of a major food processing customer emerging from bankruptcy. Each strategic product category also continued to improve sequentially compared to the third quarter. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 19% for the quarter, a long term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products. Before I update you on the SAP implementation, I'd like to review an incident that is having an industry-wide impact on the availability of acetylene gas in the United States.
In late March, a catastrophic explosion occurred at 1 of 2 plants of the nation's primary supplier of calcium carbide, which is the raw material used in the generation of acetylene gas. The implications for industry-wide availability of acetylene are significant. The supply disruption in the United States is expected to last for sometime and details are still unfolding. In response to this disruption, Airgas is utilizing a combination of alternatives in an attempt to compensate for the lack of carbide. Including increased use of chemical acetylene, reallocation of available calcium carbide and potential sourcing of calcium carbide from outside the United States. We're also encouraging customers to adopt the use of alternative fuel such as propylene or plasma technology where appropriate. 
While we are working across our national infrastructure to optimize every element of our acetylene supply chain, cost as a result of the calcium carbide shortage are now escalating due to both rising raw materials and distribution costs. Airgas and its subsidiaries have declared force majeure for all bulk in cylinder acetylene, product allocations and product surcharges are already in effect to help mitigate the financial impact to Airgas. This is a fluid situation however, and we could be facing a mild earnings headwind in the near term as a result.
I would now like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. 
Please turn to Slide 6. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly-customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits we expected to achieve in 3 key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of telesales platform; price management; and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis and we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses. This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform and we are excited about its game-changing implications. 
Our hardgoods infrastructure businesses including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and distribution centers have been running successfully on SAP since going live in July, 2010. All fulfillment metrics have been at or above pre-conversion levels. Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP on April 4, 2011. We trained more than 850 associates at over 120 locations and together with the hardgoods infrastructure converted in July of last year, now have about a 1,800 active SAP users. All major processes are working on SAP at Airgas South. We experienced no system downtime in making the switch to SAP from CU and all interbranch and customer shipments were on schedule, day 1 of the conversion. 
We measured 25 key metrics on a daily basis to assess our performance pre- and post-conversion and all of these metrics at Airgas South have been within the expected tolerance levels. Much like our experience with the hardgoods infrastructure conversion, helpdesk tickets were back to expected levels within 2 weeks following the conversion. 
As with any project of this magnitude and complexity, you expect to learn from your experiences early on and adjust your approach accordingly. In fact, our phase approach was specifically designed with this in mind. One of the lessons we learned with the Airgas South conversion is that we need to enhance our training program for our plant associates to prepare them for the changes and inventory processing and other plant records that come with the new system. We've already begun to address this issue and are incorporating necessary enhancements into the training program for the conversion of our next regional distribution company, Airgas Great Lakes. We are on schedule for the conversion of Great Lakes on September 1, 2011. Our implementation schedule accelerates thereafter and we expect our Distribution business with a majority of benefits are expected to be realized to be fully converted to SAP by the summer of 2012. 
Based on our experience to date, we are confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits detailed on our August 31 announcement will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in aggregate annual run rate benefits in operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will reach or exceed $125 million in the aggregate. 
The graph presented on Slide 7 depicts our SAP implementation cost, depreciation expense and operating income benefit projections by fiscal year as well as the net EPS impact in each year. The red bar is to note implementation costs, the gold bar is to note SAP-related depreciation expense and the green bar is to note benefits to be realized at the operating income line. 
We expect fiscal 2012 to be the heaviest net expense year related to the SAP implementation as the majority of our regional distribution companies will be converted to SAP during the fiscal year. This is a necessary cost to bear before we can begin to realize any benefits from the new platform. In fiscal 2013, we begin to accrue benefits at the operating income line in the latter part of the year, partially offsetting implementation cost and depreciation during the year. 
By the third quarter of fiscal 2014, which is December 2013, we expect to have achieved our run rate operating income benefits target of between $75 million and $125 million with approximately $17 million flowing through the financials in fiscal 2014 based on achieving the midpoint of the target benefits range. In fiscal 2015, we're estimating that we will have surpassed the midpoint of our target benefit range with at least $100 million of benefits flowing through operating income for that year. Note that the only expenses incurred related to SAP in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, will be the depreciation of the related capitalized cost which have a depreciable life of 10 years.
As you clearly see, we expect our earnings power to be significantly enhanced in the years following the completion of the SAP implementation.
Please turn to Slide 8 for an overview of the total SAP project spend. Total project spend is expected to be approximately $186 million with approximately $91 million in expense and $95 million in capitalized cost. The expense amounts presented here exclude the depreciation of the related capitalized costs. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our new divisional alignment and business support centers which will result in restructuring charges in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Currently, each of our 12 regional distribution companies operates with it's own regional accounting groups and administrative functions such as IT. In order to better utilize our resources across regional company boundaries, we will realign our regional company support functions including accounting and certain administrative functions into 4 divisional business support centers. 
Restructuring our regional company support functions at this time, in the evolution of Airgas is ideal at the conversion to a single data center across our regional distribution companies, which will take place as part of the SAP implementation enables consolidation of many administrative functions. Charges, associated with these restructuring, includes severance, transition staffing, relocation, recruiting and other costs. In fiscal 2012, we expect to incur pretax restructuring charges of $21 million, of which $13 million will occur in the first quarter primarily related to severance. Restructure will be completed in fiscal 2013 during which we will incur pretax restructuring charges of approximately $6 million primarily related to transition staffing, relocation and recruiting. 
Bob will now give our financial review of the quarter and provide guidance for next year."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 10. Sales increased to $1.1 billion reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 11% comprised of a 9% increase in gas and rent and a 14% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 6% and price was up 5%. Sequentially, total sales increased 7% from the third quarter and sales per day increased 3%. 
Daily sales for both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter slightly lower than last year's gas and rent mix of 64%. Gross margin was 54.2%, a decline of 20 basis points from the prior year reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Excluding a pretax charge of approximately $18 million related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $134 million up 27% from last year. Our performance is impressive, particularly in light of the year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP cost of $12 million. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.1%, 140 basis point improvement over the prior year driven by operating leverage on sales growth. SAP cost decreased adjusted operating margin by 50 basis points in the current quarter. Excluding $0.14 related to Air Products takeover attempt, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 28% to $0.88 in the fourth quarter. There were approximately 84 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down slightly year-over-year and down nearly 2% sequentially driven by the share repurchase authorization announced and completed in the fourth quarter.  
Return on capital, which is a trailing fourth quarter calculation was 11.9%, an improvement of 190 basis points over last year and 60 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income as the recovery continues and our business benefits from the significant capital investments we have made in the past few years, including new air separation plants, Bill Plant upgrades and SAP. 
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates and our DSO of 46 days improved slightly year-over-year and were relatively consistent with the third quarter. Inventory turns out consistent with recent trends reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels as hardgoods sales have accelerated. 
For the full year, we generated a strong free cash flow of $387 million driven by adjusted cash from operations of $617 million and reflecting the increase in working capital associated with higher sales compared to the prior year. On the strength of our earnings, continued strong cash flow and outlook for the future, we increased our dividend payout by 33% during the year. Total debt was approximately $1.9 billion at March 31, reflecting debt reduction of more than $250 million during the year, offset by share repurchases. Our fixed low debt ratio at the end of March was about 48% fixed and our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.4 comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. 
Turning now to Slide 11, we'll look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 12% versus the prior year to $997 million with same-store sales up 11%. 
Gas and rent same-store sales were up 8% and hardgoods were up 14% with pricing up 4% and volumes up 7%. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 6% in total and by 3% on a daily basis with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. 
Distribution gross margin was 55.1%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 100 basis points from the third quarter reflecting a sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods as well as seasonal increases in propane and other fuel gases that carry lower margins, partially offset by the underlying improvement in gas margins from our March price increase. Gas and rent represented 59% of distribution sales in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter. Operating income in the distribution segment increased 29% year-over-year to $130 million and operating margin improved 170 basis points to 13.1% driven by operating leverage and sales growth. 
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 12% from the prior year driven primarily by higher pricing in Ammonia and volumes in our CO2 and Dry Ice businesses. Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations segment increased by 7% in total from the third quarter and by 3% on a daily basis as higher Refrigerants and Ammonia sales more than offset the effects of seasonality in our CO2 and Dry Ice businesses from our third quarter to our fourth quarter. 
Gross margin for other operations was down 50 basis points from the prior year. Sequentially the 510 basis point decline in gross margins from the third quarter is attributable to the fact that the seasonality on sales in our CO2 and Dry Ice businesses, higher cost in the Ammonia business relative to pricing and higher sales of lower margin refrigerants. 
Operating income for All Other Operations was $9 million and operating margin of 7.6% was up 200 basis points year-over-year driven by operating leverage on sales growth in our CO2 and Dry Ice businesses. Sequentially, the decline in operating margin is attributable to seasonality in CO2 and Dry Ice, as well as higher sales of lower margin refrigerants. 
Please turn to Slide 12, capital expenditures. We were disciplined in our capital spending in fiscal 2011 as reflected in the 50 basis point year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to 6%, particularly in light of our strong organic sales growth. Cylinders and bulk tanks are the asset categories with the highest year-over-year growth in spending, has improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand of our core revenue-generating assets. 
Slide 13 presents our fiscal 2012 first quarter and full-year guidance. For the first quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.92 to $0.97, an increase of 11% to 17% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense, $0.05 of which is incremental over the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of the increase in SAP cost, the guidance range represents a 16% to 22% year-over-year increase. 
For the full year, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.75 to $3.90, up 12% to 17% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation and depreciation expense, 18% of which is incremental over last year. Excluding the impact of the increase in SAP cost, the guidance range represents a 17% to 21% year-over-year increase. Operating margin is expected to be in the 12.3% to 12.8% range and includes the dilutive impact of the increased SAP cost. Incremental SAP cost reduced this range by approximately 50 basis points. 
CapEx is expected to be about 6% of sales. Our fiscal 2012 guidance excludes the impact of the business support center restructuring charges, which are expected to be $0.10 per diluted share in the first quarter and $0.17 per diluted share for the full year. Slide 14 presents a walk through the primary elements of our first quarter and full-year guidance using fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.88 and fiscal 2011 adjusted EPS of $3.34 respectively as the starting points. 
In the first quarter, we expect headwinds of $0.05 related to stock-based compensation as the largest portion of our full-year stock-based compensation bolts in the first quarter. $0.03 due to incremental SAP implementation cost and $0.01 due to the incremental depreciation of capitalized SAP cost. We expect seasonality in our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants and Red-D-Arc businesses to provide a tailwind of $0.06 to $0.08 and the impact of the share repurchase program announced and completed in the fourth quarter net of stock plan issuance to provide a $0.02  benefit. We expect the core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.5 to $0.08 on 2 months of additional impact from our most recent price increase, continued improvement in daily sales volumes and solid execution of our operating efficiency programs.

But you have to be on SAP and you have to be stable on SAP before you can actually start to work on those pieces. And I'll take the price piece first. We've had extensive discussions with our implementation partner, Deloitte. They have done extensive work with other companies on using SAP's extensive price management and research tool with other companies in improving margins and particularly the more, the broader your product line and the broader the number of customers you have and the higher the number of smaller dollar invoices you deliver and the more decentralized you are in the way you manage pricing, the higher, the greater, the opportunity at the end of the rainbow. And they did a price study with us on real data from one of our companies. And sure enough, everything I just described is exactly what we found. And so, we were very conservative in that benefit for that piece that we identified, we were very conservative and what we came out with publicly based on -- compared to what the study indicated the potential range of benefits was. So we feel pretty good about that one. However, you can't really start using the tools and mining the data and taking the actions until you're on SAP and you're stable on SAP, which we've assumed is probably at least 6 months after you've been on it before you can even start working on it. So that's what that lines. We feel pretty good about that. The other one, is that for 12 years, we've owned a Safety Telesales business. That has been growing at dramatically higher rates compounded there annually than the Safety business is growing in the United States. And it's a business that today is a couple $200 million and something million dollars of sales. We have about 185 people on the phones that manage 75,000 customers strictly through a phone relationship. And many of their customers are small. Customers that you can't afford to target or approach with a field sales personnel in a company car. Up until now, we've piloted for a number of years where we've taken some of these telesales people. We've sent them to welding school, we trained them to weld and we've turned them loose on some exiting Airgas customers, and the sales have grown significantly. We've turned them loose on some target customers and the sales have grown significantly. Using this channel as the vehicle to reach customers that we haven't been able to reach. So the data is very compelling. Now the problem has always been that they have always been on a separate computer platform than the rest of our distribution companies where on. So the ability to utilize their capabilities and utilize our hardgoods distribution centers and utilize our branches for making deliveries of gases or allowing customers to pick things up at stores, et cetera, we couldn't do it. We were system limited, because the platforms really didn't communicate with each other. So we're now in the process of ramping up that telesales group and I think, our first 20 new telesales people have just completed welding school. And come this summer, there will be a new channel, competing in the U.S. market for customers that have many cases, really never heard from a sales person before. And we expect it to be pretty exciting. And that's that story."

If I kind of add up the $400 million roughly for 3 years, like $1.2 billion. So sure sounds like you're ability to recap the balance sheet to increase the returns on capital therefore, is maybe even more than the $300 million  when you announced today and then you said you're going to give it a rest after that. So, maybe you could reconcile what's available to you to what you've sort of committed to thus far?"

And there is a possibility that we'll go back into the market with additional share repurchases. But we're also committed to growing by acquisitions and activity is picking up and we're committed to growing our dividend as our earnings increase. And we praise that 33% this year. So, I feel good about getting back to an outstanding shares number that we had in 2004, 2005 when we completed the share repurchase. And so every quarter is a fresh look."

And that was their separation plants, it was CO2 plants, it was cylinders, it was cylinder filling facilities that invested some major ones. And we're not back to peak sales yet, and we do have unused capacity in a lot of our asset classes. And so, I can't really, I don't know whether that's 7% higher sales or what, but I would imagine that somewhere in that range 7% to 10% growth in sales before we're really starting to stretch again. And my answer is not scientific, it's based on the fact that we're in the low 80s on our ASUs than we have capacity and some of our CO2 plants and a lot of our cylinder plants, the big ones that we built over the last 3 or 4 years have unused capacity. It's certain cylinder sizes, we're tight but in a lot of them we still have capacity -- additional cylinders. So that's just kind of a back-of-the-envelope gas 7% to 10% range before we would start ramping up growth assets. And after this year but we've already had a strong high single digit this year that estimated 6% to the numbers Peter's talking about would be kind of after that."

Fiscal 2011 was a remarkable year primarily due to the tireless efforts and can-do attitude of our more than 14,000 Airgas Associates. We delivered record adjusted earnings of $3.34 per diluted share on sales of $4.3 billion and adjusted operating margins of 12.2% generating tremendous free cash flow of $387 million driven by adjusted cash flow from operations of $617 million. Most impressive is that we delivered these results on sales that were still below prerecession levels and in the year where we incurred $0.08 of incremental expense related to the SAP implementation and associated depreciation. 
We also delivered record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.88 in the fourth quarter, a 28% increase over the prior year. On sales that are still below prerecession level and while incurring $0.03 of incremental expense related to the SAP implementation and depreciation. 
Fourth-quarter sales of $1.1 billion marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 11%, gas and rent same-store sales increased 9% and hardgoods, 14%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%. 
The Manufacturing recovery that began in the central regions of the U.S. among larger customers is now evident more broadly throughout the country and in smaller manufacturers. Our Medical business began to accelerate this quarter and encouraging trends continued in utilities of petrochemical markets as well as customers using our products for repair and maintenance operations. 
We continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platforms as sales volumes improved and adjusted operating margins for the quarter increased 140 basis points year-over-year to 12.1%. During fiscal 2011, we acquired only 8 businesses with $21 million in annual revenues. But our acquisition activity typically begins to accelerate on the heels of the recovery phase of the business cycle. We recently signed an agreement to acquire our Pain Enterprises Inc., a producer and distributor of carbon dioxide and dry ice throughout the Midwest. Pain, established in 1957, is based in Bloomington, Indiana and has more than 20 locations and 140 employees and generated revenue of $33 million in calendar '10. Pain's business fits well with our carbonic and dry ice network and we expect to close the transaction within a few days. We have recently experienced a renewed level of interest from possible sellers and we expect our acquisition pipeline to continue to improve. 
During the fourth quarter, we announced and completed a $300 million share repurchase program buying $4.78 million Airgas shares on the open market at an average price of $62.76, which we expect will provide attractive earnings accretion for our shareholders. This morning, we announced a new $300 million share repurchase program, which reflects our continuing confidence in the future. Our business is strengthening, our balance sheet is solid and we continue to generate strong cash flow. Accordingly, we are able to repurchase shares and realize attractive earnings accretion while funding our growth strategies. When completed, the share repurchase program announced today will result in total shares outstanding about equal to 2004, 2005 levels. 
Looking forward, we're pleased to announce earnings guidance for next year that represents 12% to 17% growth over fiscal 2011 and 17% to 21% growth after accounting for the SAP headwind noted in our guidance. Our customers are exhibiting an improved degree of confidence in the future investing capital and adding staff. 
April sales were as expected based on historical trends and the timing of the Easter holiday, slightly below March but well above January and February and consistent with today's guidance. Our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery and we are realizing the success of that strategy. As you can see in Slide 3, our revenues and earnings were resilient, given the severity of the downturn. And now, we are delivering record earnings while our revenues have yet to recover to pre-recession levels. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive. 
Turning to Slide 4. Cash flow continues to be 1 of the strengths of our business model. We generated $617 million of adjusted operating cash flow in fiscal '11 representing a 17% compounded annual growth rate since fiscal 2001. The modest increase from fiscal 2010 was driven by working capital builds to support robust sales growth. We held capital spending roughly flat year-to-year leveraging our significant asset base in sales volume to strengthen. Because of the huge investment in capital expenditures, approximately $2.5 billion that we've made since 2007 and because of the depth of the recession, Airgas still has unused capacity in many of our asset classes and that bodes well for our EBITDA pull-through in fiscal '12.
Free cash flow of $378 million for fiscal '11 was about 9% of sales. There is tremendous opportunity for Airgas stockholders to benefit from the future value of the execution of our business strategies. Our industry is still very fragmented and we have built the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offering. The benefits of our customer centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will yield even greater value for our customers, more than 1 million strong who have selected Airgas as their supplier of choice. 
Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. We are well-positioned as the U.S. economy revised with the emergence of a stronger manufacturing base. And further opportunity beckons as spending to rebuild America's infrastructure begins to materialize. As I love to remind people, the best time at Airgas is now. Mike is here to give us a review of market strategy in operations."

As Peter mentioned, our core business is continuing to gain momentum at the U.S. Manufacturing recovery expense geographically and into smaller customers as well. Our sales and marketing strategy focus on segment alignment also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts program when this strategy originated and was already underway in Medical and Construction segments. 
With the fourth quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 13% from the prior year, driven by new accounts signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing Metal Fabrication, Materials and Conglomerates, Healthcare and Petrochemical Customer bases. Strategic Accounts represent tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and locations and currently represent more than 20% of sales. 
I encourage you to review our Strategic Products slide in the appendix in detail after our call, but in the interest of time will provide you with an overview of the fourth quarter. Strategic Products, which combined, make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 10% for the quarter. Each of our strategic product categories experienced strong year-over-year growth this quarter with the exception of CO2 and Dry Ice, which experienced normal seasonal declines and further impact of the loss of certain locations of a major food processing customer emerging from bankruptcy. Each strategic product category also continued to improve sequentially compared to the third quarter. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 19% for the quarter, a long term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products. Before I update you on the SAP implementation, I'd like to review an incident that is having an industry-wide impact on the availability of acetylene gas in the United States.
In late March, a catastrophic explosion occurred at 1 of 2 plants of the nation's primary supplier of calcium carbide, which is the raw material used in the generation of acetylene gas. The implications for industry-wide availability of acetylene are significant. The supply disruption in the United States is expected to last for sometime and details are still unfolding. In response to this disruption, Airgas is utilizing a combination of alternatives in an attempt to compensate for the lack of carbide. Including increased use of chemical acetylene, reallocation of available calcium carbide and potential sourcing of calcium carbide from outside the United States. We're also encouraging customers to adopt the use of alternative fuel such as propylene or plasma technology where appropriate. 
While we are working across our national infrastructure to optimize every element of our acetylene supply chain, cost as a result of the calcium carbide shortage are now escalating due to both rising raw materials and distribution costs. Airgas and its subsidiaries have declared force majeure for all bulk in cylinder acetylene, product allocations and product surcharges are already in effect to help mitigate the financial impact to Airgas. This is a fluid situation however, and we could be facing a mild earnings headwind in the near term as a result.
I would now like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. 
Please turn to Slide 6. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly-customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits we expected to achieve in 3 key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of telesales platform; price management; and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis and we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses. This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform and we are excited about its game-changing implications. 
Our hardgoods infrastructure businesses including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and distribution centers have been running successfully on SAP since going live in July, 2010. All fulfillment metrics have been at or above pre-conversion levels. Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP on April 4, 2011. We trained more than 850 associates at over 120 locations and together with the hardgoods infrastructure converted in July of last year, now have about a 1,800 active SAP users. All major processes are working on SAP at Airgas South. We experienced no system downtime in making the switch to SAP from CU and all interbranch and customer shipments were on schedule, day 1 of the conversion. 
We measured 25 key metrics on a daily basis to assess our performance pre- and post-conversion and all of these metrics at Airgas South have been within the expected tolerance levels. Much like our experience with the hardgoods infrastructure conversion, helpdesk tickets were back to expected levels within 2 weeks following the conversion. 
As with any project of this magnitude and complexity, you expect to learn from your experiences early on and adjust your approach accordingly. In fact, our phase approach was specifically designed with this in mind. One of the lessons we learned with the Airgas South conversion is that we need to enhance our training program for our plant associates to better prepare them for the changes and inventory processing and other plant records that come with the new system. We've already begun to address this issue and are incorporating necessary enhancements into the training program for the conversion of our next regional distribution company, Airgas Great Lakes. We are on schedule for the conversion of Great Lakes on September 1, 2011. Our implementation schedule accelerates thereafter and we expect our Distribution business with a majority of benefits are expected to be realized to be fully converted to SAP by the summer of 2012. 
Based on our experience to date, we are confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits detailed on our August 31 announcement will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in aggregate annual run rate benefits in operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will reach or exceed $125 million in the aggregate. 
The graph presented on Slide 7 depicts our SAP implementation cost, depreciation expense and operating income benefit projections by fiscal year as well as the net EPS impact in each year. The red bar is to note implementation costs, the gold bar is to note SAP-related depreciation expense and the green bar is to note benefits to be realized at the operating income line. 
We expect fiscal 2012 to be the heaviest net expense year related to the SAP implementation as the majority of our regional distribution companies will be converted to SAP during the fiscal year. This is a necessary cost to bear before we can begin to realize any benefits from the new platform. In fiscal 2013, we begin to accrue benefits at the operating income line in the latter part of the year, partially offsetting implementation cost and depreciation during the year. 
By the third quarter of fiscal 2014, which is December 2013, we expect to have achieved our run rate operating income benefits targeted between $75 million and $125 million with approximately $17 million flowing through the financials in fiscal 2014 based on achieving the midpoint of the target benefits range. In fiscal 2015, we're estimating that we will have surpassed the midpoint of our target benefit range with at least $100 million of benefits flowing through operating income for that year. Note that the only expenses incurred related to SAP in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, will be the depreciation of the related capitalized cost which have a depreciable life of 10 years.
As you clearly see, we expect our earnings power to be significantly enhanced in the years following the completion of the SAP implementation.
Please turn to Slide 8 for an overview of the total SAP project spend. Total project spend is expected to be approximately $186 million with approximately $91 million in expense and $95 million in capitalized cost. The expense amounts presented here exclude the depreciation of the related capitalized costs. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our new divisional alignment and business support centers which will result in restructuring charges in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Currently, each of our 12 regional distribution companies operates with it's own regional accounting groups and administrative functions such as IT. In order to better utilize our resources across regional company boundaries, we will realign our regional company support functions including accounting and certain administrative functions into 4 divisional business support centers. 
Restructuring our regional company support functions at this time, in the evolution of Airgas is ideal at the conversion to a single data center across our regional distribution companies, which will take place as part of the SAP implementation enables consolidation of many administrative functions. Charges, associated with these restructuring, includes severance, transition staffing, relocation, recruiting and other costs. In fiscal 2012, we expect to incur pretax restructuring charges of $21 million, of which $13 million will occur in the first quarter primarily related to severance. Restruction will be completed in fiscal 2013 during which we will incur pretax restructuring charges of approximately $6 million primarily related to transition staffing, relocation and recruiting. 
Bob will now give our financial review of the quarter and provide guidance for next year."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 10. Sales increased to $1.1 billion reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 11% comprised of",1422,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 10. Sales increased to $1.1 billion reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 11% comprised of a 9% increase in gas and rent and a 14% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 6% and price was up 5%. Sequentially, total sales increased 7% from the third quarter and sales per day increased 3%. 
Daily sales for both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter slightly lower than last year's gas and rent mix of 64%. Gross margin was 54.2%, a decline of 20 basis points from the prior year reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Excluding a pretax charge of approximately $18 million related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $134 million up 27% from last year. Our performance is impressive, particularly in light of the year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP cost of $12 million. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.1%, 140 basis point improvement over the prior year driven by operating leverage on sales growth. SAP cost decreased adjusted operating margin by 50 basis points in the current quarter. Excluding $0.14 related to Air Products takeover attempt, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 28% to $0.88 in the fourth quarter. There were approximately 84 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down slightly year-over-year and down nearly 2% sequentially driven by the share repurchase authorization announced and completed in the fourth quarter.  
Return on capital, which is a trailing fourth quarter calculation was 11.9%, an improvement of 190 basis points over last year and 60 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income as the recovery continues and our business benefits from the significant capital investments we have made in the past few years, including new air separation plants, Bill Plant upgrades and SAP. 
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates and our DSO of 46 days improved slightly year-over-year and were relatively consistent with the third quarter. Inventory turns out consistent with recent trends reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels as hardgoods sales have accelerated. 
For the full year, we generated strong free cash flow of $387 million driven by adjusted cash from operations of $617 million and reflecting the increase in working capital associated with higher sales compared to the prior year. On the strength of our earnings, continued strong cash flow and outlook for the future, we increased our dividend payout by 33% during the year. Total debt was approximately $1.9 billion at March 31, reflecting debt reduction of more than $250 million during the year, offset by share repurchases. Our fixed low debt ratio at the end of March was about 48% fixed and our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.4 comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. 
Turning now to Slide 11, we'll look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 12% versus the prior year to $997 million with same-store sales up 11%. 
Gas and rent same-store sales were up 8% and hardgoods were up 14% with pricing up 4% and volumes up 7%. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 6% in total and by 3% on a daily basis with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. 
Distribution gross margin was 55.1%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 100 basis points from the third quarter reflecting a sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods as well as seasonal increases in propane and other fuel gases that carry lower margins, partially offset by the underlying improvement in gas margins from our March price increase. Gas and rent represented 59% of distribution sales in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the third quarter. Operating income in the distribution segment increased 29% year-over-year to $130 million and operating margin improved 170 basis points to 13.1% driven by operating leverage and sales growth. 
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 12% from the prior year driven primarily by higher pricing in Ammonia and volumes in our CO2 and Dry Ice businesses. Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations segment increased by 7% in total from the third quarter and by 3% on a daily basis as higher Refrigerants and Ammonia sales more than offset the effects of seasonality in our CO2 and Dry Ice businesses from our third quarter to our fourth quarter. 
Gross margin for other operations was down 50 basis points from the prior year. Sequentially the 510 basis point decline in gross margins from the third quarter is attributable to the fact that the seasonality on sales in our CO2 and Dry Ice businesses, higher cost in the Ammonia business relative to pricing and higher sales of lower margin refrigerants. 
Operating income for All Other Operations was $9 million and operating margin of 7.6% was up 200 basis points year-over-year driven by operating leverage on sales growth in our CO2 and Dry Ice businesses. Sequentially, the decline in operating margin is attributable to seasonality in CO2 and Dry Ice, as well as higher sales of lower margin refrigerants. 
Please turn to Slide 12, capital expenditures. We were disciplined in our capital spending in fiscal 2011 as reflected in the 50 basis point year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to 6%, particularly in light of our strong organic sales growth. Cylinders and bulk tanks are the asset categories with the highest year-over-year growth in spending, has improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand of our core revenue-generating assets. 
Slide 13 presents our fiscal 2012 first quarter and full-year guidance. For the first quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.92 to $0.97, an increase of 11% to 17% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense, $0.05 of which is incremental over the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of the increase in SAP cost, the guidance range represents a 16% to 22% year-over-year increase. 
For the full year, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.75 to $3.90, up 12% to 17% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation and depreciation expense, 18% of which is incremental over last year. Excluding the impact of the increase in SAP cost, the guidance range represents a 17% to 21% year-over-year increase. Operating margin is expected to be in the 12.3% to 12.8% range and includes the dilutive impact of increased SAP cost. Incremental SAP cost reduced this range by approximately 50 basis points. 
CapEx is expected to be about 6% of sales. Our fiscal 2012 guidance excludes the impact of the business support center restructuring charges, which are expected to be $0.10 per diluted share in the first quarter and $0.17 per diluted share for the full year. Slide 14 presents a walk through the primary elements of our first quarter and full-year guidance using fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.88 and fiscal 2011 adjusted EPS of $3.34 respectively as the starting points. 
In the first quarter, we expect headwinds of $0.05 related to stock-based compensation as the largest portion of our full-year stock-based compensation bolts in the first quarter. $0.03 due to incremental SAP implementation cost and $0.01 due to the incremental depreciation of capitalized SAP cost. We expect seasonality in our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants and Red-D-Arc businesses to provide a tailwind of $0.06 to $0.08 and the impact of the share repurchase program announced and completed in the fourth quarter net of stock plan issuance to provide a $0.02  benefit. We expect the core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.5 to $0.08 on 2 months of additional impact from our most recent price increase, continued improvement in daily sales volumes and solid execution of our operating efficiency programs.

And non-tech industrial production turns down, acquisition activity dries up because these companies cash flow very well in downturns and most of the owners can afford to wait until of higher numbers that we've been for a year into the recovery. And as it's typical, we're starting to see some people who have postponed marketing their businesses to start to take a look. And so our pipeline is threefold, we're looking at a lot of deals and we're hopeful that we'll be able to make some of these acquisitions in the near future. And in fact, we just mentioned one in my script a very significant CO2, dry ice company in the middle part of the country that we've been trying to acquire for a long time and fill then a big gap in our dry ice production network."

But you have to be on SAP and you have to be stable on SAP before you can actually start to work on those pieces. And I'll take the price piece first. We've had extensive discussions with our implementation partner, Deloitte. They have done extensive work with other companies on using SAP's extensive price management and research tool with other companies in improving margins and particularly the more, the broader your product line and the broader the number of customers you have and the higher the number of smaller dollar invoices you deliver and the more decentralized you are in the way you manage pricing, the higher, the greater, the opportunity at the end of the rainbow. And they did a price study with us on real data from one of our companies. And sure enough, everything I just described is exactly what we found. And so, we were very conservative in that benefit for that piece that we identified, we were very conservative and what we came out with publicly based on -- compared to what the study indicated the potential range of benefits was. So we feel pretty good about that one. However, you can't really start using the tools and mining the data and taking the actions until you're on SAP and you're stable on SAP, which we've assumed is probably at least 6 months after you've been on it before you can even start working on it. So that's what that was. We feel pretty good about that. The other one, is that for 12 years, we've owned a Safety Telesales business. That has been growing at dramatically higher rates compounded there annually than the Safety business is growing in the United States. And it's a business that today is a couple $200 million and something million dollars of sales. We have about 185 people on the phones that manage 75,000 customers strictly through a phone relationship. And many of their customers are small. Customers that you can't afford to target or approach with a field sales person in a company car. Up until now, we've piloted for a number of years where we've taken some of these telesales people. We've sent them to welding school, we trained them to weld and we've turned them loose on some exiting Airgas customers, and the sales have grown significantly. We've turned them loose on some target customers and the sales have grown significantly. Using this channel as the vehicle to reach customers that we haven't been able to reach. So the data is very compelling. Now the problem has always been that they have always been on a separate computer platform than the rest of our distribution companies where on. So the ability to utilize their capabilities and utilize our hardgoods distribution centers and utilize our branches for making deliveries of gases or allowing customers to pick things up at stores, et cetera, we couldn't do it. We were system limited, because the platforms really didn't communicate with each other. So we're now in the process of ramping up that telesales group and I think, our first 20 new telesales people have just completed welding school. And come this summer, there will be a new channel, competing in the U.S. market for customers that have many cases, really never heard from a sales person before. And we expect it to be pretty exciting. And that's that story."

But we're also committed to growing by acquisitions and activity is picking up and we're committed to growing our dividend as our earnings increase. And we praise that 33% this year. So, I feel good about getting back to an outstanding shares number that we had in 2004, 2005 when we completed the share repurchase. And so every quarter is a fresh look."

And that was their separation plants, it was CO2 plants, it was cylinders, it was cylinder filling facilities that invested some major ones. And we're not back to peak sales yet, and we do have unused capacity in a lot of our asset classes. And so, I can't really, I don't know whether that's 7% higher sales or what, but I would imagine that somewhere in that range 7% to 10% growth in sales before we're really starting to stretch again. And my answer is not scientific, it's based on the fact that we're in the low 80s on our ASUs than we have capacity and some of our CO2 plants and a lot of our cylinder plants, the big ones that we built over the last 3 or 4 years have unused capacity. It's certain cylinder sizes, we're tight but in a lot of them we still have capacity -- additional cylinders. So that's just kind of a back-of-the-envelope gas 7% to 10% range before we would start ramping up growth assets. And after this year but we've already had a strong high single digit this year that estimated 6% to the numbers Peter's talking about would be kind of after that."

We started fiscal '12 in an impressive fashion delivering record adjusted earnings per share of $0.99, a 19% increase over last year on sales growth of 11%, but as volumes that are still well below prerecession levels. Although more than a year old, the economic recovery has been slow and the strength recently displayed in manufacturing intensive regions of the country and in our hardgoods business is indicative of the early stages of a recovery. First quarter sales or $1.2 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 13%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 2%.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%, a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year, despite a 60 basis point headwind from incremental SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense. Even with the burden of SAP implementation cost, the strength of our business and the modest economic expansion is evident. Our return on capital increased by 160 basis points over last year to 12.1%, as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales volumes recover.
Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April, we've acquired 4 businesses with nearly $70 million in aggregate annual revenues. Among them were Enterprises, a carbon dioxide and dry ice producer and distributor with 20 locations in the Midwest and 140 employees. And ABCO, an industrial gas and distributor with 12 locations and more than 100 employees in New England.
Our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year, reflecting the improved business climate. During the first quarter, we announced and completed an additional $300 million share repurchase program, which we expect will provide attractive earnings accretion for our shareholders. On the strength of our underlying business trend and our recently completed the share repurchases, we raised our earnings guidance for fiscal '12 the range of $3.90 to $4.90, representing a 17% to 21% growth over fiscal '11.
Our solid performance of this past quarter, as well as our future outlook stems from fundamental demand that seems reasonably balanced across the country. Manufacturing continues to be the strongest performing segment in our customer base, followed by medical, petrochemical and utilities. Consistent with recent trends, growth has been strongest in our Great Lakes in north central regions, both of which have a high degree of manufacturing intensity. Energy and manufacturing activity are also driving strong results in our Southwest, Midsouth and our Intermountain region.
Our Japanese automotive customers suffered headwinds last quarter from the supply chain disruptions caused by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. While some pressures still linger, we believe productions will return to a more normalized level soon. Other customer segment offering good near-term growth opportunities for us are food and beverage, analytical and life sciences and repair and maintenance.
Our Construction business focused primarily on energy and infrastructure construction, is now growing modestly in spite of lackluster conditions in the sector. Based on current customer comments and design activity in the industry, there could be room for strengthening Construction segment in calendar '12. In total, while the overall recovery has been slow, our July sales relative to June are trending slightly better than historic norms. We have further reason to expect that consistent growth trajectory as sales of welding machines and equipment in the first quarter posted the strongest growth we have seen since the downturn, well above the total hardgoods same-store sales growth rate. When customers tool up for production by purchasing machines, it bodes well for future consumption of gases and consumable hardgoods.
In addition, almost 150,000 jobs have been created by U.S. manufacturers in calendar '12, calendar '11. thus far, which is more than 1% growth in manufacturing payrolls, coupled with the encouraging signs at are welding equipment sales, we believe Manufacturing should continue on a path of moderate expansion.
Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy's focus on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. For the first quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 10% from the prior year driven by new accounts signing across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing Metal Fabrication, power and materials and oil, gas and chemicals customer basis. Strategic Accounts present us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product line and location, and represent more than 20% of sales.
I encourage you to review our Strategic Accounts slide in the appendix in detail after our call, but in the interest of time, I mean our Strategic Products slide, but in the interest of time, I'll provide you with an overview for the first quarter.
Strategic Products now make up 40% of our revenue, over 40%, and may increase 7% over the prior year and 5% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Each of our Strategic Products category really experienced good year-over-year growth this quarter. Safety was the strongest performer at 11%, and then bulk at 7% both of which reflected a favorable manufacturing environment. Sequentially, CO2 and Dry ice posted the strongest growth of our Strategic Products on normal seasonal improvement in the business. Our Radnor Private Label products were up 11% for the quarter the long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products.
I'd like to provide you with a brief update on the settling disruption issues we mentioned last quarter. Through a combination of alternative sourcing, product surcharges to cover disruption costs and substitute products, we were able to mitigate the impact of the disruption, which resulted in an approximately $0.01 hit to our first quarter earnings the settling remains in very tight supply, but we anticipate that the supply-chain pressure should continue to ease in the coming quarters.
I'd like to conclude my remarks, by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide  4. The commencement of our planned phase rollout whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession marks a major milestone in restructural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in 3 key areas, accelerated rate sales growth through expansion of telesales platform, price management and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate $75 billion to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis. And we expect to identify additional economic as the implementation progresses.
Most of these benefits are in our distribution growth, and we have approximately, I don't know what our sales in gas now about $0.5 billion in sales and our gas operations and a very few of these benefits relates to those operations. This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform, and we're excited about its game changing implications. Our hardgoods infrastructure business including Airgas and our national buying centers and distribution centers have been running successfully on SAP since going live in July 2010, a year ago. All fulfillment metrics are at or above pre-conversion levels. Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South successfully went live on SAP on April 4. All major processes have been functioning well, and there has been no system downtime. We are on schedule for the conversion of our second regional company, Airgas Great Lakes to go live at the beginning of September. Our implementation schedule accelerates thereafter, and we expect our distribution business, where we realized substantially all of the benefits we've announced thus far to be fully converted to SAP by summer 2012.
Based on our experience to date, we're confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we have detailed will be achieved, and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. We still expect fiscal '12 to be the heaviest net expense year related to the SAP implementation as the majority of our regional distribution companies will be converted to SAP during this fiscal year. In fiscal '12, SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense will likely be an $0.18 headwind over fiscal '11. However, as we complete the implementation by the end of calendar '12, the net impact of the fall-off of implementation costs and the accrual of benefits will provide an approximately $0.20 year-over-year EPS tailwind in fiscal 2013, reflecting only the beginning of what we expect will be significantly enhanced during earnings power in fiscal 2014 and beyond from our new SAP platform.
The conversion of the operating systems of our 12 regional distribution companies to a single platform, which will take place as part of the SAP implementation, enables consolidation of many administrative actions across the company. As we had announced in May, this is the ideal time of the evolution of Airgas to restructure our regional company support functions in the Ford division will support centers in order to better utilize our resources across regional boundaries. Charges associated with this restructuring includes severance, relocation and other transition costs, and we expect this restructuring to be completed in fiscal 2013. Our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery, and we are realizing the success of that strategy. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive, and there's tremendous opportunity for Airgas shareholders to benefit from the future value we can create through the execution of our business strategies. Our industry is still very fragmented, and we have built only the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offerings. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will real yield even greater value for the customer more than 1 million strong who make Airgas as their supplier of choice. Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. We are very well-positioned as the U.S. economy devise over the emergence of a stronger manufacturing base, and further opportunity beckons as spending to rebuild America's infrastructure begins to materialize. As I love to remind people, the best time at Airgas is now.
Bob, will now give you a financial review of the quarter and provide guidance for the next year."
24504,136706084,147704,"Airgas Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Airgas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide  5.Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 2% and total same-store sales growth of 9%. Comprise",1792,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide  5.
Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 2% and total same-store sales growth of 9%. Comprise that with 7% increase in gas and rent and a 13% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 4%, and price was up 5%. Sequentially, sales increased 6% from the fourth quarter on the same number of selling days with acquired sales accounting for 1% of that increase.
Sales of both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, slightly lower than last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and consistent with the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 54.4%, a decline of 50 basis points in the prior year, reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Excluding pretax charges of approximately $900,000 related to withdrawal of multiemployer pension plans, and approximately $13 million related to the previously announced business support center restructuring, as well as a nearly $7 million benefit from the lower previously estimated net cost related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt in fiscal 2011, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $145 million, up 11% from last year. Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of year-over-year headwinds from incremental and SAP costs of approximately $7 million.
Adjusting operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%, a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year, despite incremental SAP cost of 60 basis points. The margin expansion excluding the incremental SAP cost was 70 basis points, driven by strong operating leverage on organic sales growth.
Excluding $0.06 of special items, consisting of the previously announced business support center restructuring charge of $0.10, multiemployer pension withdrawal charges of $0.01 and a $0.05 benefit from lower than previously estimated net cost related to the unsolicited takeover, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a record $0.99, an increase of 19% from $0.83 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $0.99, includes a year-over-year increase of $0.05 in SAP implementation and depreciation costs, which were substantially offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. There were approximately 80.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 6% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially driven by the share repurchase programs that were completed in this quarter and the fourth quarter of last year.
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation was 12.1%, an improvement of 160 basis points over last year and 20 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income, as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platforms as sales volumes recover. Our working capital metrics including DSO and hardgood inventory turns held largely consistent with recent trends. for the first quarter, we generated strong free cash flow of $71 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $139 million. The decrease in free cash flow from prior year's $114 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support organic sales growth, as well as an increase in the first quarter payout of accrued annual incentive compensation.
As of June 30, we have completed the additional $300 million share repurchase program announced on May 5, 2011, repurchasing 4.46 million shares on the open market at an average price of $67.19. Our prior $300 million share repurchase program announced in February 2011 and completed in March, resulted in 4.78 million shares repurchased at an average price of $62.76.
Total debt increased approximately $500 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at June 30, reflecting $600 million spent on the share repurchase programs, and $112 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by net debt paydown of $212 million. Our fixed low debt ratio at the end of June was 51% fixed and our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.8% within our target range of 2% to 3%. On July 19, we extended the maturity of our $750 million revolving credit facility by almost 2 years from September 2014 to July of 2016, and reduced the borrowing rate from LIBOR plus 212 basis points to LIBOR plus 125 basis points.
We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range, while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx.
Turning now to Slide  6, we'll look at segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1 billion with same-store sales up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up 13% with pricing up 4% and volumes up 6%. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 3% with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 55.2%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 10 basis points from the fourth quarter. Gas and rent represented 59% of distribution sales in the first quarter down slightly from the prior year and consistent with the fourth quarter.
Operating income in the distribution segment increased 21% year-over-year to $133 million, and operating margin improved 110 basis points to 12.9%, driven by strong operating leverage on organic sales growth. As volumes continue to recover, we expect to sustain our trend of strong profit leverage and as we have significant capacity in our platform and infrastructure to support incremental volume growth. All Other Operations reflects our CO2, Dry ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and nitrous oxide businesses. Sales for All Other Operations were up 11% from the prior year with same-store sales up 7% as higher pricing and ammonia more than offset the effect of the prior year's outperformance in Refrigerants.
Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations segment increased by 27% from the fourth quarter, driven by normal seasonality in the CO2 and Dry ice businesses and the acquisition of Pain Enterprises in May. Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 160 basis points in the prior year, primarily driven by margin compression in the Ammonia business as pricing displayed its typical lag behind rising costs and due to the margin compression in the Refrigerant business as margins ran at more than normal levels after last year's market anomalies. Sequentially, the 250 basis points increase from the gross margin in the fourth quarter was primary attributable to the sales seasonal sales mix to CO2 and Dry ice. Operating income from All Other Operations was $20 million and operating margin of $13.9 million was down 400 basis points year-over-year, driven by the Ammonia and Refrigerants gross margin compression. Sequentially, the 630 basis point improvement in operating margin is attributable to the effect of seasonality on sales across most of the businesses and the All Other Operation segment. Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. Capital expenditures as a percent of sales increased 90 basis points to 6.7 in the first quarter. Cylinders and bulk tanks categories with the highest year-over-year growth in spending as improved gas and rent in same-store sales in demand for our core revenue generating assets. Construction and Process was also a contributor to the year-over-year increase reflecting the capital outlay for the construction of our new air reparation unit in Clarksville Tennessee. Slide 8 presents our fiscal 2012 quarter and updated full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.99 to $1.03, an increase of 19% to 24% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense $0.03 which is incremental on the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
For the full year, we are arranging our adjusted expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.05 per diluted share up 70% to 21% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.18 of which are incremental over last year. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high single digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.3% to 12.8%, including the dilutive impact of increased SAP cost. CapEx is expected to be around 6.5% of sales for the year. Our adjusted fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continued modest economic recovery and includes the benefit of the 2 recently completed share repurchase programs, which offsets the incremental year-over-year SAP costs.
Our guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges, which were $0.10 in the first quarter and related costs of $0.07 expected to be incurred over the balance of the year. As previously announced, these restructuring charges and related costs rise from the consolidation of accounting and certain administrative functions of 12 regional business dissolution companies into 4 business support centers. Our guidance also excludes any net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charges. It is noteworthy that with our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance, the range straddles the $4 mark. We are well within sight of our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 per share, and with continued modest economic improvement, will likely surpass that goal ahead of schedule even without the benefit of our recent share repurchases. Slide 9 presents a walk through the primary elements of our second quarter and full year guidance using first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.99 and fiscal 2011 adjusted EPS of $3.34, respectively as starting points.
Sequentially, we expect the normal seasonal effects of our Refrigerants and Rental Welder business to be a $0.03 headwind in the second quarter. We expect accretion from our second share repurchase program, net of stock plan issuances to be approximately $0.02, and we expect our core business to expand modestly 1% of 5%. For our full year, our underlying incremental SAP implementation cost of $0.14 and related depreciation of $0.04 remain unchanged. We expect an additional $0.11 of accretion from the share repurchases, primary driven by the completion of our second $300 million program in the quarter. bringing the total expected accretion from both share repurchase programs net of stock plan issuances to $0.19 in fiscal 2012.
We have raised our base business growth expectations modestly to 16% to 21% or $0.55 to $0.70 per share. I will now turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session."

We grew up in a packaged gases and many of our customers, we have all cylinder gas business and hardgoods business. But we want to historically competitive with bulk. And now, we have an opportunity to add that bulk and I'd say another reason is we have sales force out there that has been trained to spot both opportunities and we have another specialist who can go in and help them land the business.

You have liked filler metals which are like electrodes and welding wires and things like that. And then we have safety equipment and then you have personnel protection equipment on the welding side and then you also have torches and things like that. But then finally, you have what we call machines. And these machines are welding machines and cutting machines and some automation stuff like robotics and things like that. Now they tend to be the highest dollar but the lowest gross profit category within the hardgoods segment. But they tend to do very, very well on the early stages of a recovery because customers write new machines when they are gearing up for production. And then once they start with a higher production, the gases and the consumables like the filler metals and the tips and the torches and whatnot tend to follow. This quarter, we had the highest sales of machine since the recession hit, which would be indicative or which is indicative of the early stages of recovery in manufacturing. So we expect to see higher sales of gases and consumable hardgoods in the months to come as a result of the machine sales that have been strong all year, but they've been very strong in the last quarter. The customers are basically gearing up to produce more."

We are all very grateful for all of his efforts on behalf of Airgas shareholders, and we recognize his distinguished career with honor and warm memories. 
Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion. We started fiscal '12 in an impressive fashion, delivering record adjusted earnings per share of $0.99, a 19% increase over last year on sales growth of 11%, but had volumes that are still well below prerecession levels. Although more than a year old, the economic recovery has been slow, and the strength recently displayed in manufacturing-intensive regions of the country and in our hardgoods business is indicative of the early stages of our recovery. First quarter sales were $1.2 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 13%.  Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 2%.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%, a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year despite a 60 basis point headwind from incremental SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. Even with the burden of SAP implementation costs, the strength of our business and our modest economic expansion is evident. Our return on capital increased by 160 basis points over last year to 12.1% as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales volumes recover.
Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April, we've acquired 4 businesses with nearly $70 million in aggregate annual revenues. Among them were Pain Enterprises, a carbon dioxide and dry ice producer and distributor with 20 locations in the Midwest and 140 employees, and ABCO, an industrial gas and welding distributor with 12 locations and more than 100 employees in New England.
Our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year, reflecting the improved business climate. During the first quarter, we announced and completed an additional $300 million share repurchase program, which we expect will provide attractive earnings accretion for our shareholders. On the strength of underlying business trend and our recently completed share repurchases, we have raised our earnings guidance for fiscal '12 to a range of $3.90 to $4.05, representing 17% to 21% growth over fiscal '11.
Our solid performance this past quarter, as well as our future outlook, stems from fundamental demand that seems reasonably balanced across the country. Manufacturing continues to be the strongest performing segment in our customer base, followed by medical, petrochemical and utilities. Consistent with recent trends, growth has been strongest in our Great Lakes and North Central regions, both of which have a high degree of manufacturing intensity. Energy and manufacturing activity are also driving strong results in our Southwest, Midsouth and our Intermountain region.
Our Japanese automotive customers suffered headwinds last quarter from the supply chain disruptions caused by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. While some pressures still linger, we believe production will return to a more normalized level soon. Other customer segments offering good near-term growth opportunities for us are food and beverage, analytical and life sciences and repair and maintenance.
Our construction business, focused primarily on energy and infrastructure construction, is now growing modestly in spite of lackluster conditions in the sector. Based on current customer comments and design activity in the industry, there could be hope for a strengthening construction segment in calendar '12. 
In total, while the overall recovery has been slow, our July sales relative to June are trending slightly better than historic norms. We have further reason to expect the consistent growth trajectory as sales of welding machines and equipment in the first quarter posted the strongest growth we've seen since the downturn, well above the total hardgoods same-store sales growth rate. When customers tool up for production by purchasing machines, it bodes well for future consumption of gases and consumable hardgoods.
In addition, almost 150,000 jobs have been created by U.S. manufacturers in calendar '12 -- calendar '11 thus far, which is more than 1% growth in manufacturing payrolls. Coupled with the encouraging signs on our welding equipment sales, we believe manufacturing should continue on a path of moderate expansion.
Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. For the first quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 10% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fabrication, power and materials and oil, gas and chemicals customer basis. Strategic Accounts present us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and location and represent more than 20% of sales.
I encourage you to review our Strategic Accounts slide in the appendix in detail after our call, but in the interest of time -- I mean, our Strategic Products slide, but in the interest of time, I'll provide you with an overview for the first quarter.
Strategic Products now make up 40% of our revenue -- over 40%, and they increased 7% over the prior year and 5% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Each of our Strategic Products categories experienced good year-over-year growth this quarter. Safety was the strongest performer at 11%, and then bulk gas at 7%, both of which reflect a favorable manufacturing environment. Sequentially, CO2 and dry ice posted the strongest growth of our Strategic Products on normal seasonal improvement in the business. Our Radnor private label products were up 11% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products.
I'd like to provide you with a brief update on the acetylene disruption issues that we mentioned last quarter. Through a combination of alternative sourcing, product surcharges to cover disruption costs and substitute products, we were able to mitigate the impact of the disruption, which resulted in an approximately $0.01 hit to our first quarter earnings. Acetylene remains in very tight supply, but we anticipate that the supply chain pressure should continue to ease in the coming quarters.
I'd like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 4. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in 3 key areas, accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate $75 billion to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis, and we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses.
Most of these benefits are in our distribution growth, and we have approximately -- I don't know what our sales in gas ops now. $1 billion?"

This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform, and we're excited about its game-changing implications. Our hardgoods infrastructure business, including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and distribution centers, have been running successfully on SAP since going live in July 2010, a year ago. All fulfillment metrics are at or above pre-conversion levels. Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP on April 4. All major processes have been functioning well, and there has been no system downtime. We're on schedule for the conversion of our second regional company, Airgas Great Lakes, to go live at the beginning of September. Our implementation schedule accelerates thereafter, and we expect our distribution business, where we realized substantially all of the benefits we've announced thus far to be fully converted to SAP by summer 2012.
Based on our experience to date, we're confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we've detailed will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. We still expect fiscal '12 to be the heaviest net expense year related to the SAP implementation as the majority of our regional distribution companies will be converted to SAP during this fiscal year. In fiscal '12, SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense will likely be an $0.18 headwind over fiscal '11. However, as we complete the implementation by the end of calendar '12, the net impact of the fall-off of the implementation costs, and the accrual of benefits will provide an approximately $0.20 year-over-year EPS tailwind in fiscal 2013, reflecting only the beginning of what we expect will be significantly enhanced earnings power in fiscal 2014 and beyond from our new SAP platform.
The conversion of the operating systems of our 12 regional distribution companies to a single platform, which will take place as part of the SAP implementation, enables consolidation of many administrative functions across the company. As we announced in May, this is the ideal time of the evolution of Airgas to restructure our regional company support functions and the four divisional  business support centers in order to better utilize our resources across regional boundaries. Charges associated with this restructuring includes severance, relocation and other transition costs, and we expect this restructuring to be completed in fiscal 2013. Our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery, and we are realizing the success of that strategy. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive, and there's tremendous opportunity for Airgas shareholders to benefit from the future value we can create through the execution of our business strategies. Our industry is still very fragmented, and we have built the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offerings. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will yield even greater value for the customers, more than 1 million strong, who make Airgas their supplier of choice. 
Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. We are very well positioned as the U.S. economy revives with the emergence of a stronger manufacturing base, and further opportunity beckons if spending to rebuild America's infrastructure begins to materialize. As I love to remind people, the best time at Airgas is now.
Bob will now give you a financial review of the quarter and provide guidance for next year."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide  5.
Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 2% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised [ph] with a 7% increase in gas and rent and a 13% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 4%, and price was up 5%. Sequentially, sales increased 6% from the fourth quarter on the same number of selling days with acquired sales accounting for 1% of that increase.
Sales of both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, slightly lower than last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and consistent with the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 54.4%, a decline of 50 basis points in the prior year, reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Excluding pretax charges of approximately $900,000 related to withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans and approximately $13 million related to the previously announced business support center restructuring, as well as a nearly $7 million benefit from the lower-than-previously-estimated net cost related to Air Products's unsolicited takeover attempt in fiscal 2011, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $145 million, up 11% from last year. Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of the year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs of approximately $7 million.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%, a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year despite incremental SAP costs of 60 basis points. The margin expansion, excluding the incremental SAP cost, was 70 basis points, driven by strong operating leverage on organic sales growth.
Excluding $0.06 of special items consisting of the previously announced business support center restructuring charge of $0.10, multiemployer pension withdrawal charges of $0.01 and a $0.05 benefit from lower-than-previously-estimated net cost related to the unsolicited takeover, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a record $0.99, an increase of 19% from $0.83 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $0.99 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.05 in SAP implementation and depreciation costs, which were substantially offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. There were approximately 80.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 6% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially, driven by the share repurchase programs that were completed in this quarter and the fourth quarter of last year.
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.1%, an improvement of 160 basis points over last year and 20 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales volumes recover. Our working capital metrics, including DSO and hardgood inventory turns, held largely consistent with recent trends. For the first quarter, we generated strong free cash flow of $71 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $139 million. The decrease in free cash flow from prior year's $114 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support organic sales growth, as well as an increase in the first quarter payout of accrued annual incentive compensation.
As of June 30, we had completed the additional $300 million share repurchase program announced on May 5, 2011, repurchasing 4.46 million shares on the open market at an average price of $67.19. Our prior $300 million share repurchase program announced in February 2011 and completed in March resulted in 4.78 million shares repurchased at an average price of $62.76.
Total debt increased approximately $500 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at June 30, reflecting $600 million spent on the share repurchase programs and $112 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by net debt paydown of $212 million. Our fixed low debt ratio at the end of June was 51% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.8, within our target range of 2 to 3. On July 19, we extended the maturity of our $750 million revolving credit facility by almost 2 years from September 2014 to July of 2016 and reduced the borrowing rate from LIBOR plus 212 basis points to LIBOR plus 125 basis points.
We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx.
Turning now to Slide  6, we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1 billion with same-store sales up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up 13%, with pricing up 4% and volumes up 6%. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 3%, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 55.2%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 10 basis points from the fourth quarter. Gas and rent represented 59% of distribution sales in the first quarter, down slightly from the prior year and consistent with the fourth quarter.
Operating income in the distribution segment increased 21% year-over-year to $133 million, and operating margin improved 110 basis points to 12.9%, driven by strong operating leverage on organic sales growth. As volumes continue to recover, we expect to sustain our trend of strong profit leverage as we have significant capacity in our platform and infrastructure to support incremental volume growth. 
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide businesses. Sales for All Other Operations were up 11% from the prior year, with same-store sales up 7% as higher pricing in ammonia more than offset the effect of the prior year's out-performance in refrigerants.
Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations segment increased by 27% from the fourth quarter, driven by normal seasonality in the CO2 and dry ice businesses and the acquisition of Pain Enterprises in May. Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 160 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin compression in the ammonia business as pricing displayed its typical lag behind rising costs and due to margin compression in the refrigerant business as margins ran at more normal levels after last year's market anomalies. Sequentially, the 250 basis point increase in gross margin from the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to the seasonal sales mix shift to CO2 and dry ice. 
Operating income from All Other Operations was $20 million, and operating margin of $13.9 million was down 400 basis points year-over-year, driven by the ammonia and refrigerants gross margin compression. Sequentially, the 630 basis point improvement in operating margin is attributable to the effect of seasonality on sales across most of the businesses in the All Other Operations segment. 
Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. Capital expenditures as a percent of sales increased 90 basis points to 6.7 in the first quarter. Cylinders and bulk tanks are the asset categories with the highest year-over-year growth in spending as improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvement in demand for our core revenue-generating assets. Construction in process was also a contributor to the year-over-year increase, reflecting the capital outlay for the construction of our new air separation unit in Clarksville, Tennessee. 
Slide 8 presents our fiscal 2012 second quarter and updated full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.99 to $1.03, an increase of 19% to 24% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.03 of which is incremental over the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
For the full year, we are arranging our adjusted earnings expectations to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.05 per diluted share, up 17% to 21% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.18 of which are incremental over last year. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high single digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.3% to 12.8%, including the dilutive impact of increased SAP costs. CapEx is expected to be around 6.5% of sales for the year. Our adjusted fiscal -- our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continued modest economic recovery and includes the benefit of the 2 recently completed share repurchase programs, which offsets incremental year-over-year SAP costs.
Our guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges, which were $0.10 in the first quarter, and related costs of $0.07 expected to be incurred over the balance of the year. As previously announced, these restructuring charges and related costs rise from the consolidation of accounting and of certain administrative functions of 12 regional distribution companies into 4 business support centers. Our guidance also excludes any net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charges. It is noteworthy that with our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance, the range straddles the $4 mark. We are well within sight of our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 per share and, with continued modest economic improvement, will likely surpass that goal ahead of schedule even without the benefit of our recent share repurchases. 
Slide 9 presents a walk-through to primary elements of our second quarter and full year guidance using first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.99 and fiscal 2011 adjusted EPS of $3.34, respectively, as starting points.
Sequentially, we expect the normal seasonal effects of our refrigerants and rental welder business to be a $0.03 headwind in the second quarter. We expect accretion from our second share repurchase program, net of stock plan issuances, to be approximately $0.02, and we expect our core business to expand modestly 1% of 5%. For the full year, our underlying incremental SAP implementation cost of $0.14 and related depreciation of $0.04 remain unchanged. We expect an additional $0.11 of accretion from share repurchases, primarily driven by the completion of our second $300 million program in the first quarter, bringing the expected total accretion from both share repurchase programs, net of stock plan issuances, to $0.19 in fiscal 2012.
We have raised our base business growth expectations modestly to 16% to 21% or $0.55 to $0.70 per share. I'll now turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Before we begin our earnings discussion this morning, the Airgas family extends our sincere condolences and sympathies to the family and friends of Alan Miller, who passed away earlier this week. Alan was Co-Chairman and cofounder of Innisfree M&A, our proxy solicitor over the past 2 years. We are all very grateful for all of his efforts on behalf of Airgas shareholders, and we recognize his distinguished career with honor and warm memories. 
Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion. We started fiscal '12 in an impressive fashion, delivering record adjusted earnings per share of $0.99, a 19% increase over last year on sales growth of 11%, but had volumes that are still well below prerecession levels. Although more than a year old, the economic recovery has been slow, and the strength recently displayed in manufacturing-intensive regions of the country and in our hardgoods business is indicative of the early stages of our recovery. First quarter sales were $1.2 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 13%.  Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 2%.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%, a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year despite a 60 basis point headwind from incremental SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. Even with the burden of SAP implementation costs, the strength of our business and our modest economic expansion is evident. Our return on capital increased by 160 basis points over last year to 12.1% as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales volumes recover.
Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April, we've acquired 4 businesses with nearly $70 million in aggregate annual revenues. Among them were Pain Enterprises, a carbon dioxide and dry ice producer and distributor with 20 locations in the Midwest and 140 employees, and ABCO, an industrial gas and welding distributor with 12 locations and more than 100 employees in New England.
Our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year, reflecting the improved business climate. During the first quarter, we announced and completed an additional $300 million share repurchase program, which we expect will provide attractive earnings accretion for our shareholders. On the strength of underlying business trend and our recently completed share repurchases, we have raised our earnings guidance for fiscal '12 to a range of $3.90 to $4.05, representing 17% to 21% growth over fiscal '11.
Our solid performance this past quarter, as well as our future outlook, stems from fundamental demand that seems reasonably balanced across the country. Manufacturing continues to be the strongest performing segment in our customer base, followed by medical, petrochemical and utilities. Consistent with recent trends, growth has been strongest in our Great Lakes and North Central regions, both of which have a high degree of manufacturing intensity. Energy and manufacturing activity are also driving strong results in our Southwest, Midsouth and our Intermountain region.
Our Japanese automotive customers suffered headwinds last quarter from the supply chain disruptions caused by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. While some pressures still linger, we believe production will return to a more normalized level soon. Other customer segments offering good near-term growth opportunities for us are food and beverage, analytical and life sciences and repair and maintenance.
Our construction business, focused primarily on energy and infrastructure construction, is now growing modestly in spite of lackluster conditions in the sector. Based on current customer comments and design activity in the industry, there could be hope for a strengthening construction segment in calendar '12. 
In total, while the overall recovery has been slow, our July sales relative to June are trending slightly better than historic norms. We have further reason to expect the consistent growth trajectory as sales of welding machines and equipment in the first quarter posted the strongest growth we've seen since the downturn, well above the total hardgoods same-store sales growth rate. When customers tool up for production by purchasing machines, it bodes well for future consumption of gases and consumable hardgoods.
In addition, almost 150,000 jobs have been created by U.S. manufacturers in calendar '12 -- calendar '11 thus far, which is more than 1% growth in manufacturing payrolls. Coupled with the encouraging signs on our welding equipment sales, we believe manufacturing should continue on a path of moderate expansion.
Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. For the first quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 10% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fabrication, power and materials and oil, gas and chemicals customer basis. Strategic Accounts present us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and location and represent more than 20% of sales.
I encourage you to review our Strategic Accounts slide in the appendix in detail after our call, but in the interest of time -- I mean, our Strategic Products slide, but in the interest of time, I'll provide you with an overview for the first quarter.
Strategic Products now make up 40% of our revenue -- over 40%, and they increased 7% over the prior year and 5% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Each of our Strategic Products categories experienced good year-over-year growth this quarter. Safety was the strongest performer at 11%, and then bulk gas at 7%, both of which reflect a favorable manufacturing environment. Sequentially, CO2 and dry ice posted the strongest growth of our Strategic Products on normal seasonal improvement in the business. Our Radnor private label products were up 11% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products.
I'd like to provide you with a brief update on the acetylene disruption issues that we mentioned last quarter. Through a combination of alternative sourcing, product surcharges to cover disruption costs and substitute products, we were able to mitigate the impact of the disruption, which resulted in an approximately $0.01 hit to our first quarter earnings. Acetylene remains in very tight supply, but we anticipate that the supply chain pressure should continue to ease in the coming quarters.
I'd like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 4. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in 3 key areas, accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate $75 billion to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis, and we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses.
Most of these benefits are in our distribution growth, and we have approximately -- I don't know what our sales in gas ops now. $1 billion?"

This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform, and we're excited about its game-changing implications. Our hardgoods infrastructure business, including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and distribution centers, have been running successfully on SAP since going live in July 2010, a year ago. All fulfillment metrics are at or above pre-conversion levels. Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP on April 4. All major processes have been functioning well, and there has been no system downtime. We're on schedule for the conversion of our second regional company, Airgas Great Lakes, to go live at the beginning of September. Our implementation schedule accelerates thereafter, and we expect our distribution business, where we realized substantially all of the benefits we've announced thus far to be fully converted to SAP by summer 2012.
Based on our experience to date, we're confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we've detailed will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. We still expect fiscal '12 to be the heaviest net expense year related to the SAP implementation as the majority of our regional distribution companies will be converted to SAP during this fiscal year. In fiscal '12, SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense will likely be an $0.18 headwind over fiscal '11. However, as we complete the implementation by the end of calendar '12, the net impact of the fall-off of the implementation costs, and the accrual of benefits will provide an approximately $0.20 year-over-year EPS tailwind in fiscal 2013, reflecting only the beginning of what we expect will be significantly enhanced earnings power in fiscal 2014 and beyond from our new SAP platform.
The conversion of the operating systems of our 12 regional distribution companies to a single platform, which will take place as part of the SAP implementation, enables consolidation of many administrative functions across the company. As we announced in May, this is the ideal time of the evolution of Airgas to restructure our regional company support functions and the four divisional  business support centers in order to better utilize our resources across regional boundaries. Charges associated with this restructuring includes severance, relocation and other transition costs, and we expect this restructuring to be completed in fiscal 2013. Our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery, and we are realizing the success of that strategy. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive, and there's tremendous opportunity for Airgas shareholders to benefit from the future value we can create through the execution of our business strategies. Our industry is still very fragmented, and we have built the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offerings. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will yield even greater value for the customers, more than 1 million strong, who make Airgas their supplier of choice. 
Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. We are very well positioned as the U.S. economy revives with the emergence of a stronger manufacturing base, and further opportunity beckons if spending to rebuild America's infrastructure begins to materialize. As I love to remind people, the best time at Airgas is now.
Bob will now give you a financial review of the quarter and provide guidance for next year."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide  5.Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 2% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised",1788,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide  5.
Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 2% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of a 7% increase in gas and rent and a 13% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 4%, and price was up 5%. Sequentially, sales increased 6% from the fourth quarter on the same number of selling days with acquired sales accounting for 1% of that increase.
Sales of both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, slightly lower than last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and consistent with the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 54.4%, a decline of 50 basis points in the prior year, reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Excluding pretax charges of approximately $900,000 related to withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans and approximately $13 million related to the previously announced business support center restructuring, as well as a nearly $7 million benefit from the lower-than-previously-estimated net costs related to Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt in fiscal 2011, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $145 million, up 11% from last year. Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of the year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs of approximately $7 million.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%, a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year,  despite incremental SAP costs of 60 basis points. The margin expansion, excluding the incremental SAP cost, was 70 basis points, driven by strong operating leverage on organic sales growth.
Excluding $0.06 of special items consisting of the previously announced business support center restructuring charge of $0.10, multiemployer pension withdrawal charges of $0.01 and a $0.05 benefit from lower-than-previously-estimated net costs related to the unsolicited takeover, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a record $0.99, an increase of 19% from $0.83 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $0.99 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.05 in SAP implementation and depreciation costs, which were substantially offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. There were approximately 80.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 6% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially, driven by the share repurchase programs that were completed in this quarter and the fourth quarter of last year.
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.1%, an improvement of 160 basis points over last year and 20 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales volumes recover. Our working capital metrics, including DSO and hardgood inventory turns, held largely consistent with recent trends. For the first quarter, we generated strong free cash flow of $71 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $139 million. The decrease in free cash flow from prior year's $114 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support organic sales growth, as well as an increase in the first quarter payout of accrued annual incentive compensation.
As of June 30, we had completed the additional $300 million share repurchase program announced on May 5, 2011, repurchasing 4.46 million shares on the open market at an average price of $67.19. Our prior $300 million share repurchase program announced in February 2011 and completed in March resulted in 4.78 million shares repurchased at an average price of $62.76.
Total debt increased approximately $500 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at June 30, reflecting $600 million spent on the share repurchase programs and $112 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by net debt paydown of $212 million. Our fixed low debt ratio at the end of June was 51% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.8, within our target range of 2 to 3. On July 19, we extended the maturity of our $750 million revolving credit facility by almost 2 years from September 2014 to July of 2016 and reduced the borrowing rate from LIBOR plus 212 basis points to LIBOR plus 125 basis points.
We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx.
Turning now to Slide  6, we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1 billion with same-store sales up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up 13%, with pricing up 4% and volumes up 6%. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 3%, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 55.2%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 10 basis points from the fourth quarter. Gas and rent represented 59% of distribution sales in the first quarter, down slightly from the prior year and consistent with the fourth quarter.
Operating income in the distribution segment increased 21% year-over-year to $133 million, and operating margin improved 110 basis points to 12.9%, driven by strong operating leverage on organic sales growth. As volumes continue to recover, we expect to sustain our trend of strong profit leverage as we have significant capacity in our platform and infrastructure to support incremental volume growth. 
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide businesses. Sales for All Other Operations were up 11% from the prior year, with same-store sales up 7% as higher pricing in ammonia more than offset the effect of the prior year's out-performance in refrigerants.
Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations segment increased by 27% from the fourth quarter, driven by normal seasonality in the CO2 and dry ice businesses and the acquisition of Pain Enterprises in May. Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 160 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin compression in the ammonia business as pricing displayed its typical lag behind rising costs and due to margin compression in the refrigerant business as margins ran at more normal levels after last year's market anomalies. Sequentially, the 250 basis point increase in gross margin from the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to the seasonal sales mix shift to CO2 and dry ice. 
Operating income from All Other Operations was $20 million, and operating margin of $13.9 million was down 400 basis points year-over-year, driven by the ammonia and refrigerants gross margin compression. Sequentially, the 630 basis point improvement in operating margin is attributable to the effect of seasonality on sales across most of the businesses in the All Other Operations segment. 
Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. Capital expenditures as a percent of sales increased 90 basis points to 6.7 in the first quarter. Cylinders and bulk tanks are the asset categories with the highest year-over-year growth in spending as improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvement in demand for our core revenue-generating assets. Construction in process was also a contributor to the year-over-year increase, reflecting the capital outlay for the construction of our new air separation unit in Clarksville, Tennessee. 
Slide 8 presents our fiscal 2012 second quarter and updated full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.99 to $1.03, an increase of 19% to 24% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.03 of which is incremental over the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
For the full year, we are arranging our adjusted earnings expectations to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.05 per diluted share, up 17% to 21% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.18 of which are incremental over last year. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high single digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.3% to 12.8%, including the dilutive impact of increased SAP costs. CapEx is expected to be around 6.5% of sales for the year. Our adjusted fiscal -- our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continued modest economic recovery and includes the benefit of the 2 recently completed share repurchase programs, which offsets incremental year-over-year SAP costs.
Our guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges, which were $0.10 in the first quarter, and related costs of $0.07 expected to be incurred over the balance of the year. As previously announced, these restructuring charges and related costs arise from the consolidation of accounting and of certain administrative functions of 12 regional distribution companies into 4 business support centers. Our guidance also excludes any net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charges. It is noteworthy that with our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance, the range straddles the $4 mark. We are well within sight of our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 per share and, with continued modest economic improvement, will likely surpass that goal ahead of schedule even without the benefit of our recent share repurchases. 
Slide 9 presents a walk-through to primary elements of our second quarter and full year guidance using first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.99 and fiscal 2011 adjusted EPS of $3.34, respectively, as starting points.
Sequentially, we expect the normal seasonal effects of our refrigerants and rental welder business to be a $0.03 headwind in the second quarter. We expect accretion from our second share repurchase program, net of stock plan issuances, to be approximately $0.02, and we expect our core business to expand modestly 1% of 5%. For the full year, our underlying incremental SAP implementation cost of $0.14 and related depreciation of $0.04 remain unchanged. We expect an additional $0.11 of accretion from share repurchases, primarily driven by the completion of our second $300 million program in the first quarter, bringing the expected total accretion from both share repurchase programs, net of stock plan issuances, to $0.19 in fiscal 2012.
We have raised our base business growth expectations modestly to 16% to 21% or $0.55 to $0.70 per share. I'll now turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session."

Before we begin our earnings discussion this morning, the Airgas family extends our sincere condolences and sympathies to the family and friends of Alan Miller, who passed away earlier this week",1249,"Thanks, Jay. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Before we begin our earnings discussion this morning, the Airgas family extends our sincere condolences and sympathies to the family and friends of Alan Miller, who passed away earlier this week. Alan was Co-Chairman and cofounder of Innisfree M&A, our proxy solicitor over the past 2 years. We are all very grateful for all of his efforts on behalf of Airgas shareholders, and we recognize his distinguished career with honor and warm memories. 
Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion. We started fiscal '12 in an impressive fashion, delivering record adjusted earnings per share of $0.99, a 19% increase over last year on sales growth of 11%, but had volumes that are still well below prerecession levels. Although more than a year old, the economic recovery has been slow, and the strength recently displayed in manufacturing-intensive regions of the country and in our hardgoods business is indicative of the early stages of our recovery. First quarter sales were $1.2 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 13%.  Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 2%.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%, a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year despite a 60 basis point headwind from incremental SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. Even with the burden of SAP implementation costs, the strength of our business and our modest economic expansion is evident. Our return on capital increased by 160 basis points over last year to 12.1% as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales volumes recover.
Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April, we've acquired 4 businesses with nearly $70 million in aggregate annual revenues. Among them were Pain Enterprises, a carbon dioxide and dry ice producer and distributor with 20 locations in the Midwest and 140 employees, and ABCO, an industrial gas and welding distributor with 12 locations and more than 100 employees in New England.
Our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year, reflecting the improved business climate. During the first quarter, we announced and completed an additional $300 million share repurchase program, which we expect will provide attractive earnings accretion for our shareholders. On the strength of underlying business trend and our recently completed share repurchases, we have raised our earnings guidance for fiscal '12 to a range of $3.90 to $4.05, representing 17% to 21% growth over fiscal '11.
Our solid performance this past quarter, as well as our future outlook, stems from fundamental demand that seems reasonably balanced across the country. Manufacturing continues to be the strongest performing segment in our customer base, followed by medical, petrochemical and utilities. Consistent with recent trends, growth has been strongest in our Great Lakes and North Central regions, both of which have a high degree of manufacturing intensity. Energy and manufacturing activity are also driving strong results in our Southwest, Midsouth and our Intermountain region.
Our Japanese automotive customers suffered headwinds last quarter from the supply chain disruptions caused by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. While some pressures still linger, we believe production will return to a more normalized level soon. Other customer segments offering good near-term growth opportunities for us are food and beverage, analytical and life sciences and repair and maintenance.
Our construction business, focused primarily on energy and infrastructure construction, is now growing modestly in spite of lackluster conditions in the sector. Based on current customer comments and design activity in the industry, there could be hope for a strengthening construction segment in calendar '12. 
In total, while the overall recovery has been slow, our July sales relative to June are trending slightly better than historic norms. We have further reason to expect the consistent growth trajectory as sales of welding machines and equipment in the first quarter posted the strongest growth we've seen since the downturn, well above the total hardgoods same-store sales growth rate. When customers tool up for production by purchasing machines, it bodes well for future consumption of gases and consumable hardgoods.
In addition, almost 150,000 jobs have been created by U.S. manufacturers in calendar '12 -- calendar '11 thus far, which is more than 1% growth in manufacturing payrolls. Coupled with the encouraging signs on our welding equipment sales, we believe manufacturing should continue on a path of moderate expansion.
Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. For the first quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 10% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fabrication, power and materials and oil, gas and chemicals customer basis. Strategic Accounts present us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and location and represent more than 20% of sales.
I encourage you to review our Strategic Accounts slide in the appendix in detail after our call, but in the interest of time -- I mean, our Strategic Products slide, but in the interest of time, I'll provide you with an overview for the first quarter.
Strategic Products now make up 40% of our revenue -- over 40%, and they increased 7% over the prior year and 5% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Each of our Strategic Products categories experienced good year-over-year growth this quarter. Safety was the strongest performer at 11%, and then bulk gas at 7%, both of which reflect a favorable manufacturing environment. Sequentially, CO2 and dry ice posted the strongest growth of our Strategic Products on normal seasonal improvement in the business. Our Radnor private label products were up 11% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products.
I'd like to provide you with a brief update on the acetylene disruption issues that we mentioned last quarter. Through a combination of alternative sourcing, product surcharges to cover disruption costs and substitute products, we were able to mitigate the impact of the disruption, which resulted in an approximately $0.01 hit to our first quarter earnings. Acetylene remains in very tight supply, but we anticipate that the supply chain pressure should continue to ease in the coming quarters.
I'd like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 4. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in 3 key areas, accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate $75 billion to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis, and we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses.
Most of these benefits are in our distribution growth, and we have approximately -- I don't know what our sales in gas ops now. $1 billion?"

This system will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform, and we're excited about its game-changing implications. Our hardgoods infrastructure business, including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and distribution centers, have been running successfully on SAP since going live in July 2010, a year ago. All fulfillment metrics are at or above pre-conversion levels. Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP on April 4. All major processes have been functioning well, and there has been no system downtime. We're on schedule for the conversion of our second regional company, Airgas Great Lakes, to go live at the beginning of September. Our implementation schedule accelerates thereafter, and we expect our distribution business, where we realized substantially all of the benefits we've announced thus far to be fully converted to SAP by summer 2012.
Based on our experience to date, we're confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we've detailed will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. We still expect fiscal '12 to be the heaviest net expense year related to the SAP implementation as the majority of our regional distribution companies will be converted to SAP during this fiscal year. In fiscal '12, SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense will likely be an $0.18 headwind over fiscal '11. However, as we complete the implementation by the end of calendar '12, the net impact of the fall-off of the implementation costs, and the accrual of benefits will provide an approximately $0.20 year-over-year EPS tailwind in fiscal 2013, reflecting only the beginning of what we expect will be significantly enhanced earnings power in fiscal 2014 and beyond from our new SAP platform.
The conversion of the operating systems of our 12 regional distribution companies to a single platform, which will take place as part of the SAP implementation, enables consolidation of many administrative functions across the company. As we announced in May, this is the ideal time of the evolution of Airgas to restructure our regional company support functions and the four divisional  business support centers in order to better utilize our resources across regional boundaries. Charges associated with this restructuring includes severance, relocation and other transition costs, and we expect this restructuring to be completed in fiscal 2013. Our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery, and we are realizing the success of that strategy. Our leverage to economic expansion is very attractive, and there's tremendous opportunity for Airgas shareholders to benefit from the future value we can create through the execution of our business strategies. Our industry is still very fragmented, and we have built the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offerings. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will yield even greater value for the customers, more than 1 million strong, who make Airgas their supplier of choice. 
Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. We are very well positioned as the U.S. economy revives with the emergence of a stronger manufacturing base, and further opportunity beckons if spending to rebuild America's infrastructure begins to materialize. As I love to remind people, the best time at Airgas is now.
Bob will now give you a financial review of the quarter and provide guidance for next year."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide  5.Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 2% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised",1788,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide  5.
Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 2% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of a 7% increase in gas and rent and a 13% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 4%, and price was up 5%. Sequentially, sales increased 6% from the fourth quarter on the same number of selling days with acquired sales accounting for 1% of that increase.
Sales of both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, slightly lower than last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and consistent with the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 54.4%, a decline of 50 basis points in the prior year, reflecting the sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Excluding pretax charges of approximately $900,000 related to withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans and approximately $13 million related to the previously announced business support center restructuring, as well as a nearly $7 million benefit from the lower-than-previously-estimated net costs related to Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt in fiscal 2011, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $145 million, up 11% from last year. Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of the year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs of approximately $7 million.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%, a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year,  despite incremental SAP costs of 60 basis points. The margin expansion, excluding the incremental SAP cost, was 70 basis points, driven by strong operating leverage on organic sales growth.
Excluding $0.06 of special items consisting of the previously announced business support center restructuring charge of $0.10, multiemployer pension withdrawal charges of $0.01 and a $0.05 benefit from lower-than-previously-estimated net costs related to the unsolicited takeover, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a record $0.99, an increase of 19% from $0.83 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $0.99 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.05 in SAP implementation and depreciation costs, which were substantially offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. There were approximately 80.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 6% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially, driven by the share repurchase programs that were completed in this quarter and the fourth quarter of last year.
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.1%, an improvement of 160 basis points over last year and 20 basis points sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales volumes recover. Our working capital metrics, including DSO and hardgood inventory turns, held largely consistent with recent trends. For the first quarter, we generated strong free cash flow of $71 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $139 million. The decrease in free cash flow from prior year's $114 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support organic sales growth, as well as an increase in the first quarter payout of accrued annual incentive compensation.
As of June 30, we had completed the additional $300 million share repurchase program announced on May 5, 2011, repurchasing 4.46 million shares on the open market at an average price of $67.19. Our prior $300 million share repurchase program announced in February 2011 and completed in March resulted in 4.78 million shares repurchased at an average price of $62.76.
Total debt increased approximately $500 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at June 30, reflecting $600 million spent on the share repurchase programs and $112 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by net debt paydown of $212 million. Our fixed low debt ratio at the end of June was 51% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.8, within our target range of 2 to 3. On July 19, we extended the maturity of our $750 million revolving credit facility by almost 2 years from September 2014 to July of 2016 and reduced the borrowing rate from LIBOR plus 212 basis points to LIBOR plus 125 basis points.
We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx.
Turning now to Slide  6, we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1 billion with same-store sales up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up 13%, with pricing up 4% and volumes up 6%. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 3%, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 55.2%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 10 basis points from the fourth quarter. Gas and rent represented 59% of distribution sales in the first quarter, down slightly from the prior year and consistent with the fourth quarter.
Operating income in the distribution segment increased 21% year-over-year to $133 million, and operating margin improved 110 basis points to 12.9%, driven by strong operating leverage on organic sales growth. As volumes continue to recover, we expect to sustain our trend of strong profit leverage as we have significant capacity in our platform and infrastructure to support incremental volume growth. 
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide businesses. Sales for All Other Operations were up 11% from the prior year, with same-store sales up 7% as higher pricing in ammonia more than offset the effect of the prior year's out-performance in refrigerants.
Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations segment increased by 27% from the fourth quarter, driven by normal seasonality in the CO2 and dry ice businesses and the acquisition of Pain Enterprises in May. Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 160 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin compression in the ammonia business as pricing displayed its typical lag behind rising costs and due to margin compression in the refrigerant business as margins ran at more normal levels after last year's market anomalies. Sequentially, the 250 basis point increase in gross margin from the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to the seasonal sales mix shift to CO2 and dry ice. 
Operating income from All Other Operations was $20 million, and operating margin of $13.9 million was down 400 basis points year-over-year, driven by the ammonia and refrigerants gross margin compression. Sequentially, the 630 basis point improvement in operating margin is attributable to the effect of seasonality on sales across most of the businesses in the All Other Operations segment. 
Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. Capital expenditures as a percent of sales increased 90 basis points to 6.7 in the first quarter. Cylinders and bulk tanks are the asset categories with the highest year-over-year growth in spending as improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvement in demand for our core revenue-generating assets. Construction in process was also a contributor to the year-over-year increase, reflecting the capital outlay for the construction of our new air separation unit in Clarksville, Tennessee. 
Slide 8 presents our fiscal 2012 second quarter and updated full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.99 to $1.03, an increase of 19% to 24% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.03 of which is incremental over the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
For the full year, we are arranging our adjusted earnings expectations to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.05 per diluted share, up 17% to 21% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.18 of which are incremental over last year. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high single digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.3% to 12.8%, including the dilutive impact of increased SAP costs. CapEx is expected to be around 6.5% of sales for the year. Our adjusted fiscal -- our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continued modest economic recovery and includes the benefit of the 2 recently completed share repurchase programs, which offsets incremental year-over-year SAP costs.
Our guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges, which were $0.10 in the first quarter, and related costs of $0.07 expected to be incurred over the balance of the year. As previously announced, these restructuring charges and related costs arise from the consolidation of accounting and of certain administrative functions of 12 regional distribution companies into 4 business support centers. Our guidance also excludes any net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charges. It is noteworthy that with our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance, the range straddles the $4 mark. We are well within sight of our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 per share and, with continued modest economic improvement, will likely surpass that goal ahead of schedule even without the benefit of our recent share repurchases. 
Slide 9 presents a walk-through to primary elements of our second quarter and full year guidance using first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.99 and fiscal 2011 adjusted EPS of $3.34, respectively, as starting points.
Sequentially, we expect the normal seasonal effects of our refrigerants and rental welder business to be a $0.03 headwind in the second quarter. We expect accretion from our second share repurchase program, net of stock plan issuances, to be approximately $0.02, and we expect our core business to expand modestly 1% of 5%. For the full year, our underlying incremental SAP implementation cost of $0.14 and related depreciation of $0.04 remain unchanged. We expect an additional $0.11 of accretion from share repurchases, primarily driven by the completion of our second $300 million program in the first quarter, bringing the expected total accretion from both share repurchase programs, net of stock plan issuances, to $0.19 in fiscal 2012.
We have raised our base business growth expectations modestly to 16% to 21% or $0.55 to $0.70 per share. I'll now turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session."

Our 14,000 associates have once again delivered a record quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.30, a 24% increase over last year on sales growth of 12%. But at volumes, they are still below prerecession levels. 
We continue to see strengths in the manufacturing-intensive regions of the U.S. as evidenced by the strong performances of our Great Lakes, North Central and Mid-America regions. In addition to manufacturing customers, petrochemical and energy segments are also performing very well. Second quarter sales or $1.2 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 10%, gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 14%. 
Acquisitions contributed 2% of sales. The relative outperformance in our hardgoods business on the strength of sales to large manufacturing customers and the mix shift within hardgoods to welding and automation equipment had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and accounts for the majority of the gross margin compression we experienced this quarter. However, both dynamics are generally indicative of sustained activity levels and the manufacturing economy and future demand for industrial gases and welding consumables. 
Later in the quarter, we found ourselves slightly behind the curve on rising hardgoods product cost which also had a negative effect on our hardgoods gross margin for the quarter. In addition, we had to overcome supply-chain disruptions in a few gases, including helium, acetylene and argon. 
We will be initiating a pricing action in both gas and hardgoods in the coming days in order to get back in front of the cost curve. While strong hardgoods sales and a favorable pricing outlook are both called for optimism, given the global economic uncertainty that unfolded during the quarter, we are playing -- paying close attention to our business trends. As we have proven in the past, we can quickly adjust our cost structure if warranted. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points from the prior year to 12.2%, an impressive result considering it includes a 70 basis point impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense incurred during the quarter, as well as a very difficult comps on our other operations segment. Even with the burden of SAP implementation costs, the strength of our business in a period of modest economic growth is evident. Our return on capital increased by 140 basis points over last year to 12.3% as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform on rising sales volume. 
Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April. In April we have acquired 5 businesses with nearly $7 million in aggregate annual revenues. Among them were Pain Enterprises, our carbon dioxide and dry ice producer and distributor with 20 locations and more than 140 employees in the midwestern U.S. and at and industrial gas and welding distributor with 12 locations and more than 100 employees in New England. 
While our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year, some potential sellers are delayed decisions in the wake of market volatility. Our appetite for acquisitions remained strong, and we're still targeting a goal of up $150 million in acquired annual sales of this fiscal year. On the strength of our second quarter results and outlook for sustained volumes in the coming quarter, we raised our earnings guidance from for fiscal '12 to a range of $397 million to $407 million, representing 19% to 22% growth over fiscal '11. 
October sales are trending well, consistent with the favorable daily sales run rates we saw in September. 
Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on segment alignment, continues to gain momentum. In the second quarter, Strategic Account business was up 40% from the prior year driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fab, power and materials and oil gas and chemicals customer basis. New and existing strategic account customers drove particularly strong results in safety products and filler metals this quarter. Strategic Accounts present us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product line and locations, and represent more than 20% of our sales. 
I encourage you to review our Strategic Account in our product slides in the appendix in detail after our call, but in the interest of time, I'll provide you with an overview of the second quarter. 
Strategic Products, which combined to make up 40% of our revenue increased to 8% over the prior year at 4% sequentially from the first quarter. Each of our Strategic Products categories experienced good year-over-year growth this quarter, with particular strength in safety products sales driven by increased activity in Strategic Accounts. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 19% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunities for Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty with our customer base, the gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products. 
I'd now like to provide an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 4. We are progressing well through our planned phase rollout whereby our business units implement the new SAP system in succession. We now have nearly $1 billion in annual revenue and 2,600 active users running smoothly on SAP. And we believe implementation risks associated with the remaining business units is significantly diminished. 
Our hardgoods infrastructure businesses, including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and distribution centers have been running successfully on SAP since going live at July 2010. All fulfillment metrics are at or above pre-conversion levels. 
Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South successfully went live on SAP at the beginning of April. All major processes have been functioning well, and there has been no system downtime. Our implementation team did a tremendous job applying the lessons learned during the implementation of Airgas South to the training programs in preparation work for the conversion of our second regional company Airgas Great Lakes, which went live at the beginning of September and by all measures, exceeded our expectations. For example, the Great Lakes conversion did not result in any necessary programming modifications to the system, and the cylinder supply-chain challenges that we experienced in the Airgas South conversion were almost completely mitigated at Great Lakes. 
Our implementation schedule accelerates this quarter with the conversion of our third and fourth regional companies in November and December, and we expect our distribution business to be fully converted to SAP by the summer of 2012. 
These are the businesses where we expect to realize substantially all of the benefits we have announced thus far. We have quantified the economic benefits expected to be achieved in 3 key areas, accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis. In fact, pricing management and the telesales initiative are already underway at Airgas South with encouraging signs, and we have began the process to consolidate administrative functions across the country, which Bob will discuss shortly. 
On all 3 fronts, our progress, thus far, reinforces our confidence and the benefits estimates. These 3 areas do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion, however, and we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses. 
Now please turn to Slide 5. Based on our experience to date, we are confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we detailed will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will also ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. SAP implementation costs are still expected to be heaviest at fiscal '12 as we complete the conversions of our regional distribution companies over the next 12 months, resulting in net EPS dilution of $0.30 to $0.34 this year, and $0.10 to $0.15 in fiscal '13. As highlighted in blue, we expect the combination of lower implementation costs and the ramp-up of SAP related benefits to yield year-over-year earnings accretion of approximately $0.20 in fiscal '13, above and beyond our base business performance, and to add, between $0.50 to $0.65 year-over-year accretion in fiscal '14. 
We believe our SAP costs and benefits are largely independent of the macro economy. We expect to progress through our current implementation schedule regardless of the prevailing economic climate and the success of our benefits program should primarily a function of our interlock cetacean rather than that of an improving economy. Combine the benefits of our SAP implementation with our favorable business trends and Sharp operating focus, and Airgas shareholders benefit from superior attractive future prospects. 
Before I conclude my remarks today, I'd like to acknowledge one of our board members Thomas, Chairman and CEO of has announced his plans to retirement May 2012. We assumed the role on 2007, and since that time, Radnor increased its market Cap bite $1.3 billion, resulting in a total shareholder return of 63%. contribution for the Airgas Board of Directors has also been significant, and we look forward to the benefit of his continued leadership on our board in the future. 
So to summarize our results. We just completed an impressive quarter and we're on track for continued success. Business is strong. Of the incremental profitability of our sales growth wasn't as strong as we would like to compress gross margins, but the strong volumes we're seeing in hardgoods sales, compared together in welding equipment and automation bode well for future demand for welding consumables and industrial gases. In addition, the lower margin safety business and new Strategic Accounts will continue to open doors for future gas business. 
Large customers are leading the way in today's economy as the forces of consolidation are evident in not just our industry, but across all of our customer segments. While high-volume customers tend to dampen gross margins, they are the ones driving growth and they generally have a lower net cost to serve. Airgas is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
We've achieved strong revenue growth to a very challenging time in our phase SAP implementation. And while margins were squeezed in the back half of the quarter and rising product costs and some logistics expense from supply chain disruptions, we are in a position to recover with the pricing action in the near future. The economic recovery has been slow, but seems to be gaining momentum in the sectors we serve. Our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery, and we're realizing on the success of that strategy. We are delivering strong growth in operating income and earnings with attractive expansion and return on capital, while volumes are still below prerecession levels. Our industry is still very fragmented, and we built the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offerings. The benefits of our customers' history, culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop, and will yield even greater value for the customers more than $1 million Strong to make Airgas their supplier of choice. 
Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. As I love to remind people, the best time in Airgas is now. Bob will give you a financial review of the quarter and provide updated guidance for this year."

I'd like to start today by briefly reviewing the progress we are making on the first phase of our SAP-enabled administrative efficiencies. The conversion of operating systems of our 12 regional distribution companies to a single platform enables consolidation of many administration functions across the company. As we announced in May, this is the ideal time in the evolution of Airgas to restructure our regional company support functions into 4 divisional business support centers in order to better utilize our resources across regional boundaries. As of today, we have identified the financial leadership for each of the 4 divisions, as well as a physical location of each business support center and have began staffing of the centers, in accordance with our implementation schedule. 
The cost associated with this restructuring includes severance, relocations and other transition costs. We recorded the $0.10 charge in the first quarter of this year, and incurred negligible cost in the second quarter and expect $0.07 further cost over the balance of fiscal '12. The restructuring is planned to be completed in fiscal '13, at which point, it begins to yield benefits consistent with our estimates. 
Now to review our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 6. Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 2% and total same-store growth of 10%. Comprised of a 7% increase in gas and rent, and a 14% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 6% and price was up 4%. Sequentially, sales increased 2% from the first quarter on the same number of selling days with acquired sales accounting for 1% of that increase. Sales of both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially. 
Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and slightly below the first quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.5%, a decline of 160 basis points in the prior year, reflecting continued acceleration and outperformance of hardgoods sales, a mix shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment continued sales mix shift in sales to large customers that generally carry lower margins and a lower net cost to serve, and as Peter mentioned, we also got behind the cost curve on some recent vendor price increases. Despite the pressure on gross margin, we achieved adjusted operating margin of 12.2% for the quarter, which included 70 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. 
Excluding a $0.02 asset impairment charge related to one of our liquid CO2 plants, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a record $1.03, an increase of 24% from $0.83 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $1.30 includes the year-over-year increase of $0.02 in SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were more than offset by that accretion from our share repurchase program. There were approximately 77.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 10% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, driven by the share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. 
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation was 12.3%, an improvement of 140 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with our operating income as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales, volumes continue to recover. 
Our working capital metrics including DSO and hardgoods inventory turns held largely consistent with recent trends. Year-to-date adjusted cash from operations was $256 million, and free cash flow was $106 million. The decrease in free cash flow from prior year's $188 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support sales growth. 
Total debt increased approximately $535 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at September 30, reflecting $600 million spent on share repurchase programs and $108 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by debt paydown of $173 million. Our fixed low debt ratio at the end of September was 51% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7% within our target range of 2% to 3%. 
In September, we received A2 and B2 ratings for our new commercial paper programs from S&P and Moody's, and recently began to utilize this program to reduce borrowing -- to reduce the borrowings under our revolving line of credit. The all-in rates on our commercial paper program is roughly LIBOR plus 50 basis points, which is 75 basis points below our revolver costs. We are well-positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range, while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and continuing to invest in growth CapEx. 
Now turning to Slide 7, we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been exclusive from consolidated adjusted operating results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion, with same-store sales up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up 15% with price up 4% and volumes up 6%. Hardgoods volume growth accelerated this quarter to 11% year-over-year versus 9% year-over-year growth in the first quarter. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 2%, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 54%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the prior year and 120 basis points sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by the sales mix shift the hardgoods, and within hardgoods to lower margin, welding and automation equipment as well as a mix shift towards larger customers. Gas and rent represented 51.8% of distribution sales in the second quarter, down from 59.96% in the prior year and 58.7% in the first quarter. Hardgoods growth outpacing GAAP gross is typical in the early stages of a recovery. Operating income in the distribution segment increased 18% year-over-year to $131 million. And operating margin improved 70 basis points to 12.5%, driven by strong operating leverage on our organic sales growth. All other operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia, and nitrous oxide businesses. Sales for all other operations were up 16% from the prior year with same-store sales up 7%. The same-store sales increase was driven by a significant increase in ammonia sales on both the volume and price basis. Sequentially, sales in other operations increased by 2%. 
Gross margin for all other operations was down 290 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin compression in the ammonia business, which had experienced significant and frequent cost increases over the past several quarters and our price increases continue to lag. We have additional pricing actions planned for the third quarter to address this erosion. We have also experienced margin compression in refrigerants as margins ran at more normal levels after last year's market anomalies. Both ammonia and refrigerants businesses had strong performances in the first half of the prior year and the comps for these businesses will ease of the back half of the current fiscal year. 
Sequentially, 50 basis point increase in gross margin from the first quarter was primarily attributable to seasonal sales mix shift to CO2 and dry ice, away from lower margin refrigerants. Operating income for all other operations was $19 million, and operating margin of 13.2% was down 430 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by the ammonia and refrigerants gross margin compression. 
Sequentially, the 70 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable seasonality in the refrigerants business. 
Please turn to Slide 8, capital expenditures. year-to-date, our CapEx, as a percent of sales, was 7.1% was in the second quarter. Construction and process was the asset categories with the highest year-over-year growth in spending, driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville Tennessee and expansion of our hardgoods distribution center in data at Georgia and projects to expand or consolidate plants and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. 
The cylinders in both tank categories were also a contributor to the year-over-year increase as improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue generating assets. 
Rent to welders also increased by $8 million due to the improvement in our Red-D-Arc business. 
Slide 9 presents our fiscal 2012 third quarter and full year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect the same-store sales growth in the high single digits with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.95 to $0.98. It's an increase of 90% prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.06 of which is incremental over the prior year. For the full year, we are raising our adjusted earnings expectations to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.07 per diluted share, up 19% to 22% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, 18 of which are incremental over last year. The previous announced range was $3.90 to $4.05. 
We expect the same-store sales growth to land in the high single digits for the full fiscal year, and adjusted operating margin could be in the range of 12.3% to 12.5%, including the dilutive impact of the increased SAP costs. CapEx is expected to be around 7% of sales for the year. Our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance includes the assumption for future pricing actions and assumes continued modest economic recovery in the high end while the low end allows for some moderation. The guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges which I mentioned earlier, and also excludes the asset impairment charge, the net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multiplayer in pension plan withdrawal charges. 
Slide 10 presents a walk through the primary elements of our third quarter guidance using the second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.03 as the starting point. We have also included in this slide, a walk through the primary elements of the resulting fourth quarter guidance implied by our third quarter and updated full year guidance using our third quarter guidance range as a starting point. Sequentially, the third quarter includes a headwind between $0.05 to $0.06 due to 2 fewer selling days and the impact of holidays in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. In addition, the third quarter had a headwind of between $0.03 and $0.05 due to the seasonality of our CO2, dry ice and refrigerants businesses, which typically slow during the cooler much of the year, partially offset by higher sales in our Red-D-Arc welder business ready arc growth or business due to the fall turnaround season. We also expect $0.01 of sequential headwind from higher SAP implementation cost in the third quarter as our next to regional dissertation companies are scheduled to be converted during the third quarter. We expect the core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.04 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and solid execution on our operating efficiency programs. In the fourth quarter, the addition of 2 selling days and the loss of the negative third quarter impact to the holidays should provide $0.05 to $0.06 benefit to EPS. The seasonal nature of our CO2, dry ice and Red-D-Arc business will continue to be a headwind and the ongoing conversion of regional distribution companies to SAP during the fourth quarter is expected to be a modest sequential headwind. We expect the core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.02 to $0.05 on continued modest improvement on the manufacturing economy and pricing gains. I'll now turn it back to Jay to begin the question-and-answer session."

But overall, we absolutely didn't expect to get back to the levels that we are at and ahead. We definitely had margin compression. And as I mentioned, particularly, in the ammonia business and that is a commodity driven business that has had a very significant and very frequent price increases, and we are working hard to stay up with them. But it keeps going up, and we keep lagging slightly. So we have a game plan in place to address that, and as we had mentioned have very difficult comps related to that visitor for 2 years since last year. So we think we're on the uptick."

But that was primarily the result of some very tough comps that we had in all of our strategic products but especially bulk. We've always said that where we have a good bulk supply, where we have a wonderful opportunity to expand our business, because we grew up in the packaged gas business and generally had all the gas business, except the bulk, at many of our customers.

I mean, the run-off the ammonia prices was just unprecedented and that is a volatile commodity to begin with. And we've been raising prices, but we haven't been raising prices fast enough. And so we're accelerating the process now. If you recall, that 1.5 years ago, when we were on the other side of that, we we're putting money in that business. And unfortunately, that's the nature of the beast. And even though it's less commoditized and there's much higher service element to the business in our level which is less than truckload quantities, it is very hard to keep up with the price increases on a wicked commodity cycle like that. On the hardgoods side, I think -- first of all, we are going to correct it and we're going to correct it right away in terms of the hardgoods margin. And we're confident that we can correct it. Secondly, we're looking very hard at our process at where we input pricing for our Strategic Accounts program, because clearly that was part of the reason for the compression. And then we have -- there are other issues when you implement SAP. For instance, Airgas South didn't have their last price increase which was a March price increase for us until September 1. So only one quarter, that price increase was in these results. And that's because we have to lock down the data, and we didn't want to be going through all the machinations of a price increase while we were in that pre-conversion and post-conversion stages. And then other conversions like Great Lakes, we had to lock down the data 30 days before and 30 days after. So if you take that Strategic Accounts center, and probably, we dropped the ball a little bit there and some of the disruptions caused by SAP, I think it explains that portion of the margin compression that relates to execution. But that's a small portion of the overall. The overall had to do with mix within the hardgoods segment. And the silver lining is when you sell that heavy equipment and the automation equipment, it inevitably leads to sales of gases and consumables with much higher margins."

They are starting to come to life after the credit crunch. If I have to compare it to 2008, our business stayed strong very late in the game. But our industrial and manufacturing, the whole -- the industrial business, that manufactures, energy companies and things like that really peaked into 2006. And we had a pretty nice rising environment in terms of volume. But we had pretty nice pricing environment there for the next 18 months. Here, we're seeing sort of the opposite. That this economy was very slow to recover, and it's still past steady as she goes, we're still not back to peak. Pricing has gotten better as the economy has marched on here. But it's a big customer recovery. I think it's partially because capacity utilization is still not back to the peak. So our customers aren't outsourcing. When they get the full capacity, they start outsourcing and the smaller customers tend to do better. So we're seeing a real volume growth situation here that we didn't see in 2008. And I would say that is the biggest difference. I don't know what is going to happen in the economy. We have sales in October have been very strong.

And in fact, we just approved the first sort of significant fleet buy for Red-D-Arc for sometime it but that is basically on the strength of outages and the bottlenecking and things like that. And I think we have taken some share in construction because so many of these construction companies find our strategic account offering to be of value being able to deal with one customer anywhere in the country and get the equipment they need when they need it and where they need it. But it's mostly outages, and they're talking about big projects in 2012. Now specifically, we just had a construction review, there were 4 or 5 hours construction companies who have wound down jobs, 2 or 3 jobs this year and they've actually identified new jobs for us that we'll be supplying that start up in early '12. But that's only a few companies and it is anecdotal. I think generally, people are thinking that maybe even the 12 before we have the big projects breaking ground again."

But at volumes, they are still",1951,"Thanks, Jay. Good morning. Please start by turning to Slide 2. 
Our 14,000 associates have once again delivered a record quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, a 24% increase over last year on sales growth of 12%. But at volumes, they are still below prerecession levels. 
We continue to see strengths in the manufacturing-intensive regions of the U.S. as evidenced by the strong performances of our Great Lakes, North Central and Mid-America regions. In addition to Manufacturing customers, Petrochemical and Energy segments are also performing very well. Second quarter sales were $1.2 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 10%, gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 14%. 
Acquisitions contributed 2% of sales. The relative out-performance in our hardgoods business on the strength of sales to large manufacturing customers and the mix shift within hardgoods to welding and automation equipment had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and account for the majority of the gross margin compression we experienced this quarter. However, both dynamics are generally indicative of sustained activity levels in the manufacturing economy and future demand for industrial gases and welding consumables. 
Later in the quarter, we found ourselves slightly behind the curve on rising hardgoods product cost which also had a dilutive effect on our hardgoods gross margin for the quarter. In addition, we had to overcome supply-chain disruptions in a few gases, including helium, acetylene and argon. 
We will be initiating a pricing action in both gas and hardgoods in the coming days in order to get back in front of the cost curve. While strong hardgoods sales and a favorable pricing outlook are both called for optimism, given the global or economic uncertainty that unfolded during that quarter, we are playing -- we are paying close attention to our business trends. As we have proven in the past, we can quickly adjust our cost structure if warranted. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points from the prior year to 12.2%, an impressive result considering it includes a 70 basis point impact from SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense incurred during the quarter, as well as a very difficult comps on our other operations segment. Even with the burden of SAP implementation cost, the strength of our business in a period of modest economic growth is evident. Our return on capital increased by 140 basis points over last year to 12.3% as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform on rising sales volumes. 
Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April. In April we have acquired 5 businesses with nearly $70 million in aggregate annual revenues. Among them were Pain Enterprises, our carbon dioxide and dry ice producer and distributor with 20 locations and more than 140 employees in the midwestern U.S. and ABCO an industrial gas and welding distributor with 12 locations and more than 100 employees in New England. 
While our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year, some potential sellers are delaying decisions in the wake of market volatility. Our appetite for acquisitions remained strong, and we're still targeting a goal of $150 million in acquired annual sales for this fiscal year. On the strength of our second quarter results and outlook for sustained volumes in the coming quarter, we have raised our earnings guidance from -- for fiscal '12 to a range of $397 million to $407 million, representing 19% to 22% growth over fiscal '11. 
October sales are trending well, consistent with the favorable daily sales run rate we saw in September. 
Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on segment alignment, continues to gain momentum. In the second quarter, Strategic Account business was up 40% from the prior year driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fab, power and materials and oil gas and chemicals customer basis. New and existing strategic account customers drove particularly strong results in safety products and filler metals this quarter. Strategic Accounts present us with a tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines and locations, and represent more than 20% of our sales. 
I encourage you to review our Strategic Account in our product slide in the Appendix in detail after our call, but in the interest of time, I'll provide you with an overview of the second quarter. 
Strategic Products, which combined to make up 40% of our revenue increased to 8% over the prior year at 4% sequentially from the first quarter. Each of our Strategic Product categories experienced good year-over-year growth this quarter, with particular strength in safety products sales driven by increased activity in Strategic Accounts. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 19% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty with our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products. 
I'd now like to provide you an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 4. We are progressing well through our planned phase  rollout whereby our business units implement the new SAP system in succession. We now have nearly $1 billion in annual revenue and 2,600 active users running smoothly on SAP. And we believe implementation risks associated with the remaining business units is significantly diminished. 
Our hardgoods infrastructure businesses, including Airgas Safety and our national buying centers and distribution centers have been running successfully on SAP since going live at July 2010. All fulfillment metrics are at or above pre-conversion levels. 
Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South successfully went live on SAP at the beginning of April. All major processes have been functioning well, and there has been no system downtime. Our implementation team did a tremendous job applying the lessons learned during the implementation of Airgas South to the training programs in preparation work for the conversion of our second regional company Airgas Great Lakes, which went live at the beginning of September and by all measures, exceeded our expectations. For example, the Great Lakes conversion did not result in any necessary programming modifications to the system, and the cylinder supply-chain challenges that we experienced in the Airgas South conversion were almost completely mitigated at Great Lakes. 
Our implementation schedule accelerates this quarter with the conversion of our third and fourth regional companies in November and December, and we expect our distribution business to be fully converted to SAP by the summer of 2012. 
These are the businesses where we expect to realize substantially all of the benefits we have announced thus far. We have quantified the economic benefits expected to be achieved in 3 key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform; price management; and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis. In fact, pricing management and the telesales initiative are already underway at Airgas South with encouraging signs, and we have began the process to consolidate administrative functions across the country, which Bob will discuss shortly. 
On all 3 fronts, our progress, thus far, reinforces our confidence in the benefits estimates. These 3 areas do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion, however, and we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses. 
Now please turn it to Slide 5. Based on our experience to date, we are confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we detailed will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. SAP implementation costs are still expected to be heaviest in fiscal '12 as we complete the conversions of our regional distribution companies over the next 12 months, resulting in net EPS dilution of $0.30 to $0.34 this year, and $0.10 to $0.15 in fiscal '13. As highlighted in blue, we expect the combination of a lower implementation cost and the ramp-up of SAP related benefits to yield year-over-year earnings accretion of approximately $0.20 in fiscal '13, above and beyond our base business performance, and to add, between $0.50 to $0.65 year-over-year accretion in fiscal '14. 
We believe our SAP costs and benefits are largely independent of the macro economy. We expect to progress through our current implementation schedule regardless of the prevailing economic climate and the success of our benefits programs should primarily be a function of our internal execution rather than that of an improving economy. Combine the benefits of our SAP implementation with our favorable business trends and sharp operating focus, an Airgas shareholder's benefit from superior attractive future prospects. 
Before I conclude my remarks today, I'd like to acknowledge one of our board members Lee Thomas, Chairman and CEO of Rayonier has announced his plan of retirement from Rayonier in May of 2012. Lee assumed the role on 2007, and since that time, Rayonier increased its market Cap by $1.3 billion, resulting in a total shareholder return of 63%. Lee's many contributions to the Airgas Board of Directors have also been significant, and we look forward to the benefit of his continued leadership on our board in the future. 
So to summarize our results. We've just completed an impressive quarter and we're on track for continued success. Business is strong. The incremental profitability of our sales growth wasn't as strong as we'd like to compress gross margins, but the strong volumes we're seeing in hardgoods sales, particularly in welding equipment and automation bode well for future demand for welding consumables and industrial gases. In addition, the lower margin safety business and new Strategic Accounts will continue to open doors for future gas business. 
Large customers are leading the way in today's economy as the forces of consolidation are evident in not just our industry, but across all of our customer segments. While high-volume customers tend to dampen gross margin, they're the ones driving growth and they generally have a lower net cost to serve. Airgas is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
We've achieved strong revenue growth through a very challenging time in our phase SAP implementation. And while margins were squeezed in the back half of the quarter and rising product costs and some logistics expense from supply chain disruptions, we are in a position to recover with the pricing action in the near future. The economic recovery has been slow, but seems to be gaining momentum in the sectors we serve. Our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery, and we're realizing on the success of that strategy. We are delivering strong growth in operating income and earnings with attractive expansion and return on capital, while volumes are still below prerecession levels. Our industry is still very fragmented, and we built the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offering. The benefits of our customers' history, culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop, and will yield even greater value for the customers more than $1 million strong to make Airgas their supplier of choice. 
Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. As I love to remind people, the best time in Airgas is now. Bob will give you a financial review of the quarter and provide updated guidance for this year."
24504,140986664,179584,"Airgas Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Airgas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by briefly reviewing the progress we are making on the first phase of our SAP-enabled administrative efficiencies. The conversion of operating systems of our 12 regional distribution co",1973,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by briefly reviewing the progress we are making on the first phase of our SAP-enabled administrative efficiencies. The conversion of operating systems of our 12 regional distribution companies to a single platform enables consolidation of many administration functions across the company. As we announced in May, this is the ideal time in the evolution of Airgas to restructure our regional company support functions into a 4-divisional business support centers in order to better utilize our resources across regional boundaries. As of today, we have identified the financial leadership for each of the 4 divisions, as well as a physical location of each business support center and have began staffing of the centers, in accordance with our implementation schedule. 
The costs associated with this restructuring include severance, relocation and other transition costs. We recorded a $0.10 charge in the first quarter of this year, and incurred negligible cost in the second quarter and expect $0.07 of further cost over the balance of fiscal '12. The restructuring is planned to be completed in fiscal '13, at which point, it begins to yield benefits consistent with our estimates. 
Now to review our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 6. Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 2% and total same-store growth of 10%. Comprised of a 7% increase in gas and rent, and a 14% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 6% and price was up 4%. Sequentially, sales increased 2% from the first quarter on the same number of selling days with acquired sales accounting for 1% of that increase. Sales of both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially. 
Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and slightly below the first quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 53.5%, decline of 160 basis points in the prior year, reflecting continued acceleration and out-performance of hardgoods sales, a mix shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment. Continued sales mix shift to sales to large customers that generally carry lower margins and a lower net cost to serve. And as Peter mentioned, we also got behind the cost curve on some recent vendor price increases. Despite the pressure on gross margins, we achieved adjusted operating margin of 12.2% for the quarter, which included 70 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. 
Excluding a $0.02 asset impairment charge related to one of our liquid CO2 plants, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a record $1.03, an increase of 24% from $0.83 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $1.03 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.02 in SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were more than offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. There were approximately 77.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 10% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, driven by the share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. 
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation was 12.3%, an improvement of 140 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with our operating income as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales, volumes continue to recover. 
Our working capital metrics including DSO and hardgoods inventory turns held largely consistent with recent trends. Year-to-date adjusted cash from operations was $256 million, and free cash flow was $106 million. The decrease in free cash flow from prior year's $188 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support sales growth. 
Total debt increased approximately $535 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at September 30, reflecting $600 million spent on share repurchase programs and $108 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by debt pay down of $173 million. Our fixed low debt ratio at the end of September was 51% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7% within our target range of 2% to 3%. 
In September, we received A2 and B2 ratings for our new commercial paper program from S&P and Moody's, and recently began to utilize this program to reduce borrowing -- to reduce the borrowings under our revolving line of credit. The all-in rates on our commercial paper program is roughly LIBOR plus 50 basis points, which is 75 basis points below our revolver cost. We are well-positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range, while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and continuing to invest in growth CapEx. 
Now turning to Slide 7, we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion, with same-store sales up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up 15% with price up 4% and volumes up 6%. Hardgoods volume growth accelerated this quarter to 11% year-over-year versus 9% year-over-year growth in the first quarter. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 2%, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 54%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the prior year and 120 basis points sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by the sales mix shift to hardgoods, and within hardgoods to lower-margin welding and automation equipment as well as a mix shift towards larger customers. 
Gas and rent represented 51.8% of distribution sales in the second quarter, down from 59.6% in the prior year and 58.7% in the first quarter. Hardgoods growth outpacing gas growth is typical in the early stages of a recovery. Operating income in the distribution segment increased 18% year-over-year to $131 million. And operating margin improved 70 basis points to 12.5%, driven by strong operating leverage on our organic sales growth. All other operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia, and Nitrous Oxide businesses. Sales for all other operations were up 16% from the prior year with same-store sales up 7%. The same-store sales increase was driven by a significant increase in ammonia sales on both the volume and price basis. Sequentially, sales in all other operations increased by 2%. 
Gross margin for all other operations was down 290 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin compression in the Ammonia business, which has experienced significant and frequent cost increases over the past several quarters and our price increases continue to lag. We have additional pricing actions planned for our third quarter to address this erosion. We have also experienced margin compression in Refrigerants as margins ran at more normal levels after last year's market anomalies. Both Ammonia and Refrigerants businesses had strong performances in the first half of the prior year and the comps for these businesses will ease in the back half of the current fiscal year. 
Sequentially, 50 basis point increase in gross margin from the first quarter was primarily attributable to a seasonal sales mix shift to CO2 and Dry Ice, away from lower-margin Refrigerants. Operating income for all other operations was $19 million, and operating margin of 13.2% was down 430 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by the Ammonia and Refrigerants gross margin compression. 
Sequentially, the 70 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the effect of seasonality in the Refrigerants business. 
Please turn to Slide 8, Capital Expenditures. Year-to-date, our CapEx, as a percent of sales, was 7.1% in the second quarter. Construction and process was the asset category with the highest year-over-year growth in spending, driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee and expansion of our hardgoods distribution center in Deloitte, Georgia and projects to expand or consolidate plants and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. 
The cylinders in both tank categories were also a contributor to the year-over-year increase as improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue generating assets. 
Rent to welders also increased by $8 million due to the improvement in our Red-D-Arc business. 
Slide 9 presents our fiscal 2012 third quarter and full year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high-single digits with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.95 to $0.98. It's an increase of 19% to 23% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.06 of which is incremental over the prior year. For the full year, we are raising our adjusted earnings expectations to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.07 per diluted share, up 19% to 22% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense, 18 of which are incremental over last year. The previous announced range was $3.90 to $4.05. 
We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high-single digits for the full fiscal year, and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.3% to 12.5%, including the dilutive impact of the increased SAP cost. CapEx is expected to be around 7% of sales for the year. Our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance includes the assumption for future pricing actions and assumes continued modest economic recovery in the high end while the low end allows for some moderation. The guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges which I mentioned earlier, and also excludes the impact of the asset impairment charge, the net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges. 
Slide 10 presents a walk through the primary elements of our third quarter guidance using that second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.03 as a starting point. We have also included in this slide, a walk through the primary elements of the resulting fourth quarter guidance implied by our third quarter and updated full year guidance using our third quarter guidance range as a starting point. Sequentially, the third quarter includes a headwind of between $0.05 and $0.06 due to 2 fewer selling days and the impact of holidays in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. In addition, the third quarter had a headwind of between $0.03 and $0.05 due to the seasonality of our CO2, Dry Ice and Refrigerants businesses, which typically slowed during the cooler months of the year, partially offset by higher sales in our Red-D-Arc Welder business due to the fall turnaround season. 
We also expect $0.01 of sequential headwind from a higher SAP implementation cost in the third quarter as our next 2 regional distribution companies are scheduled to be converted during the third quarter. We expect the core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.04 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and solid execution on our operating efficiency programs. In the fourth quarter, the addition of 2 selling days and the loss of the negative third quarter impact to the holidays should provide $0.05 to $0.06 benefit to EPS. The seasonal nature of our CO2, Dry Ice and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a headwind and the ongoing conversion of regional distribution companies to SAP during the fourth quarter is expected to be a modest sequential headwind. We expect the core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.02 to $0.05 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and pricing gains. 
I'll now turn it back to Jay to begin the question-and-answer session."

But overall, we absolutely expect to get back to the levels that we're at and ahead. But we definitely had margin compression. And as I mentioned, particularly, in the Ammonia business as that's a commodity-driven business that has had very significant and very frequent price increases, and we're working hard to stay up with them. But it keeps going up, and we keep lagging slightly. So we have a game plan in place to address that.

I mean, the run-off in ammonia prices was just unprecedented and that's a volatile commodity to begin with. And we've been raising prices, but we haven't been raising prices fast enough. And so we're accelerating the process now. If you recall, that 1.5 years ago, when we were on the other side of that, we we're printing money in that business. And unfortunately, that's the nature of the beast. And even though it's less commoditized and there's a much higher service element to the business at our level which is at less than truckload quantities, it's very hard to keep up with the price increases on a wicked commodity cycle like that. On the hardgoods side, I think -- we're still -- first of all, we are going to correct it and we're going to correct it right away on terms of the hardgoods margin. And we're confident that we can correct it. Secondly, we're looking very hard at our process at where we input pricing for our Strategic Accounts Program, and because clearly that was part of the reason for the compression. Then we have -- there are other issues when you implement SAP. For instance, Airgas South didn't have the last price increase which was a March price increase for us until September 1. So only one quarter, their price increase were -- was in these results. And that's because we have to lock down the data, and we didn't want to be going through all the machinations of a price increase while we were in that pre-conversion and post-conversion stages. And then other conversions like Great Lakes, we had to lock down the data 30 days before and 30 days after. So if you take the Strategic Accounts center, and probably, we dropped the ball a little bit there and some of the disruptions caused by SAP, I think it explains that portion of the margin compression that relates to execution. But that's a small portion of the overall. The overall had to do with mix within the Hardgoods segment. And that -- the silver lining is when you sell that heavy equipment and the automation equipment, it inevitably leads to sales of gases and consumables with much higher margins."

They're seeing a lot of business activity across our customer segments, particularly in manufacturing, energy, petchem but even the ones that have been growers for many, many years like life sciences, research, healthcare, they're starting to come to life after the credit crunch. If I have to compare it to 2008, our business stayed strong very late in the game. But our industrial and manufacturing, the whole industrial business, the manufactures, energy companies and things like that really peaked into 2006. And we had a pretty nice pricing environment in terms of volume. But we had a pretty nice pricing environment there for the next 18 months. Here, we're seeing sort of the opposite, this economy was very slow to recover, and it's still kind of steady as she goes, we're still not back to peak. Pricing has gotten better as the economy has marched on here. But it's a big customer recovery. I think it's partially because capacity utilization is still not back to the peak. So our customers aren't outsourcing. When they get to full capacity, they start outsourcing and the smaller customers tend to do better. So we're seeing a real volume growth situation here that we didn't see in 2008. And I would say that's the biggest difference. And I don't know what's going to happen in the economy. We have -- sales in October have been very strong. So we have pretty good visibility for this quarter, the next quarter, who knows, but being a daily sales company for most of our business, we don't have a crystal ball, but it looks very promising to us and our people are psyched and our guidance, I think, tones down our people a little bit, based on what we're reading in the newspapers and based on the political gridlock that we have in this country."

And one reason why hardgoods leads -- one element of why hardgoods leads in the beginning of a recovery is because you have people buying equipment to gear up for production. And the reason gases lag is because of that sequence they have to buy the equipment first and gear up production and then gas, a lot of gases that peak for gases is at full production. But also the pricing for gases tends to be better in the middle to later part of that cycle than it does in the early part of the cycle. So there's a good number of dynamics at work here, but we're looking for gas increases and consumables increases to follow the significant sales of equipment."

And the industry, I think, is of a mindset to get healthy through this slow and steady expansion and through pricing. And -- I mean, I don't know what's in the minds of everybody, but I just look across the landscape and it seems like a fairly good pricing environment now. If people got really scared and the economy turned down, we might see the same thing we saw at the last recession that people start to get aggressive and -- but in our industry it's really -- that happens, but the overall impact on our margins is pretty minimal as we've displayed in our last -- with our numbers in the last recession. So all I can tell you is it seems like a pretty good pricing environment. I think our customers will support the price increase that we're about to come up with forthwith. And we didn't -- back in the very difficult great recession period, we did not have maybe one quarter we had a 1% decline. But we basically held pricing throughout that great recession. What didn't happen is we didn't get the frequent increases that we had seen before that. But we didn't really have a meaningful degradation in pricing even during that hard task."

Our 14,000 associates have once again delivered a record quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, a 24% increase over last year on sales growth of 12%. But at volumes, they are still below prerecession levels. 
We continue to see strengths in the manufacturing-intensive regions of the U.S. as evidenced by the strong performances of our Great Lakes, North Central and Mid-America regions. In addition to Manufacturing customers, Petrochemical and Energy segments are also performing very well. Second quarter sales were $1.2 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 10%, gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 14%. 
Acquisitions contributed 2% of sales. The relative out-performance in our hardgoods business on the strength of sales to large manufacturing customers and the mix shift within hardgoods to welding and automation equipment had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and account for the majority of the gross margin compression we experienced this quarter. However, both dynamics are generally indicative of sustained activity levels in the manufacturing economy and future demand for industrial gases and welding consumables. 
Later in the quarter, we found ourselves slightly behind the curve on rising hardgoods product cost which also had a dilutive effect on our hardgoods gross margin for the quarter. In addition, we had to overcome supply-chain disruptions in a few gases, including helium, acetylene and argon. 
We will be initiating a pricing action in both gas and hardgoods in the coming days in order to get back in front of the cost curve. While strong hardgoods sales and a favorable pricing outlook are both calls for optimism, given the global or economic uncertainty that unfolded during that quarter, we are playing -- we are paying close attention to our business trends. As we have proven in the past, we can quickly adjust our cost structure if warranted. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points from the prior year to 12.2%, an impressive result considering it includes a 70 basis point impact from SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense incurred during the quarter, as well as a very difficult comps on our other operations segment. Even with the burden of SAP implementation cost, the strength of our business in a period of modest economic growth is evident. Our return on capital increased by 140 basis points over last year to 12.3% as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform on rising sales volumes. 
Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April. In April we have acquired 5 businesses with nearly $70 million in aggregate annual revenues. Among them were Pain Enterprises, our carbon dioxide and dry ice producer and distributor with 20 locations and more than 140 employees in the midwestern U.S. and ABCO, an industrial gas and welding distributor with 12 locations and more than 100 employees in New England. 
While our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year, some potential sellers are delaying decisions in the wake of market volatility. Our appetite for acquisitions remains strong, and we're still targeting a goal of $150 million in acquired annual sales for this fiscal year. On the strength of our second quarter results and outlook for sustained volumes in the coming quarter, we have raised our earnings guidance from -- for fiscal '12 to a range of $397 million to $407 million, representing 19% to 22% growth over fiscal '11. 
October sales are trending well, consistent with the favorable daily sales run rates we saw in September. 
Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on segment alignment, continues to gain momentum. In the second quarter, Strategic Account business was up 14% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fab, power and materials, and oil gas and chemicals customer basis. New and existing strategic account customers drove particularly strong results in safety products and filler metals this quarter. Strategic Accounts present us with a tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines and locations, and represent more than 20% of our sales. 
I encourage you to review our Strategic Account -- product slide in the Appendix in detail after our call, but in the interest of time, I'll provide you with an overview of the second quarter. 
Strategic Products, which combined to make up 40% of our revenue, increased to 8% over the prior year at 4% sequentially from the first quarter. Each of our Strategic Product categories experienced good year-over-year growth this quarter, with particular strength in safety products sales driven by increased activity in Strategic Accounts. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 19% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty with our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those on comparable OEM products. 
I'd now like to provide you an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 4. We are progressing well through our planned phase  rollout whereby our business units implement the new SAP system in succession. We now have nearly $1 billion in annual revenue and 2,600 active users running smoothly on SAP. And we believe implementation risks associated with the remaining business units is significantly diminished. 
Our hardgoods infrastructure businesses, including Airgas Safety and our national buying centers and distribution centers have been running successfully on SAP since going live at July 2010. All fulfillment metrics are at or above pre-conversion levels. 
Our first regional distribution company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP at the beginning of April. All major processes have been functioning well, and there has been no system downtime. Our implementation team did a tremendous job applying the lessons learned during the implementation of Airgas South to the training programs in preparation work for the conversion of our second regional company, Airgas Great Lakes, which went live at the beginning of September and by all measures, exceeded our expectations. For example, the Great Lakes conversion did not result in any necessary programming modifications to the system, and the cylinder supply-chain challenges that we experienced in the Airgas South conversion were almost completely mitigated at Great Lakes. 
Our implementation schedule accelerates this quarter with the conversion of our third and fourth regional companies in November and December, and we expect our distribution business to be fully converted to SAP by the summer of 2012. 
These are the businesses where we expect to realize substantially all of the benefits we have announced thus far. We have quantified the economic benefits expected to be achieved in 3 key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform; price management; and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, we expect these 3 areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis. In fact, pricing management and the telesales initiative are already underway at Airgas South with encouraging signs, and we have began the process to consolidate administrative functions across the country, which Bob will discuss shortly. 
On all 3 fronts, our progress, thus far, reinforces our confidence in the benefits estimates. These 3 areas do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion, however, and we expect to identify additional economic benefits as the implementation progresses. 
Now please turn it to Slide 5. Based on our experience to date, we are confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we detailed will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. SAP implementation costs are still expected to be heaviest in fiscal '12 as we complete the conversions of our regional distribution companies over the next 12 months, resulting in net EPS dilution of $0.30 to $0.34 this year, and $0.10 to $0.15 in fiscal '13. As highlighted in blue, we expect the combination of a lower implementation cost and the ramp-up of SAP-related benefits to yield year-over-year earnings accretion of approximately $0.20 in fiscal '13, above and beyond our base business performance, and to add, between $0.50 to $0.65 year-over-year accretion in fiscal '14. 
We believe our SAP costs and benefits are largely independent of the macro economy. We expect to progress through our current implementation schedule regardless of the prevailing economic climate and the success of our benefits programs should primarily be a function of our internal execution rather than that of an improving economy. Combine the benefits of our SAP implementation with our favorable business trends and sharp operating focus, and Airgas shareholder's benefit from superior attractive future prospects. 
Before I conclude my remarks today, I'd like to acknowledge one of our board members, Lee Thomas, Chairman and CEO of Rayonier, has announced his plan of retirement from Rayonier in May of 2012. Lee assumed the role on 2007, and since that time, Rayonier increased its market cap by $1.3 billion, resulting in a total shareholder return of 63%. Lee's many contributions to the Airgas Board of Directors have also been significant, and we look forward to the benefit of his continued leadership on our board in the future. 
So to summarize our results. We've just completed an impressive quarter and we're on track for continued success. Business is strong. The incremental profitability of our sales growth wasn't as strong as we'd like due to compress gross margins, but the strong volumes we're seeing in hardgoods sales, particularly in welding equipment and automation, bode well for future demand for welding consumables and industrial gases. In addition, the lower margin safety business and new Strategic Accounts will continue to open doors for future gas business. 
Large customers are leading the way in today's economy as the forces of consolidation are evident in not just our industry, but across all of our customer segments. While high-volume customers tend to dampen gross margin, they're the ones driving growth and they generally have a lower net cost-to-serve. Airgas is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. 
We've achieved strong revenue growth through a very challenging time in our phased SAP implementation. And while margins were squeezed in the back half of the quarter on rising product costs and some logistics expense from supply chain disruptions, we are in a position to recover with the pricing action in the near future. The economic recovery has been slow, but seems to be gaining momentum in the sectors we serve. Our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery, and we're realizing on the success of that strategy. We are delivering strong growth in operating income and earnings with attractive expansion and return on capital, while volumes are still below pre-recession levels. Our industry is still very fragmented, and we've built the only true nationwide platform in the business with the broadest available product and service offering. The benefits of our customers' history, culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop, and will yield even greater value for the customers more, than 1 million strong, to make Airgas their supplier of choice. 
Completing our SAP implementation over the next couple of years will only enhance our value proposition. As I love to remind people, the best time in Airgas is now. Bob will give you a financial review of the quarter and provide updated guidance for this year."
24504,140986664,179757,"Airgas Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Airgas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by briefly reviewing the progress we are making on the first phase of our SAP-enabled administrative efficiencies. The conversion of operating systems of our 12 regional distribution co",1972,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today by briefly reviewing the progress we are making on the first phase of our SAP-enabled administrative efficiencies. The conversion of operating systems of our 12 regional distribution companies to a single platform enables consolidation of many administration functions across the company. As we announced in May, this is the ideal time in the evolution of Airgas to restructure our regional company support functions into 4 divisional business support centers in order to better utilize our resources across regional boundaries. As of today, we have identified the financial leadership for each of the 4 divisions, as well as a physical location of each business support center and have began staffing of the centers in accordance with our implementation schedule. 
The costs associated with this restructuring include severance, relocation and other transition costs. We recorded a $0.10 charge in the first quarter of this year, and incurred negligible cost in the second quarter and expect $0.07 of further cost over the balance of fiscal '12. The restructuring is planned to be completed in fiscal '13, at which point, it begins to yield benefits consistent with our estimates. 
Now to review our consolidated results, please turn to Slide 6. Sales increased to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 2% and total same-store growth of 10%, comprised of a 7% increase in gas and rent, and a 14% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 6% and price was up 4%. Sequentially, sales increased 2% from the first quarter on the same number of selling days, with acquired sales accounting for 1% of that increase. Sales of both hardgoods and gas and rent improved sequentially. 
Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and slightly below the first quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 53.5%, decline of 160 basis points in the prior year, reflecting continued acceleration and out-performance of hardgoods sales, a mix shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment, continued sales mix shift to sales to large customers that generally carry lower margins and a lower net cost to serve, and as Peter mentioned, we also got behind the cost curve on some recent vendor price increases. Despite the pressure on gross margins, we achieved adjusted operating margin of 12.2% for the quarter, which included 70 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. 
Excluding a $0.02 asset impairment charge related to one of our liquid CO2 plants, adjusted earnings per diluted share were a record $1.03, an increase of 24% from $0.83 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $1.03 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.02 in SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were more than offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. There were approximately 77.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 10% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, driven by the share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. 
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.3%, an improvement of 140 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with our operating income as we continue to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform as sales, volumes continue to recover. 
Our working capital metrics including DSO and hardgoods inventory turns, held largely consistent with recent trends. Year-to-date adjusted cash from operations was $256 million, and free cash flow was $106 million. The decrease in free cash flow from prior year's $188 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support sales growth. 
Total debt increased approximately $535 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at September 30, reflecting $600 million spent on share repurchase programs and $108 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by debt pay down of $173 million. Our fixed low debt ratio at the end of September was 51% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7%, within our target range of 2% to 3%. 
In September, we received A2 and P2 ratings for our new commercial paper program from S&P and Moody's, and recently began to utilize this program to reduce borrowing -- to reduce the borrowings under our revolving line of credit. The all-in rates on our commercial paper program is roughly LIBOR plus 50 basis points, which is 75 basis points below our revolver cost. We are well-positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range, while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and continuing to invest in growth CapEx. 
Now turning to Slide 7, we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments, nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion, with same-store sales up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7% and hardgoods were up 15%, with price up 4% and volumes up 6%. Hardgoods volume growth accelerated this quarter to 11% year-over-year versus 9% year-over-year growth in the first quarter. On a sequential basis, sales in the distribution segment increased by 2%, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 54%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the prior year and 120 basis points sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by the sales mix shift to hardgoods, and within hardgoods to lower-margin welding and automation equipment, as well as a mix shift towards larger customers. 
Gas and rent represented 51.8% of distribution sales in the second quarter, down from 59.6% in the prior year and 58.7% in the first quarter. Hardgoods growth outpacing gas growth is typical in the early stages of a recovery. Operating income in the distribution segment increased 18% year-over-year to $131 million, and operating margin improved 70 basis points to 12.5%, driven by strong operating leverage on our organic sales growth. All other operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia, and Nitrous Oxide businesses. Sales for all other operations were up 16% from the prior year with same-store sales up 7%. The same-store sales increase was driven by a significant increase in Ammonia sales on both the volume and price basis. Sequentially, sales in all other operations increased by 2%. 
Gross margin for all other operations was down 290 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin compression in the Ammonia business, which has experienced significant and frequent cost increases over the past several quarters, and our price increases continue to lag. We have additional pricing actions planned for our third quarter to address this erosion. We have also experienced margin compression in Refrigerants as margins ran at more normal levels after last year's market anomalies. Both Ammonia and Refrigerants businesses had strong performances in the first half of the prior year and the comps for these businesses will ease in the back half of the current fiscal year. 
Sequentially, 50 basis point increase in gross margin from the first quarter was primarily attributable to a seasonal sales mix shift to CO2 and Dry Ice, away from lower-margin Refrigerants. Operating income for all other operations was $19 million, and operating margin of 13.2% was down 430 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by the Ammonia and Refrigerants gross margin compression. 
Sequentially, the 70 basis point decline in operating margins is primarily attributable to the effect of seasonality in the Refrigerants business. 
Please turn to Slide 8, Capital Expenditures. Year-to-date, our CapEx, as a percent of sales, was 7.1% in the second quarter. Construction and process was the asset category with the highest year-over-year growth in spending, driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee an expansion of our hardgoods distribution center in Deloitte, Georgia, and projects to expand or consolidate plants and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. 
The cylinders in both tank categories were also a contributor to the year-over-year increase as improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue generating assets. 
Rent to welders also increased by $8 million due to the improvement in our Red-D-Arc business. 
Slide 9 presents our fiscal 2012 third quarter and full year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high-single digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.95 to $0.98. It's an increase of 19% to 23% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.06 of which is incremental over the prior year. For the full year, we are raising our adjusted earnings expectations to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.07 per diluted share, up 19% to 22% over fiscal 2011, which includes $0.32 of SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense, $0.18 which are incremental over last year. The previous announced range was $3.90 to $4.05. 
We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high-single digits for the full fiscal year, and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.3% to 12.5%, including the dilutive impact of the increased SAP cost. CapEx is expected to be around 7% of sales for the year. 
Our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance includes the assumption for future pricing actions and assumes continued modest economic recovery in the high end while the low end allows for some moderation. The guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges, which I mentioned earlier, and also excludes the impact of the asset impairment charge, the net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges. 
Slide 10 presents a walk through the primary elements of our third quarter guidance using the second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.03 as a starting point. We have also included in this slide, a walk through the primary elements of the resulting fourth quarter guidance implied by our third quarter and updated full year guidance using our third quarter guidance range as a starting point. 
Sequentially, the third quarter includes a headwind of between $0.05 and $0.06 due to 2 fewer selling days and the impact of holidays in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. In addition, the third quarter had a headwind of between $0.03 and $0.05 due to the seasonality of our CO2, Dry Ice and Refrigerants businesses, which typically slow during the cooler months of the year, partially offset by higher sales in our Red-D-Arc Welder business due to the Fall turnaround season. 
We also expect $0.01 of sequential headwind from a higher SAP implementation cost in the third quarter as our next 2 regional distribution companies are scheduled to be converted during the third quarter. We expect the core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.04 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and solid execution on our operating efficiency programs. In the fourth quarter, the addition of 2 selling days and the loss of the negative third quarter impact to the holidays should provide $0.05 to $0.06 benefit to EPS. The seasonal nature of our CO2, Dry Ice and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a headwind and the ongoing conversion of regional distribution companies to SAP during the fourth quarter is expected to be a modest sequential headwind. We expect the core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.02 to $0.05 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and pricing gains. 
I'll now turn it back to Jay to begin the question-and-answer session."

So I think a combination. And also, we're also addressing the pass-through of hardgoods pricing, where I think we had a couple of execution issues in a few areas and -- so I think the combination of all of those will result. And the last thing that I'd say is as we get into the last quarter our gas ops should improve as well, dramatically.

But overall, we absolutely expect to get back to the levels that we're at and ahead. But we definitely had margin compression. And as I mentioned, particularly, in the Ammonia business as that's a commodity-driven business that has had very significant and very frequent price increases, and we're working hard to stay up with them. But it keeps going up, and we keep lagging slightly. So we have a game plan in place to address that.

But that was primarily the result of some very tough comps that we had in all of our strategic products but especially Bulk. We've always said that where we have a good bulk supply, where we have a wonderful opportunity to expand our business, because we grew up in the Packaged Gas business and generally had all the Gas business except the Bulk, and many of our customers. So when we proposed sole-sourcing arrangements and things like that -- and just because we're in there everyday with 1,500 salesmen, I think we have a good opportunity to grow our bulk that way.

I mean, the run-off in ammonia prices was just unprecedented, and that's a volatile commodity to begin with. And we've been raising prices, but we haven't been raising prices fast enough and so we're accelerating the process now. You'll recall that 1.5 years ago, when we were on the other side of that, we we're printing money in that business. And unfortunately, that's the nature of the beast. And even though it's less commoditized and there's a much higher service element to the business at our level, which is at less than truckload quantities, it's very hard to keep up with the price increases on a wicked commodity cycle like that. On the hardgoods side, I think -- we're still -- first of all, we are going to correct it and we're going to correct it right away on terms of the hardgoods margin. And we're confident that we can correct it. Secondly, we're looking very hard at our process, at where we input pricing for our Strategic Accounts program, and because clearly that was part of the reason for the compression. Then we have -- there are other issues when you implement SAP. For instance, Airgas South didn't have the last price increase which was a March price increase for us until September 1. So only one quarter, their price increase were -- was in these results. And that's because we have to lock down the data, and we didn't want to be going through all the machinations of a price increase while we were in that pre-conversion and post-conversion stages. And then other conversions like Great Lakes, we had to lock down the data 30 days before and 30 days after. So if you take the Strategic Accounts center, and probably we dropped the ball a little bit there, and some of the disruptions caused by SAP, I think it explains that portion of the margin compression that relates to execution. But that's a small portion of the overall. The overall had to do with mix within the hardgoods segment. And that -- the silver lining is when you sell that heavy equipment and the automation equipment, it inevitably leads to sales of gases and consumables with much higher margins."

They're seeing a lot of business activity across our customer segments, particularly in manufacturing, energy, petchem. But even the ones that have been growers for many, many years like life sciences, research, healthcare, they're starting to come to life after the credit crunch. If I have to compare it to 2008, our business stayed strong very late in the game. But our industrial and manufacturing, the whole industrial business, the manufactures, energy companies and things like that, really peaked into 2006. And we had a pretty nice pricing environment in terms of volume. But we had a pretty nice pricing environment there for the next 18 months. Here, we're seeing sort of the opposite. This economy was very slow to recover, and it's still kind of steady-as-she-goes. We're still not back to peak. Pricing has gotten better as the economy has marched on here. But it's a big customer recovery. I think it's partially because capacity utilization is still not back to the peak, so our customers aren't outsourcing. When they get to full capacity, they start outsourcing and the smaller customers tend to do better. So we're seeing a real volume growth situation here that we didn't see in 2008. And I would say that's the biggest difference. And I don't know what's going to happen in the economy. We have -- sales in October have been very strong.

And one reason why hardgoods leads -- one element of why hardgoods leads in the beginning of a recovery is because you have people buying equipment to gear up for production. And the reason gases lag is because of that sequence. They have to buy the equipment first and gear up production and then gas -- a lot of gases -- that peak for gases is at full production. But also the pricing for gases tends to be better in the middle-to-later part of that cycle than it does in the early part of the cycle.
