Republic Services has concluded a very successful fourth quarter and fiscal year. Financial and operational highlights include revenue of approximately $2 billion for the quarter and $8.1 billion for the full year. This is the third consecutive quarter with positive internal growth. Sequentially, volume improved 140 basis points including a 90 basis point improvement in Collection and a 680 basis point improvement in landfill. We secured price increases across all lines of business and continued our focus on retaining existing business that generates appropriate returns.
This resulted in record EBITDA margin performance of 31.1% in 2010. Our fourth quarter EPS was $0.42 and $1.71 for the full year. Our full year performance exceeded the guidance that we provided in February of 2010. Our fourth quarter free cash flow was $197 million and $776 million for the full year. Our strong free cash flow allowed Republic to increase its dividend and authorize a $400 million share repurchase program. We repurchased over 1.4 million shares in the fourth quarter for approximately $41 million. We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011. We remain committed to efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders. Our field organization continues to effectively manage our cost structure. Productivity has improved, which the a gradual conversion of our residential fleet to automate Collection. We expect that 55% of our residential routes will be automated by the end of 2011. 
Maintenance expenses were 40 basis points lower than 2010 when compared to the prior year. We adjusted our maintenance staffing levels to the proper ratio of collection routes resulting in lower maintenance costs per engine hour. We continue to see reduction in frequency of insurance claims. Our accident and injury frequency improved by approximately 12% as compared to 2009. 
In 2010, we increased our investments in single stream recycling facilities, alternative fuel trucks and landfill gas to energy projects. These investments are not only environmentally beneficial but are good businesses decisions, which enhance infrastructure and generate solid returns. We will continue to pursue these investments in 2011.
I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to a high level of execution in all aspects of our business and delivering another year of outperformance for Republic Services. 
Before turning the call over to Tod, I'll provide our 2011 financial guidance. Consistent with our comments on the third quarter call, we expect 2011 EPS to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.89 or a 9% to 11% increase compared to 2010. Free cash flow for the full year is expected to be in a range of $875 million to $900 million. This is a 13% to 16% increase over 2010 performance. This includes the benefit we expect from the recent extension of tax bonus depreciation.
Revenue's expected to improve by up to 1.5% with total internal growth of 2% to 3%, offset by the impact of San Mateo and Toronto contract losses. Net capital expenditures in 2011 are expected to be $735 million. This level of spending allows us to maintain our current fleet age of less than seven years. Our EBITDA margin guidance for the full year 2011 is 31.6%, which is a 50 basis point improvement over 2010. 
Tod will now provide further detail on our financial performance and guidance."
386225,118236905,101726,"Republic Services, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2011",2011-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue, as Don indicated, was just over $2 billion. After considering the impact to revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased $31 million for the quarter consisting of the following: core price growth",1407,"Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue, as Don indicated, was just over $2 billion. After considering the impact to revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased $31 million for the quarter consisting of the following: core price growth of plus 1%. In total, the Collection line of business saw a price increase of 1% with all lines of Collection business reporting positive price increases in the fourth quarter. Our total disposal price increased by 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 2.8%, partially offset by relatively lower-priced C&D and special waste event-driven work. For the full year, we reported core price of 1.6%, which was in line with our expectations that we discussed in our third quarter earnings call.
Current pricing levels reflect the lower CPI environment, which has a direct impact on our index base business. I'd like to remind everybody that approximately 50% of our customer contracts contained pricing restrictions, the majority tied to CPI. These restrictions are weighted to the residential and commercial Collection businesses but are also somewhat present in the landfill MSW volumes. The pricing in these contracts has been negatively impacted by low levels of CPI. You might recall our 2010 original guidance assumed a full year CPI of approximately 2.5%. The actual CPI for 2010 was 1.6%.
Both pricing and costs were lower than originally anticipated due to the lower inflationary environment. But, as Don mentioned, we were able to achieve our overall objectives of increased cash flow and margin expansion. 
The commodity revenue increased by 1.4%. Commodity prices increased approximately 38% to an average of $137 per ton in the current quarter from $99 per ton in the prior year. Q4 recycling facility commodity volume of 450,000 tons was flat sequentially and was up approximately 3% from the prior year. Now our 2011 guidance is based upon December average commodity prices of approximately $143 per ton. And if prices hold at current February levels of approximately $151 per ton, our EPS would increase by about $1.05. Just for reference purposes, a $10 change per ton in commodity values equals approximately $0.02 of EPS, which includes the impact of rebates.
I'll be talking about our Fuel Recovery Fee, which increased 0.3%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.14 in Q4 2010 from $2.74 in the prior like quarter, an increase of about 15%. Again, our 2011 guidance is based upon December average fuel price of $3.24 per gallon. Now if prices hold at current February levels of $3.51 per gallon, our EPS would actually decrease by about $2.05 for the full year. For reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is approximately $0.01 of EPS, and again, this includes the impact of Fuel Recovery Fees. 
Our volumes were down 1.1% for the quarter and on a year-over-year basis with a sequential improvement from the third quarter 2010 of 140 basis points. We continue to see volume improvement in the Collection business, which is now down only 2% over the prior year. Volumes are improving in all Collection lines sequentially including a 210 basis point increase in the Industrial business and an 80 basis point increase in the Commercial business. 
Our landfill and transfer volumes had year-over-year growth of 3.3%, a sequential increase also of 480 basis points. The improvement in volume is due to an increase in special waste received at our landfills. As Don had indicated, we expect 2011 volumes to be between zero and 0.5% positive. This volume guidance specifically excludes the impact of the San Mateo and Toronto contracts, which ended effective December 31, 2010. For those of you who have followed the companies for quite a while, you will recall that our landfill disposal contract with the City of Toronto expired at the end of 2010, and the San Mateo contract service by Allied was lost in 2008. The combined revenue of these contracts was approximately $115 million annually.
Now let me talk about our fourth quarter year-over-year margin. Fourth quarter 2010 adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 30.5% from 29.4% in the prior year. I would like to remind you that a reconciliation of EBITDA and cost detail information can be found in our 8-K filing. I will comment on some of the more significant changes, which are indicated in that filing. 
First, labor and benefit-related costs. The 40 basis point increase in expense relates to favorable adjustments recorded to health and welfare costs in the prior year. Last year, we mentioned a 70 basis point benefit from finalizing actuarial assumptions associated with the new combined health and welfare benefit plans. The increase in the expense results from the absence of this benefit in the current year, and that was partially offset by staffing reductions in the current year and also an overall improvement in Collection productivity during 2010.
Second, transfer and disposal costs. The 70 basis point improvement primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry little or no associated disposal cost and internalizing volumes that were historically exposed to third party facilities. 
Third, I'll talk about our maintenance and repair costs. The 40 basis point improvement in margin there relates primarily to procurement-driven cost reductions and the benefit realized from our focus on fleet and heavy equipment maintenance practices.
Fourth, transportation and subcontract expenses. The 30 basis point improvement in margin here results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network. 
Fifth is the fuel cost category. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 50 basis points was due to a 15% increase in the cost of diesel. Again, the average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.14 in the fourth quarter of 2010 from $2.74 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel cost was an increase in related Fuel Recovery Fee resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of approximately 40 basis points.
Sixth, our landfill operating cost. The 30 basis point increase in expense for the quarter relates primarily to a $6 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 for a closed landfill in the Midwest. 
Seventh, our risk management costs. The 60 basis point improvement primarily results from a couple of significant factors: first, 70 basis points of favorable actuarial adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010; and second, a 50 basis point unfavorable actuarial and premium adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. The actuarial adjustments in both periods are related to claims developments for prior plan years and relates to comments Don made earlier about performance improvement and better safety record.
Additionally, there were reductions in the current year plan cost due to decreases in cranes frequency and third party premium costs. Next our recycling cost of goods sold. There is an unfavorable 50 basis point increase in expense, and that relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $40 a ton from $26 a ton in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increased spread of approximately $24 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 50 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, excluding the cost of achieved synergies, was 10.9% of revenue compared to 10.6% in the prior year. The 30 basis point increase in expense relates primarily to an acceleration of executive retirement expenses and relocation costs for senior management changes. SG&A expense for the full year excluding cost to achieve synergies was 10.2% of revenue. We expect 2011 SG&A expenses to be approximately 10% of revenue.
All of these improvements drove a 110 basis point EBITDA margin expansion for the quarter, and as Don indicated earlier, enabled to us to exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance of 31%.
Now our DD&A also improved by 50 basis points. This relates primarily to a reduction in landfill amortization expense and accretion. This resulted from the cumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extend the life and reduce construction costs. DD&A as a percentage of revenue approximated 11.1%. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger.
Now I'll turn the call back to Ed."

Q4 2010 interest expense of $120 million includes $23 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of $10 million will decline. In 2011, we expect to refinance debt that matures throughout the year as well as call the notes due in May of 2016. Our EPS guidance includes the favorable impact of refinancing this debt with total interest expense in a range of $445 million to $455 million. This includes noncash interest of about $70 million. Our guidance excludes any premiums paid or discounts written off in connection with the early extinguishments. 
I will now discuss the full year free cash flow. Full year adjusted free cash flow was $776 million, which consisted of cash provided by operating activities of $1,434,000,000 less property and equipment received of $849 million plus proceeds from the sale of property of $37 million, merger-related expenditures net of tax of $20 million, divestiture-related tax payments of $23 million and legacy tax settlements related to BFI of $111 million, and the adjusted free cash flow again was $776 million. I want to note that we spent $14 million more on capital expenditures than our most recent guidance, primarily due to an acceleration of planned 2011 purchases. 
As Don talked about in our guidance, we expect 2011 adjusted free cash flow in a range of $875 million to $900 million. This includes approximately $100 million of cash tax benefit from the new tax loss extending bonus depreciation. Since this is an acceleration of the tax deduction for depreciation on vehicles and equipment purchase, this cash tax benefit will reverse in future periods.
Now I'd like to comment on the balance sheet. At December 31, our accounts receivable balance was $829 million, and our days sales outstanding was 37 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.7 billion at December 31, and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. In the last two years, we have paid off more than $1.3 billion of outstanding debt, and we closed 2010 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.9x. By the end of 2011, we expect this ratio to improve to approximately 2.7x. 
Before I turn the call over to Don, I would like to talk about the timing of earnings in 2011. We expect 2011 to be a little more weighted to the second half of the year, with approximately 47% of earnings being realized in the first half and 53% in the second half. This occurs in part due to the lagging nature of fuel recovery fees and a rising fuel cost environment and the timing of the intended refinancing activity. Additionally, the harsh weather that most of the country has been experiencing lately will put some pressure on the first quarter, which was not contemplated in our guidance. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

Republic Services has concluded a very successful fourth quarter and fiscal year. Financial and operational highlights include revenue of approximately $2 billion for the quarter and $8.1 billion for the full year. This is the third consecutive quarter with positive internal growth. Sequentially, volume improved 140 basis points, including a 90 basis point improvement in collection and a 680 basis point improvement in landfill. We secured price increases across all lines of business and continued our focus on retaining existing business that generates appropriate returns.
This resulted in record EBITDA margin performance of 31.1% in 2010. Our fourth quarter EPS was $0.42 and $1.71 for the full year. Our full year performance exceeded the guidance that we provided in February of 2010. Our fourth quarter free cash flow was $197 million and $776 million for the full year. Our strong free cash flow allowed Republic to increase its dividend and authorize a $400 million share repurchase program. We repurchased over 1.4 million shares in the fourth quarter for approximately $41 million. We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011. We remain committed to an efficient cash-utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders. Our field organization continues to effectively manage our cost structure. Productivity has improved, which reflects the gradual conversion of our residential fleet to automated collection. We expect that 55% of our residential routes will be automated by the end of 2011. 
Maintenance expenses were 40 basis points lower than 2010 when compared to the prior year. We adjusted our maintenance staffing levels to the proper ratio of collection routes resulting in lower maintenance costs per engine hour. We continue to see reduction in frequency of insurance claims. Our accident and injury frequency improved by approximately 12% as compared to 2009. 
In 2010, we increased our investments in single-stream recycling facilities, alternative fuel trucks and landfill gas-to-energy projects. These investments are not only environmentally beneficial but are good business decisions, which enhance infrastructure and generate solid returns. We will continue to pursue these investments in 2011.
I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to a high level of execution in all aspects of our business and delivering another year of outperformance for Republic Services. 
Before turning the call over to Tod, I'll provide our 2011 financial guidance. Consistent with our comments on the third quarter call, we expect 2011 EPS to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.89 or a 9% to 11% increase compared to 2010. Free cash flow for the full year is expected to be in a range of $875 million to $900 million. This is a 13% to 16% increase over 2010 performance. This includes the benefit we expect from the recent extension of tax bonus depreciation.
Revenue is expected to improve by up to 1.5% with total internal growth of 2% to 3%, offset by the impact of San Mateo and Toronto contract losses. Net capital expenditures in 2011 are expected to be $735 million. This level of spending allows us to maintain our current fleet age of less than seven years. Our EBITDA margin guidance for the full year 2011 is 31.6%, which is a 50 basis point improvement over 2010. 
Tod will now provide further detail on our financial performance and guidance."
386225,118236905,101877,"Republic Services, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2011",2011-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue, as Don indicated, was just over $2 billion. After considering the impact to revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased $31 million for the quarter consisting of the following: core price growth",1403,"Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue, as Don indicated, was just over $2 billion. After considering the impact to revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased $31 million for the quarter consisting of the following: core price growth of plus 1%. In total, the Collection line of business saw a price increase of 1% with all lines of Collection business reporting positive price increases in the fourth quarter. Our total disposal price increased by 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 2.8%, partially offset by relatively lower-priced C&D and special waste event-driven work. For the full year, we reported core price of 1.6%, which was in line with our expectations that we discussed in our third quarter earnings call.
Current pricing levels reflect the lower CPI environment, which has a direct impact on our index-based business. I'd like to remind everybody that approximately 50% of our customer contracts contained pricing restrictions, a majority tied to CPI. These restrictions are weighted to the Residential and Commercial Collection businesses but are also somewhat present in the landfill MSW volumes. The pricing in these contracts has been negatively impacted by low levels of CPI. You might recall our 2010 original guidance assumed a full year CPI of approximately 2.5%. The actual CPI for 2010 was 1.6%.
Both pricing and costs were lower than originally anticipated due to the lower inflationary environment. But, as Don mentioned, we are able to achieve our overall objectives of increased cash flow and margin expansion. 
The commodity revenue increased by 1.4%. Commodity prices increased approximately 38% to an average of $137 per ton in the current quarter from $99 per ton in the prior year. Q4 recycling facility commodity volume of 450,000 tons was flat sequentially and was up approximately 3% from the prior year. Now our 2011 guidance is based upon December average commodity prices of approximately $143 per ton. And if prices hold at current February levels of approximately $151 per ton, our EPS would increase by about $0.015. Just for reference purposes, a $10 change per ton in commodity values equals approximately $0.02 of EPS, which includes the impact of rebates.
I'll be talking about our Fuel Recovery Fee, which increased 0.3%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.14 in Q4 2010 from $2.74 in the prior like quarter, an increase of about 15%. Again, our 2011 guidance is based upon December average fuel price of $3.24 per gallon. Now if prices hold at current February levels of $3.51 per gallon, our EPS would actually decrease by about $0.025 for the full year. For reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is approximately $0.01 of EPS, and again, this includes the impact of Fuel Recovery Fees. 
Our volumes were down 1.1% for the quarter and on a year-over-year basis with a sequential improvement from the third quarter 2010 of 140 basis points. We continue to see volume improvement in the Collection business, which is now down only 2% over the prior year. Volumes are improving in all Collection lines sequentially, including a 210 basis point increase in the Industrial business and an 80 basis point increase in the Commercial business. 
Our landfill and transfer volumes had year-over-year growth of 3.3%, a sequential increase also of 480 basis points. The improvement in volume is due to an increase in special waste received at our landfills. As Don had indicated, we expect 2011 volumes to be between zero and 0.5% positive. This volume guidance specifically excludes the impact of the San Mateo and Toronto contracts, which ended effective December 31, 2010. For those of you who have followed the companies for quite a while, you will recall that our landfill disposal contract with the City of Toronto expired at the end of 2010, and the San Mateo contract serviced by Allied was lost in 2008. The combined revenue of these contracts was approximately $115 million annually.
Now let me talk about our fourth quarter year-over-year margin. Fourth quarter 2010 adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 30.5% from 29.4% in the prior year. I would like to remind you that a reconciliation of EBITDA and cost detail information can be found in our 8-K filing. I will comment on some of the more significant changes, which are indicated in that filing. 
First, labor and benefit-related costs. The 40 basis point increase in expense relates to favorable adjustments recorded to health and welfare costs in the prior year. Last year, we mentioned a 70 basis point benefit from finalizing actuarial assumptions associated with the new combined health and welfare benefit plans. The increase in the expense results from the absence of this benefit in the current year, and that was partially offset by staffing reductions in the current year and also an overall improvement in Collection productivity during 2010.
Second, transfer and disposal costs. The 70 basis point improvement primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry little or no associated disposal cost and internalizing volumes that were historically exposed to third-party facilities. 
Third, I'll talk about our maintenance and repair costs. The 40 basis point improvement in margin there relates primarily to procurement-driven cost reductions and the benefit realized from our focus on fleet and heavy-equipment maintenance practices.
Fourth, transportation and subcontract expenses. The 30 basis point improvement in margin here results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network. 
Fifth is the fuel cost category. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 50 basis points was due to a 15% increase in the cost of diesel. Again, the average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.14 in the fourth quarter of 2010 from $2.74 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel cost was an increase in related Fuel Recovery Fee, resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of approximately 40 basis points.
Sixth, our landfill operating cost. The 30 basis point increase in expense for the quarter relates primarily to a $6 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 for a closed landfill in the Midwest. 
Seventh, our risk-management cost. The 60 basis point improvement primarily results from a couple of significant factors: First, 70 basis points of favorable actuarial adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010; and second, a 50 basis point unfavorable actuarial and premium adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. The actuarial adjustments in both periods are related to claims developments for prior plan years and relate to comments Don made earlier about the performance improvement and better safety record. Additionally, there were reductions in the current year plan cost due to decreases in claims frequency and third-party premium costs. 
Next, our recycling cost of goods sold. There is an unfavorable 50 basis point increase in expense, and that relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $40 a ton from $26 a ton in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increased spread of approximately $24 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 50 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, excluding the cost to achieved synergies, was 10.9% of revenue compared to 10.6% in the prior year. The 30 basis point increase in expense relates primarily to an acceleration of executive retirement expenses and relocation costs for senior management changes. SG&A expense for the full year, excluding cost to achieve synergies was 10.2% of revenue. We expect 2011 SG&A expenses to be approximately 10% of revenue.
All of these improvements drove a 110 basis point EBITDA margin expansion for the quarter, and as Don indicated earlier, enabled to us to exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance of 31%.
Now our DD&A also improved by 50 basis points. This relates primarily to a reduction in landfill amortization expense and accretion. This resulted from the cumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extend the life and reduce construction costs. DD&A as a percentage of revenue approximated 11.1%. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger.
Now I'll turn the call back to Ed."

Q4 2010 interest expense of $120 million includes $23 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of $10 million will decline. In 2011, we expect to refinance debt that matures throughout the year as well as call the notes due in May of 2016. Our EPS guidance includes the favorable impact of refinancing this debt with total interest expense in a range of $445 million to $455 million. This includes noncash interest of about $70 million. Our guidance excludes any premiums paid or discounts written off in connection with the early extinguishments. 
I will now discuss the full year free cash flow. Full year adjusted free cash flow was $776 million, which consisted of cash provided by operating activities of $1,434,000,000 less property and equipment received of $849 million plus proceeds from the sale of property of $37 million, merger-related expenditures net of tax of $20 million, divestiture-related tax payments of $23 million and legacy tax settlements related to BFI of $111 million, and the adjusted free cash flow again was $776 million. I want to note that we spent $14 million more on capital expenditures than our most recent guidance, primarily due to an acceleration of planned 2011 purchases. 
As Don talked about in our guidance, we expect 2011 adjusted free cash flow in a range of $875 million to $900 million. This includes approximately $100 million of cash tax benefit from the new tax loss extending bonus depreciation. Since this is an acceleration of the tax deduction for depreciation on vehicles and equipment purchase, this cash tax benefit will reverse in future periods.
Now I'd like to comment on the balance sheet. At December 31, our accounts receivable balance was $829 million, and our day sales outstanding was 37 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.7 billion at December 31, and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. In the last two years, we have paid off more than $1.3 billion of outstanding debt, and we closed 2010 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.9x. By the end of 2011, we expect this ratio to improve to approximately 2.7x. 
Before I turn the call over to Don, I would like to talk about the timing of earnings in 2011. We expect 2011 to be a little more weighted to the second half of the year, with approximately 47% of earnings being realized in the first half and 53% in the second half. This occurs in part due to the lagging nature of Fuel Recovery Fees and a rising fuel cost environment and the timing of the intended refinancing activity. Additionally, the harsh weather that most of the country has been experiencing lately will put some pressure on the first quarter, which was not contemplated in our guidance. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

Republic Services has concluded a very successful fourth quarter and fiscal year. Financial and operational highlights include revenue of approximately $2 billion for the quarter and $8.1 billion for the full year. This is the third consecutive quarter with positive internal growth. 
Sequentially, volume improved 140 basis points, including a 90 basis point improvement in collection and a 680 basis point improvement in landfill. We secured price increases across all lines of business and continued our focus on retaining existing business that generates appropriate returns.
This resulted in record EBITDA margin performance of 31.1% in 2010. Our fourth quarter EPS was $0.42 and $1.71 for the full year. Our full year performance exceeded the guidance that we provided in February of 2010. 
Our fourth quarter free cash flow was $197 million and $776 million for the full year. Our strong free cash flow allowed Republic to increase its dividend and authorize a $400 million share repurchase program. We repurchased over 1.4 million shares in the fourth quarter for approximately $41 million. 
We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011. We remain committed to an efficient cash-utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders. 
Our field organization continues to effectively manage our cost structure. Productivity has improved, which reflects the gradual conversion of our residential fleet to automated collection. We expect that 55% of our residential routes will be automated by the end of 2011. 
Maintenance expenses were 40 basis points lower in 2010 when compared to the prior year. We adjusted our maintenance staffing levels to the proper ratio of collection routes resulting in lower maintenance costs per engine hour. We continue to see reduction in frequency of insurance claims. Our accident and injury frequency improved by approximately 12% as compared to 2009. 
In 2010, we increased our investments in single-stream recycling facilities, alternative fuel trucks and landfill gas-to-energy projects. These investments are not only environmentally beneficial but are good business decisions, which enhance infrastructure and generate solid returns. We will continue to pursue these investments in 2011.
I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to a high level of execution in all aspects of our business and delivering another year of outperformance for Republic Services. 
Before turning the call over to Tod, I'll provide our 2011 financial guidance. Consistent with our comments on the third quarter call, we expect 2011 EPS to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.89 or a 9% to 11% increase compared to 2010. 
Free cash flow for the full year is expected to be in a range of $875 million to $900 million. This is a 13% to 16% increase over 2010 performance. This includes the benefit we expect from the recent extension of tax bonus depreciation.
Revenue is expected to improve by up to 1.5% with total internal growth of 2% to 3%, offset by the impact of San Mateo and Toronto contract losses. Net capital expenditures in 2011 are expected to be $735 million. 
This level of spending allows us to maintain our current fleet age of less than seven years. Our EBITDA margin guidance for the full year 2011 is 31.6%, which is a 50 basis point improvement over 2010. 
Tod will now provide further detail on our financial performance and guidance."
386225,118236905,101940,"Republic Services, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2011",2011-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue, as Don indicated, was just over $2 billion. After considering the impact to revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased $31 million for the quarter consisting of the following. Core price grow",1404,"Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter 2010 revenue, as Don indicated, was just over $2 billion. After considering the impact to revenue from divested operations, same-store revenue increased $31 million for the quarter consisting of the following. 
Core price growth of plus 1%. In total, the Collection line of business saw a price increase of 1% with all lines of Collection business reporting positive price increases in the fourth quarter. Our total disposal price increased by 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 2.8%, partially offset by relatively lower-priced C&D and special waste event-driven work. For the full year, we reported core price of 1.6%, which was in line with our expectations that we discussed in our third quarter earnings call.
Current pricing levels reflect the lower CPI environment, which has a direct impact on our index-based business. I'd like to remind everybody that approximately 50% of our customer contracts contained pricing restrictions, a majority tied to CPI. 
These restrictions are weighted to the Residential and Commercial Collection businesses but are also somewhat present in the landfill MSW volumes. The pricing in these contracts has been negatively impacted by low levels of CPI. You might recall our 2010 original guidance assumed a full year CPI of approximately 2.5%. The actual CPI for 2010 was 1.6%.
Both pricing and costs were lower than originally anticipated due to the lower inflationary environment. But, as Don mentioned, we are able to achieve our overall objectives of increased cash flow and margin expansion. 
The commodity revenue increased by 1.4%. Commodity prices increased approximately 38% to an average of $137 per ton in the current quarter from $99 per ton in the prior year. Q4 recycling facility commodity volume of 450,000 tons was flat sequentially and was up approximately 3% from the prior year. 
Now our 2011 guidance is based upon December average commodity prices of approximately $143 per ton. And if prices hold at current February levels of approximately $151 per ton, our EPS would increase by about $1.05. Just for reference purposes, a $10 change per ton in commodity values equals approximately $0.02 of EPS, which includes the impact of rebates.
Now let me about our Fuel Recovery Fee, which increased 0.3%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.14 in Q4 of 2010 from $2.74 in the prior like quarter, an increase of about 15%. Again, our 2011 guidance is based upon December average fuel price of $3.24 per gallon. 
Now if prices hold at current February levels of $3.51 per gallon, our EPS would actually decrease by about $0.025 for the full year. For reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is approximately $0.01 of EPS, and again, this includes the impact of Fuel Recovery Fees. 
Our volumes were down 1.1% for the quarter and on a year-over-year basis with a sequential improvement from the third quarter 2010 of 140 basis points. We continue to see volume improvement in the Collection business, which is now down only 2% over the prior year. Volumes are improving in all Collection lines sequentially, including a 210 basis point increase in the Industrial business and an 80 basis point increase in the Commercial business. 
Our landfill and transfer volumes had year-over-year growth of 3.3%, a sequential increase also of 480 basis points. The improvement in volume is due to an increase in special waste received at our landfills. As Don had indicated, we expect 2011 volumes to be between zero and 0.5% positive. This volume guidance specifically excludes the impact of the San Mateo and Toronto contracts, which ended effective December 31, 2010. 
For those of you who have followed the companies for quite a while, you will recall that our landfill disposal contract with the City of Toronto expired at the end of 2010, and the San Mateo contract serviced by Allied was lost in 2008. The combined revenue of these contracts was approximately $115 million annually.
Now let me talk about our fourth quarter year-over-year margin. Fourth quarter 2010 adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 30.5% from 29.4% in the prior year. I would like to remind you that a reconciliation of EBITDA and cost detail information can be found in our 8-K filing. I will comment on some of the more significant changes, which are indicated in that filing. 
First, labor and benefit-related costs. The 40 basis point increase in expense relates to favorable adjustments recorded to health and welfare costs in the prior year. Last year, we mentioned a 70 basis point benefit from finalizing actuarial assumptions associated with the new combined health and welfare benefit plans. The increase in the expense results from the absence of this benefit in the current year, and that was partially offset by staffing reductions in the current year and also an overall improvement in Collection productivity during 2010.
Second, transfer and disposal costs. The 70 basis point improvement primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry little or no associated disposal cost and internalizing volumes that were historically exposed to third-party facilities. 
Third, I'll talk about our maintenance and repair costs. The 40 basis point improvement in margin there relates primarily to procurement-driven cost reductions and the benefit realized from our focus on fleet and heavy-equipment maintenance practices.
Fourth, transportation and subcontract expenses. The 30 basis point improvement in margin here results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network. 
Fifth is the fuel cost category. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 50 basis points was due to a 15% increase in the cost of diesel. Again, the average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.14 in the fourth quarter of 2010 from $2.74 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel cost was an increase in related Fuel Recovery Fee, resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of approximately 40 basis points.
Sixth, our landfill operating cost. The 30 basis point increase in expense for the quarter relates primarily to a $6 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 for a closed landfill in the Midwest. 
Seventh, our risk-management cost. The 60 basis point improvement primarily results from a couple of significant factors: First, 70 basis points of favorable actuarial adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010; and second, a 50 basis point unfavorable actuarial and premium adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
The actuarial adjustments in both periods are related to claims developments for prior plan years and relate to comments Don made earlier about the performance improvement and better safety record. Additionally, there were reductions in the current year plan cost due to decreases in claims frequency and third-party premium costs. 
Next, our recycling cost of goods sold. There is an unfavorable 50 basis point increase in expense, and that relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $40 a ton from $26 a ton in the prior year. 
Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increased spread of approximately $24 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 50 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, excluding the cost to achieved synergies, was 10.9% of revenue compared to 10.6% in the prior year. The 30 basis point increase in expense relates primarily to an acceleration of executive retirement expenses and relocation costs for senior management changes. SG&A expense for the full year, excluding cost to achieve synergies, was 10.2% of revenue. We expect 2011 SG&A expenses to be approximately 10% of revenue.
All of these improvements drove a 110 basis point EBITDA margin expansion for the quarter, and as Don indicated earlier, enabled to us to exceed our full year EBITDA margin guidance of 31%.
Now our DD&A also improved by 50 basis points. This relates primarily to a reduction in landfill amortization expense and accretion. This resulted from the cumulative impact of expansions and permit modifications that extend the life and reduce construction costs. DD&A as a percentage of revenue approximated 11.1%. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger.
Now I'll turn the call back to Ed."

Q4 2010 interest expense of $120 million includes $23 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of $10 million will decline. 
In 2011, we expect to refinance debt that matures throughout the year as well as call the notes due in May of 2016. Our EPS guidance includes the favorable impact of refinancing this debt with total interest expense in a range of $445 million to $455 million. This includes noncash interest of about $70 million. Our guidance excludes any premiums paid or discounts written off in connection with the early extinguishments. 
I will now discuss the full year free cash flow. Full year adjusted free cash flow was $776 million which consisted of: Cash provided by operating activities of $1.434 billion; less property and equipment received of $849 million; plus proceeds from the sale of property of $37 million; merger-related expenditures net of tax of $20 million; divestiture-related tax payments of $23 million; and legacy tax settlements related to BFI of $111 million. And the adjusted free cash flow, again, was $776 million. 
I want to note that we spent $14 million more on capital expenditures than our most recent guidance, primarily due to an acceleration of planned 2011 purchases. 
As Don talked about in our guidance, we expect 2011 adjusted free cash flow in a range of $875 million to $900 million. This includes approximately $100 million of cash tax benefit from the new tax laws extending bonus depreciation. Since this is an acceleration of the tax deduction for depreciation on vehicles and equipment purchase, this cash tax benefit will reverse in future periods.
Now I'd like to comment on the balance sheet. At December 31, our accounts receivable balance was $829 million, and our day sales outstanding was 37 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.7 billion at December 31, and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. 
In the last two years, we have paid off more than $1.3 billion of outstanding debt, and we closed 2010 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.9x. By the end of 2011, we expect this ratio to improve to approximately 2.7x. 
Before I turn the call over to Don, I would like to talk about the timing of earnings in 2011. We expect 2011 to be a little more weighted to the second half of the year, with approximately 47% of earnings being realized in the first half and 53% in the second half. This occurs in part due to the lagging nature of Fuel Recovery Fees and a rising fuel cost environment and the timing of the intended refinancing activity. 
Additionally, the harsh weather that most of the country has been experiencing lately will put some pressure on the first quarter, which was not contemplated in our guidance. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

As far as the open market business, generally, as we've done in years past, we have our open market business really in somewhat 12 buckets across the year, and we are out in the open market pricing those customers on a regular basis throughout the year, so that every customer gets an annual review and adjustment to recover inflation.

Based on our first quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve the financial guidance provided in February. Financial and operational highlights include revenue of approximately $2 billion for the quarter. Total price growth in the quarter was 2.6% with core price of 1%. We secured core price increases across all lines of business and continued our focus on retaining existing business that generates appropriate returns. 
Volumes declines 0.7%, which is a sequential improvement of 40 basis points, including 110 basis point improvement in Collection. This is the fourth straight quarter of sequential volume improvement in the Collection business.
Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.42. Our first quarter adjusted free cash flow was $273 million. We repurchased 5 million shares in the first quarter for $148 million. We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011.
We returned $225 million to our shareholders during the quarter. We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We recently closed a new 5-year $1.25 billion credit facility. Republic continues to extend debt maturities and lower interest costs. 
Moody's recently raised the outlook on our credit rating to positive. Republic is committed to a strategy of growing our business, improving return on capital, returning cash to shareholders and a strong credit profile.
We recently purchased 2 recycling facilities in the Midwest to enhance our recycling capabilities. Our field organization continues to effectively manage our cost structure. All controllable costs remain flat or decreased as a percentage of revenue, including labor and maintenance expenses. We achieved year-to-year labor productivity gains in all Collection lines of business. We saw a reduction in frequency of insurance claims. Our accident and injury frequency improved by approximately 15% as compared to 2010. I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to a high level of performance in all aspects of our business.
Tod and Ed will now update our financial performance."

Change in revenue from the prior period includes the following. First, our core price growth of 1%. In total, the Collection lines of business saw core price increase of 1% with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the first quarter. Our total disposal core price increased by 1.3%, which includes landfill MSW of 2.1%, which was partially offset by relatively lower-priced event C&D and event special work. This level of pricing is in line with our expectations for the quarter. Since our price in index base contracts tends to lag, we are still impacted by lower CPI environment that occurred in 2009 and 2010. This has not yet anniversaried. 
In 2011, we expect core price of approximately 1% in the first half the year and in a range of 1.5% to 2% in the second half of the year. Second, our commodity revenue increase of 1%. Commodity prices increased by 19% to an average price of $149 per ton in the current quarter from $125 per ton in the prior year. Q1 recycling facility commodity volume of 478,000 tons was up approximately 13% from the prior year and up 8% on a same-store basis. 
As Don mentioned, we've recently purchased 2 recycling facilities. As a reminder, our 2011 guidance was based on December 2010 average commodity prices, which at that time was about $143 a ton. If prices hold at the current April levels of about $152 a ton, our EPS would increase for the year by about $0.02. Now for reference purposes, a $10 change per ton in commodity value equals about $0.02 of EPS, and that is net of the impact of rebates.
Let me talk briefly about our Fuel Recovery Fee, which increased by 0.6%. The increase in Fuel Recovery Fees relates to an increase of fuel costs obviously. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.63 in the first quarter of '11 from $2.85 in the prior year, about a 27% increase. Our 2011 guidance was based on an average fuel price of $3.42 a gallon. If prices hold at the current April levels of $4.10 per gallon, our full year EPS would decrease by about $0.05. Again, for reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is slightly less than $0.01 of EPS, which includes the impact of the Fuel Recovery Fees. 
Now let me turn to volumes. Volumes were down 0.7% year-over-year. As Don indicated, this is a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter 2010 of 40 basis points. We continue to see volume improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 1% over the prior year. Volumes improved in all Collection lines sequentially, including a 220 basis point increase in the Industrial business and also 100 basis points sequential increase in the Commercial business. Our volumes improved despite the severe weather early in the quarter.
Our landfill and transfer station volumes had year-over-year growth of about 2%. This continues to reflect the positive contribution from both permanent and temporary special waste volumes. Our outlook for special waste activity remains strong, and we remain confident that we can replace or slightly exceed the volumes that we received in 2010. 
Now let me turn to our margins. First quarter year-over-year margins. The first quarter 2010 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.6% compared to 31.7% in the prior year. This decline in margin is primarily due to the 27% increase in the cost of diesel fuel. That's 120 basis points of negative margin impact. The average price per gallon again as I'd indicated increased to $3.63 in the quarter from $2.85 in the prior year like quarter and again, with the current prices at $4.10 a gallon. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel cost was increasing related Fuel Recovery Fee revenue resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 80 basis points. If prices remain at this level for fuel, we will have margin headwind for the balance of the year. 
Other significant changes to margin include transfer and disposal costs. We actually had a 30 basis point improvement here, which primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry little or no associated disposal cost. 
Next transportation and subcontract expenses. We had an 80 basis point improvement in margin results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network. Also the loss of the Toronto disposal contract, which had a high level of transportation cost and the divestiture of 3 New York City transfer stations in late 2010 helped our transportation subcontract expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Risk management. Here, it's a little lumpy. The 40 basis point increase in expense relates to the change in actuarial estimates. As we've said before, we perform actuarial assessment of risk reserves each quarter, which can create volatility. We could very easily smooth the numbers through the year, but we believe this is the best practice. In 2010's first quarter, we benefited from favorable adjustments to prior plan years. The favorable adjustment was repeated in the first quarter of 2011 but not at the same level. Our net benefit was probably in the range of $2 million to $3 million.
Next, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 50 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $47 per ton from $38 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increased spread of approximately $15 per ton. The net impact here was obviously favorable 40 basis points in EBITDA margin. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, excluding the cost to achieve synergies, was 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase in expense relates primarily to investments in programs designed to lower costs, drive efficiency and increase productivity. We expect full year 2011 SG&A expenses to approximate 10% of revenue. 
Now let me talk briefly about our DD&A. DD&A as a percentage of revenue was relatively comparable at 11.5% in the current year versus 11.4% in the prior year. And of course, as we said before, our DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to discuss interest expense, free cash flow and the balance sheet."

Q1 2011 interest expense was $116 million, and that includes $22 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of $9 million will decline.
On April 20, we closed a new 5-year $1.25 billion credit facility. This new facility has a fully drawn cost equal to the facility being replaced. Republic has total bank market capacity of $2.5 billion that can be used for issuing letters of credit, short-term borrowing and general corporate purposes.
During Q2 of this year, we expect to refinance debt that matures throughout the year. As you remember, we started having debt maturities last November, and that'll continue through August. Notes due in May 2016 were called on April 15, and the notes that we offered to tender due in 2021 and 2035. Our EPS guidance provided in February included the favorable impact of refinancing this debt, but excluded any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with the extinguishments.
I will now discuss free cash flow. Q1 adjusted free cash flow was $273 million, which consisted of first, cash provided by operating activities of $434 million less property and equipment received of $169 million plus proceeds from the sale of property of $7 million plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of $1 million. And therefore, adjusted free cash flow is $273 million.
At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $840 million, and our days sales outstanding was 39 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.8 billion at March 31 and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.4 billion. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

Keep in mind during the first half of this year, we're still working through the lower CPI environment we saw in 2009 and into 2010. As we get to July 1 in the second half of the year, we'll anniversary out those lower CPI numbers, and then we'll see CPI numbers that reflect more the full year average for 2010, which was about 1.6%. So we will see kind of a lower CPI in the first half of the year, a step up to that mid-1% in the second half of the year. And then as we see CPI develop this year, and I know we've seen a few months here getting a little bit higher pushing above 2%, we really won't see that kind of blend into our numbers until the second half of '12. As we usually stated, it takes about 12 or 18 months for that CPI trend to work its way into the average price. And as we discussed on the other call, Las Vegas is a very large market for us, and there's probably one that has a longer lag than others, but because of its size it doesn't tack the corporate average. In Las Vegas, they use a calendar year CPI, and you get that price increase to follow in July 1. So therefore, on July 1 of '10, we actually had to roll back our pricing right 0.4%, which was the '09 CPI number. And then what will happen this July 1 we'll get a price increase of 1.6%, and that'll be your price increase for that marketplace starting July 1 of '11 through June 30 of '12, and then potentially we'll see that higher CPI pricing come into our numbers beginning July 1 of '12.

And there's always pockets of pushback based on competitive behavior maybe locally or something along those lines, but no really change in what it's been. So we continue to review all of our pricing. Every customer gets reviewed annually. We continue to do that while we continue to defend our business and look for signs of life in the economy to grow our business.

So we have those projects come up periodically throughout the year, and we will continue to price those. I think in MSW this year early quarter, we had a little better than 2% price on MSW. We sort of would like to see that go a little higher. We had a little bit of volume in a couple of markets in landfill where we move price to competitive MSW hollers in the marketplace. And we were not willing to get price concession, so we lost a little volume there. So we're going to continue to focus on the infrastructure and use the assets according to the marketplace."

Remember, we've always said that we're looking to get that spread over and above through inflation. And when our customers are seeing inflation in their business, when they're a little more comfortable with their business activity, there a little less price-sensitive, the market behavior changes a little bit it allows us a little more of pricing strength.

I think our customers are pretty smart folks. I think they're looking at total cost of serve, and that's what we try to sell our customers is there's a total cost of service. We're not hiding behind our fees. We look at our Fuel Recovery Fee as the fairest way to deal with our customer base so that when fuel goes up, it's a big part of our cost, they share in that cost increase. When fuel goes down, they get the benefit. And so it's a different sales approach than the guy who's selling no fees. The difference is when fuel spikes, that operator has to run around it and bring more fuel price increases to the customer. We're touching the customer once annually. We've got index working for us on fuel, and we think it's the fairest way to approach the customer. Remember we've got 150 million gallons of fuel a year, and when fuel was up $0.50 we can't just run around and try to find $75 million. So it works pretty well for us.

We have had regular meetings with our people. We had our second annual general management conference here in February where we brought in all of our general managers and area teams and region teams from across the country. We had our key decision-makers from the corporate office there, and we had close to 500 people in one room talking about the road map going forward, what we've achieved and the plans, and I tell it was a pretty good vibe in the room, and you could cut the excitement with a knife. So from a culture perspective, I would say we've done a great job bringing it together, and I think everyone is pretty pumped up about where we'll be going from here. From a synergy perspective, our best practice perspective, talk about the parking block as we put the synergy goals together, we found some things that we like to do. We just said that the company can only change so much at once. And so we put all the parking lot. We've been dusting some of those things off and looking at those things today and how we can continue to improve the business. None of them in and of themselves are major deal movers, but there are things that are worth $1 million, things that are worth $0.5 million and we're going to continue to shave those pennies off of our cost and improve the way we go to market. We're going to continue to build our service, customer service experience and those kind of things. So from here in out, it's just improving on what we built. But I would tell you that the company flies one flag, and it's pretty excited about the future today."

Based on our first quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve the financial guidance provided in February. Financial and operational highlights include revenue of approximately $2 billion for the quarter. Total price growth in the quarter was 2.6%, with core price of 1%. We secured core price increases across all lines of business and continued our focus on retaining existing business that generates appropriate returns. 
Volumes declined 0.7%, which is a sequential improvement of 40 basis points, including 110 basis point improvement in Collection. This is the fourth straight quarter of sequential volume improvement in the Collection business.
Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.42. Our first quarter adjusted free cash flow was $273 million. We repurchased 5 million shares in the first quarter for $148 million. We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011.
We returned $225 million to our shareholders during the quarter. We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We recently closed a new 5-year $1.25 billion credit facility. Republic continues to extend debt maturities and lower interest costs. 
Moody's recently raised the outlook on our credit rating to positive. Republic is committed to a strategy of growing our business, improving return on capital, returning cash to shareholders and a strong credit profile.
We recently purchased 2 recycling facilities in the Midwest to enhance our recycling capabilities. Our field organization continues to effectively manage our cost structure. All controllable costs remain flat or decreased as a percentage of revenue, including labor and maintenance expenses. We achieved year-to-year labor productivity gains in all Collection lines of business. We saw a reduction in frequency of insurance claims. Our accident and injury frequency improved by approximately 15% as compared to 2010. I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to a high level of performance in all aspects of our business.
Tod and Ed will now update our financial performance."

Change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: First, our core price growth of 1%. In total, the Collection lines of business saw a core price increase of 1% with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the first quarter. 
Our total disposal core price increased by 1.3%, which includes landfill MSW of 2.1%, which was partially offset by relatively lower-priced event C&D and event special waste drilling work. This level of pricing is in line with our expectations for the quarter. Since our price on index-based contracts tends to lag, we are still impacted by lower CPI environment that occurred in 2009 and 2010. This has not yet anniversaried. 
In 2011, we expect core price of approximately 1% in the first half of the year and in a range of 1.5% to 2% in the second half of the year. Second, our commodity revenue increase of 1%. Commodity prices increased by 19% to an average price of $149 per ton in the current quarter from $125 per ton in the prior year. Q1 recycling facility commodity volume of 478,000 tons was up approximately 13% from the prior year and up 8% on a same-store basis. As Don mentioned, we've recently purchased 2 recycling facilities. 
As a reminder, our 2011 guidance was based on December 2010 average commodity prices, which at that time was about $143 a ton. If prices hold at the current April levels of about $152 a ton, our EPS would increase for the year by about $0.02. Now for reference purposes, a $10 change per ton in commodity value equals about $0.02 of EPS, and that is net of the impact of rebates.
Let me talk briefly about our fuel recovery fee, which increased by 0.6%. The increase in fuel recovery fees relates to an increase of fuel costs, obviously. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.63 in the first quarter of '11 from $2.85 in the prior year, about a 27% increase. Our 2011 guidance was based on an average fuel price of $3.42 a gallon. If prices hold at the current April levels of $4.10 per gallon, our full year EPS would decrease by about $0.05. Again, for reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is slightly less than $0.01 of EPS, which includes the impact of the fuel recovery fees. 
Now let me turn to volumes. Volumes were down 0.7% year-over-year. As Don indicated, this is a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter 2010 of 40 basis points. We continue to see volume improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 1% over the prior year. Volumes improved in all Collection lines sequentially, including a 220 basis point increase in the Industrial business and also 100 basis points sequential increase in the Commercial business. Our volumes improved despite the severe weather early in the quarter.
Our landfill and transfer station volumes had year-over-year growth of about 2%. This continues to reflect the positive contribution from both permanent and temporary special waste volumes. Our outlook for special waste activity remains strong, and we remain confident that we can replace or slightly exceed the volumes that we received in 2010. 
Now let me turn to our margins. First quarter year-over-year margins. The first quarter 2010 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.6% compared to 31.7% in the prior year. This decline in margin is primarily due to the 27% increase in the cost of diesel fuel. That's 120 basis points of negative margin impact. The average price per gallon, again, as I've indicated, increased to $3.63 in the quarter from $2.85 in the prior year like quarter, and again, with the current prices at $4.10 a gallon. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel cost was an increase in related fuel recovery fee revenue resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 80 basis points. If prices remain at this level for fuel, we will have margin headwind for the balance of the year. 
Other significant changes to margin include transfer and disposal costs. We actually had a 30 basis point improvement here, which primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry little or no associated disposal cost. 
Next, transportation and subcontract expenses. We had an 80 basis point improvement in margin results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network. Also, the loss of the Toronto disposal contract, which had a high level of transportation cost and the divestiture of 3 New York City transfer stations in late 2010, helped our transportation subcontract expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Risk management. Here, it's a little lumpy. The 40 basis point increase in expense relates to the change in actuarial estimates. As we've said before, we perform actuarial assessment of risk reserves each quarter, which can create volatility. We could very easily smoothen the numbers through the year, but we believe this is the best practice. In 2010's first quarter, we benefited from favorable adjustments to prior plan years. The favorable adjustment was repeated in the first quarter of 2011 but not at the same level. Our net benefit was probably in the range of $2 million to $3 million.
Next, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 50 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $47 per ton from $38 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increased spread of approximately $15 per ton. The net impact here was obviously favorable 40 basis points in EBITDA margin. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, excluding the cost to achieve synergies, was 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase in expense relates primarily to investments in programs designed to lower costs, drive efficiency and increase productivity. We expect full year 2011 SG&A expenses to approximate 10% of revenue. 
Now let me talk briefly about our DD&A. DD&A as a percentage of revenue was relatively comparable at 11.5% in the current year versus 11.4% in the prior year. And of course, as we said before, our DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to discuss interest expense, free cash flow and the balance sheet."

Q1 2011 interest expense was $116 million, and that includes $22 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of $9 million will decline.
On April 20, we closed a new 5-year $1.25 billion credit facility. This new facility has a fully drawn cost equal to the facility being replaced. Republic has total bank market capacity of $2.5 billion that can be used for issuing letters of credit, short-term borrowing and general corporate purposes.
During Q2 of this year, we expect to refinance debt that matures throughout the year. As you remember, we started having debt maturities last November, and that'll continue through August. Notes due in May 2016 were called on April 15, and the notes that we offered to tender due in 2021 and 2035. Our EPS guidance provided in February included the favorable impact of refinancing this debt but excluded any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with extinguishments.
I will now discuss free cash flow. Q1 adjusted free cash flow was $273 million, which consisted of, first, cash provided by operating activities of $434 million less property and equipment received of $169 million plus proceeds from the sale of property of $7 million plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of $1 million. And therefore, adjusted free cash flow is $273 million.
At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $840 million, and our days sales outstanding was 39 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.8 billion at March 31, and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.4 billion. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

Keep in mind, during the first half of this year, we're still working through the lower CPI environment we saw in 2009 and into 2010. As we get to July 1 in the second half of the year, we'll anniversary out those lower CPI numbers, and then we'll see CPI numbers that reflect more the full year average for 2010, which was about 1.6%. So we will see kind of a lower CPI in the first half of the year, a step-up to that mid-1% in the second half of the year. And then as we see CPI develop this year, and I know we've seen a few months here getting a little bit higher pushing above 2%, we really won't see that kind of blend into our numbers until the second half of '12. As we usually stated, it takes about 12 or 18 months for that CPI trend to work its way into the average price. And as we discussed on the other call, Las Vegas is a very large market for us, and there's probably one that has a longer lag than others, but because of its size it doesn't tack the corporate average. And in Las Vegas, they use a calendar year CPI, and you get that price increase to follow in July 1. So therefore, on July 1 of '10, we actually had to roll back our pricing by 0.4%, which was the '09 CPI number. And then what will happen this July 1 we'll get a price increase of 1.6%, and that'll be your price increase for that marketplace starting July 1 of '11 through June 30 of '12, and then potentially we'll see that higher CPI pricing come into our numbers beginning July 1 of '12. And, Don, you want to talk about open-market pricing?"

So remember, the other part of the business is open market, and we have an internal process we call RPM, which is just basically taking those old market customers and we spread them across 12 months and we review and accordingly adjust those customer prices at least annually. And so we have positive pricing across all lines of business in the quarter, and pricing in that arena is going well for us. And there's always pockets of pushback based on competitive behavior maybe locally or something along those lines, but no really change in what it's been. So we continue to review all of our pricing. Every customer gets reviewed annually. We continue to do that while we continue to defend our business and look for signs of life in the economy to grow our business. So all in all, I think the 1% pricing in the quarter was a pretty good number for us."

So we have those projects come up periodically throughout the year, and we will continue to price those. I think in MSW this year, early quarter, we had a little better than 2% price on MSW. We sort of would like to see that go a little higher. We had a little bit of volume defection in a couple of markets in landfill where we move price to competitive MSW haulers in the marketplace. And we were not willing to get price concession, so we lost a little volume there. So we're going to continue to focus on the infrastructure and use the assets accordingly in the marketplace."

So we said we'd close about $75 million of revenue this year. As it relates to recycling, some of those projects are developmental project, some would be acquisitions. So we've identified what we think are 25 markets across our 240 marketplaces that we need to fill some gaps in recycling where we don't have quite enough capability to meet the demand of our customers. And so we'll be looking to fill those gaps. So those could be with existing facilities that we had, that we just need to retrofit, add capacity. Some could be developing a whole new footprint or some could be an acquisition. So that's baked in our numbers.

And again, one of the advantages, Jonathan, is with the way that we do pricing in those 12 buckets, as I described, as conditions change in the marketplace and as CPI ebbs and flows, it does give us flexibility across that part of our portfolio. So the second half of the year where we're pricing those 6 buckets in those markets, we could be pricing a little stronger there depending on the market activity. Remember, we've always said that we're looking to get that spread over and above through inflation. And when our customers are seeing inflation in their business, when they're a little more comfortable with their business activity, they're a little less price-sensitive, the market behavior changes a little bit, it allows us a little more pricing strength. So we will meter that accordingly as the markets allow us to in the second half, and we'll wait and see."

I think our customers are pretty smart folks. I think they look at total cost to serve, and that's what we try to sell our customers is there's a total cost to service. We're not hiding behind our fees. We look at our fuel recovery fee as the fairest way to deal with our customer base so that when fuel goes up, it's a big part of our cost, they share in that cost increase. When fuel goes down, they get the benefit. And so it's a different sales approach than the guy who's selling no fees. The difference is when fuel spikes, that operator has to run around and bring more fuel price increases to the customer. We're touching the customer once annually. We've got the index working for us on fuel, and we think it's the fairest way to approach the customer. Remember, we've got 150 million gallons of fuel a year, and when fuel was up $0.50, we can't just kind of run around the house [ph] like we're to find $75 million. So it works pretty well for us.

It could change a little bit as we go through the year depending on certain contracts. But we're not making a huge move there. What we've done, frankly, is we've made investments in some of our larger fleets in the appropriate markets on the fueling station and on introducing CNG vehicles. And we're going to, this year, basically fill out the routes in those facilities. So by example, if I had 100-truck facility last year I replaced 40 of the tracks to CNG, and the other 60 or so diesel, I built the CNG station. This year, we may go back in and basically replace those other 60 vehicles with CNG sort of being the full affect then of that investment of the CNG stations. Does that makes sense?"

So one of the reasons this acquisition works so well is that we were very serious, from the very beginning, Jim and I and Tod and the rest of the team, about putting together one team building the best of the best culture, and we did that. We spent a fair amount of time on the social issues and the culture through the process so that we did become one company very quickly. So I'd be kidding myself if I said we've got 30,000 employees. There's not so many out there who would maybe rather fly a different flag today. But I would say those are the exceptions, and they're very, very minor exceptions. We have had regular meetings with our people. We had our second annual general management conference here in February where we brought in all of our general managers and area teams and region teams from across the country. We had our key decision makers from the corporate office there, and we had close to 500 people in one room talking about the road map going forward, what we've achieved and the plans, and I'll tell you it was a pretty good vibe in the room, and you could cut the excitement with a knife. So from a culture perspective, I would say we've done a great job bringing it together, and I think everyone is pretty pumped up about where we'll be going from here. From a synergy perspective or best practice perspective, there is talk about the parking lot as we put the synergy goals together, we found some things that we like to do. We just said that the company can only change so much at once. And so we put all the parking lot. We've been dusting some of those things off and looking at those things today and how we can continue to improve the business. None of them in and of themself are major deal movers, but there are things that are worth $1 million, things that are worth $0.5 million, and we're going to continue to shave those pennies off of our cost and improve the way we go to market. We're going to continue to build our service, customer service experience and those kind of things. So from hereon out, it's just improving on what we built. But I would tell you that the company flies one flag, and it's pretty excited about the future today."

Based on our first quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve the financial guidance provided in February. Financial and operational highlights include revenue of approximately $2 billion for the quarter. Total price growth in the quarter was 2.6%, with core price of 1%. We secured core price increases across all lines of business and continued our focus on retaining existing business that generates appropriate returns. 
Volumes declined 0.7%, which is a sequential improvement of 40 basis points, including 110 basis point improvement in Collection. This is the fourth straight quarter of sequential volume improvement in the Collection business.
Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.42. Our first quarter adjusted free cash flow was $273 million. We repurchased 5 million shares in the first quarter for $148 million. We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011.
We returned $225 million to our shareholders during the quarter. We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We recently closed a new 5 year $1.25 billion credit facility. Republic continues to extend debt maturities and lower interest costs. 
Moody's recently raised the outlook on our credit rating to positive. Republic is committed to a strategy of growing our business, improving return on capital, returning cash to shareholders and a strong credit profile.
We recently purchased 2 recycling facilities in the Midwest to enhance our recycling capabilities. Our field organization continues to effectively manage our cost structure. All controllable costs remain flat or decreased as a percentage of revenue, including labor and maintenance expenses. We achieved year to year labor productivity gains in all Collection lines of business. We saw a reduction in frequency of insurance claims. Our accident and injury frequency improved by approximately 15% as compared to 2010. I would like to thank our field operations for their commitment to a high level of performance in all aspects of our business.

Change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: First, our core price growth of 1%. In total, the Collection lines of business saw a core price increase of 1% with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the first quarter. 
Our total disposal core price increased by 1.3%, which includes landfill MSW of 2.1%, which was partially offset by relatively lower priced event C&D and event special waste driven work. This level of pricing is in line with our expectations for the quarter. Since our price on index based contracts tends to lag, we are still impacted by lower CPI environment that occurred in 2009 and 2010. This has not yet anniversaried. 
In 2011, we expect core price of approximately 1% in the first half of the year and in a range of 1.5% to 2% in the second half of the year. Second, our commodity revenue increase of 1%. Commodity prices increased by 19% to an average price of $149 per ton in the current quarter from $125 per ton in the prior year. Q1 recycling facility commodity volume of 478,000 tons was up approximately 13% from the prior year and up 8% on a same store basis. As Don mentioned, we've recently purchased 2 recycling facilities. 
As a reminder, our 2011 guidance was based on December 2010 average commodity prices, which at that time was about $143 a ton. If prices hold at the current April levels of about $152 a ton, our EPS would increase for the year by about $0.02. Now for reference purposes, a $10 change per ton in commodity value equals about $0.02 of EPS, and that is net of the impact of rebates.
Let me talk briefly about our fuel recovery fee, which increased by 0.6%. The increase in fuel recovery fees relates to an increase of fuel costs, obviously. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.63 in the first quarter of '11 from $2.85 in the prior year, about a 27% increase. Our 2011 guidance was based on an average fuel price of $3.42 a gallon. If prices hold at the current April levels of $4.10 per gallon, our full year EPS would decrease by about $0.05. Again, for reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is slightly less than $0.01 of EPS, which includes the impact of the fuel recovery fees. 
Now let me turn to volumes. Volumes were down 0.7% year over year. As Don indicated, this is a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter 2010 of 40 basis points. We continue to see volume improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 1% over the prior year. Volumes improved in all Collection lines sequentially, including a 220 basis point increase in the Industrial business and also 100 basis point sequential increase in the Commercial business. Our volumes improved despite the severe weather early in the quarter.
Our landfill and transfer station volumes had year over year growth of about 2%. This continues to reflect the positive contribution from both permanent and temporary special waste volumes. Our outlook for special waste activity remains strong, and we remain confident that we can replace or slightly exceed the volumes that we received in 2010. 
Now let me turn to our margins. First quarter year over year margins. The first quarter 2010 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.6% compared to 31.7% in the prior year. This decline in margin is primarily due to the 27% increase in the cost of diesel fuel. That's 120 basis points of negative margin impact. The average price per gallon, again, as I'd indicated, increased to $3.63 in the quarter from $2.85 in the prior year like quarter, and again, with the current prices at $4.10 a gallon. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel cost was an increase in related fuel recovery fee revenue resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 80 basis points. If prices remain at this level for fuel, we will have margin headwind for the balance of the year. 
Other significant changes to margin include transfer and disposal costs. We actually had a 30 basis point improvement here, which primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry little or no associated disposal cost. 
Next, transportation and subcontract expenses. We had an 80 basis point improvement in margin results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network. Also, the loss of the Toronto disposal contract, which had a high level of transportation cost and the divestiture of 3 New York City transfer stations in late 2010, helped our transportation subcontract expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Risk management. Here, it's a little lumpy. The 40 basis point increase in expense relates to the change in actuarial estimates. As we've said before, we perform actuarial assessment of risk reserves each quarter, which can create volatility. We could very easily smooth the numbers through the year, but we believe this is the best practice. In 2010's first quarter, we benefited from favorable adjustments to prior plan years. The favorable adjustment was repeated in the first quarter of 2011 but not at the same level. Our net benefit was probably in the range of $2 million to $3 million.
Next, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 50 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $47 per ton from $38 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increased spread of approximately $15 per ton. The net impact here was obviously favorable 40 basis points in EBITDA margin. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, excluding the cost to achieve synergies, was 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase in expense relates primarily to investments in programs designed to lower cost, drive efficiency and increase productivity. We expect full year 2011 SG&A expenses to approximate 10% of revenue. 
Now let me talk briefly about our DD&A. DD&A as a percentage of revenue was relatively comparable at 11.5% in the current year versus 11.4% in the prior year. And of course, as we said before, our DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to discuss interest expense, free cash flow and the balance sheet."

Q1 2011 interest expense was $116 million, and that includes $22 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the Allied debt discount of $9 million will decline.
On April 20, we closed a new 5 year $1.25 billion credit facility. This new facility has a fully drawn cost equal to the facility being replaced. Republic has total bank market capacity of $2.5 billion that can be used for issuing letters of credit, short term borrowing and general corporate purposes.
During Q2 of this year, we expect to refinance debt that matures throughout the year. As you remember, we started having debt maturities last November, and that'll continue through August. Notes due in May 2016 were called on April 15, and the notes that we offered to tender due in 2021 and 2035. Our EPS guidance provided in February included the favorable impact of refinancing this debt but excluded any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with extinguishments.
I will now discuss free cash flow. Q1 adjusted free cash flow was $273 million, which consisted of, first, cash provided by operating activities of $434 million less property and equipment received of $169 million plus proceeds from the sale of property of $7 million plus merger related expenditures net of tax of $1 million. And therefore, adjusted free cash flow is $273 million.
At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $840 million, and our days sales outstanding was 39 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.8 billion at March 31, and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.4 billion.

Keep in mind, during the first half of this year, we're still working through the lower CPI environment we saw in 2009 and into 2010. As we get to July 1 in the second half of the year, we'll anniversary out those lower CPI numbers, and then we'll see CPI numbers that reflect more the full year average for 2010, which was about 1.6%. So we will see kind of a lower CPI in the first half of the year, a step up to that mid 1% in the second half of the year. And then as we see CPI develop this year, and I know we've seen a few months here getting a little bit higher pushing above 2%, we really won't see that kind of blend into our numbers until the second half of '12. As we usually state, it takes about 12 or 18 months for that CPI trend to work its way into the average price. And as we discussed on the other call, Las Vegas is a very large market for us, and there's probably one that has a longer lag than others, but because of its size it doesn't impact the corporate average. And in Las Vegas, they use a calendar year CPI, and you get that price increase the following July 1. So therefore, on July 1 of '10, we actually had to roll back our pricing by 0.4%, which was the '09 CPI number. And then what will happen this July 1, we'll get a price increase of 1.6%, and that'll be your price increase for that marketplace starting July 1 of '11 through June 30 of '12, and then potentially we'll see that higher CPI pricing come into our numbers beginning July 1 of '12.

And there's always pockets of pushback based on competitive behavior maybe locally or something along those lines, but no really change in what it's been. So we continue to review all of our pricing. Every customer gets reviewed annually. We continue to do that while we continue to defend our business and look for signs of life in the economy to grow our business.

So we have -- those projects [ph] come up periodically throughout the year, and we will continue to price those. I think in MSW this year, or the quarter, we had a little better than 2% price on MSW.

And we were not willing to give price concession, so we lost a little volume there. So we're going to continue to focus on the infrastructure and use the assets accordingly in the marketplace."

So we've identified what we think are 25 markets across our 240 marketplaces that we need to fill some gaps in recycling where we don't have quite enough capability to meet the demand of our customers. And so we'll be looking to fill those gaps. Some of those could be with existing facilities that we have, that we just need to retrofit, add capacity.

Remember, we've always said that we're looking to get that spread over and above true inflation. And when our customers are seeing inflation in their business, when they're a little more comfortable with their business activity, they're a little less price sensitive, the market behavior changes a little bit, and it allows us a little more pricing strength.

I think our customers are pretty smart folks. I think they look at total cost to serve, and that's what we try to sell our customers is there's a total cost to service. We're not hiding behind our fees. We look at our fuel recovery fee as the fairest way to deal with our customer base so that when fuel goes up, it's a big part of our cost, they share in that cost increase. When fuel goes down, they get the benefit. And so it's a different sales approach than the guy who's selling no fees. The difference is when fuel spikes, that operator has to run around and bring more fuel price increases to the customer. We're touching the customer once annually. We've got the index working for us on fuel, and we think it's the fairest way to approach the customer. Remember, we've got 150 million gallons of fuel a year, and when fuel was up $0.50, we can't just kind of run around with our hair on fire trying to find $75 million. So it works pretty well for us.

So by example, if I had 100 truck facility last year I replaced 40 of the tracks to CNG, and the other 60 are still diesel, I built the CNG station.

So one of the reasons this acquisition works so well is that we were very serious, from the very beginning, Jim and I and Tod and the rest of the team, about putting together one team building the best of the best culture, and we did that. We spent a fair amount of time on the social issues and the culture through the process so that we did become one company very quickly. So I'd be kidding myself if I said we've got 30,000 employees, there's not somebody out there who would maybe rather fly a different flag today. But I would say those are the exceptions, and they're very, very minor exceptions. We have had regular meetings with our people. We had our second annual general management conference here in February where we brought in all of our general managers and area teams and region teams from across the country. We had our key decision makers from the corporate office there, and we had close to 500 people in one room talking about the road map going forward, what we've achieved and the plans, and I'll tell you it was a pretty good vibe in the room, and you could cut the excitement with a knife. So from a culture perspective, I would say we've done a great job bringing it together, and I think everyone is pretty pumped up about where we go from here. From a synergy perspective or best practice perspective, there is talk about the parking lot as we put the synergy goals together, we found some things that we'd like to do. We just said that the company can only change so much at once. And so we put them out in the parking lot. We've been dusting some of those things off and looking at those things today and how we can continue to improve the business. But none of them in and of themself are major needle movers, but there are things that are worth $1 million, things that are worth $0.5 million, and we're going to continue to shave those pennies off of our cost and improve the way we go to market. We're going to continue to build our service, customer service experience and those kind of things. So from here on out, it's just improving on what we've built. But I would tell you that the company flies one flag, and is pretty excited about the future today."

Based on our first quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve the financial guidance provided in February. Financial and operational highlights include revenue of approximately $2 billion for the quarter. Total price growth in the quarter was 2.6%, with core price of 1%. We secured core price increases across all lines of business and continued our focus on retaining existing business that generates appropriate returns. 
Volumes declined 0.7%, which is a sequential improvement of 40 basis points, including 110 basis point improvement in Collection. This is the fourth straight quarter of sequential volume improvement in the Collection business.
Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.42. Our first quarter adjusted free cash flow was $273 million. We repurchased 5 million shares in the first quarter for $148 million. We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011.
We returned $225 million to our shareholders during the quarter. We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We recently closed a new 5 year $1.25 billion credit facility. Republic continues to extend debt maturities and lower interest costs. 
Moody's recently raised the outlook on our credit rating to positive. Republic is committed to a strategy of growing our business, improving return on capital, returning cash to shareholders and a strong credit profile.
We recently purchased 2 recycling facilities in the Midwest to enhance our recycling capabilities. Our field organization continues to effectively manage our cost structure. All controllable costs remain flat or decreased as a percentage of revenue, including labor and maintenance expenses. We achieved year to year labor productivity gains in all Collection lines of business. We saw a reduction in frequency of insurance claims. Our accident and injury frequency improved by approximately 15% as compared to 2010.

Change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: First, our core price growth of 1%. In total, the Collection lines of business saw a core price increase of 1% with all lines of business reporting positive price increases in the first quarter. 
Our total disposal core price increased by 1.3%, which includes landfill MSW of 2.1%, which was partially offset by relatively lower priced event C&D and event special waste driven work. This level of pricing is in line with our expectations for the quarter. Since our price on index based contracts tends to lag, we are still impacted by lower CPI environment that occurred in 2009 and 2010. This has not yet anniversaried. 
In 2011, we expect core price of approximately 1% in the first half of the year and in a range of 1.5% to 2% in the second half of the year. Second, our commodity revenue increase of 1%. Commodity prices increased by 19% to an average price of $149 per ton in the current quarter from $125 per ton in the prior year. Q1 recycling facility commodity volume of 478,000 tons was up approximately 13% from the prior year and up 8% on a same store basis. As Don mentioned, we've recently purchased 2 recycling facilities. 
As a reminder, our 2011 guidance was based on December 2010 average commodity prices, which at that time was about $143 a ton. If prices hold at the current April levels of about $152 a ton, our EPS would increase for the year by about $0.02. Now for reference purposes, a $10 change per ton in commodity value equals about $0.02 of EPS, and that is net of the impact of rebates.
Let me talk briefly about our fuel recovery fee, which increased by 0.6%. The increase in fuel recovery fees relates to an increase of fuel costs, obviously. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.63 in the first quarter of '11 from $2.85 in the prior year, about a 27% increase. Our 2011 guidance was based on an average fuel price of $3.42 a gallon. If prices hold at the current April levels of $4.10 per gallon, our full year EPS would decrease by about $0.05. Again, for reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is slightly less than $0.01 of EPS, which includes the impact of the fuel recovery fees. 
Now let me turn to volumes. Volumes were down 0.7% year over year. As Don indicated, this is a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter 2010 of 40 basis points. We continue to see volume improvements in the Collection business, which is now down less than 1% over the prior year. Volumes improved in all Collection lines sequentially, including a 220 basis point increase in the Industrial business and also 100 basis point sequential increase in the Commercial business. Our volumes improved despite the severe weather early in the quarter.
Our landfill and transfer station volumes had year over year growth of about 2%. This continues to reflect the positive contribution from both permanent and temporary special waste volumes. Our outlook for special waste activity remains strong, and we remain confident that we can replace or slightly exceed the volumes that we received in 2010. 
Now let me turn to our margins. First quarter year over year margins. The first quarter 2010 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.6% compared to 31.7% in the prior year. This decline in margin is primarily due to the 27% increase in the cost of diesel fuel. That's 120 basis points of negative margin impact. The average price per gallon, again, as I'd indicated, increased to $3.63 in the quarter from $2.85 in the prior year like quarter, and again, with the current prices at $4.10 a gallon. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel cost was an increase in related fuel recovery fee revenue resulting in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 80 basis points. If prices remain at this level for fuel, we will have margin headwind for the balance of the year. 
Other significant changes to margin include transfer and disposal costs. We actually had a 30 basis point improvement here, which primarily relates to the margin benefit of incremental landfill volumes that carry little or no associated disposal cost. 
Next, transportation and subcontract expenses. We had an 80 basis point improvement in margin results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network. Also, the loss of the Toronto disposal contract, which had a high level of transportation cost and the divestiture of 3 New York City transfer stations in late 2010, helped our transportation subcontract expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Risk management. Here, it's a little lumpy. The 40 basis point increase in expense relates to the change in actuarial estimates. As we've said before, we perform actuarial assessment of risk reserves each quarter, which can create volatility. We could very easily smooth the numbers through the year, but we believe this is the best practice. In 2010's first quarter, we benefited from favorable adjustments to prior plan years. The favorable adjustment was repeated in the first quarter of 2011 but not at the same level. Our net benefit was probably in the range of $2 million to $3 million.
Next, recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 50 basis point increase in expense relates to increases in rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $47 per ton from $38 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, resulting in an increased spread of approximately $15 per ton. The net impact here was obviously favorable 40 basis points in EBITDA margin. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, excluding the cost to achieve synergies, was 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase in expense relates primarily to investments in programs designed to lower cost, drive efficiency and increase productivity. We expect full year 2011 SG&A expenses to approximate 10% of revenue. 
Now let me talk briefly about our DD&A. DD&A as a percentage of revenue was relatively comparable at 11.5% in the current year versus 11.4% in the prior year. And of course, as we said before, our DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to discuss interest expense, free cash flow and the balance sheet."

On April 20, we closed a new 5 year $1.25 billion credit facility. This new facility has a fully drawn cost equal to the facility being replaced. Republic has total bank market capacity of $2.5 billion that can be used for issuing letters of credit, short term borrowing and general corporate purposes.
During Q2 of this year, we expect to refinance debt that matures throughout the year. As you remember, we started having debt maturities last November, and that'll continue through August. Notes due in May 2016 were called on April 15, and the notes that we offered to tender due in 2021 and 2035. Our EPS guidance provided in February included the favorable impact of refinancing this debt but excluded any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with extinguishments.
I will now discuss free cash flow. Q1 adjusted free cash flow was $273 million, which consisted of, first, cash provided by operating activities of $434 million less property and equipment received of $169 million plus proceeds from the sale of property of $7 million plus merger related expenditures net of tax of $1 million. And therefore, adjusted free cash flow is $273 million.
At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $840 million, and our days sales outstanding was 39 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.8 billion at March 31, and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.4 billion. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

Keep in mind, during the first half of this year, we're still working through the lower CPI environment we saw in 2009 and into 2010. As we get to July 1 in the second half of the year, we'll anniversary out those lower CPI numbers, and then we'll see CPI numbers that reflect more the full year average for 2010, which was about 1.6%. So we will see kind of a lower CPI in the first half of the year, a step up to that mid 1% in the second half of the year. And then as we see CPI develop this year, and I know we've seen a few months here getting a little bit higher pushing above 2%, we really won't see that kind of blend into our numbers until the second half of '12. As we usually state, it takes about 12 or 18 months for that CPI trend to work its way into the average price. And as we discussed on the other call, Las Vegas is a very large market for us, and there's probably one that has a longer lag than others, but because of its size it doesn't impact the corporate average. And in Las Vegas, they use a calendar year CPI, and you get that price increase the following July 1. So therefore, on July 1 of '10, we actually had to roll back our pricing by 0.4%, which was the '09 CPI number. And then what will happen this July 1, we'll get a price increase of 1.6%, and that'll be your price increase for that marketplace starting July 1 of '11 through June 30 of '12, and then potentially we'll see that higher CPI pricing come into our numbers beginning July 1 of '12.

And we were not willing to give price concession, so we lost a little volume there. So we're going to continue to focus on the infrastructure and use the assets accordingly in the marketplace."

Can you talk about whether you're seeing that in the market?"

First of all, when you see fuel going up, it tends to lag, especially when you see a substantial ramp up in fuel. We've got a 1 month lag in the surcharge. So there's a little bit of an impact there that will stay with us for the full year unless it were to drop back down this year. So I guess we'll wait and see on that. In terms of our fuel surcharge, we do not get all of it dollar for dollar. Obviously, it's about 2/3 that we get, and we have obviously some franchise customers that are on that CPI based pricing, so the fuel surcharge isn't there. So we're not able to get the full dollar for dollar recovery."

I think our customers are pretty smart folks. I think they look at total cost to serve, and that's what we try to sell our customers is there's a total cost to service. We're not hiding behind our fees. We look at our fuel recovery fee as the fairest way to deal with our customer base so that when fuel goes up, it's a big part of our cost, they share in that cost increase. When fuel goes down, they get the benefit. And so it's a different sales approach than the guy who's selling no fees. The difference is when fuel spikes, that operator has to run around and bring more fuel price increases to the customer. We're touching the customer once annually. We've got the index working for us on fuel, and we think it's the fairest way to approach the customer. Remember, we've got 150 million gallons of fuel a year, and when fuel was up $0.50, we can't just kind of run around with our hair on fire trying to find $75 million. So it works pretty well for us. It's a built in hedge, if you will, and again, I just think we're always going to have somebody out there trying to market it a different way. We don't see that from bigger companies. We generally see it from the smaller folks."

So by example, if I had 100 truck facility last year I replaced 40 of the tracks to CNG, and the other 60 are still diesel, I built the CNG station.

So one of the reasons this acquisition works so well is that we were very serious, from the very beginning, Jim and I and Tod and the rest of the team, about putting together one team building the best of the best culture, and we did that. We spent a fair amount of time on the social issues and the culture through the process so that we did become one company very quickly. So I'd be kidding myself if I said we've got 30,000 employees, there's not somebody out there who would maybe rather fly a different flag today. But I would say those are the exceptions, and they're very, very minor exceptions. We have had regular meetings with our people. We had our second annual general management conference here in February where we brought in all of our general managers and area teams and region teams from across the country. We had our key decision makers from the corporate office there, and we had close to 500 people in one room talking about the road map going forward, what we've achieved and the plans, and I'll tell you it was a pretty good vibe in the room, and you could cut the excitement with a knife. So from a culture perspective, I would say we've done a great job bringing it together, and I think everyone is pretty pumped up about where we go from here. From a synergy perspective or best practice perspective, there is talk about the parking lot as we put the synergy goals together, we found some things that we'd like to do. We just said that the company can only change so much at once. And so we put them out in the parking lot. We've been dusting some of those things off and looking at those things today and how we can continue to improve the business. But none of them in and of themself are major needle movers, but there are things that are worth $1 million, things that are worth $0.5 million, and we're going to continue to shave those pennies off of our cost and improve the way we go to market. We're going to continue to build our service, customer service experience and those kind of things. So from here on out, it's just improving on what we've built. But I would tell you that the company flies one flag, and is pretty excited about the future today."

Based on our second quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve record levels of earnings and free cash flow. Financial and operational highlights include: Revenue of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, total price growth in the quarter was 3.4%, with core price of 1%. We continue to utilize our ROI pricing tools to evaluate new opportunities and retain existing business. We expect to increase our price increases in the second half of this year in a range to 1% to 1.5%. 
Volume has declined 1%. Although the economy is recovering slowly, we have 5 consecutive quarters of total collection volume improvement. In fact, industrial halls accelerated third quarter and were you real positive in both May and June. We expect our total volume performance to be flat to slightly positive by year end. 
Our second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.49. I will update our 2011 financial guidance later in the call. Our second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $162 million. Republic's board has authorized a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend effective with the October dividend payment. 
We repurchased 3.6 million shares in the second quarter for $115 million. We are in track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011. Since November 2010, we have repurchased over 10 million shares for approximately $30 million. 
We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increase in cash returns for our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Total cash returned from shareholders in the quarter was $191 million. 
During the second quarter, we issued $1.85 million of long term debt at lower rates that maturing in cold debt. We also renewed our bank facility for five years with no increase in the effective rate. We continue to take advantage of the low rates environment to extend maturities and lower interest expense. We closed on $10 million in annual revenue from privatization contracts, including the City of Toledo, which we start servicing I that third quarter. 
We have a pipeline of quality acquisition opportunities. During 2011, we have closed on transactions involving private companies that will improve our operating density and landfill volumes. These transactions will expand our EBITDA margins and return on invested capital. Our field organization continues to target profitable growth and effectively manage our cost structure. We saw an 80-basis point improvement in our commercial collection volumes, and industrial collection is flat year-over-year. 
All controllable operating costs were either flat or decreased as a percentage of revenue. SG&A was 9.6%, which represents a 20-basis point improvement. Our safety performance continues to improve, with our frequency rate down, 13% year-over-year. I'd like to thank our field operations for their continued success in executing our strategy of achieving profitable growth, and maintaining a safe work environment for all of our people. Tod and Ed, will now update our financial performance."

Our second quarter of 2011 revenue, as Don indicated, was approximately $2.1 billion. The change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: Core price growth of positive 1%. Second quarter price was in line with first quarter an",1117,"Thanks, Don. Our second quarter of 2011 revenue, as Don indicated, was approximately $2.1 billion. The change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: Core price growth of positive 1%. Second quarter price was in line with first quarter and also, with our second quarter expectations; all lines of business, as Don indicated, report positive price; Commercial Industrial where about positive 1%, with residential somewhat lower due to the continued lagging impact of prior year's CPI. Landfill MSW price was positive 2.3%, a slight improvement from the first quarter. Within that component of our business, our third-party open market landfill customers where we are increasing price in the range of 4% down 5%. 
As I noted, second quarter price was in line with our expectations. Since our price on index-based contracts tends to lag, we're still impacted by lower CPI environments from 2009 and 2010, which have not fully anniversary. Given the current CPI environment, we expect index-based pricing to modestly improve in the second half of 2010, with further improvement throughout 2010 and into '13. Now let's talk about our commodity revenue increase of 1.3%. Commodity prices increased 22% to an average price of $147 per ton in the current quarter, from $120 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter recycling facility volumes are 526,000 tons, was up 13% from the prior year, and up 7% on a same-store basis. 
Our updated guidance assumes commodity prices remain at June levels for the remainder of the year. Also, our fuel recovery fee increased by 1.1% due to higher diesel prices. The increase in fuel recovery fees relates again to an increase in fuel costs, the average price per gallon of diesel increased to $4.01 in the second quarter of 2011, from $3.03 in the prior year, or an increase of 33%.  Currently, the price of fuel is $3.95 per gallon.  And again, our updated guidance assumes fuel prices will remain at June levels for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 1% year-over-year. We do continue to see volume improvements in the collection lines of business. Second quarter collection volume improved 30 basis points over the first quarter. Industrial volume is now flat year-over-year, and commercial volumes are only slightly negative. 
Landfill and transfer volumes were down 1.8% versus the prior year. This decline is due to year-over-year unfavorable MSW volume, along with less positive volume contribution from special waste than what we saw in the first quarter. Although second quarter MSW volume was negative, it has improved sequentially versus the first quarter by 210 basis points, and is now in the low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis.  And our second quarter special waste volume increased 2% versus a very strong prior-year comparison.  We do believe that our 2011 volumes for special waste will replace or slightly exceed the volumes we received for the full year of 2010. 
Turning our attention to second quarter year-over-year margins. Second quarter of 2011 adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.1%, compared to 31.3% in the prior year, a 20-basis point decline. The impact of the fuel cost increases, partially offset by an increase in related fuel recovery fee revenue, resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin, of 80 basis points. Excluding this net impact of fuel, our margins actually would have increased 60 basis points, and would have been 31.9% over the prior year. 
If fuel prices remain at current levels, we will continue to have a slight margin headwind for the balance of the year. Other significant changes to margins include: Labor and related benefits; we have a 20-basis points improvement, and that relates to productivity gains in all collection lines of business; our transfer and disposal costs, we saw a 40-basis points improvement, and this relates to decreased external disposal expense. This decrease is primarily due to our decision to divest the 3 New York City transfer stations, which has significantly lower disposal internalization than our average. 
Turning to transportation and subcontract expenses, we saw a 50-basis points improvement from redirected waste streams within our transfer and disposal network, and also less transportation expense as a result of the exploration of our City of Toronto contract. While there's a significant favorable margin impact to this line item, and the net impact to total market is flat as a contract was at our total company margins. 
An additional favorable impact is due to the transportation cost reductions associated with the divestiture of the New York City transfer stations, that I've previously mentioned. 
Our landfill operating costs, we saw a 30-basis point improvement, and this release a lower landfill gas management costs. The cost decrease was due to ending a subcontract relationship at several sites, and taking their workflow more effectively internally. 
Risk management costs, the 20-basis point improvement here relates to reductions in premiums charged by third-party carriers, as well as an improvement in our claims experience. I would also add and remind everybody that we do a quarterly actuarial reviews. So we're not averaging our risk management costs throughout the year and guessing it, we actually know what it is from an actuarial standpoint. 
Next, our recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 60-basis point increase in expense relates to increased rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $48 per ton from $38 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, and thus resulted in an increased spread of approximately $16 per ton.  The net impact was a favorable 40-basis points improvement in EBITDA margin. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, as Don indicated, as was 9.6% of revenue. Now this compares an equity percent of the prior year, excluding the cost of synergies in the prior year. The 20-basis point improvement relates primy to the leverage benefit of holding our SG&A dollars flat, having an increased overall revenue base. 
Republic remains very comfortable with SG&A expense of about 10%. And I would remind people, this includes 20 to 30 basis points of investments on an ongoing basis in our major initiatives. 
Turning to DD&A. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, was 10.9% in the current year, versus 11.3% in the prior year. The 40-basis point improvement, primarily relates to reductions in landfill amortization expense, as a result of expansions approved during the quarter. 
DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger in 2008. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed. He's going to discuss interest expense, free cash flow and our balance sheet"

Q2 2011 interest expense of $111 million includes $18 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the allied debt discount of $5 million will decline. On May 2, Republic issued $1.85 billion of long-term debt to refinance existing maturities. The newly-issued debt consists of: $700 million at 3.8% due in 2018; $550 million at 4.75% due in 2023; and $600 million at 5.7%, due in 2041. In addition to the 2011 maturities, we retired the following existing debt: We called $600 million of Allied Waste North America notes due in 2016 that had a coupon of 7% and an 8%; we tendered $59 million of BFI debentures due in 2021 that had a 9.25% coupon, and $183 million of BFI debentures due in 2035 that had a coupon of 7.4%. 
Our EPS guidance provided in February included the favorable impact of refinancing this debt, but excluded any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with early extinguishments. Our annual run rate interest expense after the refinancing is approximately $430 million, of which $70 million is noncash. Our refinancing activities since December of 2008, which have benefited from more investment grade status and a low-rate environment, have reduced annual interest expense by approximately $185 million. We will have additional refinancing opportunities in 2012. 
I will now discuss free cash flow. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $162 million, which consisted of: Cash provided by operating activities of $362 million, less property and equipment received of $219 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $9 million, plus merger-related expenditures, net of tax of $1 million, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $9 million. Therefore, adjusted free cash flow is $162 million. 
Now I will talk about the balance sheet. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $872 million, and our days sales outstanding was 38 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7.3 billion at June 30, and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. I'll now turn the call back to Don."

As we have talked about in the first quarter call, we are seeing some pressure on the municipal contracts that are rolling through. We have done some surprise rollbacks, some re-extensions of business in flat rates to extend that business going forward. We have been taking a very strong approach in protecting our current business. And when competitors are calling we're fiercely defending that business, we've got a great business with good, strong margins of cash flow. So the job of Republic is to protect the cash flow we have and then grow the cash flow from there. So we have seen some competitive activity out there. It's probably a not too unusual based on the fact that the economy has been as long a deep and a downward trend that it's been. So we have, we will hold it on our own. And we think they're days ahead. As far as pricing goes, we're still in the marketplace every month, effectively our pricing are open market business. As Tod said in his comments, are open market MSW price, and the landfill is between 4% and 5% in the quarter. So we're very active in the market in the open market, raising prices, and very effectively defending our business accordingly."

If we look at the first half of the year, our pricing was about 1%. If we look at the second half of the year, what we're saying today is, that there will be a modest step-up in pricing, and we believe it's in the range of 1% to 1.5%. This is primarily coming from the higher CPI environment, the anniversary-ing of lower CPI from prior years. So as we look ahead to '12, we would expect to see further step-ups to CPI, and it's just inherent in our base of business."

And then we have another -- and this is because of the refinery cleanup project in the Midwest, I think. And then there are some other things that Don mentioned on the West Coast were also a factor. And then in the fourth quarter, we had an even larger peak, and that was due to the Camp Pendelton in Southern California and Pharmanex, which was to clean up EPA-mandated in Las Vegas. So as we look at our volumes of this year, I think the difference is, we believe we will meet or exceed the total volumes for last year, but we're doing it with a broader base of smaller jobs, which is actually a good thing.

Yes, we're in 40 states, in Puerto Rico, and we're organizing 4 regions, 28 areas. But what's really important about the businesses sis the 243 markets are all uniquely different. And so when we think about how we're going to improve the business on a day-to-day operating side, we think about how we do maintenance, or how we do safety, or how we move toward automation. Those things are very similar everywhere across those 243 markets. But when you think about how we invest and grow the business, those markets are very uniquely different, and they're different because they're different competitors, different asset structure, different market dynamics, different regulations and so forth. So as it relates to recycling, when we talk about the investments we're making in recycling, they're not everywhere, because the tons aren't moving in the same way everywhere. So what we've done, the teams done here is evaluated 243 markets, we've identified 25 markets, about 10%. And we think we need to develop marketability in and around recycling, because we think the market would benefit and the customers are willing to pay for recycling, they're interested in recycling, so there's some customer demand. So what we've done in our original plan this year is we set aside about $25 million to invest in about 5 markets to begin to move that business forward. And we may, by the end of the year, invest more than $25 million, but we're doing it very, very, very cautiously, if you will, making sure that we're learning along the way in how we're going to do with best, and we've prioritized the markets accordingly. So we're excited about it, the team's actively involved in it. And we're convinced that in some of those markets, the ton is evolving and there is more recycling and diversion possible. It's not happening very rapidly, but it's important for us to be in that space. And so we're trying to bring all the solutions we need to do our customers to that. So I have a long answer to your question, but we're engaged in it, we're excited about it, and it's right smack in the core of what we do. We look like we own the waste stream today, and we want to own it tomorrow even as it changes."

So those 2 are kind of new from -- so even though CapEx is going up, the cash taxes is going to offset that. You asked about the first quarter working capital. Typically, what happens is we end up with a fair bit of capital spend at the end of the year which moves up our accounts payable. So you'll see a reversal from the first half to the second half of the year working capital, and we're very, very comfortable with the cash flow guidance that we've given, staying within that range, despite the fact that we're going to spend a little bit more this year with the pull forward."

First, take a look -- I'll just remind you -- look at our EBITDA margins, 31-plus percent. So I think that reflects a lot of things about our company. One, the have the base we have been operating capability of our people, but we watch very keenly, pricing and the return on our business. And so we're pretty proud of that margin. And I think there's some books would like to have that. As far as pricing goes, again, there is no organic growth in the marketplace. And so when you took your first economics class in high school, it's kind of supply and demand, you got that, right? It's been really long, really deep, so some of the smaller folks out there in the marketplace, get a little twitchy, and they start doing some silly things. And you can only stand by and watch it for so long. There's a couple of things going on simultaneously at Republic Services and we've talked about this before. First, we're steadily, consistently and continuously pricing our business. So in the open market, we are every month, in the market, pricing our business, in all lines of business in the open market, in every geography in the company. And we call it, ratable pricing. And we go through the year constantly through, levering up and down, if you will, depending on the market dynamic, by pricing consistently in the marketplace. So we haven't stopped that practice. When -- some time last year, we started talking about offending the business more staunchly, and we have a team out there, using ROI tool, knowing what our cash costs are, and defending a very good business space. So we might have been more willing to walk away form business 2 years before that. And then as we started to defend business, say, business at a lower rate in some cases. It's going to show up in our price metric. We didn't lose the volume, we keep the volume at a lower price per unit even though it's profitable, and it has good cash flow associated with it. As an owner of our business, you want us to do that. You want us to protect that cash flow, and we do it very well, probably better than we ever have. But that's going to show up when we report it right Cory? So the third thing we're doing out there is we're selling, right? And we're out there in the marketplace and we're looking for new opportunities as well. And we may -- we're going to compete vigorously in the marketplace as we always have. And there are some markets where we're losing share to 1 or 2 smaller competitors, and we may be more aggressive in a couple of those cases, because we can't just stand idly by. So we have not changed our pricing strategy or focus. We have not changed our return focus, but we're simultaneously pricing, saving business, and competing in the marketplace. Now when we do all the month, of all the mix, by type and line of business and geography, and the saving and the churn, that's putting some pressure on the price metric. But the activity and the philosophy and the strategy has not changed. But there's a lot of mix and math that caused those numbers to be what they are. Now first I'll go back to back to the first statement I made. Look at the 31% EBITDA margin, that shows you that we're focused at doing the right things. Every so often, we make a mistake, and we may be have some bad facts, and maybe a little over us some year there, ever some other company does that. No different than it's ever been, but we're -- we haven't changed our tune."

Based on our second quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve record levels of earnings and free cash flow. Financial and operational highlights include: revenue of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, total price growth in the quarter was 3.4%, with core price of 1%. We continue to utilize our ROI pricing tools to evaluate new opportunities and resisting high return business. We expect to achieve core price increases in the second half of this year in the range of 1% to 1.5%. 
Volume has declined 1%. Although the economy is recovering slowly, we have 5 consecutive quarters of total collection volume improvement. In fact, industrial halls accelerated through the quarter and were year-over-year positive in both May and June. We expect our total volume performance to be flat to slightly positive by year end. Our second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.49. I will update our 2011 financial guidance later in the call. 
Our second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $162 million. Republic's board has authorized a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend, effective with the October dividend payment. 
We repurchased 3.6 million shares in the second quarter for $115 million. We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011. Since November 2010, we have repurchased over 10 million shares for approximately $30 million. 
We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increase in cash returns to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Total cash returned from shareholders in the quarter was $191 million. 
During the second quarter, we issued $1.85 billion of long-term debt at lower rates than maturing in call debt. We also renewed our bank facility for 5 years with no increase in the effective rate. We continue to take advantage of the low-rate environment to extend maturities and lower interest expense. We closed on $10 million in annual revenue from privatization contracts, including the City of Toledo, which we start servicing in the third quarter. 
We have a pipeline of quality acquisition opportunities. During 2011, we have closed on transactions involving private companies that will improve our operating density and landfill volumes. These transactions will expand our EBITDA margins and return on invested capital. Our field organization continues to target profitable growth and effectively manage our cost structure. We saw an 80 basis point improvement in our commercial collection volumes, and industrial collection is flat year-over-year. 
All controllable operating costs were either flat or decreased as a percentage of revenue. SG&A was 9.6%, which represents a 20 basis point improvement. Our safety performance continues to improve, with our frequency rate down 13% year-over-year. 
I would like to thank our field operations for their continued success in executing our strategy of achieving profitable growth and maintaining a safe work environment for all of our people. Tod and Ed will now update our financial performance."
386225,134415008,148242,"Republic Services, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Our second quarter 2011 revenue, as Don indicated, was approximately $2.1 billion. The change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: core price growth of positive 1%; second quarter price was in line with first quarter and a",1127,"Thanks, Don. Our second quarter 2011 revenue, as Don indicated, was approximately $2.1 billion. The change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: core price growth of positive 1%; second quarter price was in line with first quarter and also with our second quarter expectations; all lines of business, as Don indicated, report positive price; commercial and industrial were about positive 1%, with residential somewhat lower due to the continued lagging impact of prior year's CPI. Landfill MSW price was positive 2.3%, a slight improvement from the first quarter. Within that component of our business, our third-party open market landfill customers where we are increasing price in the range of 4% to 5%. 
As I noted, second quarter price was in line with our expectations. Since our price on index-based contracts tends to lag, we're still impacted by lower CPI environments from 2009 and 2010, which had not fully anniversary-ed. Given the current CPI environment, we expect index-based pricing to modestly improve in the second half of 2010 with further improvement throughout 2010 and into '13. 
Now let's talk about our commodity revenue increase of 1.3%. Commodity prices increased 22% to an average price of $147 per ton in the current quarter from $120 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter recycling facility commodity volumes are 526,000 tons, was up 13% from the prior year and up 7% on a same-store basis. 
Our updated guidance assumes commodity prices remain at June levels for the remainder of the year. Also, our fuel recovery fee increased by 1.1% due to higher diesel prices. The increase in fuel recovery fees relates again to an increase in fuel costs, the average price per gallon of diesel increased to $4.01 in the second quarter of 2011 from $3.03 in the prior year or an increase of 33%. Currently, the price of fuel is $3.95 per gallon. And again, our updated guidance assumes fuel prices will remain at June levels for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 1% year-over-year. We do continue to see volume improvements in the collection lines of business. Second quarter collection volume improved 30 basis points over the first quarter. Industrial volume is now flat year-over-year, and commercial volumes are only slightly negative. 
Landfill and transfer volumes were down 1.8% versus the prior year. This decline is due to year-over-year unfavorable MSW volume, along with less positive volume contribution from special waste than what we saw in the first quarter. Although second quarter MSW volume was negative, it has improved sequentially versus the first quarter by 210 basis points and is now in the low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis.  
And our second quarter special waste volume increased 2% versus a very strong prior-year comparison. We do believe that our 2011 volumes for special waste will replace or slightly exceed the volumes we received for the full year of 2010. 
Turning our attention to second quarter year-over-year margins. Second quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.1% compared to 31.3% in the prior year, a 20 basis point decline. The impact of fuel cost increases, partially offset by an increase in related fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of 80 basis points. Excluding this net impact of fuel, our margins actually would have increased 60 basis points and would have been 31.9% over the prior year. 
If fuel prices remain at current levels, we will continue to have a slight margin headwind for the balance of the year. Other significant changes to margins include: labor and related benefits. We have a 20 basis points improvement, and that relates to productivity gains in all collection lines of business. Our transfer and disposal costs, we saw a 40 basis points improvement, and this relates to decreased external disposal expense. This decrease is primarily due to our decision to divest the 3 New York City transfer stations, which had significantly lower disposal internalization than our average. 
Turning to transportation and subcontract expenses, we saw a 50 basis points improvement from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network and also less transportation expense as a result of the exploration of our City of Toronto contract. While there's a significant favorable margin impact to this line item, the net impact to total margin is flat as the contract was at our total company margins. 
An additional favorable impact is due to the transportation cost reductions associated with the divestiture of the New York City transfer stations that I've previously mentioned. 
Our landfill operating costs, we saw a 30 basis point improvement, and this relates to lower landfill gas management costs. The cost decrease was due to ending a subcontract relationship at several sites and taking the workflow more effectively internally. 
Our risk management costs, the 20 basis point improvement here relates to reductions in premiums charged by third-party carriers, as well as an improvement in our claims experience. I would also add and remind everybody that we do a quarterly actuarial reviews. So we're not averaging our risk management costs throughout the year and guessing it. We actually know what it is from an actuarial standpoint. 
Next, our recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 60 basis points increase in expense relates to increased rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $48 per ton from $38 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, and thus resulted in an increased spread of approximately $16 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 40 basis points improvement in EBITDA margin. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, as Don indicated, was 9.6% of revenue. Now this compares to 9.8% in the prior year, excluding the cost to achieve synergies in the prior year. The 20 basis point improvement relates primarily to the leverage benefit of holding our SG&A dollars flat, well having an increased overall revenue base. 
Republic remains very comfortable with SG&A expense of about 10%. And I would remind people, this includes 20 to 30 basis points of investments on an ongoing basis in our major initiatives. 
Turning to DD&A. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, was 10.9% in the current year versus 11.3% in the prior year. The 40 basis point improvement, primarily relates to reductions in landfill amortization expense, as a result of expansions approved during the quarter. 
DD&A is higher-than-capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger in 19 -- in 2008. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed. He's going to discuss interest expense, free cash flow and our balance sheet."
386225,134415008,148242,"Republic Services, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tod. Q2 2011 interest expense of $111 million includes $18 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the allied debt discount of $5 million will decline. On May 2, Republic issued $1.85 billion",356,"Thanks, Tod. Q2 2011 interest expense of $111 million includes $18 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the allied debt discount of $5 million will decline. 
On May 2, Republic issued $1.85 billion of long-term debt to refinance existing maturities. The newly issued debt consists of: $700 million at 3.8% due in 2018; $550 million at 4.75% due in 2023; and $600 million at 5.7%, due in 2041. 
In addition to the 2011 maturities, we retired the following existing debt: we called $600 million of Allied Waste North American notes due in 2016 that had a coupon of 7% and an 8%; we tendered $59 million of BFI debentures due in 2021 that had a 9.25% coupon; and $183 million of BFI debentures due in 2035 that had a coupon of 7.4%. 
Our EPS guidance provided in February included the favorable impact of refinancing this debt, but excluded any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with early extinguishments. Our annual run rate interest expense after the refinancing is approximately $430 million, of which $70 million is noncash. Our refinancing activities since December of 2008, which have benefited from more investment grade status and a low-rate environment, have reduced annual interest expense by approximately $185 million. We will have additional refinancing opportunities in 2012. 
I will now discuss free cash flow. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $162 million, which consisted of: cash provided by operating activities of $362 million, less property and equipment received of $219 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $9 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of $1 million, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $9 million. Therefore, adjusted free cash flow is $162 million. 
Now I'll talk about the balance sheet. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $872 million, and our days sales outstanding was 38 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7.3 billion at June 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

I'll let Tod take the second half of that question on the sequential price for the second half. This is Don, by the way. We have -- as we talked about in the first quarter call, we are seeing some pressure on the municipal contracts that are rolling through. We have done some surprise rollbacks, some reextensions of business and flat  rates to extend that business going forward. We have been taking a very strong approach in protecting our current business. And when competitors are calling, we're fiercely defending that business. We've got a great business with good, strong margins and cash flow. So job one of Republic is to protect the cash flow we have and then grow the cash flow from there. So we have seen some competitive activity out there. It's probably a not too unusual based on the fact that the economy has been -- has long and deep and a downward trend that it's been. So we've -- we're holding our own. And we think there are better days ahead. As far as pricing goes, we're still in the marketplace every month, effectively our pricing are open market business. As Tod said in his comments are open market MSW price. And the landfill is 4 -- between 4% and 5% in the quarter. So we're very actively in the market every month in the open market, raising prices and very effectively defending our business accordingly."

And as Don indicated, we're protecting both existing business and keeping adequate returns. And the business that we acquire is also at good returns. As Don said earlier, we're using our ROI pricing model. If we look at the first half of the year, our pricing was about 1%. If we look at the second half of the year, what we're saying today is there will be a modest step-up in pricing, and we believe it's in the range of 1% to 1.5%. This is primarily coming from the higher CPI environment, the anniversary-ing of lower CPI from prior years. So as we look ahead to '12, we would expect to see further step-ups to the CPI, and it's just inherent in our base of business."

And then we kind of picked up some speed in June there. So it -- we're looking at that to hold up for us.

And then there were some other -- the other things that Don mentioned on the West Coast were also a factor. And then in the fourth quarter, we had an even larger peak, and that was due to the Camp Pendleton in Southern California and Tronics, which was a clean-up EPA-mandated in Las Vegas. So as we look at our volumes this year, I think the difference is, we believe we will meet or exceed the total volumes for last year, but we're doing it with a broader base of smaller jobs, which is actually a good thing.

Yes, we're in 40 states, in Puerto Rico. And we're organizing 4 regions, 28 areas. But what's really important about the business is the 243 markets are all uniquely different. And so when we think about how we're going to improve the business on a day-to-day operating side, we think about how we do maintenance or how we do safety or how we move toward automation. Those things are very similar everywhere across those 243 markets. But when you think about how we invest and grow the business, those markets are very uniquely different, and they're different because they're different competitors, different asset structure, different market dynamics, different regulations and so forth. So as it relates to recycling, when we talk about the investments we're making in recycling, they're not everywhere, because the tons aren't moving in the same way everywhere. So what we've done, the team's done here is evaluated 243 markets. We've identified 25 markets, about 10%. And we think we need to develop more capability in, in and around recycling because we think the market would benefit and the customers are willing to pay for recycling. They're interested in recycling so there's some customer demand. So what we've done in our original plan this year is we set aside about $25 million to invest in about 5 markets to begin to move that business forward. And we may, by the end of the year, invest a little more than $25 million. But we're doing it very, very, very cautiously, if you will, making sure that we're learning along the way in how we're going to do with it best. And we've prioritized the markets accordingly. So we're excited about it, the team's actively involved in it. And we're convinced that in some of those markets, the ton is evolving, and there is more recycling and diversion possible. It's not happening very rapidly, but it's important for us to be in that space. And so we're trying to bring all the solutions we need due to our customers through that. So I have a long answer to your question, but we're engaged in it. We're excited about it, and it's right smack in the core of what we do. We look at it like we own the waste stream today, and we want to own it tomorrow even as it changes."

Also we closed out some of our open tax issues. And so we're going to get a favorable benefit from our cash taxes. So those 2 are kind of neutral. So even though CapEx is going up, the cash tax is going to offset that. You asked about the first quarter working capital. Typically, what happens is we end up with a fair bit of capital spend at the end of the year, which moves up our accounts payable. So you'll see a reversal from the first half to the second half of the year working capital, and we're very, very comfortable with the cash flow guidance we've given, staying within that range, despite the fact that we're going to spend a little bit more this year with the pull-forward truck capital."

Look at our EBITDA margins, 31-plus percent. So I think that reflects a lot of things about our company. One, certainly the asset base we have and operating capability of our people, but we watch very keenly, pricing and the return on our business. And so we're pretty proud of that margin. And I think there's some folks who'd like to have that. As far as pricing goes, again, there is no organic growth in the marketplace. And so when you took your first economics class in high school, it's kind of supply/demand and you get that, right? It's been really long, really deep. So some of the smaller folks out there in the marketplace, get a little twitchy, and they start doing some silly things. And you can only stand by and watch it for so long. There's a couple of things going on simultaneously at Republic Services, and we've talked about this before. First, we are steadily, consistently, continuously pricing our business. So in the open market, we are every month in the market, pricing our business in all lines of business in the open market in every geography in the company. And we call it, ratable pricing. And we go through the year constantly through levering up and down, if you will, depending on the market dynamic, but pricing consistently in the marketplace. So we haven't stopped that practice. When -- some time last year, we started talking about defending the business more staunchly, and we had the team out there using ROI tools, knowing what our cash costs are and defending a very good business space. So we might have been more willing to walk away from this business 2 years before that. And then we start to defend business, say business at a lower rate in some cases. It's going to show up on our price metric. We didn't lose the volume, we keep the volume at a lower price per unit even though it's profitable, and there's good cash flow associated with it. As an owner of our business, you want us to do that. You want us to protect that cash flow, and we do it very well, probably better than we ever have. But that's going to show up in what we report as price, right, Cory? So the third thing we're doing out there is we're selling, right? And we're out there in the marketplace and we're looking for new opportunities as well. And we may -- we're going to compete vigorously with everybody in the marketplace, just like we always have. And there are some markets where we're losing share to 1 or 2 smaller competitors, and we may be more aggressive in a couple of those cases because we can't just stand idly by. So we have not changed our pricing strategy or focus. We have not changed our return focus, but we're simultaneously pricing, saving business and competing in the marketplace. Now when you do all the month of all the mix by type and line of business and geography and the saving and the churn, that's putting some pressure on the price metric. But the activity and the philosophy and the strategy has not changed. But there's a lot of mix and math that caused those numbers to be what they are. Now full circle back to the first statement I made: look at 31% EBITDA margin. That shows you that we're focused at doing the right things. Every so often, we make a mistake, and we may be -- we may have some bad facts and maybe get a little lower here or there. Every so often, some other company does that. No different than it's ever been, but we're -- we haven't changed our tune."

Based on our second quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve record levels of earnings and free cash flow. Financial and operational highlights include: revenue of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, total price growth in the quarter was 3.4%, with core price of 1%. We continue to utilize our ROI pricing tools to evaluate new opportunities and retain exisisting, high return business. We expect to achieve core price increases in the second half of this year in the range of 1% to 1.5%. 
Volume has declined 1%. Although the economy is recovering slowly, we have 5 consecutive quarters of total collection volume improvement. In fact, industrial halls accelerated through the quarter and were year-over-year positive in both May and June. We expect our total volume performance to be flat to slightly positive by year end. Our second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.49. I will update our 2011 financial guidance later in the call. 
Our second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $162 million. Republic's board has authorized a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend, effective with the October dividend payment. 
We repurchased 3.6 million shares in the second quarter for $115 million. We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011. Since November 2010, we have repurchased over 10 million shares for approximately $30 million. 
We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increase in cash returns for our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Total cash returned for shareholders in the quarter was $191 million. 
During the second quarter, we issued $1.85 billion of long-term debt at lower rates than maturing in call debt. We also renewed our bank facility for 5 years with no increase in the effective rate. We continue to take advantage of the low-rate environment to extend maturities and lower interest expense. We closed on $10 million in annual revenue from privatization contracts, including the City of Toledo, which we start servicing in the third quarter. 
We have a pipeline of quality acquisition opportunities. During 2011, we have closed on transactions involving private companies that will improve our operating density and landfill volumes. These transactions will expand our EBITDA margins and return on invested capital. Our field organization continues to target profitable growth and effectively manage our cost structure. We saw an 80 basis point improvement in our commercial collection volumes, and industrial collection is flat year-over-year. 
All controllable operating costs were either flat or decreased as a percentage of revenue. SG&A was 9.6%, which represents a 20 basis point improvement. Our safety performance continues to improve, with our frequency rate down 13% year-over-year. 
I would like to thank our field operations for their continued success in executing our strategy of achieving profitable growth and maintaining a safe work environment for all of our people. Tod and Ed will now update our financial performance."
386225,134415008,148358,"Republic Services, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Our second quarter 2011 revenue, as Don indicated, was approximately $2.1 billion. The change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: core price growth of positive 1%; second quarter price was in line with first quarter and a",1127,"Thanks, Don. Our second quarter 2011 revenue, as Don indicated, was approximately $2.1 billion. The change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: core price growth of positive 1%; second quarter price was in line with first quarter and also with our second quarter expectations; all lines of business, as Don indicated, report positive price; commercial and industrial were about positive 1%, with residential somewhat lower due to the continued lagging impact of prior year's CPI. Landfill MSW price was positive 2.3%, a slight improvement from the first quarter. Within that component of our business, our third-party open market landfill customers where we are increasing price in the range of 4% to 5%. 
As I noted, second quarter price was in line with our expectations. Since our price on index-based contracts tends to lag, we're still impacted by lower CPI environments from 2009 and 2010, which had not fully anniversary-ed. Given the current CPI environment, we expect index-based pricing to modestly improve in the second half of 2010 with further improvement throughout 2012 and into '13. 
Now let's talk about our commodity revenue increase of 1.3%. Commodity prices increased 22% to an average price of $147 per ton in the current quarter from $120 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter recycling facility commodity volumes of 526,000 tons, was up 13% from the prior year and up 7% on a same-store basis. 
Our updated guidance assumes commodity prices remain at June levels for the remainder of the year. Also, our fuel recovery fee increased by 1.1% due to higher diesel prices. The increase in fuel recovery fees relates again to an increase in fuel costs, the average price per gallon of diesel increased to $4.01 in the second quarter of 2011 from $3.03 in the prior year, or an increase of 33%. Currently, the price of fuel is $3.95 per gallon. And again, our updated guidance assumes fuel prices will remain at June levels for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 1% year-over-year. We do continue to see volume improvements in the collection lines of business. Second quarter collection volume improved 30 basis points over the first quarter. Industrial volume is now flat year-over-year, and commercial volumes are only slightly negative. 
Landfill and transfer volumes were down 1.8% versus the prior year. This decline is due to year-over-year unfavorable MSW volume, along with less positive volume contribution from special waste than what we saw in the first quarter. Although second quarter MSW volume was negative, it has improved sequentially versus the first quarter by 210 basis points and is now in the low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis.  
And our second quarter special waste volume increased 2% versus a very strong prior-year comparison. We do believe that our 2011 volumes for special waste will replace or slightly exceed the volumes we received for the full year of 2010. 
Turning our attention to second quarter year-over-year margins. Second quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.1% compared to 31.3% in the prior year, a 20 basis point decline. The impact of fuel cost increases, partially offset by an increase in related fuel recovery fee revenue, resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of 80 basis points. Excluding this net impact of fuel, our margins actually would have increased 60 basis points and would have been 31.9% over the prior year. 
If fuel prices remain at current levels, we will continue to have a slight margin headwind for the balance of the year. Other significant changes to margins include labor and related benefits. We have a 20 basis points improvement, and that relates to productivity gains in all collection lines of business. Our transfer and disposal costs, we saw a 40 basis points improvement, and this relates to decreased external disposal expense. This decrease is primarily due to our decision to divest the 3 New York City transfer stations, which had significantly lower disposal internalization than our average. 
Turning to transportation and subcontract expenses, we saw a 50 basis points improvement from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network and also less transportation expense as a result of the exploration of our City of Toronto contract. While there's a significant favorable margin impact to this line item, the net impact to total margin is flat as the contract was at our total company margins. 
An additional favorable impact is due to the transportation cost reductions associated with the divestiture of the New York City transfer stations that I've previously mentioned. 
Our landfill operating costs, we saw a 30 basis point improvement, and this relates to lower landfill gas management costs. The cost decrease was due to ending a subcontract relationship at several sites and taking the workflow more effectively internally. 
Our risk management costs, the 20 basis point improvement here relates to reductions in premiums charged by third-party carriers, as well as an improvement in our claims experience. I would also add and remind everybody that we do a quarterly actuarial review. So we're not averaging our risk management costs throughout the year and guessing it. We actually know what it is from an actuarial standpoint. 
Next, our recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 60 basis points increase in expense relates to increased rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $48 per ton from $38 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, and thus resulted in an increased spread of approximately $16 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 40 basis points improvement in EBITDA margin. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, as Don indicated, was 9.6% of revenue. Now this compares to 9.8% in the prior year, excluding the cost to achieve synergies in the prior year. The 20 basis point improvement relates primarily to the leverage benefit of holding our SG&A dollars flat, while having an increased overall revenue base. 
Republic remains very comfortable with SG&A expense of about 10%. And I would remind people, this includes 20 to 30 basis points of investments on an ongoing basis in our major initiatives. 
Turning to DD&A. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, was 10.9% in the current year versus 11.3% in the prior year. The 40 basis point improvement, primarily relates to reductions in landfill amortization expense, as a result of expansions approved during the quarter. 
DD&A is higher-than-capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger in 19 -- in 2008. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed. He's going to discuss interest expense, free cash flow and our balance sheet."

As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the allied debt discount of $5 million will decline. On May 2, Republic issued $1.85 billion",356,"Thanks, Tod. Q2 2011 interest expense of $111 million includes $18 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the allied debt discount of $5 million will decline. 
On May 2, Republic issued $1.85 billion of long-term debt to refinance existing maturities. The newly issued debt consists of: $700 million at 3.8%, due in 2018; $550 million at 4.75%, due in 2023; and $600 million at 5.7%, due in 2041. 
In addition to the 2011 maturities, we retired the following existing debt: we called $600 million of Allied Waste North American notes due in 2016 that had a coupon of 7% and an 8%; we tendered $59 million of BFI debentures due in 2021 that had a 9.25% coupon; and $183 million of BFI debentures due in 2035 that had a coupon of 7.4%. 
Our EPS guidance provided in February included the favorable impact of refinancing this debt, but excluded any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with early extinguishments. Our annual run rate interest expense after the refinancing is approximately $430 million, of which $70 million is noncash. Our refinancing activities since December of 2008, which have benefited from our investment grade status and a low-rate environment, have reduced annual interest expense by approximately $185 million. We will have additional refinancing opportunities in 2012. 
I will now discuss free cash flow. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $162 million, which consisted of: cash provided by operating activities of $362 million, less property and equipment received of $219 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $9 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of $1 million, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $9 million. Therefore, adjusted free cash flow is $162 million. 
Now I'll talk about the balance sheet. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $872 million, and our days sales outstanding was 38 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7.3 billion at June 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

I'll let Tod take the second half of that question on the sequential price for the second half. This is Don, by the way. We have -- since we talked about it on the first quarter call, we are seeing some pressure on the municipal contracts that are rolling through. We have done some surprise rollbacks, some reextensions of business and flat  rates to extend that business going forward. We have been taking a very strong approach in protecting our current business. And when competitors are calling, we're fiercely defending that business. We've got a great business with good, strong margins and cash flow. So job one of Republic is to protect the cash flow we have and then grow the cash flow from there. So we have seen some competitive activity out there. It's probably not too unusual, based on the fact that the economy has been -- has long and deep and a downward trend that it's been. So we've -- we're holding our own. And we think there are better days ahead. As far as pricing goes, we're still in the marketplace every month, effectively pricing our open market business. As Tod said in his comments, our open market MSW price and the landfill is 4 -- between 4% and 5% in the quarter. So we're very actively in the market every month in the open market, raising prices and very effectively defending our business accordingly."

On the second half, well I would add to Don that if we look at our collection business, all lines of our collection business on a unit basis, our revenue per unit is up. And as Don indicated, we're protecting both existing business and keeping it at good returns. And the business that we acquire is also at good returns. As Don said earlier, we're using our ROI pricing model. If we look at the first half of the year, our pricing was about 1%. If we look at the second half of the year, what we're saying today is there will be a modest step-up in pricing, and we believe it's in the range of 1% to 1.5%. This is primarily coming from the higher CPI environment, the anniversary-ing of lower CPI from prior years. So as we look ahead to '12, we would expect to see further step-ups to the CPI, and it's just inherent in our base of business."

And then we kind of picked up some speed in June there. So it -- we're looking at that to hold up for us.

And then there were some other -- the other things that Don mentioned on the West Coast were also a factor. And then in the fourth quarter, we had an even larger peak, and that was due to the Camp Pendleton in Southern California and Tronics, which was a clean-up EPA-mandated in Las Vegas. So as we look at our volumes this year, I think the difference is, we believe we will meet or exceed the total volumes for last year, but we're doing it with a broader base of smaller jobs, which is actually a good thing.

Yes, we're in 40 states, in Puerto Rico. And we're organizing 4 regions, 28 areas. But what's really important about the business is the 243 markets are all uniquely different. And so when we think about how we're going to improve the business on a day-to-day operating side, we think about how we do maintenance or how we do safety or how we move toward automation. Those things are very similar everywhere across those 243 markets. But when you think about how we invest and grow the business, those markets are very uniquely different, and they're different because they're different competitors, different asset structure, different market dynamics, different regulations and so forth. So as it relates to recycling, when we talk about the investments we're making in recycling, they're not everywhere, because the tons aren't moving in the same way everywhere. So what we've done, the team's done here is evaluated 243 markets. We've identified 25 markets, about 10%. And we think we need to develop more capability in, in and around recycling because we think the market would benefit and the customers are willing to pay for recycling. They're interested in recycling so there's some customer demand. So what we've done in our original plan this year is we set aside about $25 million to invest in about 5 markets to begin to move that business forward. And we may, by the end of the year, invest a little more than $25 million. But we're doing it very, very, very cautiously, if you will, making sure that we're learning along the way in how we're going to do with it best. And we've prioritized the markets accordingly. So we're excited about it, the team's actively involved in it. And we're convinced that in some of those markets, the ton is evolving, and there is more recycling and diversion possible. It's not happening very rapidly, but it's important for us to be in that space. And so we're trying to bring all the solutions we need due to our customers through that. So I have a long answer to your question, but we're engaged in it. We're excited about it, and it's right smack in the core of what we do. We look at it like we own the waste stream today, and we want to own it tomorrow even as it changes."

Also we closed out some of our open tax issues. And so we're going to get a favorable benefit from our cash taxes. So those 2 are kind of neutral. So even though CapEx is going up, the cash tax is going to offset that. You asked about the first quarter working capital. Typically, what happens is we end up with a fair bit of capital spend at the end of the year, which moves up our accounts payable. So you'll see a reversal from the first half to the second half of the year working capital, and we're very, very comfortable with the cash flow guidance we've given, staying within that range, despite the fact that we're going to spend a little bit more this year with the pull-forward truck capital."

Look at our EBITDA margins, 31-plus percent. So I think that reflects a lot of things about our company. One, certainly the asset base we have and operating capability of our people, but we watch very keenly, pricing and the return on our business. And so we're pretty proud of that margin. And I think there's some folks who'd like to have that. As far as pricing goes, again, there is no organic growth in the marketplace. And so when you took your first economics class in high school, it's kind of supply/demand and you get that, right? It's been really long, really deep. So some of the smaller folks out there in the marketplace, get a little twitchy, and they start doing some silly things. And you can only stand by and watch it for so long. There's a couple of things going on simultaneously at Republic Services, and we've talked about this before. First, we are steadily, consistently, continuously pricing our business. So in the open market, we are every month in the market, pricing our business in all lines of business in the open market in every geography in the company. And we call it ratable pricing. And we go through the year constantly through levering up and down, if you will, depending on the market dynamic, but pricing consistently in the marketplace. So we haven't stopped that practice. When -- sometime last year, we started talking about defending the business more staunchly, and we had the team out there using ROI tools, knowing what our cash costs are and defending a very good business space. So we might have been more willing to walk away from this business 2 years before that. And then we start to defend business, say business at a lower rate in some cases. It's going to show up on our price metric. We didn't lose the volume, we keep the volume at a lower price per unit even though it's profitable, and there's good cash flow associated with it. As an owner of our business, you want us to do that. You want us to protect that cash flow, and we do it very well, probably better than we ever have. But that's going to show up in what we report as price, right, Cory? So the third thing we're doing out there is we're selling, right? And we're out there in the marketplace and we're looking for new opportunities as well. And we may -- we're going to compete vigorously with everybody in the marketplace, just like we always have. And there are some markets where we're losing share to 1 or 2 smaller competitors, and we may be more aggressive in a couple of those cases because we can't just stand idly by. So we have not changed our pricing strategy or focus. We have not changed our return focus, but we're simultaneously pricing, saving business and competing in the marketplace. Now when you do all the math of all the mix by type and line of business and geography and the saving and the churn, that's putting some pressure on the price metric. But the activity and the philosophy and the strategy has not changed. But there's a lot of mix and math that caused those numbers to be what they are. Now full circle back to the first statement I made: look at 31% EBITDA margin. That shows you that we're focused at doing the right things. Every so often, we make a mistake, and we maybe -- we may have some bad facts and maybe get a little lower here or there. Every so often, some other company does that. No different than it's ever been, but we're -- we haven't changed our tune."

Based on our second quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve record levels of earnings and free cash flow. Financial and operational highlights include: revenue of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, total price growth in the quarter was 3.4%, with core price of 1%. We continue to utilize our ROI pricing tools to evaluate new opportunities and retain existing, high return business. We expect to achieve core price increases in the second half of this year in the range of 1% to 1.5%. 
Volume has declined 1%. Although the economy is recovering slowly, we have 5 consecutive quarters of total collection volume improvement. In fact, industrial halls accelerated through the quarter and were year-over-year positive in both May and June. We expect our total volume performance to be flat to slightly positive by year end. Our second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.49. I will update our 2011 financial guidance later in the call. 
Our second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $162 million. Republic's board has authorized a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend, effective with the October dividend payment. 
We repurchased 3.6 million shares in the second quarter for $115 million. We are on track to complete the existing authorization before the end of 2011. Since November 2010, we have repurchased over 10 million shares for approximately $30 million. 
We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increase in cash returns for our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Total cash returned for shareholders in the quarter was $191 million. 
During the second quarter, we issued $1.85 billion of long-term debt at lower rates than maturing in call debt. We also renewed our bank facility for 5 years with no increase in the effective rate. We continue to take advantage of the low-rate environment to extend maturities and lower interest expense. We closed on $10 million in annual revenue from privatization contracts, including the City of Toledo, which we start servicing in the third quarter. 
We have a pipeline of quality acquisition opportunities. During 2011, we have closed on transactions involving private companies that will improve our operating density and landfill volumes. These transactions will expand our EBITDA margins and return on invested capital. Our field organization continues to target profitable growth and effectively manage our cost structure. We saw an 80 basis point improvement in our commercial collection volumes, and industrial collection is flat year-over-year. 
All controllable operating costs were either flat or decreased as a percentage of revenue. SG&A was 9.6%, which represents a 20 basis point improvement. Our safety performance continues to improve, with our frequency rate down 13% year-over-year. 
I would like to thank our field operations for their continued success in executing our strategy of achieving profitable growth and maintaining a safe work environment for all of our people. Tod and Ed will now update our financial performance."
386225,134415008,148487,"Republic Services, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Our second quarter 2011 revenue, as Don indicated, was approximately $2.1 billion. The change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: core price growth of positive 1%; second quarter price was in line with first quarter and a",1127,"Thanks, Don. Our second quarter 2011 revenue, as Don indicated, was approximately $2.1 billion. The change in revenue from the prior period includes the following: core price growth of positive 1%; second quarter price was in line with first quarter and also with our second quarter expectations; all lines of business, as Don indicated, report positive price; commercial and industrial were about positive 1%, with residential somewhat lower due to the continued lagging impact of prior year's CPI. Landfill MSW price was positive 2.3%, a slight improvement from the first quarter. Within that component of our business, our third-party open market landfill customers where we are increasing price in the range of 4% to 5%. 
As I noted, second quarter price was in line with our expectations. Since our price on index-based contracts tends to lag, we're still impacted by lower CPI environments from 2009 and 2010, which had not fully anniversary-ed. Given the current CPI environment, we expect index-based pricing to modestly improve in the second half of 2010 with further improvement throughout 2012 and into '13. 
Now let's talk about our commodity revenue increase of 1.3%. Commodity prices increased 22% to an average price of $147 per ton in the current quarter from $120 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter recycling facility commodity volumes of 526,000 tons, was up 13% from the prior year and up 7% on a same-store basis. 
Our updated guidance assumes commodity prices remain at June levels for the remainder of the year. Also, our fuel recovery fee increased by 1.1% due to higher diesel prices. The increase in fuel recovery fees relates again to an increase in fuel costs, the average price per gallon of diesel increased to $4.01 in the second quarter of 2011 from $3.03 in the prior year, or an increase of 33%. Currently, the price of fuel is $3.95 per gallon. And again, our updated guidance assumes fuel prices will remain at June levels for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our volumes. Our volumes were down 1% year-over-year. We do continue to see volume improvements in the collection lines of business. Second quarter collection volume improved 30 basis points over the first quarter. Industrial volume is now flat year-over-year, and commercial volumes are only slightly negative. 
Landfill and transfer volumes were down 1.8% versus the prior year. This decline is due to year-over-year unfavorable MSW volume, along with less positive volume contribution from special waste than what we saw in the first quarter. Although second quarter MSW volume was negative, it has improved sequentially versus the first quarter by 210 basis points and is now in the low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis.  
And our second quarter special waste volume increased 2% versus a very strong prior-year comparison. We do believe that our 2011 volumes for special waste will replace or slightly exceed the volumes we received for the full year of 2010. 
Turning our attention to second quarter year-over-year margins. Second quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.1% compared to 31.3% in the prior year, a 20 basis point decline. The impact of fuel cost increases, partially offset by an increase in related fuel recovery fee revenue, resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of 80 basis points. Excluding this net impact of fuel, our margins actually would have increased 60 basis points and would have been 31.9% over the prior year. 
If fuel prices remain at current levels, we will continue to have a slight margin headwind for the balance of the year. Other significant changes to margins include labor and related benefits. We have a 20 basis points improvement, and that relates to productivity gains in all collection lines of business. Our transfer and disposal costs, we saw a 40 basis points improvement, and this relates to decreased external disposal expense. This decrease is primarily due to our decision to divest the 3 New York City transfer stations, which had significantly lower disposal internalization than our average. 
Turning to transportation and subcontract expenses, we saw a 50 basis points improvement from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network and also less transportation expense as a result of the exploration of our City of Toronto contract. While there's a significant favorable margin impact to this line item, the net impact to total margin is flat as the contract was at our total company margins. 
An additional favorable impact is due to the transportation cost reductions associated with the divestiture of the New York City transfer stations that I've previously mentioned. 
Our landfill operating costs, we saw a 30 basis point improvement, and this relates to lower landfill gas management costs. The cost decrease was due to ending a subcontract relationship at several sites and taking the workflow more effectively internally. 
Our risk management costs, the 20 basis point improvement here relates to reductions in premiums charged by third-party carriers, as well as an improvement in our claims experience. I would also add and remind everybody that we do a quarterly actuarial review. So we're not averaging our risk management costs throughout the year and guessing it. We actually know what it is from an actuarial standpoint. 
Next, our recycling cost of goods sold. The unfavorable 60 basis points increase in expense relates to increased rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $48 per ton from $38 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in cost, and thus resulted in an increased spread of approximately $16 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 40 basis points improvement in EBITDA margin. 
And finally, SG&A. SG&A expense, as Don indicated, was 9.6% of revenue. Now this compares to 9.8% in the prior year, excluding the cost to achieve synergies in the prior year. The 20 basis point improvement relates primarily to the leverage benefit of holding our SG&A dollars flat, while having an increased overall revenue base. 
Republic remains very comfortable with SG&A expense of about 10%. And I would remind people, this includes 20 to 30 basis points of investments on an ongoing basis in our major initiatives. 
Turning to DD&A. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, was 10.9% in the current year versus 11.3% in the prior year. The 40 basis point improvement, primarily relates to reductions in landfill amortization expense, as a result of expansions approved during the quarter. 
DD&A is higher-than-capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the merger in 19 -- in 2008. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed. He's going to discuss interest expense, free cash flow and our balance sheet."

As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the allied debt discount of $5 million will decline. On May 2, Republic issued $1.85 billion",356,"Thanks, Tod. Q2 2011 interest expense of $111 million includes $18 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, the portion related to the allied debt discount of $5 million will decline. 
On May 2, Republic issued $1.85 billion of long-term debt to refinance existing maturities. The newly issued debt consists of: $700 million at 3.8%, due in 2018; $550 million at 4.75%, due in 2023; and $600 million at 5.7%, due in 2041. 
In addition to the 2011 maturities, we retired the following existing debt: we called $600 million of Allied Waste North American notes due in 2016 that had a coupon of 7% and an 8%; we tendered $59 million of BFI debentures due in 2021 that had a 9.25% coupon; and $183 million of BFI debentures due in 2035 that had a coupon of 7.4%. 
Our EPS guidance provided in February included the favorable impact of refinancing this debt, but excluded any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with early extinguishments. Our annual run rate interest expense after the refinancing is approximately $430 million, of which $70 million is noncash. Our refinancing activities since December of 2008, which have benefited from our investment grade status and a low-rate environment, have reduced annual interest expense by approximately $185 million. We will have additional refinancing opportunities in 2012. 
I will now discuss free cash flow. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $162 million, which consisted of: cash provided by operating activities of $362 million, less property and equipment received of $219 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $9 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of $1 million, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $9 million. Therefore, adjusted free cash flow is $162 million. 
Now I'll talk about the balance sheet. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $872 million, and our days sales outstanding was 38 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7.3 billion at June 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

I'll let Tod take the second half of that question on the sequential price for the second half. This is Don, by the way. We have -- since we talked about it on the first quarter call, we are seeing some pressure on the municipal contracts that are rolling through. We have done some surprise rollbacks, some reextensions of business and flat  rates to extend that business going forward. We have been taking a very strong approach in protecting our current business. And when competitors are calling, we're fiercely defending that business. We've got a great business with good, strong margins and cash flow. So job one of Republic is to protect the cash flow we have and then grow the cash flow from there. So we have seen some competitive activity out there. It's probably not too unusual, based on the fact that the economy has been -- has long and deep and a downward trend that it's been. So we've -- we're holding our own. And we think there are better days ahead. As far as pricing goes, we're still in the marketplace every month, effectively pricing our open market business. As Tod said in his comments, our open market MSW price and the landfill is 4 -- between 4% and 5% in the quarter. So we're very actively in the market every month in the open market, raising prices and very effectively defending our business accordingly."

And as Don indicated, we're protecting both existing business and keeping it at good returns. And the business that we acquire is also at good returns. As Don said earlier, we're using our ROI pricing model. If we look at the first half of the year, our pricing was about 1%. If we look at the second half of the year, what we're saying today is there will be a modest step-up in pricing, and we believe it's in the range of 1% to 1.5%. This is primarily coming from the higher CPI environment, the anniversary-ing of lower CPI from prior years. So as we look ahead to '12, we would expect to see further step-ups to the CPI, and it's just inherent in our base of business."

And then we kind of picked up some speed in June there. So it -- we're looking at that to hold up for us.

And then there were some other -- the other things that Don mentioned on the West Coast were also a factor. And then in the fourth quarter, we had an even larger peak, and that was due to the Camp Pendleton in Southern California and Tronics, which was a clean-up EPA-mandated in Las Vegas. So as we look at our volumes this year, I think the difference is, we believe we will meet or exceed the total volumes for last year, but we're doing it with a broader base of smaller jobs, which is actually a good thing.

Yes, we're in 40 states, in Puerto Rico. And we're organizing 4 regions, 28 areas. But what's really important about the business is the 243 markets are all uniquely different. And so when we think about how we're going to improve the business on a day-to-day operating side, we think about how we do maintenance or how we do safety or how we move toward automation. Those things are very similar everywhere across those 243 markets. But when you think about how we invest and grow the business, those markets are very uniquely different, and they're different because they're different competitors, different asset structure, different market dynamics, different regulations and so forth. So as it relates to recycling, when we talk about the investments we're making in recycling, they're not everywhere, because the tons aren't moving in the same way everywhere. So what we've done, the team's done here is evaluated 243 markets. We've identified 25 markets, about 10%. And we think we need to develop more capability in, in and around recycling because we think the market would benefit and the customers are willing to pay for recycling. They're interested in recycling so there's some customer demand. So what we've done in our original plan this year is we set aside about $25 million to invest in about 5 markets to begin to move that business forward. And we may, by the end of the year, invest a little more than $25 million. But we're doing it very, very, very cautiously, if you will, making sure that we're learning along the way in how we're going to do with it best. And we've prioritized the markets accordingly. So we're excited about it, the team's actively involved in it. And we're convinced that in some of those markets, the ton is evolving, and there is more recycling and diversion possible. It's not happening very rapidly, but it's important for us to be in that space. And so we're trying to bring all the solutions we need due to our customers through that. So I have a long answer to your question, but we're engaged in it. We're excited about it, and it's right smack in the core of what we do. We look at it like we own the waste stream today, and we want to own it tomorrow even as it changes."

Also we closed out some of our open tax issues. And so we're going to get a favorable benefit from our cash taxes. So those 2 are kind of neutral. So even though CapEx is going up, the cash tax is going to offset that. You asked about the first quarter working capital. Typically, what happens is we end up with a fair bit of capital spend at the end of the year, which moves up our accounts payable. So you'll see a reversal from the first half to the second half of the year working capital, and we're very, very comfortable with the cash flow guidance we've given, staying within that range, despite the fact that we're going to spend a little bit more this year with the pull-forward truck capital."

Look at our EBITDA margins, 31-plus percent. So I think that reflects a lot of things about our company. One, certainly the asset base we have and operating capability of our people, but we watch very keenly, pricing and the return on our business. And so we're pretty proud of that margin. And I think there's some folks who'd like to have that. As far as pricing goes, again, there is no organic growth in the marketplace. And so when you took your first economics class in high school, it's kind of supply/demand and you get that, right? It's been really long, really deep. So some of the smaller folks out there in the marketplace, get a little twitchy, and they start doing some silly things. And you can only stand by and watch it for so long. There's a couple of things going on simultaneously at Republic Services, and we've talked about this before. First, we are steadily, consistently, continuously pricing our business. So in the open market, we are every month in the market, pricing our business in all lines of business in the open market in every geography in the company. And we call it ratable pricing. And we go through the year constantly through levering up and down, if you will, depending on the market dynamic, but pricing consistently in the marketplace. So we haven't stopped that practice. When -- sometime last year, we started talking about defending the business more staunchly, and we had the team out there using ROI tools, knowing what our cash costs are and defending a very good business space. So we might have been more willing to walk away from this business 2 years before that. And then we start to defend business, say business at a lower rate in some cases. It's going to show up on our price metric. We didn't lose the volume, we keep the volume at a lower price per unit even though it's profitable, and there's good cash flow associated with it. As an owner of our business, you want us to do that. You want us to protect that cash flow, and we do it very well, probably better than we ever have. But that's going to show up in what we report as price, right, Cory? So the third thing we're doing out there is we're selling, right? And we're out there in the marketplace and we're looking for new opportunities as well. And we may -- we're going to compete vigorously with everybody in the marketplace, just like we always have. And there are some markets where we're losing share to 1 or 2 smaller competitors, and we may be more aggressive in a couple of those cases because we can't just stand idly by. So we have not changed our pricing strategy or focus. We have not changed our return focus, but we're simultaneously pricing, saving business and competing in the marketplace. Now when you do all the math of all the mix by type and line of business and geography and the saving and the churn, that's putting some pressure on the price metric. But the activity and the philosophy and the strategy has not changed. But there's a lot of mix and math that caused those numbers to be what they are. Now full circle back to the first statement I made: look at 31% EBITDA margin. That shows you that we're focused at doing the right things. Every so often, we make a mistake, and we maybe -- we may have some bad facts and maybe get a little lower here or there. Every so often, some other company does that. No different than it's ever been, but we're -- we haven't changed our tune."

Based on our third quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve the earnings and cash flow guidance provided earlier this year. Financial and operational highlights include: Revenue of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter; total price growth in the quarter was 3.6%, with core price of a 0.7 percent. Our MSW landfill price was up by 3%, which is an improvement from Q2 levels; Q3 had positive volume growth, this is the ninth consecutive quarter of collection volume improvement; our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.53 and $1.43 year-to-date; our third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $266 million. We repurchased 6 million shares in the third quarter for $167 million. 
During the past 12 months, we have repurchased 16 million shares or 4% of our stock or $470 million. We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through repurchase and dividends. Total cash returned to the shareholders in the quarter was $242 million and $657 million year-to-date. 
We continue to be successful in retaining a high percentage of our existing contracts and have secured a number of new contracts that will improve our performance in 2012. During the third quarter, we started a new contract that privatized a residential collection operations of Toledo, Ohio. Privatization continues to be a source of revenue growth and assist municipalities with allocation of financial resources. Additionally, we will begin servicing a number of new contracts during 2012, including San Jose in Fresno, California and Hernando County in Florida. 
Our field organization continues to target profitable growth and effectively manage our cost structure. We saw a 20 basis point sequential improvement in our collection volumes. Our industrial collection volumes are now positive on a year-over-year basis. Our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue improved by 50 basis points after adjusting for the net impact of higher fuel. SG&A expense was 9.8%. We have increased the automated portion of our residential fleet by 15% this year. 58% of our residential fleet is now automated, which is already ahead of our full year ago. Our safety performance continues to improve with our frequency rate down 7% year-over-year. I would like to thank our field operations for their continued success in executing our strategy of achieving profitable growth, controlling costs and maintaining a safe work environment for our people. Tod will now update our financial performance."

Third quarter 2011 revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, a $55 million increase in the third quarter reflects internal growth, which totaled approximately 2.5%. This is the highest level reported since 2008. The change in revenue from prior",990,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2011 revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, a $55 million increase in the third quarter reflects internal growth, which totaled approximately 2.5%. This is the highest level reported since 2008. The change in revenue from prior periods includes the following key components, core price growth of 0.7%. Our commercial and industrial price were on average, up about 1% with residential remaining more competitive due to municipal and franchise contract pricing environment and the lagging impact of prior year's CPI. 
Since our price on an index-based contract tends to lag, we are impacted by the lower CPI environment of 2010, which is not fully anniversaried. Given the current CPI environment, we expect index based pricing to modestly improve in the second half of 2012. 
Our landfill MSW price, as Don indicated, was about 3%, a slight improvement from the second quarter. Within that component of our business, our third-party open market landfill customers were aware we are increasing prices in the range of 4% to 5%. Second is our fuel recovery fee, which increased by 1.2%. This increase in fuel recovery fee relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.87 in the third quarter from $294 in the prior year, a 32% increase. Currently, the price of fuel is $3.83 per gallon. We are assuming that fuel prices remain at this level for the remainder of the year. 
And the third key component is commodity revenue increase of 1.7%. Commodity prices increased 36% to an average price of $160 per ton in the term quarter or $118 per ton in prior year. Third quarter recycling facility commodity volume of 492,000 tons was up 8% from the prior year and up 2% on a same-store basis. 
In mid-October, export commodity prices declined. At current prices, our fourth quarter weighted average price is expected to decline from third quarter levels by about $20 per ton. This would negatively impact fourth quarter earnings by about $0.01 to $0.150 at an EPS basis, which includes the benefit of reduced cost of goods sold. Turning to our volumes, our volumes were positive 30 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see volume improvements in the collection lines of business. Again as Don mentioned, this is the ninth straight quarter of sequential improvement. Q3 collection volume of negative 0.4 improved 20 basis points over Q2 levels. Industrial volume is now positive year-over-year and commercial volume is only slightly negative. Our disposal volumes, consisting of landfill and transfer activity, were up 2.8% from the prior year. This increase is due to year-over-year favorable special waste and C&D volumes. Looking forward, we expect collection volumes to continue to improve, disposal volumes will be negatively due to high levels of special waste in the fourth quarter of 2010 giving us therefore a difficult year-over-year comp in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
So in total, we expect fourth quarter volumes to be flat to slightly negative. 
Now I'll discuss our third quarter year-over-year margin. Third quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7% compared to 30.8% in the prior year, a 10 basis point decline. The impact of fuel cost increases are partially by an increase in related fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of 60 basis points. Excluding the net impact of fuel, our margins would have been 31.3% or a 50 basis point expansion from the prior year. Other significant changes in margin include labor and labor-related benefits. We saw an 80 basis point improvement primarily relating to labor productivity gains in the Collection business. As Don mentioned, this includes the benefit of our fleet automation. Transfer and disposal costs, there was 50 basis point improvement, which relates to decreased external disposal expense. The decrease was primarily due to our decision to divest a 3 New York city transfer stations, which had higher than the average disposal costs. Our transportation and subcontract expenses, we saw a 20 basis point improvement, which results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network. And less transportation expense as a result of the expiration of our City of Toronto contract in December of last year. 
While there is a favorable margin impact to this line item, the net impact to total margin is flat as contract was at our total company margins. This benefit was partially offset by an unfavorable incremental surcharge from transportation providers due to increased fuel surcharges. 
At risk management, we saw a 60 basis points improvement relating to reductions in insurance premiums, as well as the continued improvement in our claims experience, as Don mentioned. Next is our recycling cost of goods sold. Here, we saw an unfavorable 80 basis point increase in expense, which relates to increased rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $55 per ton from $35 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in costs and resulted in an increased spread of approximately $22 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 50 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Finally, SG&A. SG&A expense was 9.8% of revenue, which was flat with the prior year excluding costs to achieve synergies in the prior year. We remain comfortable that our full year SG&A expense at approximately 10%, which includes 20 to 30 basis points of investment in our major initiatives. Our DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.1% in the current year versus 11.2% in the prior year. The 10 basis point improvement primarily relates to reductions in landfill amortization expense as a result of expansion secured during the quarter. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from our 19 -- 2008 mergers. Now Ed will discuss interest expense, our taxes and our free cash flow."

Third quarter 2011 interest expense of $108 million includes $18 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, a portion related to the Allied debt discount of $3 million will decline. Our effective tax rate includes a $0.04 benefit resulting from the normal process of reconciling our provision to our 2010 tax return, which was filed in September. Excluding the benefit realized in the quarter, our adjusted tax rate was about 40.5%. 
I will now discuss free cash flow. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow is $266 million, which consisted of cash provided by operating activities of $490 million -- $491 million, less property and equipment received of $214 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $7 million, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $6 million, less cash tax benefit from debt distinguishment of $24 million. Therefore, the adjusted free cash flow was $266 million. 
Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is $701 million and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance range of $875 million to $900 million. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $901 million and our days sales outstanding was 39 days or 26 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at September 30 and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.5 billion. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to make a few comments in our performance. Although core price was below our expectations, we continue to raise price and achieve productivity gains, which resulted in an improvement in our controllable costs as a percentage of revenue. If you adjust our EBITDA margins for the net impact of fuel, we would have seen a 50 basis point improvement in the third quarter. We have reached the point in our volume performance where we are through the trough created by the recession and expect that 2012 will have positive volume growth on a full year basis. We have completed the policy restructuring process and have locked in a low cost of capital with no debt maturities for the next 6 years. We are focused on investing in our core business to expand our market capabilities and generate higher returns and cash flow. Our investors will continue to benefit from our commitment to cash, total cash returns, through share repurchase and dividends. At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions."

This is Done. I know Tod followed me with some information in CPI. As you know, half of our business is index based, the portion of that is coming from the municipal sector, both in our collection and landfill lines of business. We have seen a little more attention given to the municipalities on the business extensions as it relates to price this year and in the quarter than we first anticipated. Having said that, the team is doing a great job of still extending the business. As I've said to you before, job one is to protect the cash flow and job two is to grow it. So doing a great job of business extended. Although as we said before, this our private public partnerships that we've enjoyed for a long time. And as these municipalities have been through this economy, they have looked for a little bit price release. So we've given back a little price there in extending the business through third quarter. But we think that frankly, as we said in our comments on the volume, we've come through the volume trough and we're looking at positive volume in '12. Only a portion of our Residential business renews every year or terminates every year through contracts. So as we work through this process, we think were kind of at the bottom working our way out. So overall, we've seen still pretty good rational behavior in the marketplace on the Residential business but some of the municipalities have been suffering with their tax based. But all in all, if you can look at the margin, you can see the cash flow generation, we're doing a good job in cost and we're going to continue to be strong on pricing in the marketplace."

And so what's tracking with that was what really Don was describing, which is some rollbacks with some municipalities to keep working and work with them on long-term basis and then some churn, maybe we're securing some new business at good returns at current market rate, but certainly less than what we might have seen with bids we may 5 or 6 years ago."

We've got a couple of big wins here, the privatization of Toledo is certainly a nice rollover for us. We've got the win in San Jose. So we've got the -- the organization is very focused on market growth across 243 markets on finding sort of niches where we can take advantage of volumes that exist there that maybe weren't there before. And we're still very effectively moving price out into the business. So we think we live through the trough here pretty well and well we're not economists, we're not going to necessarily play that role for you. We were thinking '12 will be a good positive volume year for us."

Again, customer buying are changing there. There's a substantial number of customers that we think would want to buy more regionally and nationally if we had the right skill set and service offering for them. So we're building up that capability and those things will start to pay big dividends in '12 and beyond.

And again, there is some seasonality to commodity. So where they are today or where they may be a month or 2 from now maybe different from where they are in the spring time, particularly when Asia starts to build up activity in preparation for the following holiday season. Regarding capital spend, yes, our original free cash flow guidance is $875 million to $900 million. Again we're very comfortable with frankly the higher end of that range. We have stepped up our capital spend this year. I think our original guidance was probably somewhere in the $740 million range, and we're probably about $100 million more than that. Based upon some of these contracts and the opportunities that we saw there to get decent return on that additional capital. But also based upon again the uncertainty with bonus appreciation, we're willing to take advantage of the 100% bonus appreciation again this year, next year its supposed to go to 50%, who knows what Congress is going to do but we're planning that it goes to 50% and therefore, we have a little bit of capital pull forward activity here to take advantage of that."

On the collection line, on the collection lines of business, the organization, the industry has been able to consistently do a good job on pricing over the last several years prior to this economic delay, right? That we're kind of have been through here. So year-on-year, good positive price growth, you've got these collection accounts that have great returns and then you get some competitive activity. You get some municipal activity to try to take some price out of that connection. Philosophically, that's the Collection business. On the landfill side of business, again half of our business there comes from municipalities. These municipalities don't compete with us, they're on larger or long-term contracts, escalators. We take a probably a similar approach to that kind of volume. But then we have open market landfill business. These are people who are in the business with garbage trucks competing with us and we don't necessarily take the same approach there. So we consistently raise prices there. As I said, about 3% in landfill. In total on that nonrestricted open market volume in the landfill, it's been more like 4% to 5%. So we've consistently priced that business. And if those volumes aren't willing to pay a higher price then we let the volume leave our system. So we're not -- we're still really safeguarding the value of our assets. We think the landfills certainly should be able to be priced higher and that's our philosophy. So what I'm saying is defend think collection business, think municipal business don't necessarily think open market landfill, it's a different sort of pricing strategy theory. On the collection side, you do have these small haulers who aren't -- don't have shareholders and don't have sort of the same rationale in their pricing behavior, who get a little fidgety where there's no organic growth, we tend to compete a little harder. We have done a good job of defending our business in the commercial small container business. And that tends to be a little more competitive behavior. In the residential system, these are much bigger accounts primarily a lot of times larger companies because of a big capital outlay. They tend to be more rational. But you have cities who are really looking for some price relief and with these long-term contracts and relationships. We need to step up and extend that business and we do that. So all in all, that really is the reason that we're at 70 bps price than a little lower than maybe we thought would be. But overall, we're still pricing every month in the marketplace through our RPM process. We continue to look to adjust services or upsell customers. We actually even have a couple of examples where we've actually raised prices at municipal accounts and extended business with additional services, so we're doing everything we can to do there. It's working pretty well for us. And as I said, I think we're at the trough year, and we're going to come through it. So other than that, it's always been a competitive business. It's the open market I think then consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And the teams did a great job on the cost control side and if you look at the margin and the cash flow, you can see that defending the business is the right strategy. And it doesn't mean that we are out there lowering prices on new business across the board but we are being selective and opportunistic for certain opportunities."

Total cash returned to the shareholders in the quarter was $242 million and $657 million year-to-date. 
We continue to be successful in retaining a high percentage of our existing contracts, and have secured a number of new contracts that will improve our performance in 2012. During the third quarter, we started a new contract that privatized a residential collection operations of Toledo, Ohio. Privatization continues to be a source of revenue growth and assist municipalities with allocation of financial resources. Additionally, we will begin servicing a number of new contracts during 2012, including San Jose in Fresno, California and Hernando County in Florida. 
Our field organization continues to target profitable growth and effectively manage our cost structure. We saw a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in our collection volumes. Our industrial collection volumes are now positive on a year-over-year basis. 
Our cost of operations, as a percentage of revenue, improved by 50 basis points after adjusting for the net impact of higher fuel. SG&A expense was 9.8%. We have increased the automated portion of our residential fleet by 15% this year. 58% of our residential fleet is now automated, which is already ahead of our full goal. Our safety performance continues to improve with our frequency rate down 7% year-over-year. I would like to thank our field operations for their continued success in executing our strategy of achieving profitable growth, controlling costs and maintaining a safe work environment for our people. 
Tod will now update our financial performance."

Third quarter 2011 revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, a $55 million increase in the third quarter reflects internal growth, which totaled approximately 2.5%. This is the highest level reported since 2008. The change in revenue from prior",968,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2011 revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, a $55 million increase in the third quarter reflects internal growth, which totaled approximately 2.5%. This is the highest level reported since 2008. The change in revenue from prior periods includes the following key components: Core price growth of 0.7%. Our commercial and industrial price were on average, up about 1%, with residential remaining more competitive due to municipal and franchise contract pricing environment and the lagging impact of prior year's CPI. 
Since our price on an index-based contract tends to lag, we are impacted by the lower CPI environment of 2010, which is not fully anniversaried. Given the current CPI environment, we expect index-based pricing to modestly improve in the second half of 2012. 
Our landfill MSW price, as Don indicated, was about 3%, a slight improvement from the second quarter. Within that component of our business, our third-party open market landfill customers where we are increasing prices in the range of 4% to 5%. 
Second is our fuel recovery fee, which increased by 1.2%. This increase in fuel recovery fee relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.87 in the third quarter from $2.94 in the prior year, a 32% increase. Currently, the price of fuel is $3.83 per gallon. We are assuming that fuel prices remain at this level for the remainder of the year. 
And the third key component is commodity revenue increase of 1.7%. Commodity prices increased 36% to an average price of $160 per ton in the third quarter or $118 per ton in prior year. Third quarter recycling facility commodity volume of 492,000 tons was up 8% from the prior year, and up 2% on a same-store basis. 
In mid-October, export commodity prices declined. At current prices, our fourth quarter weighted average price is expected to decline from third quarter levels by about $20 per ton. This would negatively impact fourth quarter earnings by about $0.01 to $0.015 on an EPS basis, which includes the benefit of reduced cost of goods sold. 
Turning to our volumes, our volumes were positive 30 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see volume improvements in the collection lines of business. Again as Don mentioned, this is the ninth straight quarter of sequential improvement. Q3 collection volume of negative 0.4 improved 20 basis points over Q2 levels. Industrial volume is now positive year-over-year and commercial volume is only slightly negative. Our disposal volumes, consisting of landfill and transfer activity, were up 2.8% from the prior year. This increase is due to year-over-year favorable special waste and C&D volumes. 
Looking forward, we expect collection volumes to continue to improve. Disposal volumes will be negatively due to high levels of special waste in the fourth quarter of 2010, giving us therefore a difficult year-over-year comp in the fourth quarter of 2011. So in total, we expect fourth quarter volumes to be flat to slightly negative. 
Now I'll discuss our third quarter year-over-year margin. Third quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7% compared to 30.8% in the prior year, a 10-basis-point decline. The impact of fuel cost increases, partially by an increase in related fuel recovery fee, revenue resulted in a net decrease and EBITDA margin of 60 basis points. Excluding the net impact of fuel, our margins would have been 31.3% or a 50-basis-point expansion from the prior year. 
Other significant changes in margin include labor and labor-related benefits. We saw an 80-basis-point improvement primarily relating to labor productivity gains in the collection business. As Don mentioned, this includes the benefit of our fleet automation. 
Transfer and disposal costs, there was 50-basis-point improvement, which relates to decreased external disposal expense. The decrease was primarily due to our decision to divest a 3 New York City transfer station, which had higher than the average disposal costs. 
Our transportation and subcontract expenses, we saw a 20-basis-point improvement, which results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network, and less transportation expense as a result of the expiration of our City of Toronto contract in December of last year. 
While there is a favorable margin impact to this line item, the net impact to total margin is flat as the contract was at our total company margins. This benefit was partially offset by an unfavorable incremental surcharge from transportation providers due to increased fuel surcharges. 
Our risk management, we saw a 60-basis-point improvement relating to reductions in insurance premiums, as well as the continued improvement in our claims experience, as Don mentioned. 
Next is our recycling cost of goods sold. Here, we saw an unfavorable 80-basis-point increase in expense, which relates to increased rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $55 per ton from $35 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in costs and resulted in an increased spread of approximately $22 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 50-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Finally, SG&A. SG&A expense was 9.8% of revenue, which was flat with the prior year excluding costs to achieve synergies in the prior year. We remain comfortable with our full year SG&A expense at approximately 10%, which includes 20 to 30 basis points of investment in our major initiatives. Our DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, was 11.1% in the current year versus 11.2% in the prior year. The 10-basis-point improvement primarily relates to reductions in landfill amortization expense as a result of expansion secured during the quarter. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from our 2008 mergers. 
Now Ed will discuss interest expense, our taxes and our free cash flow."

Third quarter 2011 interest expense of $108 million includes $18 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, a portion related to the Allied debt discount of $3 million will decline. Our effective tax rate includes a $0.04 benefit resulting from the normal process of reconciling our provision to our 2010 tax return, which was filed in September. Excluding the benefit realized in the quarter, our adjusted tax rate was about 40.5%. 
I will now discuss free cash flow. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow is $266 million, which consisted of cash provided of -- by operating activities of $490 million -- $491 million, less property and equipment received of $214 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $7 million, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $6 million, less cash tax benefit from debt extinguishment of $24 million. Therefore, the adjusted free cash flow was $266 million. 
Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is $701 million, and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance range of $875 million to $900 million. 
At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $901 million, and our days sales outstanding was 39 days or 26 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at September 30, and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.5 billion. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to make a few comments on our performance. Although core price was below our expectations, we continue to raise price and achieve productivity gains, which resulted in an improvement in our controllable costs as a percentage of revenue. If you adjust our EBITDA margins for the net impact of fuel, we would have seen a 50-basis-point improvement in the third quarter. We have reached the point in our volume performance where we are through the trough created by the recession, and expect that 2012 will have positive volume growth on a full year basis. 
We have completed the balance sheet restructuring process and have locked in a low cost of capital with no debt maturities for the next 6 years.

I know that Tod could follow me with some information on CPI. As you know, half of our business is index-based, good portion of that is coming from the municipal sector, both in our collection and landfill lines of business. We have seen a little more attention given to the municipalities on business extensions as it relates to price this year and in the quarter than we first anticipated. Having said that, the team's doing a great job of still extending the business. As I've said to you before, job one is to protect the cash flow and job two is to grow it. So we're doing a great job of getting business extended. Although as we said before, this are private/public partnerships that we've enjoyed for a long time. And as these municipalities have been through this tough economy, they have looked for a little bit price release. So we've given back a little price there in extending the business through quarter. But we think that frankly, as we said in our comments on the volume, we've come through the volume trough, and we're looking at positive volume in '12. Only a portion of our residential business renews every year or terminates every year through contracts. So as we work through this process, we think we're kind of at the bottom working our way out. So overall, we've seen still pretty good rational behavior in the marketplace on the residential business, but some of the municipalities, as you know, have been suffering with their tax base. But all-in-all, and you can look at the margin, you can see the cash flow generation. We're doing a good job on costs, and we're going to continue to be strong on pricing in the marketplace."

But as Don said, we've been successful at both retaining some of our business and then also securing this business at decent returns. So that churn rollback activity may mute a little bit the pricing that we'd see in that restricted residential side of the business or the franchise side of the business."

We have stepped up our capital spend this year. I think our original guidance was probably somewhere in the $740 million range, and we're probably about $100 million more than that. Based upon some of these contracts and the opportunities that we saw there to get decent return on that additional capital. But also based upon, again, the uncertainty with bonus appreciation, we're willing to take advantage of 100% bonus appreciation again this year. Next year it's supposed to go to 50%.

Now, on the collection line, the collection lines of business, the organization, the industry has been able to consistently do a good job on pricing over the last several years prior to this economic delays, right, that we're -- that we're kind of have been through here. So year-on-year-on-year, good positive price growth. You've got these collection accounts that have great returns, and then you get some competitive activity. You get some municipal activity to try to take some price out of that connection. Philosophically, that's the collection business. On the landfill side of business, again half of our business there comes from municipalities. These municipalities don't compete with us. They're on large or long-term contracts with kind of CPI escalators. We take a probably a similar approach to that kind of volume. But then we have open market landfill business. These are people who are in the business with garbage trucks competing with us, and we don't necessarily take the same approach there. So we've -- we; consistently raised prices there. As I said, about 3% on landfill in total. On that nonrestricted open market volume in the landfill, it's been more like 4% to 5%. So we've consistently priced that business. And if those volumes aren't willing to pay a higher price, then we let the volume leave our system. So we're not -- we're still really safeguarding the value of our assets. We think the landfills certainly should be able to be priced higher, and that's our philosophy. So when I try to fiercely defend, think collection business, think municipal business, don't necessarily think open market landfill. It's a different sort of a pricing strategy theory. On the collection side, you've got -- you do have these small haulers who aren't -- don't have shareholders and don't have sort of the same sort of rationale in their pricing behavior, who get a little fidgety where there's no organic growth. We tend to compete a little harder. We have done a good job of defending our business in the commercial small container business. And that tends to be a little more competitive behavior. In the residential system, these are much bigger accounts; primarily a lot of times larger companies because of the big capital outlay. They tend to be more rational. But you have cities who are really looking for some price relief. And with these long-term contracts and relationships, we need to step up and extend that business, and we do that. So it's all-in-all, that really is the reason that we're at 70 bps price than a little lower than maybe we thought we'd be. But overall, we're still pricing every month in the marketplace through our RPM process. We continue to look to adjust services or upsell customers. We actually even have a couple of examples where we've actually raised prices at municipal accounts, and extended business with additional services. So we're doing everything we can to do there. It's working pretty well for us. And as I said, I think we're at the trough year, and we're going to come through it. So other than that, it's always been a competitive business. It's -- the open market, I think, been consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And the team's did a great job on the cost control side. And if you look at the margin and the cash flow, you can see that defending good business is the right strategy. And it doesn't mean that we're out there lowering prices on new business across the board, but we are being selective and opportunistic for certain opportunities."

Based on our third quarter performance, Republic Services is on track to achieve the earnings and cash flow guidance provided earlier this year. Financial and operational highlights include: Revenue of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter; total price growth in the quarter was 3.6%, with core price of a 0.7%; our MSW landfill price was up by 3%, which is an improvement from Q2 levels; Q3 had positive volume growth, this is the ninth consecutive quarter of collection volume improvement; our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.53 and $1.43 year-to-date; our third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $266 million; we repurchased 6 million shares in the third quarter for $167 million. 
During the past 12 months, we have repurchased 16 million shares or 4% of our stock for $470 million. We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through repurchase and dividends. Total cash returned to the shareholders in the quarter was $242 million and $657 million year-to-date. 
We continue to be successful in retaining a high percentage of our existing contracts, and have secured a number of new contracts that will improve our performance in 2012. During the third quarter, we started a new contract that privatized a residential collection operations of Toledo, Ohio. Privatization continues to be a source of revenue growth and assist municipalities with allocation of financial resources. Additionally, we will begin servicing a number of new contracts during 2012, including San Jose and Fresno, California and Hernando County in Florida. 
Our field organization continues to target profitable growth and effectively manage our cost structure. We saw a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in our collection volumes. Our industrial collection volumes are now positive on a year-over-year basis. 
Our cost of operations, as a percentage of revenue, improved by 50 basis points after adjusting for the net impact of higher fuel. SG&A expense was 9.8%. We have increased the automated portion of our residential fleet by 15% this year. 58% of our residential fleet is now automated, which is already ahead of our full goal. Our safety performance continues to improve with our frequency rate down 7% year-over-year.

386225,141337442,179783,"Republic Services, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2011 revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, a $55 million increase in the third quarter reflects internal growth, which totaled approximately 2.5%. This is the highest level reported since 2008. The change in revenue from prior",970,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2011 revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, a $55 million increase in the third quarter reflects internal growth, which totaled approximately 2.5%. This is the highest level reported since 2008. The change in revenue from prior periods includes the following key components: Core price growth of 0.7%. Our commercial and industrial price were on average, up about 1%, with residential remaining more competitive due to municipal and franchise contract pricing environment and the lagging impact of prior year's CPI. 
Since our price on an index-based contract tends to lag, we are impacted by the lower CPI environment of 2010, which is not fully anniversaried. Given the current CPI environment, we expect index-based pricing to modestly improve in the second half of 2012. 
Our landfill MSW price, as Don indicated, was about 3%, a slight improvement from the second quarter. Within that component of our business, our third-party open market landfill customers where we are increasing prices in the range of 4% to 5%. 
Second is our fuel recovery fee, which increased by 1.2%. This increase in fuel recovery fee relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.87 in the third quarter from $2.94 in the prior year, a 32% increase. Currently, the price of fuel is $3.83 per gallon. We are assuming that fuel prices remain at this level for the remainder of the year. 
And the third key component is commodity revenue increase of 1.7%. Commodity prices increased 36% to an average price of $160 per ton in the third quarter or $118 per ton in prior year. Third quarter recycling facility commodity volume of 492,000 tons was up 8% from the prior year, and up 2% on a same-store basis. 
In mid-October, export commodity prices declined. At current prices, our fourth quarter weighted average price is expected to decline from third quarter levels by about $20 per ton. This would negatively impact fourth quarter earnings by about $0.01 to $0.015 on an EPS basis, which includes the benefit of reduced cost of goods sold. 
Turning to our volumes, our volumes were positive 30 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see volume improvements in the collection lines of business. Again as Don mentioned, this is the ninth straight quarter of sequential improvement. Q3 collection volume of negative 0.4 improved 20 basis points over Q2 levels. Industrial volume is now positive year-over-year and commercial volume is only slightly negative. Our disposal volumes, consisting of landfill and transfer activity, were up 2.8% from the prior year. This increase is due to year-over-year favorable special waste and C&D volumes. 
Looking forward, we expect collection volumes to continue to improve. Disposal volumes will be negative due to high levels of special waste in the fourth quarter of 2010, giving us therefore a difficult year-over-year comp in the fourth quarter of 2011. So in total, we expect fourth quarter volumes to be flat to slightly negative. 
Now I'll discuss our third quarter year-over-year margin. Third quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7% compared to 30.8% in the prior year, a 10-basis-point decline. The impact of fuel cost increases, partially offset by an increase in related fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in a net decrease and EBITDA margin of 60 basis points. Excluding the net impact of fuel, our margins would have been 31.3% or a 50-basis-point expansion from the prior year. 
Other significant changes in the margin include labor and labor-related benefits. We saw an 80-basis-point improvement primarily relating to labor productivity gains in the collection business. As Don mentioned, this includes the benefit of our fleet automation. 
Transfer and disposal costs, there was 50-basis-point improvement, which relates to decreased external disposal expense. The decrease was primarily due to our decision to divest a 3 New York City transfer stations, which had higher than the average disposal costs. 
Our transportation and subcontract expenses, we saw a 20-basis-point improvement, which results from redirecting waste streams within our transfer and disposal network, and less transportation expense as a result of the expiration of our City of Toronto contract in December of last year. 
While there is a favorable margin impact to this line item, the net impact to total margin is flat as the contract was at our total company margins. This benefit was partially offset by an unfavorable incremental surcharge from transportation providers due to increased fuel surcharges. 
Our risk management, we saw a 60-basis-point improvement relating to reductions in insurance premiums, as well as the continued improvement in our claims experience, as Don mentioned. 
Next is our recycling cost of goods sold. Here, we saw an unfavorable 80-basis-point increase in expense, which relates to increased rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold at our recycling facilities increased to an average of $55 per ton from $35 in the prior year. Commodity revenue increases more than offset this increase in costs and resulted in an increased spread of approximately $22 per ton. The net impact was a favorable 50-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margin.
Finally, SG&A. SG&A expense was 9.8% of revenue, which was flat with the prior year excluding costs to achieve synergies in the prior year. We remain comfortable with our full year SG&A expense at approximately 10%, which includes 20 to 30 basis points of investment in our major initiatives. Our DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, was 11.1% in the current year versus 11.2% in the prior year. The 10-basis-point improvement primarily relates to reductions in landfill amortization expense as a result of expansion secured during the quarter. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, due to the amortization of intangibles resulting from our 2008 mergers. 
Now Ed will discuss interest expense, our taxes and our free cash flow."

Third quarter 2011 interest expense of $108 million includes $18 million of noncash amortization. As we continue to refinance our debt, a portion related to the Allied debt discount of $3 million will decline. Our effective tax rate includes a $0.04 benefit resulting from the normal process of reconciling our provision to our 2010 tax return, which was filed in September. Excluding the benefit realized in the quarter, our adjusted tax rate was about 40.5%. 
I will now discuss free cash flow. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow is $266 million, which consisted of cash provided of -- by operating activities of $490 million -- $491 million, less property and equipment received of $214 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $7 million, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $6 million, less cash tax benefit from debt extinguishment of $24 million. Therefore, the adjusted free cash flow was $266 million. 
Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is $701 million, and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance range of $875 million to $900 million. 
At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $901 million, and our days sales outstanding was 39 days or 26 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at September 30, and excess credit availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.5 billion. 
I will now turn the call back to Don."

Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to make a few comments on our performance. Although core price was below our expectations, we continued to raise price and achieve productivity gains, which resulted in an improvement in our controllable costs as a percentage of revenue. If you adjust our EBITDA margins for the net impact of fuel, we would have seen a 50-basis-point improvement in the third quarter. We have reached the point in our volume performance where we are through the trough created by the recession, and expect that 2012 will have positive volume growth on a full year basis. 
We have completed the balance sheet restructuring process and have locked in a low cost of capital with no debt maturities for the next 6 years.

This is Don. And I'll let Tod follow me with some information on CPI. As you know, half of our business is index-based, good portion of that is coming from the municipal sector, both in our collection and landfill lines of business. We have seen a little more attention given to the municipalities on business extensions as it relates to price this year and in the quarter than we first anticipated. Having said that, the team's doing a great job of still extending the business. As I've said to you before, job one is to protect the cash flow and job two is to grow it. So we're doing a great job of getting business extended. Although as we said before, this are private/public partnerships that we've enjoyed for a long time. And as these municipalities have been through this tough economy, they have looked for a little bit price relief. So we've given back a little price there in extending the business through quarter. But we think that frankly, as we said in our comments on the volume, we've come through the volume trough, and we're looking at positive volume in '12. Only a portion of our residential business renews every year or terminates every year through contracts. So as we work through this process, we think we're kind of at the bottom working our way out. So overall, we've seen still pretty good rational behavior in the marketplace on the residential business, but some of the municipalities, as you know, have been suffering with their tax base. But all-in-all, and you can look at the margin, you can see the cash flow generation. We're doing a good job on costs, and we're going to continue to be strong on pricing in the marketplace."

Again, customer buying habits are changing there. There's a substantial number of customers that we think would want to buy more regionally and nationally if we have the right skill set and service offering for them. So we're building out that capability. And those things will start to pay big dividends in '12 and beyond. But these things are all slow-moving as far as the integration process and the change management. So these things don't get done overnight.

Regarding capital spend, yes, we -- our original free cash flow guidance is $875 million to $900 million. Again, we're very comfortable with frankly, the higher end of that range. We have stepped up our capital spend this year. I think our original guidance was probably somewhere in the $740 million range, and we're probably about $100 million more than that. Based upon some of these contracts and the opportunities that we saw there to get decent return on that additional capital. But also based upon, again, the uncertainty with bonus appreciation, where we're going to take advantage of 100% bonus appreciation again this year. Next year it's supposed to go to 50%.

The fact is, Dallas is really one of the few major cities that has a landfill of any size like that, that flow control could be an impact.

So it's kind of an anomaly to have a city that size of Dallas that has the ability to legally do flow control. So we're not concerned about it overall.

Now, on the collection line, the collection lines of business, the organization, the industry has been able to consistently do a good job on pricing over the last several years prior to this economic malaise, right, that we're -- that we've kind of have been through here. So year-on-year-on-year, good positive price growth. You've got these collection accounts that have great returns, and then you get some competitive activity. You get some municipal activity to try to take some price out of that collection. Philosophically, that's the collection business. On the landfill side of business, again half of our business there comes from municipalities. These municipalities don't compete with us. They're on large or long-term contracts with kind of CPI escalators. We take a probably a similar approach to that kind of volume. But then we have open market landfill business. These are people who are in the business with garbage trucks competing with us, and we don't necessarily take the same approach there. So we've -- we; consistently raised prices there. As I said, about 3% on landfill in total. On that nonrestricted open market volume in the landfill, it's been more like 4% to 5%. So we've consistently priced that business. And if those volumes aren't willing to pay a higher price, then we let the volume leave our system. So we're not -- we're still really safeguarding the value of our assets. We think the landfills certainly should be able to be priced higher, and that's our philosophy. So when I say fiercely defend, think collection business, think municipal business, don't necessarily think open market landfill. It's a different sort of a pricing strategy theory. On the collection side, you've got -- you do have these small haulers who aren't -- don't have shareholders and don't have sort of the same sort of rationale in their pricing behavior, who get a little fidgety where there's no organic growth and tend to compete a little harder. We have done a good job of defending our business in the commercial small container business. And that tends to be a little more competitive behavior. In the residential system, these are much bigger accounts; primarily a lot of times larger companies because of the big capital outlay. They tend to be more rational. But you have cities who are really looking for some price relief. And with these long-term contracts and relationships, we need to step up and extend that business, and we do that. So it's all-in-all, that really is the reason that we're at 70 bps price than a little lower than maybe we thought we'd be. But overall, we're still pricing every month in the marketplace through our RPM process. We continue to look to adjust services or upsell customers. We actually even have a couple of examples where we've actually raised prices at municipal accounts, and extended business with additional services. So we're doing everything we can to do there. It's working pretty well for us. And as I said, I think we're at the trough here, and we're going to come through it. So other than that, it's always been a competitive business. It's -- the open market's, I think, been consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And the teams did a great job on the cost control side. And if you look at the margin and the cash flow, you can see that defending good business is the right strategy. And it doesn't mean that we're out there lowering prices on new business across the board, but we are being selective and opportunistic for certain opportunities."
