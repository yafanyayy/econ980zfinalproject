Following my remarks, Larry Stone will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results. We delivered solid results for the quarter, including earnings that exceeded o",1254,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Following my remarks, Larry Stone will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results. We delivered solid results for the quarter, including earnings that exceeded our guidance, and I would like to thank our more than 234,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. 
Sales for the quarter increased 3.1%, and comparable store sales increased 1.1%. Our domestic comparable store sales increase was 1.3%. Our fourth quarter sales benefited from a strong start to the holiday season resulting in great sell-through of seasonal products. However, difficult winter weather negatively impacted performance in the month of January. Comp average ticket was up 1.9% in the fourth quarter, but comp traffic was down slightly. New store cannibalization reduced comps by approximately 35 basis points in the quarter.
We continue to be pleased with our merchandising strategies and seasonal sell-through, which helped us deliver 60 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. We also leveraged expenses and delivered earnings per share of $0.21, an increase of 50%, which exceeded our guidance for the quarter. We used third-party data to gauge our retail market penetration. From a rolling four-quarter basis, we maintained our total unit market share with gains in 10 of our 19 product categories, including strong gains in hardware and tools.
I'm pleased with our inventory position at the end of the fourth quarter, which was up less than 1% year-over-year. Since the end of the first quarter, we have carefully managed our purchases, driven exceptional seasonal sell-through and rationalized our assortments. Most importantly, we were able to accomplish this without sacrificing in-stock levels. 
Overall, what drove household spending picked up late in the year, it remain constrained by higher employment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. And, while consumer confidence rose in February to its highest level since February 2008, it remained close to the Lowe's of the prior recession and near historical Lowe's. According to our fourth quarter consumer survey, fewer homeowners feel the economy will get worse before it gets better, with the number of homeowners who feel the recession is not over remains high and approximately 45% of those homeowners tell us that they do not anticipate changing their spending plans as they move into 2011, evidence that consumers at large remain cautious.
Now let me address some of the management changes from the past few months. We're proud to have one of the deepest and most experienced leadership teams in retail, both the long tenured team that will be retirements and rotations from time to time. In mid-November, Mid Kantor, Executive Vice President of Merchandising announced his retirement after 37 years with the company. At the end of January, Larry Stone, President and Chief Operating Officer, announced his retirement after 42 years of service. Both have enjoyed long and successful careers at Lowe's making many important and lasting contributions. Though we knew this day would come and our thorough succession planning process had us prepared for the changes. We do not plan to fill the President and Chief Executive Officer after Larry's retirement. So Larry and I will work together over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition and reporting structure for his direct reports. Bob, a veteran of Lowe's has assumed the role of Executive Vice President of Merchandising. Mike Brown, a 26 year veteran of Lowe's, has been appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer. And Rick Taman, a 30-year veteran Lowe's has assumed the role of the Executive Vice President store operations. We're fortunate to have a skilled and talented leadership team to make these rotations effective and seamless.
At our analyst conference in November, we shared our belief that we can grow by focusing on the opportunity we have with existing customers by growing a greater share of wallet. We also reviewed the steps we've taken to begin the transformation from a home improvement retailer to home improvement company. Our commitments to deliver better customer experiences by pulling together the best combination of possibilities, support and value for customers. To deliver on this commitment we must remain focused on cost effective operations. At the end of January, to further align hours with customer demand, we restructured our store management roles and implemented weekend teams. Larry will provide more details about these changes in a few minutes. 
Let me share a few milestones from fourth quarter that give us confidence that we can deliver better experiences. First, to increase our share position in major appliances, we launched prepared services at the end of September. The was complete in mid-November enhancing our advantage program to provide after sales service for customers. We now own the repair experience, taking the phone calls, troubleshooting a problem and assisting with the resolution. This furthermore will drive incremental repeat customer visits with purchases across the store. Additional benefits the include repair parts sales, additional extended protection plan sales and the reduction in the return rate. We're also able to accumulate data about manufacturer to help identify defects with our merchants to resolve quality issues. We will roll off this concept to outdoor power equipment in mid-2011.
Second, our e-commerce team generated a significant amount of interest with our social media campaigns during the quarter. On two separate occasions, we were recognized at the second and third fastest growing site on Facebook, and we recently surpassed 500,000 fans. We also done a $1 million leveraging Facebook fans to publicize the event and allocate the funds to competing charities. We reached key customer segments through online media, which allows us to better monitor and influence sentiment from this highly influential and vital group of customers. The social media and improvements we've made to our lowes.com platform such as improved search capabilities new navigation and expanded marketing reach, we experienced a 32% increase in online conversion rates in the fourth quarter. 
Lastly, we lost our mobile site in December building a foundation that will allow customers to continue their shopping experience regardless of their location. We have 1 million visits to our mobile site within the first month of the launch, and while we're very pleased with customer adoption of the site, we're looking forward to significantly more expansion as we make incremental improvements to the site and as our marketing efforts ramp throughout 2011. We're also excited to launch our first mobile app in early 2011, as well as the foundation and release of My Lowe's, our customer focused portal with capabilities that allow customers to more efficiently projects to improve their homes. 
As we look to 2011, it looks our Buddhist stabilizing and, while certain housing market appear to be heading in the right direction, home prices are still hurdle. are expecting another 5% to 8% drop in medium home prices by the fourth quarter of 2011 to two an increase in the sales of distressed housing. The result is a housing model that is recovering more slowly than the overall economy. In addition, consumers are increasingly concerned about inflation over the next 12 months as the price of raw materials and oil service and manufacturing wages in China continue to increase.
So while uncertainty of the market remains, the economy recovery is continuing. And as I said before, we're prepared to operate effectively in a slow growth environment. Thanks again for your interest, and I'll turn it over to Larry Stone to provide more detail up for the quarter and the year. Larry?"

This morning, I will review our fourth quarter performance and then provide an update on our operational measures and our success that I covered during our analyst and investor conference in November. As Robert mentioned,",1632,"Thanks, Robert, and good morning. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter performance and then provide an update on our operational measures and our success that I covered during our analyst and investor conference in November. As Robert mentioned, we finished the quarter with positive comps of 1.1%. Performance exceeded the average in the non-coastal regions of the U.S. particularly the upper Midwest, South central and southwest. Comparable store's average ticket increased 1.9%, continuing to stabilize we experienced in the first three quarters of 2010. This work noted in this average ticket growth occurred despite appliances comping just above the company average. Comp transactions decreased 0.08% year-over-year declining in January after increasing in November and in December. The largest wins from December and January occurred within the lower Midwest and Southern regions affected by January snowstorms. While we are confident that obstruction from the snowstorm produced our total quarterly comp sales, we did sell a tremendous amount of blowers, shovels and ice melt. We were able to meet this demand through the use of our predictive weather analytics combined with our advanced logistics systems, which helped us out product in stock where customers needed it most.
Looking forward to the first quarter, we expect sales to benefit from post-storm repair guttering, landscaping and other exterior products. In addition, we continue to look for ways to drive more transactions in our stores. As we enter spring, we are amplifying the message in around our low price guarantee and remix in our media spend, and we're also more customer facing ours in our stores during the weekends. From a product category perspective, our strongest comp growth for the quarter was in seasonal living, tools, lawn and landscape, and millwork.
Seasonal performance are driven by holiday assortments and seasonal heating products. We holiday decoration items placed in our storms early and drive great sell-through record fewer markdowns with inventory at the end of the season. Seasonal heat and light removal products benefited from the harsh winter. Strong tool sales reflected exciting innovation from our vendors and are clear targeted to strategy, which drove higher unit growth especially for hand tools.
Snow shovels and ice melt in landscape comp growth water Electrical Group was mostly due to copper inflation. Strength in Millwork was primarily in windows and exterior doors. Our project exteriors or PSEs combined with focus SOS helped customers take advantage of the tax credit where energy efficient improvements expired at year end. As with Cash for Appliances, we see some opportunities to drive additional sales by quickly executing program to help customers benefit from government incentives.
Additionally, the project special exteriors program helped us increase our 2010 installed comp sales by over 10% with the greatest growth occurring in Millwork, lumber and building materials. In fact, fourth quarter comparable store sales or ticket less than $50 increase roughly 0.5%, while those over $500 increased roughly 1%. The better comp performance and tickets over $500 was mostly due to strong sales of products handled through our PSE program. We expect to obtain further comp benefit from this program as we anniversaried last year's ramp up. Our lower comp in product categories include countertops, plumbing, outdoor power equipment, home organization and flooring. Within outdoor power equipment, snowblower sales affected this year's snowstorms only partially offset lower comps and generators due to last year's severity December eye storms along the East Coast.
Home organization sales drive some kitchen organization products have struggled, but we expect improve our sales in these categories in 2011. Finally, in our department, land and wood products have not performed for our expectations, but we do have plans in place to improve the performance of this category in 2011.
On the other hand, positive comps in carpet continued as customers responded enthusiastically to our free installation of most recognizable brand of stain resistant carpet, STAINMASTER. 
Fourth quarter gross margin improved 60 basis points with margin rate increasing in 12 of our 19 product categories. Gains in many of these categories are attributable to our expansion in based product optimization, which are two elements of our local merchandising strategy. We have better aligned our price with our stores' competitive circumstances, and we are have successful in the base price optimization tool to find the best balance of unit volume and margin rate to optimize margin dollars.
For seasonal living products, we entered the holiday season and carefully manage sell-through in order to minimize markdowns. There has been concern in the market about potentially negative margin impact of inflation. In 2010, we experienced cost inflation rough electrical, rough plumbing, lumber and Millwork and we have been able to pass most of these cost through our retail pricing. However, we are also aware that inflationary pressures on imported products. These pressures caused by growing it wage inflation, overseas markets and increasing cost for fuel and raw materials such as steel. In fact, we have received request for price increases from some of our vendors. We believe that we can work with our vendors to minimize these increases and pass along the majority of these cost in our retail pricing.
We leveraged operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Bob will walk you through the details but once the source of leverage was payroll. Fourth quarter payroll leverage resulted from a decision to freeze hiring in advance of our event restructuring of our store organization. Despite this leverage, we're gratified to see ongoing strength in our fourth quarter customer focus scores. 
Looking forward, I like to cover a couple of recent store organization changes that would strengthen our ability to serve customers and operate our stores more efficiently. First, as we be store openings, we did time to change our store management structure and continued to put more hours on the sales floor in order to better serve customers. Therefore, we have reorganized our store structure by consolidating the zone, operations, sales and administrative management team into a single level assistant store manager structure. This structure fully empowers our system managers to drive the business and allows them to manage all team members in the area of responsibility. On average, this change resulted in a reduction of one management position per store.
Second, we're implementing a weekend team in each store. In addition to our hiring, we will hire part-time employees to Friday, Saturday and Sunday to increase our ability to serve our customers on these peak days. Customers will see more invoice on the floor, and we believe the structure will yield increased sales and improve customer service. Although the primary purpose of these changes to make our store management structure more effective and to deploy more hours to serve customers when they enter our stores, net savings of these changes will largely offset the cost of our 2011 wage increases.
We have continued to balance our inventory. At the end of the first quarter, inventory was 9.8% above last year, which was due to purchases in appliance and flooring. Over the last three quarters, we have carefully managed our purchases in these categories, and we drove the sectional sell-through in the fourth quarter and our seasonal and tool categories. We ended the fourth quarter 0.09% above last year despite a 2% higher store count and fourth quarter comp sales growth. Even so, we have maintained our service-level, and as on this call, we're ready for spring across the country with the right items such as outdoor patio furniture, grills, lawn and garden products to meet customers demand.
Before I finish, I'd like to our update on how we plan to make progress on 2011 on the metrics of success I've discussed on our analyst and investor conference, and Bob will take you through the guidance in more detail. First, we will grow sales 1% to 2% faster than the market. Our 2011 market share growth will be driven by better alignment of our teams and resources to meet customers' evolving needs. And as I already shared with you, we expect sales to benefit from weekend teams all implementation of our PSE program, adjust our media mix and more aggressively best our low price guarantee. We also expect to have additional transactions to revamp selling skills and better training for our Associates. Further, as Robert discussed, we continue to make great progress in improving our online presence, which should lead to more purchases online and in the store.
This growth in market share in addition to opening highly productive stores with a greater presence in designated population urban markets should help us make progress towards our second measure of success, rolling sales per square foot to $304 in 2015.
Third, we expect to grow EBIT 20 basis points for each 100 basis points above a 1% comp. In 2011, we will obtain most of this grow through expense leverage. SG&A will benefit from the store structure changes we've already announced and through continued efforts of our cost reduction committee. A cross-functional team that searches opportunities across our company to get more value from every dollar we spend. Finally, we set a goal of improved inventory turns about 25% over the next five years. We made solid progress on rightsizing our inventories at the end of 2010, and we expect to continue that progress in 2011 as we review the depth and breadth of our assortments and roll out integrated planning and execution or IP&E. Let's focus on the category or mix merchants and logistic teams better context for making inventory decisions.
At the end of 2011, we look forward to updating you again on our progress towards our five-year operational goals. Thanks for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our fourth quarter financial results. Bob?"
180871,127195636,105376,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2011",2011-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $10.5 billion, which represents a 3.1% increase over last year's fourth quarter. In Q4, total average ticket increased by 2.3% to $61.34, and total customer count increased 0.08%",1666,"Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $10.5 billion, which represents a 3.1% increase over last year's fourth quarter. In Q4, total average ticket increased by 2.3% to $61.34, and total customer count increased 0.08%. Comp sales were 1.1% for the quarter with was within our guidance of flat to 2%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were positive 2% in November, positive 2.8% in December and negative 2.5% in January. Our monthly comps in the quarter were impacted by both the holiday shift and weather. This year, New Year's holiday fell on Saturday, which was the first day of our fiscal January where last year fell on Friday, which is the last day in fiscal December. This shift aided December and hurt January comps. Adjusting for this shift, comps would have been positive 1.7% for December and negative 0.8% in January.
As you heard from Larry, the sales of storm-related products in January were not sufficient to offset the negative impact to our normal customer traffic patterns. For the quarter, comp average ticket increased 1.9%, while comp transactions decreased 0.08%. With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the fourth quarter included Millwork, tools, rough electrical, seasonal living, lawn and landscape and appliances. Rough plumbing performed at approximately the overall corporate average. For the year, comp sales were 1.3% and total sales increased 3.4% to $48.8 billion. 2010 was our first positive comp year since 2005.
For 2010, comp transactions increased 0.9%, and comp average ticket increased 0.5%. For the year, the categories that performed above-average included tools, lumbered, rough electrical, seasonal living, household power equipment, lawn and landscape and appliances. Millwork and paint performed approximately the overall corporate average.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 35.55% of sales, an increase of 60 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The primary driver of gross margin expansion in the quarter was base price optimization and patch area expansion, and we estimate the favorable impact was approximately 25 basis points. In addition, product inflation, better seasonal sell-through, a higher proportion of private label products, less reset activity and lower inventory all aided gross margin in the quarter. For the year, gross margin of 35.14% of sales represents an increase of 28 basis points over fiscal 2009.
SG&A for Q4 was 26.64% of sales, which leveraged 65 basis points. The primary driver of SG&A leverage in the quarter was bonus expense. We were excited to against large bonus accruals in last year's fourth quarter versus more normal trends in this year's Q4. As a result, bonus expense leveraged 56 basis points in this year's fourth quarter. Also in the quarter, we experienced leverage in store payroll, impairment of discontinued projects and advertising. Store payroll leverage in Q4 despite them $50 million pretax impact associated with the store management and restructuring changes Larry described. 
Lastly, we experienced the leverage in the quarter associated with private label credit, profit taxes, bankcard expense and other income. The deleverage in other income relates to our share of the bank card income anti-trust settlement received in Q4 2009. For the year, SG&A was 44.6% of sales and leveraged 25 basis points to 2009.
Depreciation at 3.74% of sales totaled $392 million and leveraged 21 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes increased 146 basis points to 5.17% of sales. For the year, up 7.29% represents an increase of 70 basis points over 2009. Interest expense at $86 million for the quarter deleveraged 27 basis points as a percentage of sales. The increase in interest is attributable to the $1.5 billion increase in net debt at year end relative to last year. 
For the quarter, total expenses were 31.2% of sales and leveraged 59 basis points. Pretax earnings for the quarter were 4.35% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% versus 36.3% for Q4 last year. For the year, the effective tax rate was 37.7% compared with 36.9% for 2009. Q4 net earnings of $285 million increased 39% versus last year. Earnings per share of $0.21 for the quarter exceeded our guidance of $0.16 to $0.19 and increased 50% versus last year's $0.14.
For fiscal 2010, earnings per share of $1.42 were up 17.4% versus 2009 and came in at the high-end of our original 2010 guidance of $1.30 to $1.42 provided last February. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $652 million. Our fourth quarter inventory balance of $8.3 billion increased $72 million or 0.9% versus Q4 last year. The increase was due to square footage growth of 2% and distribution inventory offset by a comp store inventory reduction of 4.4%. Inventory turnover calculated by taking a trailing fourth quarter cost of sales by average inventory for the last five quarters was 3.63%, a decrease of two basis points from Q4 2009. At the end of the fourth quarter, we owned 89% of our stores. Return on assets determined using a trailing fourth quarter earnings divided by average assets for the last five quarters increased 52 basis points to 5.81%.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, we finished the year with no short-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with accounts payable of $4.4 billion, which was a 1.5% increase over Q4 last year. In the fourth quarter, we issued $1 billion of unsecured bonds in two tranches, $475 million of five and a half year notes with a two in 18% interest rate and $525 million, 10 and a half feared issued with 3.75% interest rate. As a result, our total debt balance at the end of the quarter to $6.6 billion.
Our debt-to-equity ratio was 36.3% compared to 26.6% to the end of 2009. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.7x. Return on invested capital measured using a trailing four quarters of earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity over the last five quarters increased 84 basis points for the quarter to 9%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. For the year, cash flow from operations was almost $3.9 billion and cash used in profit in property acquired was just over $1.3 billion resulting of free cash flow of $2.5 billion, which was 12% higher than 2010. During the quarter, we repurchased 41.4 million shares at an average price of $24.15 for a total repurchase amount of $1 billion.
For the year, we repurchased almost 112 million shares of 7.7% of our beginning share count. In total, we repurchased $2.6 billion in 2010 and had $2.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. We expect the first quarter total sales increase of approximately 2%, which assumes comp sales of essential flat and square footage growth of approximately 2%. In Q1, we faced difficult comparisons associated with last year's cash program, which we estimate aided first quarter 2009 comps by 65 basis points. Gross margin is expected to be up slightly in Q1 2010 as a percentage of sales. 
For SG&A, we anticipate deleverage of 40 to 50 basis points. This delever just turbine by a number of factors, including insurance, proprietary credit and expenses associated with investments we are making with customer experiences. Recycling against leverage in our casualty insurance program in last year's first quarter due to a decrease in actuarial projected losses during the period. Depreciation for Q1 is expected to be approximately $360 million and leveraged roughly 30 basis points. As a result, during Q4 earnings and interest and taxes for the quarter expected to decrease by 10 to 20 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.7% for the quarter and for the year. We expect earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.38, which is flat to last year's $0.34 at the low-end an increase of 12% on the upper-end.
Prior to getting our outlook for the year, I wanted to highlight our fiscal 2011 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Lowe's fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to the end of January. This means we have a 53rd week every five or six years. Our last 53-week year was fiscal 2005. For the year, we estimate that the 53rd week will increase total sales by approximately 1.6% and earnings per share by approximately $0.02. In 2011, we expect to open 25 to 30 stores resulting in an increase in square footage of approximately 1.5%. We're estimating 2011 comp sales to be positive 1% to 2%, and with the impact of 53rd week, we expect total sales increase of approximately 5%. For the fiscal year, we're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 30 basis points. For 2011, we expect depreciation expense of about $1.5 billion and interest expense of approximately $350 million.
This would yield earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.72, which represents an increase of 13% to 21% over 2010. And looking at our guidance relative to the first call, the mean estimate for the year falls within the middle of our guided range. However, first quarter appears to be heavy and Q4 appears to be light by about $0.02 each relative to our expectations. 
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.6 billion. Our capital plan for 2011 is approximately $1.8 billion was roughly $100 million funded by operating leases resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion. Our guidance assumes approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases for 2011 spread evenly across fourth quarters.

As we look at the comps versus overall performance for the quarter, we're pleased with obviously we met our numbers. We look at some of the items in the quarter, and what was discussed yesterday on the competition's call, if we look at Black Friday, we had great performance on Black Friday probably one of our best days ever the entire weekend, great receptivity to lowes.com in some of the things we're doing there. We weren't aggressive as others were with respect to appliances in the promotions that took with appliances around our Black Friday. So I think that certainly impacted our numbers as you see. We were just slightly above average comps on appliances for the quarter. The other thing is that Winter products we had a great quarter in Winter products that double-digit comes on the tub of the quarter was a record year in 2009. But quite frankly, by the time we got to January, we were out of products. For all intents and purposes I smells remaining shovels thought we're around. So we know that we missed some opportunities there because obviously the winter was much harder than we expected even though that we did have great performance. I think Larry talked in his comments a little bit about store staffing and the fact part of what we're acting to with the weekend team is we know we haven't had enough hours on the floor on the store on weekends, which is when we were short from customer our facing time. As Larry mentioned, we had a hire and freeze inflation restructure to get reset after the change that took place that we were probably a little light in some areas in the quarter we were setting up to do that. But in great shape for spring. We got the plans in place, the hiring is already started, and we think we're going to be in great shape to capitalize on spring sales. If you're in to make a change like that, obviously, the fourth quarter is the best time of the year to do it because that's our lowest volume part of the year. And then I guess finally, on kitchen cabinets was an area that we probably was not as promotional as some of the others during the quarter, and then I think it was also some comments about HVAC insulation. we're really not in the business of the tax credits that we would have had similar results from some of the energy stored tax credit stuff but not in HVAC. So a little bit service kind of from market share. We maintained our market share growth categories, so we're pleased with that, and we think we're in a great shape with the changes we made from an inventory position. Our inventory is and what we're doing from a staffing standpoint as we head into spring. So Greg I'd ask you to talk about the next numbers?"

There's a lot of things that we didn't efficiencies with 103 that have to just go back into our other families of stores and improve the shopping experience for the customer just a couple of things on our seasonal side. It will look better merchandise, our patio furniture, our outdoor power equipment were lower as a things like that and really created a much improved shopping experience for some of the we have with the 103 and those would've produced square footage than to figure out how to make store better.

Following my remarks, Larry Stone will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results. We delivered solid results for the quarter, including earnings that exceeded our guidance, and I would like to thank our more than 234,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. 
Sales for the quarter increased 3.1%, and comparable store sales increased 1.1%. Our domestic comparable store sales increase was 1.3%. Our fourth quarter sales benefited from a strong start to the holiday season resulting in great sell-through of seasonal products. However, difficult winter weather negatively impacted performance in the month of January. Comp average ticket was up 1.9% in the fourth quarter, but comp traffic was down slightly. New store cannibalization reduced comps by approximately 35 basis points in the quarter.
We continue to be pleased with our merchandising strategies and seasonal sell-through, which helped us deliver 60 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. We also leveraged expenses and delivered earnings per share of $0.21, an increase of 50%, which exceeded our guidance for the quarter. We used third-party data to gauge our retail market penetration. From a rolling four-quarter basis, we maintained our total unit market share with gains in 10 of our 19 product categories, including strong gains in hardware and tools.
I'm pleased with our inventory position at the end of the fourth quarter, which was up less than 1% year-over-year. Since the end of the first quarter, we have carefully managed our purchases, driven exceptional seasonal sell-through and rationalized our assortments. Most importantly, we were able to accomplish this without sacrificing in-stock levels. 
Overall, while growth in household spending picked up late in the year, it remained constrained by higher employment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. And, while consumer confidence rose in February to its highest level since February 2008, it remained close to the lows of the prior recession and near historical lows. 
According to our fourth quarter consumer survey, fewer homeowners feel the economy will get worse before it gets better. But the number of homeowners who feel the recession is not over remains high, and approximately 45% of those homeowners tell us that they do not anticipate changing their spending plans as they move into 2011, evidence that consumers at large remain cautious.
Now let me address some of the management changes from the past few months. We were proud to have one of the deepest and most experienced leadership teams in retail. But with the long-tenured team, there will be retirements and rotations from time to time. In mid-November, Nick Canter, Executive Vice President of Merchandising announced his retirement after 37 years with the company. 
At the end of January, Larry Stone, President and Chief Operating Officer, announced his retirement after 42 years of service. Both have enjoyed long and successful careers at Lowe's making many important and lasting contributions. Though we knew this day would come and our thorough succession planning process had us prepared for the changes, we do not plan to fill the President and Chief Operating Officer position after Larry's retirement. So Larry and I will work together over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition and reporting structure for his direct reports. Bob Gfeller, an 11-year veteran of Lowe's, has assumed the role of Executive Vice President of Merchandising. Mike Brown, a 26-year veteran of Lowe's, has been appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer. And Rick Damron, a 30-year veteran of Lowe's has assumed the role of the Executive Vice President, Store Operations. We're fortunate to have a skilled and talented leadership team to make these rotations effective and seamless.
At our analyst conference in November, we shared our belief that we can grow by focusing on the opportunity we have with existing customers by growing a greater share of wallet. We also reviewed the steps we've taken to begin the transformation from a home improvement retailer to a home improvement company. Our commitment is to deliver better customer experiences by pulling together the best combination of possibilities, support and value for customers. But to deliver on this commitment, we must remain focused on cost effective and efficient operations. At the end of January, to further align parallel hours with customer demand, we restructured our store management roles and implemented weekend teams. Larry will provide more details about these changes in a few minutes. 
Let me share a few milestones from the fourth quarter that give us confidence that we can deliver better experiences. First, to increase our share position in major appliances, we launched repair services at the end of September. The phase rollout was complete in mid-November enhancing our Appliance Advantage program to provide after sales service for customers. We now own the repair experience, taking the phone calls, troubleshooting a problem and assisting with the resolution. This furthermore will drive incremental repeat customer visits with purchases across the store. Additional benefits include repair and parts sales, additional Extended Protection Plan sales and the reduction in plan return rate. We're also able to accumulate data about manufacturer to help identify defects and work with our merchants to resolve quality issues. We will roll off this concept to outdoor power equipment in mid-2011.
Second, our e-commerce team generated a significant amount of interest with our social media campaigns during the quarter. On two separate occasions, we were recognized as the second and third fastest growing site on Facebook, and we recently surpassed 500,000 fans. We also donated $1 million leveraging Facebook fans to publicize the event and allocate the funds to competing charities. We reached key customer segments through online media, which allows us to better monitor and influence sentiment from this highly influential and vital group of customers. With the social media and improvements we've made to our lowes.com platform such as improved search capabilities, new navigation and expanded marketing reach, we experienced a 32% increase in online conversion rates in the fourth quarter. 
Lastly, we launched our mobile site in December building a foundation that will allow customers to continue their shopping experience regardless of their location. We have 1 million visits to our mobile site within the first month of the launch, and while we're very pleased with customer adoption of the site, we're looking forward towards significantly more expansion as we make incremental improvements to the site and as our marketing efforts ramp throughout 2011. We're also excited to launch our first Mobile App ! in early 2011, as well as the foundational release of My Lowe's, our customer focused portal with capabilities that allow customers to more efficiently manage projects and improve their homes. 
As we look to 2011, it appears that our employment is stabilizing. And while certain housing market indicators appear to be heading in the right direction, home price is still a hurdle. Our commerce are expecting another 5% to 8% drop in medium home prices by the fourth quarter of 2011 due to an increase in the sales of distressed housing. The result is a housing model that is recovering more slowly than the overall economy. In addition, consumers are increasingly concerned about inflation over the next 12 months as the price of raw materials and oil service and manufacturing wages in China continue to increase.
So while uncertainty in the market remains, the economy recovery is continuing. And as I've said before, we're prepared to operate effectively in a slow-growth environment. Thanks again for your interest, and I'll now turn it over to Larry Stone to provide more details from the quarter and the year. Larry?"

This morning, I will review our fourth quarter performance and then provide an update on our operational measures of our success I covered during the analyst and investor conference in November. As Robert mentioned, we fi",1698,"Thanks, Robert, and good morning. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter performance and then provide an update on our operational measures of our success I covered during the analyst and investor conference in November. As Robert mentioned, we finished the quarter with positive comps of 1.1%. Performance exceeded the company average in the non-coastal regions of the U.S. particularly the upper Midwest, South Central and desert Southwest. Comparable stores average ticket increased 1.9%, continuing to stabilizing trend we experienced in the first three quarters of 2010. It is worth to know that this average ticket growth occurred despite appliances comping just above the company average. Comp transactions decreased 0.08% year-over-year declining in January after increasing in November and in December. The largest wins from December to January occurred within the lower Midwest and Southern regions affected by January snowstorms. While we are confident that the destruction from the snowstorm produced our totally quarterly comp sales, we did sell a tremendous amount of snow blowers, shovels and ice melt. We were able to meet this demand through the use of our predictive weather analytics combined with our advanced logistics systems, which helped us to have product in stock where customers needed it most.
Looking forward to the first quarter, we expect sales to benefit from post-storm repair of roofing, guttering, landscaping and other exterior products. In addition, we continue to look for ways to drive more transactions in our stores. As we enter spring, we are amplifying the message in and around our low price guarantee and remix in our media spend, and we're also equipping more customer facing hours in our stores during the weekends. From a product category perspective, our strongest comp growth for the quarter was in seasonal living, tools, lawn and landscape, rough electrical and millwork.
Season-related performance are driven by our holiday assortments and seasonal heating products. We boast of  holiday decoration items with wide appeal placed in their storage early and drove great sell-through requiring fewer markdowns with the inventory at the end of the season. Seasonal heat and light snow removal products benefited from the harsh winter. Strong tool sales reflected exciting innovation from our vendors and are clear targeted gift under strategy, which drove higher unit growth especially for hand tools.
Snow shovels and ice melt drove our lawn and landscape comp growth, while rough electric growth was mostly due to copper inflation. Strength in millwork was primarily in windows and exterior doors. Our Project Specialist Exteriors or PSEs combined with focus SOS conversions helped customers take advantage of the tax credits for energy efficient improvements that expired at year end. As with Cash for Appliances, we've seized some opportunities to drive additional sales by quickly executing programs that helped customers benefit from government incentives.
Additionally, the Project Specialist Exteriors program helped us increase our 2010 installed comp sales by over 10% with the greatest growth occurring in millwork, lumber and building materials. In fact, fourth quarter comparable store sales from tickets less than $50 decreased roughly 0.5%, while those over $500 increased roughly 1%. The better comp performance in tickets over $500 was mostly due to strong sales of products handled through our PSE program. We expect to obtain further comp benefit from this program as we anniversaried last year's ramp up. Our lower comp in product categories include the cabinets and countertops, fashion plumbing, outdoor power equipment, home organization and flooring. Within outdoor power equipment, snow blower sales after this year's snowstorms only partially offset lower comps and generators due to last year's severe December ice storm along the East Coast.
Home organization sales that drive some kitchen organization products have struggled, but we expect to improve our sales in these categories in 2011. Finally, in our flooring department, land and wood products have not performed true to our expectations, but we do have plans in place to improve the performance to this category in 2011.
On the other hand, positive comps in carpet continued as customers responded enthusiastically to our free installation of most recognizable brand of stain-resistant carpet, STAINMASTER. 
Fourth quarter gross margin improved 60 basis points with margin rate increasing in 12 of our 19 product categories. Gains in many of these categories are attributable to our patch area expansion and base price optimization, such are two elements of our local merchandising strategy. We have better aligned our price with our stores' competitive circumstances, and we are successful in the base price optimization tool to find the best balance of unit volume and margin rate to optimize margin dollars.
For seasonal living products, we entered the holiday season early and carefully managed sell-through in order to minimize markdowns. There has been concern in the market about potentially negative impact have been marginally impacted inflation. In 2010, we experienced cost inflation in rough electrical, rough plumbing, lumber and millwork, and we have been able to pass most of these costs through our retail pricing. However, we are also aware that inflationary pressures on imported products. These pressures are caused by growing wage inflation, overseas markets and increasing cost for fuel and raw materials such as steel. In fact, we have received request for price increases from some of our vendors. We believe that we can work with our vendors to minimize these increases and pass along the majority of these cost in our retail pricing.
We leveraged operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Bob will walk you through the details, but once the source of leverage was payroll. Fourth quarter payroll leverage resulted from our decision to freeze hiring in advance of our event restructuring of our store organization. Despite this leverage, we're gratified to see ongoing strength in our fourth quarter customer focus scores. 
Looking forward, I like to cover a couple of recent store organization changes that would strengthen our ability to serve customers and operate our stores more efficiently. First, as we start our base store openings, we knew it was time to change our store management structure and we continued to put more hours on sales floor in order to better serve customers. Therefore, we have reorganized our store stat and structure by consolidating the zone, operations, sales and administrative management team into a single-level assistant store manager structure. This structure fully empowers our system managers to drive the business and allows them to manage all team members in their area of responsibility. On average, this change resulted in the reduction of one management position per store.
Second, we're implementing a weekend team in each store. In addition to our April hiring, we will hire part-time employees dedicated to Friday, Saturday and Sunday to increase our ability to serve customers on these peak days. Customers will see more employees on the floor, and we believe the structure will yield increased sales and improved customer service. Although the primary purpose of these changes to make our store management structure more effective and to deploy more hours to serve customers when they enter our stores, net savings from these changes will largely offset the cost of our 2011 wage increases.
We have continued to balance our inventory. At the end of the first quarter, inventory was 9.8% above last year, which was due to this initiative purchases in appliance and flooring. Over the last three quarters, we have carefully managed our purchases in these categories, and we drove the exceptional sell-through in the fourth quarter in our seasonal and tool categories. We ended the fourth quarter 0.09% above last year, despite a 2% higher store count and fourth quarter comp sales growth. Even so, we have maintained our service-level, and as of this call, we're ready for spring across the country with the right items such as outdoor patio furniture, grills and lawn and garden products to meet customers' demand.
Before I finish, I'd like to our update on how we plan to make progress in 2011 on the metrics of success I've discussed during our analyst and investor conference, and Bob will take you through the guidance in more detail. First, we will grow sales 1% to 2% faster than the market. Our 2011 market share growth will be driven by better alignment of our teams and resources to meet customers' evolving needs. And as I already shared with you, we expect sales to benefit from the employment of weekend teams or the implementation of our PSE program, adjusting our media mix and more aggressively, vesting our best our low price guarantee. We also expect to have additional transactions to revamp selling skills and better training for our associates. Further, as Robert discussed, we continue to make great progress in improving our online presence, which should lead to more purchases online and in the store.
This growth in market share, in addition to opening highly productive stores with a greater presence in densely populated urban markets should help us make progress towards our second measure of success, rolling sales per square foot to $304 in 2015.
Third, we expect to grow EBIT 20 basis points for each 100 basis points above a 1% comp. In 2011, we will obtain most of this growth through expense leverage. SG&A will benefit from the store structure changes we've already announced and through  continued efforts of our cost reductions committee, a cross-functional team that searches for opportunities across our company to get more value from every dollar we spend. 
Finally, we set a goal of improved inventory turns about 25% over the next five years. We made solid progress on rightsizing our inventories at the end of 2010, and we expect to continue that progress in 2011 as we review the depth and breadth of our assortments and roll out integrated planning and execution or IP&E. And hedge start with some of the roll, each category price are mixed with our merchants' and logistic team's better context for making inventory decisions.
At the end of 2011, we look forward to updating you again on our progress towards our five-year operational goals. Thanks for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our fourth quarter financial results. Bob?"
180871,127195636,105552,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2011",2011-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $10.5 billion, which represents a 3.1% increase over last year's fourth quarter. In Q4, total average ticket increased by 2.3% to $61.34, and total customer count increased 0.08%",1675,"Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $10.5 billion, which represents a 3.1% increase over last year's fourth quarter. In Q4, total average ticket increased by 2.3% to $61.34, and total customer count increased 0.08%. Comp sales were 1.1% for the quarter which was within our guidance of flat to 2%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were positive 2% in November, positive 2.8% in December and negative 2.5% in January. Our monthly comps in the quarter were impacted by both the holiday shift and weather. This year, New Year's holiday fell on Saturday, which was the first day of our fiscal January, where last year it fell on Friday, which is the last day in fiscal December. This shift aided December and hurt January comps. Adjusting for this shift, comps would have been positive 1.7% for December and negative 0.8% in January.
As you heard from Larry, the sales of storm-related products in January were not sufficient to offset the negative impact to our normal customer traffic patterns. For the quarter, comp average ticket increased 1.9%, while comp transactions decreased 0.08%. With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the fourth quarter included millwork, tools, rough electrical, seasonal living, lawn and landscape and appliances. Rough plumbing performed at approximately the overall corporate average. For the year, comp sales were 1.3% and total sales increased 3.4% to $48.8 billion. 2010 was our first positive comp year since 2005.
For 2010, comp transactions increased 0.9% and comp average ticket increased 0.5%. For the year, the categories that performed above-average included tools, lumber, rough electrical, seasonal living, household power equipment, lawn and landscape and appliances. Millwork and paint performed, at approximate, the overall corporate average.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 35.55% of sales, an increase of 60 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The primary driver of gross margin expansion in the quarter was base price optimization and patch area expansion, and we estimate the favorable impact was approximately 25 basis points. In addition, product inflation, better seasonal sell-through, a higher proportion of private label products, less reset activity and lower inventory shrink all aided gross margin in the quarter. For the year, gross margin of 35.14% of sales represents an increase of 28 basis points over fiscal 2009.
SG&A for Q4 was 26.64% of sales, which leveraged 65 basis points. The primary driver of SG&A leverage in the quarter was bonus expense. We were cycled against large bonus accruals in last year's fourth quarter versus more normal trends in this year's Q4. As a result, bonus expense leveraged 56 basis points in this year's fourth quarter. Also in the quarter, we experienced leverage in store payroll, impairment of discontinued projects and advertising. Store payroll leverage in Q4 despite the $50 million pretax severance impact associated with the store management restructuring changes Larry described. 
Lastly, we experienced deleverage in the quarter associated with private label credit, profit taxes, bankcard expense and other income. The deleverage in other income relates to our share of the bank card anti-trust settlement received in Q4 2009. For the year, SG&A was 44.6% of sales and leveraged 25 basis points to 2009.
Depreciation at 3.74% of sales totaled $392 million and leveraged 21 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes increased 146 basis points to 5.17% of sales. For the year, up 7.29% represents an increase of 70 basis points over 2009. Interest expense at $86 million for the quarter deleveraged 27 basis points as a percentage of sales. The increase in interest is attributable to the $1.5 billion increase in net debt at year end relative to last year. 
For the quarter, total expenses were 31.2% of sales and leveraged 59 basis points. Pretax earnings for the quarter were 4.35% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% versus 36.3% for Q4 last year. For the year, the effective tax rate was 37.7% compared with 36.9% for 2009. Q4 net earnings of $285 million increased 39% versus last year. Earnings per share of $0.21 for the quarter exceeded our guidance of $0.16 to $0.19 and increased 50% versus last year's $0.14.
For fiscal 2010, earnings per share of $1.42 were up 17.4% versus 2009 and came in at the high-end of our original 2010 guidance of $1.30 to $1.42 provided last February. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $652 million. Our fourth quarter inventory balance of $8.3 billion increased $72 million or 0.9% versus Q4 last year. The increase was due to square footage growth of 2% and distribution inventory offset by a comp store inventory reduction of 4.4%. Inventory turnover calculated by taking a trailing fourth quarter cost of sales but by average inventory for the last five quarters was 3.63%, a decrease of two basis points from Q4 2009. At the end of the fourth quarter, we owned 89% of our stores. Return on assets determined using a trailing fourth quarter earnings divided by average assets for the last five quarters increased 52 basis points to 5.81%.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, we finished the year with no short-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with accounts payable of $4.4 billion, which was a 1.5% increase over Q4 last year. In the fourth quarter, we issued $1 billion of unsecured bonds in two tranches, $475 million of five and a half year notes with 2.18% interest rate and $525 million, 10 and a half year feared issued with 3.75% interest rate. As a result, our total debt balance at the end of the quarter to $6.6 billion.
Our debt-to-equity ratio was 36.3% compared to 26.6% to the end of 2009. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.7x. Return on invested capital measured using a trailing four quarters of earnings plus tax adjusted interest, divided by average debt and equity over the last five quarters increased 84 basis points for the quarter to 9%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. For the year, cash flow from operations was almost $3.9 billion and cash used and profit acquired was just over $1.3 billion resulting of free cash flow of $2.5 billion, which was 12% higher than 2010. During the quarter, we repurchased 41.4 million shares at an average price of $24.15 for a total repurchase amount of $1 billion.
For the year, we repurchased almost 112 million shares or 7.7% of our beginning share count. In total, we repurchased $2.6 billion in 2010 and had $2.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. We expect the first quarter total sales increase of approximately 2%, which assumes comp sales of essential flat and square footage growth of approximately 2%. In Q1, we faced difficult comparisons associated with last year's Cash for Appliances program, which we estimate aided first quarter 2009 comps by 65 basis points. Gross margin is expected to be up slightly in Q1 2010 as a percentage of sales. 
For SG&A, we anticipate deleverage of 40 to 50 basis points. This deleverage is driven by a number of factors including insurance, proprietary credit and expenses associated with investments we are making with customer experiences. We are cycling against leverage in our casualty insurance program and last year's first quarter due to a decrease in actuarial projected losses during the period. Depreciation for Q1 is expected to be approximately $360 million and leveraged roughly 30 basis points. As a result, earnings for interest and taxes for the quarter are expected to decrease by 10 to 20 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.7% for the quarter and for the year. We expect earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.38, which is flat to last year's $0.34 at the low-end and an increase of 12% on the upper-end.
Prior to getting into our outlook for the year, I wanted to highlight that our fiscal 2011 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Lowe's fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to the end of January. This means we have a 53rd week every five or six years. Our last 53-week year was fiscal 2005. For the year, we estimate that the 53rd week will increase total sales by approximately 1.6% and earnings per share by approximately $0.02. In 2011, we expect to open 25 to 30 stores resulting in an increase in square footage of approximately 1.5%. We're estimating 2011 comp sales to be positive 1% to 2%, and with the impact of 53rd week, we expect total sales increase of approximately 5%. For the fiscal year, we're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 30 basis points. For 2011, we expect depreciation expense of about $1.5 billion and interest expense of approximately $350 million.
The sum of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.72, which represents an increase of 13% to 21% over 2010. And looking at our guidance relative to the first call, the mean estimate for the year falls within the middle of our guided range. However, first quarter appears to be heavy, and Q4 appears to be light by about $0.02 each relative to our expectations. 
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.6 billion. Our capital plan for 2011 is approximately $1.8 billion with roughly $100 million funded by operating leases resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion to ops.

Obviously, November and December we had much better performance, as you said the January NAICS isn't out yet. So certainly, I think when you look that part of it will be part of the impact, and I think we're focused on the NAICS 4441. Although we do know we have some work to do certainly. As we look at the comps versus overall performance for the quarter, we're pleased with -- obviously we met our numbers. We look at some of the items in the quarter, and what was discussed yesterday on the competition's call, if we look at Black Friday, we had great performance on Black Friday probably one of our best days ever that entire weekend, great receptivity to lowes.com in some of the things we're doing there. We weren't aggressive as others were with respect to appliances and the promotions that took on appliances around our Black Friday. So I think that certainly impacted our numbers as you see. We were just slightly above average comps on appliances for the quarter. The other thing is that Winter products, we had a great quarter in Winter products that double-digit comps on top of what was a record year in 2009. But quite frankly, by the time we got to January, we were out of products for all intents and purposes other than ice melts, a few remaining snow blowers and shovels that were around. So we know that we missed some opportunity there because obviously the winter was much harder than we expected even though that we did have great performance. I think Larry talked in his comments a little bit about store staffing and the fact -- part of what we're reacting to with the weekend team; is that we know we haven't had enough hours on the floor on the store on weekends, which is when we were short from customer our facing time. As Larry mentioned, we had a hire and freeze inflation. We were restructuring because they could get reset after the change that took place. And we were probably a little light in some areas in the quarter as we were setting up to do that. But [indiscernible] in great shape for spring. We got the plans in place, the hiring is already started, and we think we're going to be in great shape to capitalize on spring sales. If you're going to make a change like that, obviously, the fourth quarter is the best time of the year to do it because that's our lowest volume part of the year. And then I guess finally, on kitchen cabinets was an area that we probably were not as promotional as some of the others during the quarter. And then I think there was also some comments about HVAC insulation. We're really not in the business so the tax credits [ph] , we would have had similar results from some of the energy store tax credit stuff but not in HVAC. So a little bit of  [ph] sale just kind of overall from market-to-market share. We maintained our market share growth at several categories, so we're pleased with that, and we think we're in a great shape with the changes we've made from an inventory position, how clean our inventory is, and what we're doing from a staffing standpoint as we head into spring. So Greg I'd ask you to talk about the next numbers?"

So in terms of square footage, we dropped it overall about 10% to 15%. And we still have our outdoor garden center in all of our stores and that really varies with this profit that we combined, what we've been on the side. But overall, the 103K I'm seeing in the last two years has been predominantly what we've done as a company. It's our present comp going forward as we go back and repurchase as our stores. A lot of things that we getting suspicious is with 103 that have to just go back into our other families of stores and improve the shopping experience for the customers just a couple of things on our seasonal side. Raising to better merchandise our patio furniture, our outdoor power equipment, DEWALT, behind blowers and things like that and really created a much improved shopping experience for some of the largest we have from 103 because we didn't have that reduced square footage, we had to figure out how to make the store work better. So I'm very pleased with this prototype and 94K, we launched that many years ago and that's still kind of a great small-market store for us. In the 94K still has 94,000 square feet of interior selling space.

I mean overall, we still look to gain share and plus it seems like a there's great opportunity out there. We'll be focused on that throughout 2011 as well. Obviously, we know that there's a hurdle coming up against with stimulus programs in 2011. We've got some other promotional things that we think will help offset part of that. We may not offset 100% of it, but we also recognize quite frankly that last year's high in the first quarter, we had great weather in the month of April and we've garnered some great sales. We knew there were some other areas that we probably didn't execute as well as we thought we could have. So even though we got a hurdle with appliances, to go up against in the first quarter, actually first half of 2011, we also recognize that there's some opportunity out there with other categories that we can execute better in, and that's really our team is focused on we're saying, ""Okay, given the environment, given what we're going up against, how do we execute as well as we can with some promotions that we have out there and some great new ideas in the appliance category but didn't really focus on, where we didn't get our share in the business last year and go harder after that."" So that's kind of our game plan. But on longer term our goal is to get great relationship with key vendors in the appliance area. We're quickly becoming one of the biggest competitors with its dynamics that have changed overall in the industry. Obviously, we feel good about our relationship, and we expect to continue to grow and I think it is, particularly, as you think about the environment slowly starting to improve. Customers, as we go forward, our store ease more maybe into some home improvement in that related areas. I think that bodes well for being strong in that category as well, so it continues to be a key focus for us."

Following my remarks, Larry Stone will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results. We delivered solid results for the quarter, including earnings that exceeded our guidance, and I would like to thank our more than 234,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. 
Sales for the quarter increased 3.1%, and comparable store sales increased 1.1%. Our domestic comparable store sales increase was 1.3%. Our fourth quarter sales benefited from a strong start to the holiday season resulting in great sell-through of seasonal products. However, difficult winter weather negatively impacted performance in the month of January. Comp average ticket was up 1.9% in the fourth quarter, but comp traffic was down slightly. New store cannibalization reduced comps by approximately 35 basis points in the quarter.
We continue to be pleased with our merchandising strategies and seasonal sell-through, which helped us deliver 60 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. We also leveraged expenses and delivered earnings per share of $0.21, an increase of 50%, which exceeded our guidance for the quarter. We used third-party data to gauge our retail market penetration. From a rolling four-quarter basis, we maintained our total unit market share with gains in 10 of our 19 product categories, including strong gains in hardware and tools.
I'm pleased with our inventory position at the end of the fourth quarter, which was up less than 1% year-over-year. Since the end of the first quarter, we have carefully managed our purchases, driven exceptional seasonal sell-through and rationalized our assortments. Most importantly, we were able to accomplish this without sacrificing in-stock levels. 
Overall, while growth in household spending picked up late in the year, it remained constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. And, while consumer confidence rose in February to its highest level since February 2008, it remained close to the lows of the prior recession and near historical lows. 
According to our fourth quarter consumer survey, fewer homeowners feel the economy will get worse before it gets better. But the number of homeowners who feel the recession is not over remains high, and approximately 45% of those homeowners tell us that they do not anticipate changing their spending plans as they move into 2011, evidence that consumers at large remain cautious.
Now let me address some of the management changes from the past few months. We were proud to have one of the deepest and most experienced leadership teams in retail. But with the long-tenured team, there will be retirements and rotations from time to time. In mid-November, Nick Canter, Executive Vice President of Merchandising announced his retirement after 37 years with the company. 
At the end of January, Larry Stone, President and Chief Operating Officer, announced his retirement after 42 years of service. Both have enjoyed long and successful careers at Lowe's making many important and lasting contributions. Though we knew this day would come and our thorough succession planning process had us prepared for the changes, we do not plan to fill the President and Chief Operating Officer position after Larry's retirement. So Larry and I will work together over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition and reporting structure for his direct reports. Bob Gfeller, an 11-year veteran of Lowe's, has assumed the role of Executive Vice President of Merchandising. Mike Brown, a 26-year veteran of Lowe's, has been appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer. And Rick Damron, a 30-year veteran of Lowe's has assumed the role of the Executive Vice President, Store Operations. We're fortunate to have a skilled and talented leadership team to make these rotations effective and seamless.
At our analyst conference in November, we shared our belief that we can grow by focusing on the opportunity we have with existing customers by growing a greater share of wallet. We also reviewed the steps we've taken to begin the transformation from a home improvement retailer to a home improvement company. Our commitment is to deliver better customer experiences by pulling together the best combination of possibilities, support and value for customers. But to deliver on this commitment, we must remain focused on cost effective and efficient operations. At the end of January, to further align payroll hours with customer demand, we restructured our store management roles and implemented weekend teams. Larry will provide more details about these changes in a few minutes. 
Let me share a few milestones from the fourth quarter that give us confidence that we can deliver better experiences. First, to increase our share position in major appliances, we launched repair services at the end of September. The phase rollout was complete in mid-November enhancing our Appliance Advantage program to provide after sales service for customers. We now own the repair experience, taking the phone calls, troubleshooting the problem and assisting with the resolution. This program will drive incremental repeat customer visits with purchases across the store. Additional benefits include repair parts sales, additional Extended Protection Plan sales and a reduction in Appliance return rate. We're also able to accumulate data about manufacturer to help identify defects and work with our merchants to resolve quality issues. We will roll out this concept to outdoor power equipment in mid-2011.
Second, our e-commerce team generated a significant amount of interest with our social media campaigns during the quarter. On two separate occasions, we were recognized as the second and third fastest growing site on Facebook, and we recently surpassed 500,000 fans. We also donated $1 million leveraging Facebook fans to publicize the event and allocate the funds to competing charities. We’re reaching a key customer segment through online media, which allows us to better monitor and influence sentiment from this highly influential and viral group of customers. With social media and the improvements we've made to our lowes.com platform such as improved search capabilities, new navigation and expanded marketing reach, we experienced a 32% increase in online conversion rates in the fourth quarter. 
Lastly, we launched our mobile site in December building a foundation that will allow customers to continue their shopping experience regardless of their location. We have 1 million visits to our mobile site within the first month of the launch, and while we're very pleased with customer adoption of the site, we're looking forward to significantly more expansion as we make incremental improvements to the site and as our marketing efforts ramp throughout 2011. We're also excited to launch our first Mobile App ! in early 2011, as well as the foundational release of My Lowe's, our customer focused portal with capabilities that will allow customers to more efficiently manage projects and improve their homes. 
As we look to 2011, it appears that unemployment is stabilizing. And while certain housing market indicators appear to be heading in the right direction, home price are still a hurdle. Economists are expecting another 5% to 8% drop in median home prices by the fourth quarter of 2011 due to an increase in the sales of distressed housing. The result is a housing market that is recovering more slowly than the overall economy. In addition, consumers are increasingly concerned about inflation over the next 12 months as the price of raw materials and oil surge and manufacturing wages in China continue to increase.
So while uncertainty in the market remains, the economic recovery is continuing. And as I've said before, we are prepared to operate effectively in a slow-growth environment. Thanks again for your interest, and I'll now turn it over to Larry Stone to provide more details from the quarter and the year. Larry?"

This morning, I will review our fourth quarter performance and then provide an update on our operational measures of success I covered during the analyst and investor conference in November. As Robert mentioned, we finish",1682,"Thanks, Robert, and good morning. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter performance and then provide an update on our operational measures of success I covered during the analyst and investor conference in November. As Robert mentioned, we finished the quarter with positive comps of 1.1%. Performance exceeded the company average in the non-coastal regions of the U.S. particularly the upper Midwest, South Central and desert Southwest. Comparable stores average ticket increased 1.9%, continuing to the stabilizing trend we experienced in the first three quarters of 2010. It is worth noting that this average ticket growth occurred despite appliances’ comping just above the company average. Comp transactions decreased 0.8% year-over-year declining in January after increasing in November and in December. The largest wins from December to January occurred within the lower Midwest and Southern regions affected by January snowstorms. While we are confident that the destruction from the snowstorms reduced our totally quarterly comp sales, we did sell a tremendous amount of snow blowers, shovels and ice melt. We were able to meet this demand through the use of our predictive weather analytics combined with our advanced logistics systems, which helped us have product in stock where customers needed it most.
Looking forward to the first quarter, we expect sales to benefit from post-storm repair of roofing, guttering, landscaping and other exterior products. In addition, we continue to look for ways to drive more transactions in our stores. As we enter spring, we are amplifying the message in and around our low price guarantee and remixing our media spend, and we're also putting more customer facing hours in our stores during the weekends. From a product category perspective, our strongest comp growth for the quarter was in seasonal living, tools, lawn and landscape, rough electrical and millwork.
Seasonal living performance is driven by our holiday assortments and seasonal heating products. We bought holiday decoration items with wide appeal placed them in their storage early and drove great sell-through requiring fewer markdowns through inventory at the end of the season. Seasonal heat and light snow removal products benefited from the harsh winter. Strong tool sales reflected exciting innovation from our vendors and a clear targeted gift under strategy, which drove higher unit growth especially for hand tools.
Snow shovels and ice melt drove our lawn and landscape comp growth, while rough electric growth was mostly due to copper inflation. Strength in millwork was primarily in windows and exterior doors. Our Project Specialist Exteriors or PSEs combined with focused SOS promotions helped customers take advantage of tax credits for energy efficient improvements that expired at year end. As with Cash for Appliances, we've seized an opportunity to drive additional sales by quickly executing programs that helped customers benefit from government incentives.
Additionally, the Project Specialist Exteriors program helped us increase our 2010 installed comp sales by over 10% with the greatest growth occurring in millwork, lumber and building materials. In fact, fourth quarter comparable store sales on tickets less than $50 decreased roughly 0.5%, while those over $500 increased roughly 1%. The better comp performance in tickets over $500 was mostly due to strong sales of products handled through our PSE program. We expect to obtain further comp benefit from this program as we anniversaried last year's ramp up. Our lower comp in product categories include the cabinets and countertops, fashion plumbing, outdoor power equipment, home organization and flooring. Within outdoor power equipment, snow blower sales after this year's snowstorms only partially offset lower comps and generators due to last year's severe December ice storm along the East Coast.
Home organization sales garage and kitchen organization products have struggled, though we expect to improve our sales in these categories in 2011. Finally, in our floor department, lament and wood products have not performed to our expectations, though we do have plans in place to improve the performance of this category in 2011.
On the other hand, positive comps in carpet continued as customers responded enthusiastically to our free installation of most recognizable brand of stain-resistant carpet, STAINMASTER. 
Fourth quarter gross margin improved 60 basis points with margin rate increasing in 12 of our 19 product categories. Gains in many of these categories are attributable to our patch area expansion and base price optimization, which are two elements for our go-local merchandising strategy. We have better aligned our price with our stores' competitive circumstances, and we are successfully implemented the base price optimization tool to find the best balance of unit volume and margin rate to optimize margin dollars.
For seasonal living products, we entered the holiday season early and carefully managed sell-through in order to minimize markdowns. There has been concern in the market about potentially negative margin impact from inflation. In 2010, we experienced cost inflation in rough electrical, rough plumbing, lumber and millwork, and we have been able to pass most of these costs through our retail pricing. However, we are also aware of inflationary pressures on imported products. These pressures are caused by growing wage inflation in overseas markets and increasing cost for fuel and raw materials such as steel. In fact, we have received request for price increases from some of our vendors. We believe that we can work with our vendors to minimize these increases and pass along the majority of these costs in our retail pricing.
We leveraged operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Bob will walk you through the details, but one significant source of leverage was payroll. Fourth quarter payroll leverage resulted in our decision to freeze hiring in advance of our event restructuring of our store organization. Despite this leverage, we're gratified to see ongoing strength in our fourth quarter customer focus scores. 
Looking forward, I like to cover a couple of recent store organization changes that will strengthen our ability to serve customers and operate our stores more efficiently. First, as we slowed our pace of store openings, we knew it was time to change our store management structure and to continue to put more hours on sales floor in order to better serve customers. Therefore, we have reorganized our store staffing structure by consolidating the zone, operations, sales and administrative management team into a single-level assistant store manager structure. This structure fully implements the managers to drive the business and allows them to manage all team members in their area of responsibility. On average, this change resulted in the reduction of one management position per store.
Second, we're implementing a weekend team in each store. In addition to our seasonal hiring, we will hire part-time employees dedicated to Friday, Saturday and Sunday to increase our ability to serve customers on these peak days. Customers will see more employees on the floor, and we believe the structure will yield increased sales and improved customer service. Although the primary purpose of these changes to make our store management structure more effective and to deploy more hours to serve customers when they are in our stores, net savings from these changes will largely offset the cost of our 2011 wage increases.
We have continued to balance our inventory. At the end of the first quarter, inventory was 9.8% above last year, which was due [indiscernible] purchases in appliance and flooring. Over the last three quarters, we have carefully managed our purchases in these categories, and we drove exceptional sell-through in the fourth quarter in our seasonal and tool categories. We ended the fourth quarter 0.9% above last year, despite a 2% higher store count and fourth quarter comp sales growth. Even so, we have maintained our service-level, and as of this call, we're ready for spring across the country with the right items such as outdoor patio furniture, grills and lawn and garden products to meet customers' demand.
Before I finish, I'd like to our update on how we plan to make progress in 2011 on the measures of success I've discussed during our analyst and investor conference, and Bob will take you through the guidance in more detail. First, we will grow sales 1% to 2% faster than the market. Our 2011 market share growth will be driven by better alignment of our teams and resources to meet customers' evolving needs. And as already shared with you, we expect sales to benefit from implement of weekend teams full implementation of our PSE program, adjusting our media mix and more aggressively messaging our low price guarantee. We also expect to drive additional transactions to revamp selling skills and better training for our associates. Further, as Robert discussed, we continue to make great progress in improving our online presence, which should lead to more purchases online and in the store.
This growth in market share, in addition to opening highly productive stores with a greater presence in densely populated urban markets should help us make progress towards our second measure of success, growing sales per square foot to $304 in 2015.
Third, we expect to grow EBIT 20 basis points for each 100 basis points above a 1% comp. In 2011, we will obtain most of this growth through expense leverage. SG&A will benefit from the store structure changes we've already announced and through  continued efforts of our cost reductions committee, a cross-functional team that searches for opportunities across our company to get more value from every dollar we spend. 
Finally, we set a goal to improve inventory turns by 25% over the next five years. We made solid progress on rightsizing our inventories at the end of 2010, and we expect to continue that progress in 2011 as we review the depth and breadth of our assortments and roll out integrated planning and execution or IP&E. And hedge focus on the role each category plays in our mix, gives our merchants' and logistic team's better context for making inventory decisions.
At the end of 2011, we look forward to updating you again on our progress towards our five-year operational goals. Thanks for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our fourth quarter financial results. Bob?"

Sales for the fourth quarter were $10.5 billion, which represents a 3.1% increase over last year's fourth quarter. In Q4, total average ticket increased by 2.3% to $61.34, and total customer count increased 0.8%.",1674,"Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $10.5 billion, which represents a 3.1% increase over last year's fourth quarter. In Q4, total average ticket increased by 2.3% to $61.34, and total customer count increased 0.8%. Comp sales were 1.1% for the quarter which was within our guidance of flat to 2%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were positive 2% in November, positive 2.8% in December and negative 2.5% in January. Our monthly comps in the quarter were impacted by both the holiday shift and weather. This year, New Year's holiday fell on Saturday, which was the first day of our fiscal January, where last year it fell on Friday, which is the last day in fiscal December. This shift aided December and hurt January comps. Adjusting for this shift, comps would have been positive 1.7% for December and negative 0.8% in January.
As you heard from Larry, the sales of storm-related products in January were not sufficient to offset the negative impact to our normal customer traffic patterns. For the quarter, comp average ticket increased 1.9%, while comp transactions decreased 0.8%. With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the fourth quarter included millwork, tools, rough electrical, seasonal living, lawn and landscape and appliances. Rough plumbing performed at approximately the overall corporate average. For the year, comp sales were 1.3% and total sales increased 3.4% to $48.8 billion. 2010 was our first positive comp year since 2005.
For 2010, comp transactions increased 0.9% and comp average ticket increased 0.5%. For the year, the categories that performed above-average included tools, lumber, rough electrical, seasonal living, household power equipment, lawn and landscape and appliances. Millwork and paint performed, at approximate, the overall corporate average.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 35.55% of sales, an increase of 60 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The primary driver of gross margin expansion in the quarter was base price optimization and patch area expansion, and we estimate the favorable impact was approximately 25 basis points. In addition, product inflation, better seasonal sell-through, a higher proportion of private label products, less reset activity and lower inventory shrink all aided gross margin in the quarter. For the year, gross margin of 35.14% of sales represents an increase of 28 basis points over fiscal 2009.
SG&A for Q4 was 26.64% of sales, which leveraged 65 basis points. The primary driver of SG&A leverage in the quarter was bonus expense. We were cycling against large bonus accruals in last year's fourth quarter versus more normal trends in this year's Q4. As a result, bonus expense leveraged 56 basis points in this year's fourth quarter. Also in the quarter, we experienced leverage in store payroll, impairment in discontinued projects and advertising. Store payroll leverage in Q4 despite the $15 million pretax severance impact associated with the store management structuring changes Larry described. 
Lastly, we experienced deleverage in the quarter associated with private label credit, profit taxes, bankcard expense and other income. The deleverage in other income relates to our share of the bank card anti-trust sentiment received in Q4 2009. For the year, SG&A was 24.6% of sales and leveraged 25 basis points to 2009.
Depreciation at 3.74% of sales totaled $392 million and leveraged 21 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes increased 146 basis points to 5.17% of sales. For the year, up 7.29% represents an increase of 70 basis points over 2009. Interest expense at $86 million for the quarter deleveraged 27 basis points as a percentage of sales. The increase in interest is attributable to the $1.5 billion increase in net debt at year end relative to last year. 
For the quarter, total expenses were 31.2% of sales and leveraged 59 basis points. Pretax earnings for the quarter were 4.35% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% versus 36.3% for Q4 last year. For the year, the effective tax rate was 37.7% compared with 36.9% for 2009. Q4 net earnings of $285 million increased 39% versus last year. Earnings per share of $0.21 for the quarter exceeded our guidance of $0.16 to $0.19 and increased 50% versus last year's $0.14.
For fiscal 2010, earnings per share of $1.42 were up 17.4% versus 2009 and came in at the high-end of our original 2010 guidance of $1.30 to $1.42 provided last February. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $652 million. Our fourth quarter inventory balance of $8.3 billion increased $72 million or 0.9% versus Q4 last year. The increase was due to square footage growth of 2% and distribution inventory offset by a comp store inventory reduction of 4.4%. Inventory turnover calculated by taking a trailing four quarter cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last five quarters was 3.63%, a decrease of two basis points from Q4 2009. At the end of the fourth quarter, we owned 89% of our stores. Return on assets determined using a trailing four quarters’ earnings divided by average assets for the last five quarters increased 52 basis points to 5.81%.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, we finished the year with no short-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with accounts payable of $4.4 billion, which was a 1.5% increase over Q4 last year. In the fourth quarter, we issued $1 billion of unsecured bonds in two tranches, $475 million of five and a half year notes with 2 1/8% interest rate and $525 million, 10 and a half year issue with 3.75% interest rate. As a result, our total debt balance at the end of the quarter was $6.6 billion.
Our debt-to-equity ratio was 36.3% compared to 26.6% to the end of 2009. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.7x. Return on invested capital measured using a trailing four quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest, divided by average debt and equity over the last five quarters increased 84 basis points for the quarter to 9%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. For the year, cash flow from operations was almost $3.9 billion and cash used and profit acquired was just over $1.3 billion resulting in free cash flow of $2.5 billion, which was 12% higher than 2010. During the quarter, we repurchased 41.4 million shares at an average price of $24.15 for a total repurchase amount of $1 billion.
For the year, we repurchased almost 112 million shares or 7.7% of our beginning share count. In total, we repurchased $2.6 billion in 2010 and had $2.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. We expect the first quarter total sales increase of approximately 2%, which assumes comp sales to be essentially flat and square footage growth of approximately 2%. In Q1, we faced difficult comparisons associated with last year's Cash for Appliances program, which we estimate aided first quarter 2009 comps by 65 basis points. Gross margin is expected to be up slightly in Q1 2010 as a percentage of sales. 
For SG&A, we anticipate deleverage of 40 to 50 basis points. This deleverage is driven by a number of factors including insurance, proprietary credit and expenses associated with investments we are making with customer experiences. We are cycling against leverage in our casualty insurance program and last year's first quarter due to a decrease in actuarial projected losses during the period. Depreciation for Q1 is expected to be approximately $360 million and leveraged roughly 30 basis points. As a result, earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter are expected to decrease by 10 to 20 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.7% for the quarter and for the year. We expect earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.38, which is flat to last year's $0.34 at the low-end and an increase of 12% on the upper-end.
Prior to getting into our outlook for the year, I wanted to highlight that our fiscal 2011 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Lowe's fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to the end of January. This means we have a 53rd week every five or six years. Our last 53-week year was fiscal 2005. For the year, we estimate that the 53rd week will increase total sales by approximately 1.6% and earnings per share by approximately $0.02. In 2011, we expect to open 25 to 30 stores resulting in an increase in square footage of approximately 1.5%. We're estimating 2011 comp sales to be positive 1% to 2%, and with the impact of the 53rd week, we expect total sales increase of approximately 5%. For the fiscal year, we're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 30 basis points. For 2011, we expect depreciation expense of about $1.5 billion and interest expense of approximately $350 million.
The sum of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.72, which represents an increase of 13% to 21% over 2010. And looking at our guidance relative to the first call, the mean estimate for the year falls within the middle of our guided range. However, first quarter appears to be heavy, and Q4 appears to be light by about $0.02 each relative to our expectations. 
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.6 billion. Our capital plan for 2011 is approximately $1.8 billion with roughly $100 million funded by operating leases resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion. Our guidance assumes approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases for 2011 spread evenly across four quarters. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

Obviously, November and December we had much better performance, as you said, the January NAICS isn't out yet. So certainly, I think when you look that part of it will be part of the impact, and I think we would focus on the NAICS 4441. Although we do know we have some work to do certainly. As we look at the comps versus our overall performance for the quarter, we're pleased with, obviously we met our numbers. We look at some of the items in the quarter, and what was discussed yesterday on the competition's call, if we look at Black Friday, we had great performance on Black Friday probably one of our best days ever that entire weekend, great receptivity to lowes.com in some of the things we're doing there. We weren't aggressive as others were with respect to appliances and the promotions that took on appliances around our Black Friday. So I think that certainly impacted our numbers as you see. We were just slightly above average comps on appliances for the quarter. The other thing is that Winter products, we had a great quarter in Winter products we had double-digit comps on top of what was a record year in 2009. But quite frankly, by the time we got to January, we were out of products for all intents and purposes other than ice melts, a few remaining snow throwers and shovels that were around. So we know that we missed some opportunity there because obviously the winter was much harder than we expected even though that we did have great performance. I think Larry talked in his comments a little bit about store staffing and the fact -- part of what we're reacting to with the weekend teams; is that we know we haven't had enough hours on the floor on the store on weekends, which is when we were short from customer facing time. As Larry mentioned, we had a hiring freeze in place because we were restructuring because we had to get reset for the change that took place. And we were probably a little light in some areas in the quarter as we were setting up to do that. But is set us up in great shape for spring. We’ve got the plans in place, the hiring has already started, and we think we're going to be in great shape to capitalize on spring sales. If you're going to make a change like that, obviously, the fourth quarter is the best time of the year to do it because that's our lowest volume part of the year. And then I guess finally, on kitchen cabinets was an area that we probably were not as promotional as some of the others during the quarter. And then I think there was also some comments about HVAC insulation. We're really not in the business so the tax credits stuff, we would have had similar results from the ENERGY STAR tax credit stuff but not in HVAC. So a little bit of thoughts there just kind of overall from market, market share. We maintained our market share grew it in several categories, so we're pleased with that, and we think we're in a great shape with the changes we've made, where we’re at from an inventory position, how clean our inventory is, and what we're doing from a staffing standpoint as we head into spring. So Greg I'd ask you to talk about the next numbers?"

We also had our smaller market store, which is 94,000 square-foot store that we use in certain smaller markets and also in some urban areas where that’s what we can fit into that particular area. So in terms of square footage, we’ve dropped it overall about 10% to 15%. And we still have our outdoor garden center in all of our stores and that really varies depending on the piece of property we can buy and what we can put on the site. 103K I’d say in the last two years that’s predominantly what we built as a company. It's our prototype going forward as we go back in re-merchandise our stores. There’s a lot of things that we gain sufficiency with 103 that have us go back into our other families of stores and improve the shopping experience for the customers just a couple of things on our seasonal side. We’re able to better merchandise our patio furniture, our outdoor power equipment, our walk-behind mowers and things like that, that really create a much improved shopping experience by some of the learnings we got from 103 because we did have that reduced square footage, we had to figure out how to make the store work better. So I'm very pleased with this prototype and 94K, we launched that many years ago and that's still been a great small-market store for us. In the 94K still has 94,000 square feet of interior selling space.

We just didn't have enough staff in the stores on the weekends and certainly, we've got part timers you got to give weekends off and so forth, so felt like this was a much better way to approach it because there are a lot of people a lot are very qualified people, they are looking for weekend shifts Friday, Saturday and Sunday, so we've been able to attract some very talented people. We feel like this will really give us that fourth power we need inside the store with the customer facing during those three peak days.

Obviously, we know that there's a hurdle coming up against with stimulus programs in 2011. We've got some other promotional things that we think will help offset part of that. We may not offset 100% of it, but we also recognize quite frankly that last year's high in the first quarter, even though we had great weather in the month of April and we've garnered some great sales. We knew there were some other areas that we probably didn't execute as well as we thought we could have. So even though we got a hurdle with appliances, to go up against in the first quarter, actually first half of 2011, we also recognize that there's some opportunity out there with other categories that we can execute better in, and that's really what the team is focused on we're saying, ""Okay, given the environment, given what we're going up against, how do we execute as well as we can with some great promotions that we have out there and some great new ideas in the appliance category but then really focus on, where we didn't get our share of the business last year and go harder after that."" So that's kind of our game plan. But on longer term our goal we got great relationships with key vendors in the appliance area. We're quickly becoming one of the biggest competitors with the dynamics that have changed overall in the industry. We feel good about our relationship, and we expect to continue to grow and I think it is, particularly, as you think about the environment slowly starting to improve. Customers, as we go forward, are starting to ease more maybe into some home improvement related areas. I think that bodes well for being strong in that category as well, so it continues to be a key focus for us."

Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results.Our performance in the quarter did not meet our expectations. Sales for the q",1307,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results.
Our performance in the quarter did not meet our expectations. Sales for the quarter declined 1.6%, and comparable store sales declined 3.3%. Comp average ticket was essentially flat in the first quarter, while comp traffic declined 3.4%.
But we had solid gross margin improvement and delivered earnings per share within our guidance despite lower-than-expected sales. I would like to thank our more than 234,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.
We faced tough comparisons in the first quarter as a result of last year's government stimulus programs such as Cash for Appliances and the Homebuyer Tax Credit, as well as favorable weather conditions last year. We knew the bar was high, but we had a reasonable plan in place heading into the quarter, and we executed against that plan. In fact, our performance was solid through about week 8 of the quarter, and we were impacted by the unseasonably cold wet weather in the Northeast, North Central and Northwest regions of the U.S. and the severe storms in the southern part of the country, in particular the unprecedented tornado season.
In fact, the storm in Carolina was struck by a tornado in mid-April. Fortunately there were no customer or employee fatalities or injuries. However, the store sustained severe damage resulting in a need to demolish and rebuild the store. Our thoughts are with the families impacted by the numerous tornadoes and widespread flooding throughout the country. As we've done in the past when natural disasters strike, Lowe's stores around the country as well as lowe's.com became official donation sites for the American Red Cross disaster relief fund with Lowe's also contributing $750,000 to the relief efforts. 
Overall, the economic recovery is continuing but uncertainty remains. And consumer confidence sagged during the quarter in response to increasing concerns around inflation, unrest in the Middle East and the impact of potential budget cuts at the federal, state and local levels. In fact, U.S. GDP growth slowed to 1.8% for the first quarter after a 3.1% rise in the fourth quarter.
More specifically with regard to home improvement spending, the drivers were mixed. Employment and disposable income are slowly improving, but housing turnover is restrained, and home prices continue to decline. The implications for our business is that customers may feel better about their employment situation but are uneasy due to higher fuel, clothing and food costs, as well as geopolitical issues around the world. In addition, decreasing home prices and low housing turnover consumers remain cautious when it comes to big-ticket discretionary spending on their homes.
According to our first quarter consumer survey, rising gas and energy prices are cited by homeowners as the top factor affecting future spending plans followed by the state of the overall economy and inflation in general. While housing remain a concern, we did see positive trends in home improvement affinity and project plans in our survey, which may suggest that homeowners were beginning to look for ways to enhance their homes. 
That said, our survey indicates that 84% of planned spending in the next 6 months will be small ticket, less than $500, and 43% of that planned spending will be discretionary.
As we shared with you previously, our business has historically been 60% maintenance and 40% discretionary. But during the downturn that mix shift moved closer to 70% maintenance and 30% discretionary. As consumers have focused increasingly on maintenance projects and as the cost of fuel has increased, convenience in store location is playing a great role in consumer's choice of where to shop. Differentiation is key to combating this convenience factor in addition to our targeted store expansions strategy. These 2 factors, convenience and differentiation, as well as the opportunity to close more sales are driving our transformation from a home improvement retailer to a home improvement company.
As we discussed at our analyst conference in November, we are working diligently in our commitment to deliver better customer experiences while pulling together the best combination of possibilities, support and value for customers wherever and whenever they choose to engage and building momentum behind this transformation in 2011. 
Researchers are saying that are there are 7 stages in home improvement spending: inspiration, planning, getting supplies, getting started, making progress, finishing and enjoyment. Each stage differs in length especially with the type of projects that customer's undertaking and the level of emotional engagement is generally higher in the beginning and ending stages than it is in the middle. Traditionally, our industry is focused on getting supplies where emotional engagement is relatively low. Our focus for the future is on all 7 stages as we strive to provide customer with a better and differentiated experience. As I said, we're building momentum behind our transformation, so let me give you some examples. 
During the quarter, our store employees began using a business community portal that puts them in touch with fellow employees throughout our chain. Through this portal, they are able to communicate with one another and offer solutions to the questions they encounter everyday. We also lowe's.com that gives customer the ability to ask product-specific questions and receive answers from a variety of sources, including Lowes employees, other customers and product vendors. With these systems, our employees can provide more in-depth advice in store or wherever customers choose that's align customers to more easily complete their projects. 
Year-over-year ago, we completed our www.lowes.com platform redesign and since that time, we've been making incremental improvements fueling a 19% increase in traffic year-over-year and a 78% increase in online conversion rates. We also saw a substantial increase in customer satisfaction according to third-party data.
We have over 170,000 items available online with significant expansion planned for the remainder of the year. And also we plan to launch the Spanish version of www.lowes.com this summer in an effort to better resonate with this very important demographic. We also delivered further improvements in our multi-channel presence in summer as we launched our first Mobile App! as well as foundational capabilities to support My Lowe's, our customer-focused portal that will allow customers to more efficiently manage projects and improve their homes.
Finally, we'll rollout to repair services concept to outdoor power equipment or OPE in the second quarter. Having after sales service for this category is expected to increase our share position while positively affecting customer satisfaction resulting in incremental repeat customer visits and allowing us to minimize cost savings through lower OPE return rates. This initiative will also increase our ability to identify product quality concerns that we can work with our vendors to resolve. 
This transformation is about living up to our vision to provide the customer base solutions necessary to become the first choice in home improvement. This is about bringing Lowe's to the consumer on their terms regardless of the store presence and making the experience relevant and personal. Make no mistake, this effort is just much about maintenance items and small projects as it is larger ticket, discretionary projects.
In the second quarter, we expect to take advantage of the late-season opportunities as weather patterns improve and consumers are finally able to move outdoors and tackle traditional projects as well as repair damage caused by the harsh weather. We continue to expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, given the challenging comparisons in the first half of last year as a result of government stimulus programs. However, stabilization of home prices and solid progress working to the inventory of distressed housing will be key milestones for recovery. 
Thanks again for your interest, and now I'll turn it over to Rick Damron to provide more details on the quarter. Rick?"

I will review our first quarter performance, discuss the new programs underway to drive sales, update you on ways to continue to learn and improve. 
As Robert mentioned, we finished the first quarter with negative 3.3% comps. Performance exceeded the company average in the Southeast, South Central and Desert Southwest regions of the country where temperatures and rainfall were close to normal. On the other hand, performance lagged the company average by over 200 basis points in the Northeast and North Central regions of the country where colder and winter conditions prevailed. Looking at a detailed analysis of our indoor and outdoor performance, specifically characterized by hundreds of product groups as indoor or outdoor, comp store performance of our outdoor categories were essentially flat, while our outdoor categories declined 9% for the quarter and 21% over the last 5 weeks of the quarter. Some categories actually benefited from wet weather. For instance, performance benefited from strong sales of pumps and tanks and air filters. 
There were some additional factors affecting category performance in the quarter. On the positive side, counter tops performed well, driven by strong performance of our special order kitchen cabinets. Inflation drove high single digit comps in rough electrical and helped paint to comp positively overcoming slow sales of exterior stains and applicators. 
On the negative side, Millwork was impacted by the pull forward of sales into 2010 from expiring energy tax credits. Further as expected, appliances were unable to overcome a very difficult comparison to last year's Cash for Appliances programs but achieved a 2-year comp of roughly 9%. Installed sales generated low single digit comps driven by strong promotions in special order kitchen cabinets, improve special order lead times in appliances and customers continued enthusiastic response to STAINMASTER Carpet.
Not surprisingly, our comp store performance was driven by April transactions not ticket. Comparable store average ticket was essentially flat and was flat to positive in 12 of 21 domestic regions. Even though we were comping against the favorable impact to ticket of last year's Cash for Appliances program. 
On the other hand, comp transactions decreased 3.4% year-over-year, increasing in February, declining low single digits in March and declining high single digit in April. The weakest April transaction comps occurred within the Northeast and North Central areas of the country. Our ending first quarter inventory is 2.4% lower than first quarter of 2010, which, as a reminder, ended 9.8% higher than the first quarter of 2009. Last year, we attribute our higher inventory to optimistic purchases of appliances flooring. So far, our inventory is lower than last year. We had the right inventory to meet customer demand in the second quarter. 
Further, even though our first quarter sales of seasonal products struggled, we have confidence in our ability to sell through these inventories in the second quarter and avoid significant markdowns. As expected with negative comp performance, our expenses deleveraged. Bob will share more details regarding our overall expense performance, but I'd like to point out we're able to partially offset other expense deleverage through operating salaries leverage while maintaining our strong customer service scores. 
Although we hired aggressively for our weekend teams, we adjusted hiring seasonal and employees to forecasted sales trends. Now I'd like to discuss a few programs we undertook during the first quarter to close more sales and build ticket. As mentioned on last quarter's call, we streamlined the store management structure and implemented weekend teams to provide more customer facing hours on the weekends. And we adjusted our medium mix to obtain better efficiency from each advertising dollar. So I'd like to share with you some more details about these programs. 
First, we are pleased with the initial results of our weekend teams who provide additional customer facing hours from Friday through Sunday. We have field more than 90% of our weekend positions. Unlike our seasonal hires, our weekend teams will remain in place throughout the year. These teams have increased our weekend to date total selling hours by 150 basis points. One indication of the effectiveness of this program is that our first quarter growth of comparable store sales and transactions on weekends were over 140 basis points higher than for weekdays. 
Additionally, we have received positive feedback from our stores that the weekend teams are enhancing the customer experience and providing the staffing flexibility needed to support weekend traffic and sales. Next we realigned our media spend, placing more emphasis in online media, the same media that more of our customers are moving to. Online media is also much more efficient as we can dramatically increase our media presence per dollar versus print. Additionally, we shifted away from local to national radio where once again, we can gain more impressions per dollars spent. 
We also rolled out 3 programs that were not discussed on our fourth quarter call. First, we entered into a gift card model program with Black Hawk. Black Hawk manages over 85% of the gift card model distribution in the U.S. and we now have our cards available for purchase in grocery stores and other high-volume retail channels, which will significantly increase our total gift card sales. In addition, gift card models will be in all of our stores beginning late in the second half of the year. 
Second, we introduced a tax refund card at the beginning of the first quarter. This promotion coincides with the timing of many customers tax refunds as cards were purchased from February 8 through March 14. On March 18, 10% of the original purchase amount was added to the card. We wanted to give customers another reason to make their initial purchases at Lowe's and then return for additional purchases. Customers and stores responded positively to these cards. However, we found that many of the cards were used on purchases that customers had already planned to make at Lowe's so the incremental sales from this program were not as significant as we had planned. 
Third, we launched a program at the end of April that provides Lowe's consumer credit cardholders with 5% off everyday. For purchases above $299 we continue to offer cardholders the option of no interest financing instead of the 5% discount. You might wonder why we did this. Over the past year, we have experienced declines in our proprietary credit penetration the result of regulatory changes that preclude companies from offering no payment promotions. Those regulatory changes dramatically reduced the value proposition of our proprietary card. Since our proprietary credit programs provide a lower cost of tender, we evaluated a number of options to drive customers back to this program. 
We have used credit promotions ranging from our everyday 6-month 0 interest offer to periodic use of 12 month and 18 month 0 interest offers for key promotional periods. And last fall, given consumer's increasing focus on maintenance projects we tested percent off programs to determine whether we could drive greater proportion of smaller-ticket purchases. After evaluating our test, we concluded that a combination offer would enhance the card's value to customers by giving them another choice to make their purchases even more affordable everyday.
Now I'd like to discuss with a few ways in which our organization continues to learn and improve. We have previously discussed our efforts to go local with our pricing using based-price optimization and expansion and in market assorting using integrated premium and execution or IP&E. We have fully implemented base price optimization and expansion and IP&E is being rolled out across all of our merchandise categories this year with the benefits coming in 2012 and beyond. But there is another near-term effort to go local. I believe we have an opportunity to unleash more the creativity and market-specific knowledge of our store personnel. 
During our rapid growth over the past decade, we needed more commanding control to ensure our new stores represented the Lowe's brand. As our growth has slowed, the tenure of our store managers and associates has increased giving them greater experience and knowledge to make the stores better to serve their specific markets. We will always have a centralized approach to ensuring consistent standards for merchandising, store environment and customer service. But I know we can maintain our high standards while also giving more latitude to our store teams to creatively address local market needs. I call this flexibility within the framework. 
Since assuming my role, I often blog within our business portal community, which for the entire Lowe's organization. I encourage our store employees to share examples of what they have done within their own stores to better serve customers and to drive sales.
For instance, we recently introduced a new paint coded with Teflon. While priced higher than a traditional tray, it makes clean up easier and is more likely to be reused, which ultimately is a better value for the customer and more environmentally friendly. But despite strong messaging on the package, customers were not able to see the value until one associate put a simple idea into action. Take one tray, pour paint, let it dry and leave it for customers to see how easy it is to pull the paint right out of the tray without washing or scrubbing. This simple display works so well that the employees idea on our business community portal. This display is now being used across most of the company, and sales of these trays have improved. 
Likewise on a larger scale, we continue to measure and improve our merchandising programs and find ways to better serve customers. One great example is our tools category. We took a category that was losing share and had lower comps and overhauled the offering by introducing a challenge exclusive in portal cable hand-held power tools. We also expanded our offering of the and now offer the largest assortment in our channel. We rationalized our offering at each price point adjusting our assortments based on significant differences in market preferences, and we offered more innovative products. Our tools category has gained unit and dollars share, and we continue to drive more sales, which has led to positive low single digit comps for the first quarter. 
We have also improved the performance of ceramic tile flooring by increasing our offering in the warmer southern states. Expanding the wall tile assortments, bringing the samples to the floor and making take with inventory for high-volume items more readily available for purchase. Then to improve service and attachment rate, we moved grounds, mortars and closer to the town, so customers can easily access everything needed for the job and like tools, ceramic top produced low single digit comps in the first quarter. 
We continue to learn and improve across all facets of our day-to-day operations, and we will continue to add company-wide tools and processes to fulfill our promise to provide better customer experiences. Thanks for your interest in Lowe's and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our first quarter financial results. Bob?"

Sales for the first quarter were $12.2 billion, which represents 1.6% increase from last year's first quarter. In Q1, total customer transactions decreased 2.1% while average ticket increased 0.5% to $62.51. Comp sales were negative 3.3% for the quarter, which is below our guidance of essentially flat. For the quarter comp transactions of decreased 3.4% and comp average ticket increased 0.1%. 
Looking at monthly credits, comps were positive 2.7% in February, negative 1.9% in March and negative 8.3% in April. The monthly comp trends reflect the difficult comparisons we had versus last year's positive 8.8% April comp, which was driven by both favorable weather and government stimulus. 
Q1 was our most difficult comparison to last year due to the impact of Cash for Appliances. In Q1 2010, Cash for Appliances aided comps by 65 basis points. We knew this going to the quarter and felt that we had a reasonable plan in place. In fact, we were ahead of our sales plans through our fiscal week 8. Then as Rick described, unseasonable weather over the last 5 weeks of the quarter had a significant impact on our exterior categories, which represent about 40% of our sales for that 5-week period and was the primary driver of our below plan sales for the quarter. 
With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the first quarter include rough electrical, rough plumbing, cabinets and countertops, tools, lighting, paint, flooring, fashion, storage and cleaning, hardware and fashion plumbing. Seasonal living performed at approximately the overall corporate average. 
Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.44% of sales and increased 26 basis points over last year's first quarter. The increase was driven by 34 basis points of margin rate improvement with base price optimization in patch area expansion accounting for approximately 25 basis points of the margin rate improvement. 
Additionally, gross margin benefited 28 basis points from the mix of items sold, the result of strong sales and rough plumbing, as well as lower sales in outdoor power equipment and appliances. These improvements were partially offset by deleverage and distribution expenses primarily the result of increased fuel costs and higher inventory shrink. 
SG&A for Q1 was 25.6% of sales, which deleveraged 62 basis points. The largest driver of the SG&A deleverage was insurance, both casualty and employee, deleveraged 32 basis points. The increase in casualty was weighted to a favorable actuarial adjustment in last year's first quarter. The deleverage in employee insurance led to increased claim cost and higher dependent enrollment. We also experienced approximately 15 basis points of deleverage weighted to investments made to improving customer experiences. Expenses related to staffing up our contact center to support the insourcing of appliance repairs last year and contract labor for additional lowe's.com capabilities and My Lowe's concept and continued efforts to build out our customer relationship platform. 
In addition, advertising expense deleverage approximately 10 basis points largely due to the timing of spend versus last year. Lastly, while only about 5 basis points each deleveraged for the following items is worth noting. Delivery due to higher fuel costs, taxes related to higher state unemployment tax rates, bankcard due to higher interchange rates and proprietary credit associated with lower sales as a result of a lower receivable related to the provision against no payment promotions. 
Somewhat offsetting these items was leverage and bonus expense. We fell short of our sales and earnings plan for the quarter, and as a result, we reduced our expected bonus payout amounts accordingly. Depreciation for the quarter was $371 million, which was 3.05% of sales and leveraged 15 basis points compared to last year's first quarter due to slower square footage growth and assets becoming fully depreciated. 
Earnings before interest and taxes decreased 21 basis points to 6.79% of sales. Interest expense is $88 million for the quarter deleveraged 6 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, total expenses were 29.3% of sales and deleveraged 53 basis points. 
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 6.07% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 37.8% in Q1 last year. Earnings per share of $0.34 for the quarter were at the bottom end of our guidance of $0.34 to $0.38 and were flat to last year's $0.34. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $1.5 billion. Our first quarter inventory balance of $9.7 billion decreased $238 million or 2.4% from Q1 last year. The decrease was due to a 5.6% decrease in comp store inventory offset by square footage growth of 1.6% and a slight increase in distribution inventory. 
Inventory turnover by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales averaged inventory for the last 5 quarters was 3.5, a decrease of 6 basis points from Q1 2010. Return on assets determined using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters increased 44 basis points to 5.63%. 
Moving to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $6.7 billion represents a 5% decrease from Q1 last year. The decrease in accounts payable is higher than our 2.4% decrease in inventory, which relates to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year. 
Our debt to equity ratio was 37.7% compared to 31.9% for Q1 last year. At the end of the first quarter, we suggested debt to EBITDAR was 1.72, which is higher than our target of 1.8x. Return on invested capital using a trailing 4 quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last 5 quarters increased 75 basis points for the quarter to 8.91%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion, which was $313 million lower than Q1 2010 due to the timing of income tax payments versus last year and the decrease in accounts payable related to the timing of purchases. Cash used property acquired was $313 million up $30 million over last year due to an increase in information technology spending on lowe's.com, store infrastructure and the ongoing buildout of our customer relationship platform. 
As a result, first quarter free cash flow of $2.1 billion was down 14% versus last year. During the quarter, we repurchased 37.9 million shares at an average price of $26.42 for a total repurchased amount of $1 billion. We have $1.4 billion remaining share repurchase authorization. The remaining $31 million of the $1.013 billion of share repurchase -- of repurchase shown in the statement of cash flows relates to shares repurchased from employees to satisfy exercised stock options or the statutory withholding tax liability upon investing a restricted stock. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. We expect second quarter total sales to increase approximately 4%, which will incorporate account sales increase of approximately 2% and square footage growth of approximately 1.5%. As we noted, our Q1 sales shortfall was driven by poor seasonal sales as a result of weather. In the second quarter as the weather has improved, so have our sales. 
In fact, sales trends for the beginning of May are much better than April, which gives us confidence in our Q2 sales outlook. Depreciation for Q2 is expected to be approximately $370 million and leverage about 30 basis points to last year's second quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes for the second quarter are expected to increase 20 to 30 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. 
For the quarter, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.6% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.69, which represents an increase of 12% to 19% over last year's $0.58. In 2011, we expect to open approximately 25 stores resulting in an increase in square footage of approximately 1.3%. 
We're estimating 2011 comp sales to be flat to positive 1% and including the 53rd week, total sales increase of approximately 4%. For the fiscal year we are anticipating EBIT to increase by approximately 10 basis points. For 2011, depreciation expense is expected to be $1.47 billion, and interest expense is expected to be approximately $350 million. 
For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.6%. Some of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.56 to $1.64 which represents an increase of 10% to 15% over 2010. We have tempered our outlook for the second half and for the year due to the uncertainty the impact of gas prices in overall inflation will have on consumer spending. In addition, the correction in housing continues to play out, and there is a potential that home price declines extend into 2012.
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.6 billion. Our capital expenditures for each 2011 are forecasted be approximately $1.8 billion and roughly $100 million funded operating leases resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow of $2.9 billion for the year. Our guidance assumes approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases for 2011. We repurchased $1 billion in Q1 with the remaining $1.4 billion expected to be spread evenly across the next 3 quarters. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

In fact, we're performing better than we did in first quarter, and we are confident in our Q2 outlook. We did miss some seasonal sales in Q1. We expect to recover some of those in Q2, which leads to our 2% comp outlook for the second quarter. As it relates to margin, we are expecting some nominal margin decline in the back half of the year. Some of that comes from fuel costs. Fuel was up early in the year, still is up relative to last year. We'll see that as the sales through cost of goods impacting gross margin Q2 and into the back half of the year. In addition, our shrink was up slightly by 10 basis points in the first quarter. We expect to be up roughly 5 basis points for the rest of the year, which is contributing to the decline in margin for the year."

And then secondly, we are starting to see in our consumer survey that consumers are mentioning the impact of fuel prices starting to impact their purchase decisions. And when we think about discretionary income and the fact that when fuel prices go up it does limit their ability to spend on discretionary basis, part of that is what we've taken into account as we've looked at over the balance of the year. And I think Bob also alluded in his comments that as we look over the balance of the year with what's going on with housing, with fuel prices, those types of things some of the talked about potentially the bottoming in home prices extending beyond the second half of the year and potentially into the first half of 2012.

This weekend was a little bit of a challenging looking the weather across the country. But we see the weather improve, not only just the fact of improved weather but also an opportunity to pick up some of those sales that were delayed from the first quarter into the second quarter leads us to be comfortable with the guidance that we provided today. And we think we've been sufficiently conservative in that guidance to take into account the impact of fuel prices and everything else that is impacting the customer's mindset today.

I think we've seen some of economist we've already seen the double dip in home prices and so you have economist today who are forecasting home prices to begin stabilization in the fourth quarter of 2011 now begin to stretch that stabilization period into 2012. The risk we're trying to monitor is really the impact of foreclosure sales in the marketplace today and how that's impacting market by market the stabilization of home values. So we're definitely being conservative when we try to understand what will happen to home prices on a regional and a market basis across all the areas that we operate in. But there are some mitigating factors out there. Robert touched on it earlier. There's all of our affinity scores when we do our own customer sentiment research are coming in as significantly higher than we've seen in the past couple of years. And these are affinity statements such as I enjoy conducting home improvement projects, I'm willing to spend more and invest in home improvement time and money. We're seeing some pretty interesting strong upsurges in all of the affinity areas. So if you look at -- if you break apart your University of Michigan consumer sentiment research that Rick just released, the difference between current situation and expectations is beginning to create 2 different factor. And I think that's what we're trying to understand is the consumer seems poised given certain macroeconomic factors to be able to invest time and money into home improvement as we move into the second half of the year and into the beginning of 2012. Obviously, the #1 thing on their mind and we're hearing this from both outside research and from our own consumer sentiment survey is gas prices. It can affect as much as 2/3 of homeowners in terms of their willingness to spend, and that's where they're going to be watching their budget. The other factor, of course, is the factor of is My home value increasing or decreasing, is my local housing situation improving or not improving. And we're seeing pretty strong sentiment today on current situation that most people feel their home values and their local market are not improving. So those are the 2 watchouts but we're also keeping an eye on the fact that from a standpoint of affinity with home improvement we are seeing scores we haven't seen in years."

Sales for the",1328,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results.
Our performance for the quarter did not meet our expectations. Sales for the quarter declined 1.6%, and comparable store sales declined 3.3%. Comp average ticket was essentially flat in the first quarter, while comp traffic declined 3.4%.  But we had solid gross margin improvement and delivered earnings per share within our guidance despite lower-than-expected sales. I would like to thank our more than 234,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.
We faced tough comparisons in the first quarter as a result of last year's government stimulus programs such as Cash for Appliances and the Homebuyer Tax Credit, as well as favorable weather conditions last year. We knew the bar was high, but we had a reasonable plan in place heading into the quarter, and we executed against that plan. In fact, our performance was solid through about week 8 of the quarter, and then we had -- and then we were impacted by the unseasonably cold wet weather in the Northeast, North Central and Northwest regions of the U.S. and the severe storms in the southern part of the country, in particular, the unprecedented tornado season.
In fact, the Lowe's store in Sanford, North Carolina was struck by a tornado in mid-April. Fortunately, there were no customer or employee fatalities or injuries. However, the store sustained severe damage, resulting in a need to demolish and rebuild the store. Our thoughts are with the families impacted by the numerous tornadoes and widespread flooding throughout the country. As we've done in the past when natural disasters strike, Lowe's stores around the country, as well as lowes.com, became official donation sites for the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund, with Lowe's also contributing $750,000 to the relief efforts. 
Overall, the economic recovery is continuing but uncertainty remains. And consumer confidence sagged during the quarter, in response to increasing concerns around inflation, unrest in the Middle East and the impact of potential budget cuts at the federal, state and local levels. In fact, U.S. GDP growth slowed to 1.8% for the first quarter after a 3.1% rise in fourth quarter.
More specifically, with regard to home improvement spending, the drivers were mixed. Employment and disposable income are slowly improving, but housing turnover is restrained, and home prices continue to decline. The implications for our business is that customers may feel better about their employment situation but are uneasy due to higher fuel, clothing and food costs, as well as geopolitical issues around the world. In addition, decreasing home prices and low housing turnover mean consumers remain cautious when it comes to big-ticket, discretionary spending on their homes.
According to our first quarter consumer survey, rising gas and energy prices are cited by homeowners as the top factor affecting future spending plans followed by the state of the overall economy and inflation in general. While housing values remain a concern, we did see positive trends in home improvement affinity and project plans in our survey, which may suggest that homeowners are beginning to look for ways to enhance their homes. 
That said, our survey indicates that 84% of planned spending in the next 6 months will be small ticket, less than $500, and 43% of that planned spending will be discretionary.
As we shared with you previously, our business has historically been 60% maintenance and 40% discretionary. But during the downturn, that mix shifted closer to 70% maintenance and 30% discretionary. 
As consumers have focused increasingly on maintenance projects, and as the cost of fuel has increased, convenience of store location is playing a growing role in consumer's choice of where to shop. Differentiation is key to combating this convenience factor in addition to our targeted store expansion strategy. These 2 factors, convenience and differentiation, as well as the opportunity to close more sales, are driving our transformation from a home improvement retailer to a home improvement company.
As we discussed at our analyst conference in November, we are working diligently on our commitment to deliver better customer experiences, while pulling together the best combination of possibilities, support and value for customers wherever and whenever they choose to engage and we're building momentum behind this transformation in 2011. 
Research assume that there are 7 stages in home improvement spending: inspiration, planning, getting supplies, getting started, making progress, finishing and enjoyment. Each stage differs in length based on the type of project the customer's undertaking, and the level of emotional engagement is generally higher in the beginning and ending stages than it is in the middle. 
Traditionally, our industry is focused on getting supplies where emotional engagement is relatively low. Our focus for the future is on all 7 stages, as we strive to provide customer with a better and differentiated experience. As I said, we're building momentum behind our transformation, so let me give you some examples. 
During the quarter, our store employees began using a business community portal that puts them in touch with fellow employees throughout our chain. Through this portal, they are able to communicate with one another and offer solutions to the questions they encounter everyday. We also launched that too on lowes.com that gives customers the ability to ask product-specific questions and receive answers from a variety of sources, including Lowe's employees, other customers and product vendors. With these systems, our employees can provide more in-depth advice in-store or whoever customers choose, plus allowing customers to more easily complete their projects. 
A little over a year ago, we completed our lowes.com platform redesign, and since that time, we've been making incremental improvements, fueling a 19% increase in traffic year-over-year and a 78% increase in online conversion rates. We also saw a substantial increase in customer satisfaction according to third-party data.
We have over 170,000 items available online with significant expansions planned for the remainder of the year. And also, we plan to launch the Spanish version of lowes.com this summer in an effort to better resonate with this very important demographic. We will also deliver further improvements in our multi-channeled presence this summer, as we launch our first mobile app, as well as foundational capabilities to support My Lowe's, our customer-focused portal that will allow customers to more efficiently manage projects and improve their homes.
Finally, we will roll out to repair services content -- concept to outdoor power equipment or OPE in the second quarter. Having after sales service for this product category is expected to increase our share position, while positively affecting customer satisfaction, resulting in incremental repeat customer visits and allowing us to minimize cost savings through lower OPE return rates. This initiative will also increase our ability to identify product quality concerns that we can work with our vendors to resolve. 
This transformation is about living up to our vision to provide the customer base solutions necessary to become the first choice in home improvement. It's about bringing Lowe's to the consumer on their terms regardless of the physical store presence and making the experience relevant and personal. Make no mistake, this effort is as much about maintenance items and small projects as it is larger-ticket, discretionary projects.
In the second quarter, we expect to take advantage of the late seasonal opportunities, as weather patterns improve and consumers are finally able to move outdoors and tackle traditional projects, as well as repair damage caused by the harsh weather. We continue to expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, given the challenging comparisons in the first half of last year as a result of government stimulus programs. However, stabilization of home prices and solid progress working through the inventory of distressed housing will be key milestones for recovery. 
Thanks again for your interest, and now I'll turn it over to Rick Damron to provide more details on the quarter. Rick?"

I will review our first quarter performance, discuss the new programs underway to drive sales, then update you on ways we continue to learn and improve. As Robert mentioned, we finished the first quarter with negative 3",1852,"Thanks, Robert, and good morning. I will review our first quarter performance, discuss the new programs underway to drive sales, then update you on ways we continue to learn and improve. 
As Robert mentioned, we finished the first quarter with negative 3.3% comps. Performance exceeded the company average in the Southeast, South Central and desert Southwest regions of the country, where temperatures and rainfall were close to normal. On the other hand, performance lagged the company average by over 200 basis points in the Northeast and North Central regions of the country, where colder and winter conditions prevailed. 
Looking at a detailed analysis of our indoor and outdoor performance, specifically characterized by hundreds of product groups as indoor or outdoor, comp store performance of our outdoor categories were essentially flat, while our outdoor categories declined 9% for the quarter and 21% over the last 5 weeks of the quarter. Some categories actually benefited from wet weather. For instance, rough plumbing performance benefited from strong sales of pumps and tanks and air filters. 
There were some additional factors affecting category performance in the quarter. On the positive side, cabinets and counter tops performed well, driven by strong performance of our special order kitchen cabinets. Inflation drove high single-digit comps in rough electrical and helped paint to comp positively overcoming slow sales of exterior stains sealers and applicators. 
On the negative side, Millwork was impacted by the pull forward of sales into 2010 from expiring energy tax credits. Further, as expected, appliances were unable to overcome a very difficult comparison to the last year's Cash for Appliances program but achieved a 2-year comp of roughly 9%. 
Installed sales generated low single-digit comps driven by strong promotions in special order kitchen cabinets, improve special order lead times in appliances and customers' continued enthusiastic response to STAINMASTER Carpet.
Not surprisingly, our comp store performance was driven by April transactions, not ticket. Comparable store average ticket was essentially flat and was flat to positive in 12 of 21 domestic regions. Even though we were comping against the favorable impact to ticket of last year's Cash for Appliances program. 
On the other hand, comp transactions decreased 3.4% year-over-year, increasing in February, declining low single digit in March and declining high single digit in April. The weakest April transaction comps occurred within the Northeast and North Central areas of the country. 
Our ending first quarter inventory is 2.4% lower than first quarter of 2010, which, as a reminder, ended 9.8% higher than the first quarter of 2009. Last year, we attribute our higher inventory to optimistic purchases of appliances and flooring. So if our inventory is lower than last year, we had the right inventory to meet customer demand in the second quarter.  Further, even though our first quarter sales of seasonal products struggled, we have confidence in our ability to sell through these inventories in the second quarter and avoid significant markdowns. 
As expected with negative comp performance, our expenses deleveraged. Bob will share more details regarding our overall expense performance, but I'd like to point that we're able to partially offset other expense deleverage through operating salaries leverage, while maintaining our strong customer service scores.  Although we hired aggressively for our weekend teams, we adjusted hiring of seasonal and temporary employees to forecasted sales trends. 
Now I'd like to discuss a few programs we undertook during the first quarter to close more sales and build ticket. As mentioned on the last quarter's call, we streamlined the store management structure and implemented weekend teams to provide more customer-facing hours on the weekends. And we adjusted our medium mix to obtain better efficiency from each advertising dollar. So I'd like to share with you some more details about these programs. 
First, we are pleased with the initial results of our weekend teams, who provide additional customer-facing hours from Friday through Sunday. We have filled more than 90% of our weekend positions. Unlike our seasonal hires, our weekend teams will remain in place throughout the year. These teams have increased our weekend-to-date total selling hours by 150 basis points. 
One indication of the effectiveness of this program is that our first quarter growth of comparable store sales and transactions on weekends were over 140 basis points higher than for weekdays.  Additionally, we have received positive feedback from our stores that the weekend teams are enhancing the customer experience and providing the staffing flexibility needed to support weekend traffic and sales. 
Next we realigned our media spend, placing more emphasis in online media, the same media that more of our customers are moving to. Online media is also much more efficient, as we can dramatically increase our medium presence per dollar versus print. Additionally, we shifted away from local to national radio, where once again, we can gain more impressions per dollar spent. 
We also rolled out 3 programs that were not discussed on our fourth quarter call. First, we entered into a Gift Card Mall program with Blackhawk. Blackhawk manages over 85% of the Gift Card Mall distribution in the U.S., and we now have our cards available for purchase in grocery stores and other high-volume retail channels, which will significantly increase our total gift card sales. In addition, Gift Card Malls will be in all of our stores beginning late in the second half of the year. 
Second, we introduced a tax refund card at the beginning of the first quarter. This promotion coincides with the timing of many customers' tax refunds, as cards were purchased from February 8 through March 14. On March 18, 10% of the original purchase amount was added to the card. We wanted to give customers another reason to make their initial purchases at Lowe's and then return for additional purchases. Customers and stores responded positively to these cards. However, we found that many of the cards were used on purchases that customers had already planned to make at Lowe's, so the incremental sales from this program were not as significant as we had planned. 
Third, we launched a program at the end of April that provides Lowe's consumer credit cardholders with 5% off everyday. For purchases above $299, we continue to offer cardholders the option of no interest financing instead of the 5% discount. You might wonder why we did this. 
Over the past year, we have experienced declines in our proprietary credit penetration, the result of regulatory changes that preclude companies from offering no payment promotions. Those regulatory changes dramatically reduced the value proposition of our proprietary card. Since our proprietary credit programs provide a lower cost of tender, we evaluated a number of options to drive customers back to this program.  We had used credit promotions ranging from our every day 6-month 0%  interest offer to periodic use to 12-month and 18-month 0% interest offers for key promotional periods. 
And last fall, given consumer's increasing focus on maintenance projects, we tested percent-off programs to determine whether we could drive greater proportion for smaller-ticket purchases. After evaluating our test, we concluded that a combination offer would enhance the card's value to customers by giving them another choice to make their purchases even more affordable everyday.
Now I'd like to discuss with you a few ways in which our organization continues to learn and improve. We have previously discussed our efforts to go local with our pricing using Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion and in market assorting, using Integrated Planning and Execution or IP&E. We have fully implemented Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion; and IP&E is being rolled out across all of our merchandise categories this year, with the benefits coming in 2012 and beyond. 
But there is another near-term effort to go local. I believe we have an opportunity to unleash more the creativity and market-specific knowledge of our store personnel.  During our rapid growth over the past decade, we needed more of a command-and-control approach to ensure our new stores represented the Lowe's brand. As our growth has slowed, the tenure of our store managers and associates has increased, giving them greater experience and knowledge to make their stores better to serve their specific markets. 
We will always have a centralized approach to ensuring consistent standards for merchandising, store environment and customer service. But I know we can maintain our high standards while also giving more latitude to our store teams to creatively address local market needs. I call this flexibility within the framework. 
Since assuming my role, I often blog within our business portal community, which is accessible for the entire Lowe's organization. I encourage our store employees to share examples of what they have done within their own stores to better serve customers and to drive sales.  
For instance, we recently introduced a new paint tray coated with Teflon. While priced higher than a traditional tray, it makes clean up easier and is more likely to be reused, which ultimately is a better value for the customer and more environmentally friendly. But despite strong messaging on the package, customers were not able to see the value until one associate put a simple idea into action. Take one tray, pour paint in it, let it dry and leave it for customers to see how easy it is to pull the paint right out the tray without washing or scrubbing. This simple display worked so well that the employees shared the idea on our business community portal. This display is now being used across most of the company, and sales of these trays have improved. 
Likewise on a larger scale, we continue to measure and improve our merchandising programs and find ways to better serve customers. One great example is our tools category. We took a category that was losing share and had lower comps and overhauled the offering by introducing a channel-exclusive in PORTER-CABLE handheld power tools. We also expanded our offering of DEWALT and now offer the largest assortment in our channel. We rationalized our offering at each price point, adjusting our assortments based on significant differences in market preferences, and we offered more innovative products. Our tools category has gained unit and dollar share, and we continue to drive more sales, which has led to positive low-single digit comps for the first quarter. 
We have also improved the performance of ceramic tile flooring by increasing our offering in the warmer southern states, expanding DEWALT tile assortments, bringing the samples to the floor and making take with the inventory for high-volume items more readily available for purchase. Then to improve service and attachment rates, we moved grouts, mortars and sealers closer to the tile, so customers can easily access everything needed for the job. And like tools, ceramic top produced low single-digit comps in the first quarter. 
We continue to learn and improve across all facets of our day-to-day operations, and we will continue to add company-wide tools and new processes to fulfill our promise to provide better customer experiences. 
Thanks for your interest in Lowe's. And I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our first quarter financial results. Bob?"

Sales for the first quarter were $12.2 billion, which represents a 1.6% decrease from last year's first quarter. In Q1, total customer transactions decreased 2.1%, while average ticket increased 0.5% to $62.51. Co",1603,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $12.2 billion, which represents a 1.6% decrease from last year's first quarter. In Q1, total customer transactions decreased 2.1%, while average ticket increased 0.5% to $62.51. Comp sales were negative 3.3% for the quarter, which is below our guidance of essentially flat. For the quarter comp transactions decreased 3.4%, and comp average ticket increased 0.1%. 
Looking at monthly credits, comps were positive 2.7% in February, negative 1.9% in March and negative 8.3% in April. The monthly comp trends reflect the difficult comparisons we had versus last year's positive 8.8% April comp, which was driven by both favorable weather and government stimulus. 
Q1 was our most difficult comparison to last year due to the impact of Cash for Appliances. In Q1 2010, Cash for Appliances aided comps by 65 basis points. We knew this going into the quarter and felt that we had a reasonable plan in place. In fact, we were ahead of our sales plans through our fiscal week 8. Then as Rick described, unseasonable weather over the last 5 weeks of the quarter had a significant impact on our exterior categories, which represent about 40% of our sales for that 5-week period and was the primary driver of our below-plan sales for the quarter. 
With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the first quarter include rough electrical, rough plumbing, cabinets and countertops, tools, lighting, paint, flooring, home fashion, storage and cleaning, hardware and fashion plumbing. Seasonal living performed at approximately the overall corporate average. 
Gross margin for the quarter -- for the first quarter was 35.44% of sales and increased 26 basis points over last year's first quarter. The increase was driven by 34 basis points of margin rate improvement with Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion accounting for approximately 25 basis points of the margin rate improvement. 
Additionally, gross margin benefited 28 basis points from the mix of items sold, the result of strong sales and rough plumbing, as well as lower sales in outdoor power equipment and appliances. These improvements were partially offset by deleverage and distribution expenses, primarily, the result of increased fuel costs and higher inventory shrink. 
SG&A for Q1 was 25.6% of sales, which deleveraged 62 basis points. The largest driver of the SG&A deleverage was insurance, both casualty and employee, was deleveraged 32 basis points. The increase in casualty was weighted to a favorable actuarial adjustment in last year's first quarter. The deleverage in employee insurance led to increased claim cost and higher dependent enrollment. 
We also experienced approximately 15 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improving customer experiences. Expenses related to staffing up our contact center to support the insourcing of appliance repairs last year and contract labor for additional lowes.com capabilities, advancing the My Lowe's concept and continued efforts to build out our customer relationship platform.  In addition, advertising expense deleverage-ed approximately 10 basis points, largely due to the timing of spend versus last year. 
Lastly, while only about 5 basis points each, deleverage for the following items is worth noting: delivery due to higher fuel costs; payroll taxes related to higher state unemployment tax rates; bankcard due to higher interchange rates; and proprietary credit associated with lower sales as a result of a lower receivable related to the provision against no-payment promotions.  Somewhat offsetting these items was leverage and bonus expense. We fell short of our sales and earnings plan for the quarter, and as a result, we reduced our expected bonus payout amounts accordingly. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $371 million, which was 3.05% of sales and leveraged 15 basis points compared to last year's first quarter due to slower square footage growth and assets becoming fully depreciated.  Earnings before interest and taxes decreased 21 basis points to 6.79% of sales. Interest expense is $88 million for the quarter deleveraged 6 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.  For the quarter, total expenses were 29.3% of sales and deleveraged 53 basis points. 
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 6.07% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 37.8% for Q1 last year. Earnings per share of $0.34 for the quarter were at the bottom end of our guidance of $0.34 to $0.38 and were flat to last year's $0.34. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $1.5 billion. Our first quarter inventory balance of $9.7 billion decreased $238 million or 2.4% from Q1 last year. The decrease was due to a 5.6% decrease in comp store inventory, offset by square footage growth of 1.6% and a slight increase in distribution inventory. 
Inventory turnover, calculated by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last 5 quarters, was 3.5%, a decrease of 6 basis points from Q1 2010. Return on assets determined using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters increased 44 basis points to 5.63%. 
Moving to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $6.7 billion represents a 5% decrease from Q1 last year. The decrease in accounts payable is higher than our 2.4% decrease in inventory, which relates to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year.  Our debt to equity ratio was 37.7% compared to 31.9% for Q1 last year. 
At the end of the first quarter, we suggested debt to EBITDAR was 1.72x, which is higher than our target of 1.8x. Return on invested capital measured using a trailing 4 quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last 5 quarters increased 75 basis points for the quarter to 8.91%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion, which is $313 million lower than Q1 2010 due to the timing of income tax payments versus last year and the decrease in accounts payable related to the timing of purchases. Cash used and profit acquired was $313 million, up $30 million over last year, due to an increase in information technology spending on lowes.com, store infrastructure and the ongoing buildout of our customer relationship platform.  As a result, first quarter free cash flow of $2.1 billion was down 14% versus last year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 37.9 million shares at an average price of $26.42 for a total repurchased amount of $1 billion. We have $1.4 billion remaining share repurchase authorization. The remaining $31 million of the $1.013 billion of share repurchase -- of repurchase of common stock shown in the statement of cash flows relates to shares repurchased from employees to satisfy either the exercised price of stock options or the statutory withholding tax liability upon investing our restricted stock forwards. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. We expect second quarter total sales to increase approximately 4%, which will incorporate some comp sales increase of approximately 2% and square footage growth of approximately 1.5%. 
As we noted, our Q1 sales shortfall was driven by poor seasonal sales as a result of weather. In the second quarter as the weather has improved, so have our sales.  In fact, sales trends for the beginning of May are much better than April, which gives us confidence in our Q2 sales outlook. 
Depreciation for Q2 is expected to be approximately $370 million and leverage to about 30 basis points to last year's second quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes for the second quarter are expected to increase 20 to 30 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. 
For the quarter, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.6% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.69, which represents an increase of 12% to 19% over last year's $0.58. 
In 2011, we expect to open approximately 25 stores, resulting in an increase in square footage of approximately 1.3%.  We're estimating 2011 comp sales to be flat to positive 1%, and including the 53rd week, a total sales increase of approximately 4%. 
For the fiscal year we're anticipating EBIT to increase by approximately 10 basis points. For 2011, depreciation expense is expected to be $1.47 billion, and interest expense is expected to be approximately $350 million.  For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.6%. Some of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.56 to $1.64, which represents an increase of 10% to 15% over 2010. 
We have tempered our outlook for the second half and for the year due to the uncertainty, the impact of gas prices and overall inflation will have on consumer spending. In addition, the corruption in housing continues to play up, and there is the potential that home price declines extend into 2012.
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.6 billion. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecasted to be approximately $1.8 billion and roughly $100 million funded by operating leases, resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow of $2.9 billion for the year. 
Our guidance assumes approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases for 2011. We repurchased $1 billion in Q1, with a remaining $1.4 billion expected to be spread evenly across the next 3 quarters. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

We expect to recover some of those in Q2, which leads to our 2% comp outlook for the second quarter. As it relates to margin, we are expecting some nominal margin decline in the back half of the year. Some of that comes from fuel costs. Fuel was up early in the year, still is up relative to last year. We'll see that as it sells through cost of goods, they're impacting gross margin Q2 and into the back half of the year. In addition, our shrink rate was up slightly by 10 basis points.

Some of the increase in shrink as a percent of sales was really based on the comp decline in Q1. And again, we'll have a nominal increase in shrink as a percent of sales in the back half of the year."

So we don't really think there were any declines in market share. And as you are aware, TraQline only pledged to retail sales. It does not impact or does not track commercial sales. But we think the biggest impact is -- as Bob and Rick described during the quarter, was primarily weather-related conditions. And then secondly, we are starting to see in our consumer survey that consumers are mentioning the impact of fuel prices starting to impact their purchase decisions. And when we think about discretionary income and the fact that when fuel prices go up, it does limit their ability to spend on discretionary basis, part of that is what we've taken into account as we've looked at over the balance of the year. And I think, Bob also alluded in his comments that as we look over the balance of the year, with what's going on with housing, with fuel prices, those types of things, you're starting to fear -- some of the economists talk about potentially the bottoming in home prices extending beyond the second half of the year, and potentially, into the first half of 2012. So overall, from a market-share standpoint, we think, we're executing well and continue to maintain and gain share in a lot of categories. But it's really more macro things rather than the impact that we saw in the quarter plus weather."

In Q1 seasonal categories bounced back very strong, as weather improved in May. This weekend was a little bit of a challenge, when you look at the weather across the country. But we see the weather improve, not only just the fact of improved weather, but also an opportunity to pick up some of those sales that were delayed from the first quarter into the second quarter. It feels it leads us to being comfortable with the guidance that we've provided today. And we think we've been sufficiently conservative in that guidance to take into account the impact of fuel prices and everything else that is impacting the customers' mindset today, so -- and we've put a lot of rigor into coming up towards the outlook and believe that it's achievable based on what we see out there and what we've seen quarter to-date in the performance as we -- particularly, as we look at where that performance is coming from."

I think, we've seen -- some economists say we've already seen the double dip in home prices, and so you have economists today, who are forecasting home prices to begin stabilization in the fourth quarter of 2011, now beginning to stretch that stabilization period into 2012. The risk that we're trying to monitor is really the impact of foreclosure sales in the marketplace today and how that's impacting market by market, the stabilization of home values. So we're definitely being conservative, when we try to understand what will happen to home prices on a regional and a market basis across all the areas that we operate in. But there are some mitigating factors out there. Robert touched on it earlier. There's -- all of our affinity scores, when we do our own customer sentiment research, are coming in as significantly higher than we've seen over the past couple of years. And these are affinity statements such as ""I enjoy conducting home improvement projects."" ""I'm willing to spend more and invest in home improvement time and money."" We're seeing some pretty interesting, strong upsurges in all of the affinity areas. So if you look at -- if you break apart your University of Michigan consumer sentiment research that Rick just released, the difference between current situation and expectations is beginning to create 2 different -- an interesting factor. And I think, that's what we're trying to understand -- is the consumer seems poised, given certain macro economic factors to be able to invest time and money into home improvement, as we move into the second half of the year and into the beginning of 2012. Obviously, the #1 thing on their mind, and we're hearing this from both outside research and from our own consumer sentiment surveying is gas prices. It can affect as much as 2/3 of homeowners in terms of their willingness to spend, and that's where they're going to be watching their budget. The other factor, of course, is the factor of is my home value increasing or decreasing, is my local housing situation improving or not improving. And we're seeing pretty strong sentiment today on current situation that most people feel their home values and their local market are not improving. So those are the 2 watchouts, but we're also keeping an eye on the fact that from a standpoint of affinity with home improvement, we're seeing scores we haven't seen in years."

Sales for the",1328,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results.
Our performance for the quarter did not meet our expectations. Sales for the quarter declined 1.6%, and comparable store sales declined 3.3%. Comp average ticket was essentially flat in the first quarter, while comp traffic declined 3.4%.  But we had solid gross margin improvement and delivered earnings per share within our guidance, despite lower-than-expected sales. I would like to thank our more than 234,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.
We faced tough comparisons in the first quarter as a result of last year's government stimulus programs, such as Cash for Appliances and the Homebuyer Tax Credit as well as favorable weather conditions last year. We knew the bar was high, but we had a reasonable plan in place heading into the quarter, and we executed against that plan. In fact, our performance was solid through about week 8 of the quarter, and then we had -- and then we were impacted by the unseasonably cold, wet weather in the Northeast, North Central and Northwest regions of the U.S. and the severe storms in the southern part of the country; in particular, the unprecedented tornado season.
In fact, the Lowe's store in Sanford, North Carolina was struck by a tornado in mid-April. Fortunately, there were no customer or employee fatalities or injuries. However, the store sustained severe damage, resulting in a need to demolish and rebuild the store. Our thoughts are with the families impacted by the numerous tornadoes and widespread flooding throughout the country. As we've done in the past when natural disasters strike, Lowe's stores around the country, as well as lowes.com, became official donation sites for the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund, with Lowe's also contributing $750,000 to the relief efforts. 
Overall, the economic recovery is continuing, but uncertainty remains. And consumer confidence sagged during the quarter in response to increasing concerns around inflation, unrest in the Middle East and the impact of potential budget cuts at the federal, state and local levels. In fact, U.S. GDP growth slowed to 1.8% for the first quarter after a 3.1% rise in the fourth quarter.
More specifically, with regard to home improvement spending, the drivers were mixed. Employment and disposable income are slowly improving while housing turnover is restrained and home prices continue to decline. The implications for our business is that customers may feel better about their employment situation but are uneasy due to higher fuel, clothing and food costs as well as geopolitical issues around the world. In addition, decreasing home prices and low housing turnover mean consumers remain cautious when it comes to big-ticket discretionary spending on their homes.
According to our first quarter consumer survey, rising gas and energy prices are cited by homeowners as the top factor affecting future spending plans, followed by the state of the overall economy and inflation in general. While housing values remain a concern, we did see positive trends in home improvement affinity and project plans in our survey, which may suggest that homeowners are beginning to look for ways to enhance their homes. 
That said, our survey indicates that 84% of planned spending in the next 6 months will be small-ticket, less than $500, and 43% of that planned spending will be discretionary.
As we shared with you previously, our business has historically been 60% maintenance and 40% discretionary. But during the downturn, that mix shifted closer to 70% maintenance and 30% discretionary. 
As consumers have focused increasingly on maintenance projects, and as the cost of fuel has increased, convenience of store location is playing a growing role in consumer's choice of where to shop. Differentiation is key to combating this convenience factor in addition to our targeted store expansion strategy. These 2 factors, convenience and differentiation, as well as the opportunity to close more sales are driving our transformation from a home improvement retailer to a home improvement company.
As we discussed at our analyst conference in November, we are working diligently on our commitment to deliver better customer experiences while pulling together the best combination of possibilities, support and value for customers wherever and whenever they choose to engage, and we're building momentum behind this transformation in 2011. 
Research assumed that there are 7 stages in home improvement spending: inspiration, planning, getting supplies, getting started, making progress, finishing and enjoyment. Each stage differs in length based on the type of project the customer's undertaking, and the level of emotional engagement is generally higher in the beginning and ending stages than it is in the middle. 
Traditionally, our industry is focused on getting supplies where emotional engagement is relatively low. Our focus for the future is on all 7 stages as we strive to provide customer with a better and differentiated experience. As I said, we're building momentum behind our transformation, so let me give you some examples. 
During the quarter, our store employees began using a business community portal that puts them in touch with fellow employees throughout our chain. Through this portal, they are able to communicate with one another and offer solutions to the questions they encounter every day. We also launched a tool on lowes.com that gives customers the ability to ask product-specific questions and receive answers from a variety of sources, including Lowe's employees, other customers and product vendors. With these systems, our employees can provide more in-depth advice in-store or wherever customers choose plus allowing customers to more easily complete their projects. 
A little over a year ago, we completed our lowes.com platform redesign, and since that time, we've been making incremental improvements, fueling a 19% increase in traffic year-over-year and a 78% increase in online conversion rates. We also saw a substantial increase in customer satisfaction according to third-party data.
We have over 170,000 items available online with significant expansions planned for the remainder of the year. And also, we plan to launch the Spanish version of lowes.com this summer in an effort to better resonate with this very important demographic. We will also deliver further improvements in our multi-channeled presence this summer as we launch our first mobile app as well as foundational capabilities to support My Lowe's, our customer-focused portal that will allow customers to more efficiently manage projects and improve their homes.
Finally, we will roll out to repair services content -- concept to outdoor power equipment, or OPE, in the second quarter. Having after-sales service for this product category is expected to increase our share position while positively affecting customer satisfaction, resulting in incremental repeat customer visits and allowing us to minimize cost savings through lower OPE return rates. This initiative will also increase our ability to identify product quality concerns that we can work with our vendors to resolve. 
This transformation is about living up to our vision to provide the customer value solutions necessary to become the first choice in home improvement. It's about bringing Lowe's to the consumer on their terms regardless of the physical store presence and making the experience relevant and personal. Make no mistake, this effort is as much about maintenance items and small projects as it is larger-ticket, discretionary projects.
In the second quarter, we expect to take advantage of the late seasonal opportunities as weather patterns improve and consumers are finally able to move outdoors and tackle traditional projects as well as repair damage caused by the harsh weather. We continue to expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, given the challenging comparisons in the first half of last year as a result of government stimulus programs. However, stabilization of home prices and solid progress working through the inventory of distressed housing will be key milestones for recovery. 
Thanks again for your interest, and now I'll turn it over to Rick Damron to provide more details on the quarter. Rick?"

I will review our first quarter performance, discuss the new programs under way to drive sales, then update you on ways we continue to learn and improve. As Robert mentioned, we finished the first quarter with negative",1841,"Thanks, Robert, and good morning. I will review our first quarter performance, discuss the new programs under way to drive sales, then update you on ways we continue to learn and improve. 
As Robert mentioned, we finished the first quarter with negative 3.3% comps. Performance exceeded the company average in the Southeast, South Central and desert Southwest regions of the country, where temperatures and rainfall were close to normal. On the other hand, performance lagged the company average by over 200 basis points in the Northeast and North Central regions of the country, where colder and winter conditions prevailed. 
Looking at a detailed analysis of our indoor and outdoor performance, specifically characterized by hundreds of product groups as indoor or outdoor, comp store performance of our outdoor categories were essentially flat, while our outdoor categories declined 9% for the quarter and 21% over the last 5 weeks of the quarter. Some categories actually benefited from wet weather. For instance, rough plumbing performance benefited from strong sales of pumps and tanks and air filters. 
There were some additional factors affecting category performance in the quarter. On the positive side, cabinets and countertops performed well, driven by strong performance of our special-order kitchen cabinets. Inflation drove high single-digit comps in rough electrical and helped paint to comp positively, overcoming slow sales of exterior stains, sealers and applicators. 
On the negative side, Millwork was impacted by the pull-forward of sales into 2010 from expiring energy tax credits. Further, as expected, appliances were unable to overcome a very difficult comparison to the last year's Cash for Appliances program but achieved a 2-year comp of roughly 9%. 
Installed sales generated low-single-digit comps driven by strong promotions in special-order kitchen cabinets, improve special-order lead times in appliances and customers' continued enthusiastic response to STAINMASTER Carpet.
Not surprisingly, our comp store performance was driven by April transactions, not ticket. Comparable store average ticket was essentially flat and was flat to positive in 12 of 21 domestic regions even though we were comping against the favorable impact to ticket of last year's Cash for Appliances program. 
On the other hand, comp transactions decreased 3.4% year-over-year, increasing in February, declining low single-digit in March and declining high single-digit in April. The weakest April transaction comps occurred within the Northeast and North Central areas of the country. 
Our ending first quarter inventory is 2.4% lower than first quarter of 2010, which, as a reminder, ended 9.8% higher than the first quarter of 2009. Last year, we attributed our higher inventory to optimistic purchases of appliances and flooring. So if our inventory is lower than last year, we had the right inventory to meet customer demand in the second quarter.  Further, even though our first quarter sales of seasonal products struggled, we have confidence in our ability to sell through these inventories in the second quarter and avoid significant markdowns. 
As expected, with negative comp performance, our expenses deleveraged. Bob will share more details regarding our overall expense performance, but I'd like to point that we're able to partially offset other expense deleverage through operating salaries leverage while maintaining our strong customer service scores.  Although we hired aggressively for our weekend teams, we adjusted hiring of seasonal and temporary employees to forecasted sales trends. 
Now I'd like to discuss a few programs we undertook during the first quarter to close more sales and build ticket. As mentioned on last quarter's call, we streamlined the store management structure and implemented weekend teams to provide more customer-facing hours on the weekends. And we adjusted our media mix to obtain better efficiency from each advertising dollar. So I'd like to share with you some more details about these programs. 
First, we are pleased with the initial results of our weekend teams, who provide additional customer-facing hours from Friday through Sunday. We have filled more than 90% of our weekend positions. Unlike our seasonal hires, our weekend teams will remain in place throughout the year. These teams have increased our weekend-to-date total selling hours by 150 basis points. 
One indication of the effectiveness of this program is that our first quarter growth of comparable store sales and transactions on weekends were over 140 basis points higher than for weekdays.  Additionally, we have received positive feedback from our stores that the weekend teams are enhancing the customer experience and providing the staffing flexibility needed to support weekend traffic and sales. 
Next we realigned our media spend, placing more emphasis in online media, the same media that more of our customers are moving to. Online media is also much more efficient as we can dramatically increase our media impressions per dollar versus print. Additionally, we shifted away from local to national radio, where, once again, we can gain more impressions per dollar spent. 
We also rolled out 3 programs that were not discussed on our fourth quarter call. First, we entered into a Gift Card Mall program with Blackhawk. Blackhawk manages over 85% of the Gift Card Mall distribution in the U.S., and we now have our cards available for purchase in grocery stores and other high-volume retail channels, which will significantly increase our total gift card sales. In addition, Gift Card Malls will be in all of our stores beginning late in the second half of the year. 
Second, we introduced a tax refund card at the beginning of the first quarter. This promotion coincided with the timing of many customers' tax refunds, as cards were purchased from February 8 through March 14. On March 18, 10% of the original purchase amount was added to the card. We wanted to give customers another reason to make their initial purchases at Lowe's and then return for additional purchases. Customers and stores responded positively to these cards. However, we found that many of the cards were used on purchases that customers had already planned to make at Lowe's, so the incremental sales from this program were not as significant as we had planned. 
Third, we launched a program at the end of April that provides Lowe's consumer credit cardholders with 5% off every day. For purchases above $299, we continue to offer cardholders the option of no interest financing instead of the 5% discount. You might wonder why we did this. 
Over the past year, we have experienced declines in our proprietary credit penetration, the result of regulatory changes that preclude companies from offering no-payment promotions. Those regulatory changes dramatically reduced the value proposition of our proprietary card. Since our proprietary credit programs provide a lower cost of tender, we evaluated a number of options to drive customers back to this program.  We had used credit promotions ranging from our everyday 6-month 0% interest offer to periodic use of 12-month and 18-month 0% interest offers for key promotional periods. 
And last fall, given consumer's increasing focus on maintenance projects, we tested percent-off programs to determine whether we could drive greater proportion of smaller-ticket purchases. After evaluating our test, we concluded that a combination offer would enhance the card's value to customers by giving them another choice to make their purchases even more affordable every day.
Now I'd like to discuss with you a few ways in which our organization continues to learn and improve. We have previously discussed our efforts to go local with our pricing using Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion and in market assorting, using Integrated Planning and Execution, or IP&E. We have fully implemented Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion; and IP&E is being rolled out across all of our merchandise categories this year, with the benefits coming in 2012 and beyond. 
But there is another near-term effort to go local. I believe we have an opportunity to unleash more the creativity and market-specific knowledge of our store personnel.  During our rapid growth over the past decade, we needed more of a command-and-control approach to ensure our new stores represented the Lowe's brand. As our growth has slowed, the tenure of our store managers and associates has increased, giving them greater experience and knowledge to make their stores better to serve their specific markets. 
We will always have a centralized approach to ensuring consistent standards for merchandising, store environment and customer service. But I know we can maintain our high standards while also giving more latitude to our store teams to creatively address local market needs. I call this flexibility within the framework. 
Since assuming my role, I often blog within our business portal community, which is accessible for the entire Lowe's organization. I encourage our store employees to share examples of what they have done within their own stores to better serve customers and to drive sales.  
For instance, we recently introduced a new paint tray coated with Teflon. While priced higher than a traditional tray, it makes clean-up easier and is more likely to be reused, which ultimately is a better value for the customer and more environmentally friendly. But despite strong messaging on the package, customers were not able to see the value until one associate put a simple idea into action. Take one tray, pour paint in it, let it dry and leave it for customers to see how easy it is to pull the paint right out the tray without washing or scrubbing. This simple display worked so well that the employees shared the idea on our business community portal. This display is now being used across most of the company, and sales of these trays have improved. 
Likewise, on a larger scale, we continue to measure and improve our merchandising programs and find ways to better serve customers. One great example is our tools category. We took a category that was losing share and had lower comps and overhauled the offering by introducing a channel exclusive in PORTER-CABLE handheld power tools. We also expanded our offering of DEWALT and now offer the largest assortment in our channel. We rationalized our offering at each price point, adjusting our assortments based on significant differences in market preferences, and we offered more innovative products. Our tools category has gained unit and dollar share, and we continue to drive more sales, which has led to positive low-single-digit comps for the first quarter. 
We have also improved the performance of ceramic tile flooring by increasing our offering in the warmer southern states, expanding DEWALT tile assortments, bringing the samples to the floor and making take with inventory for high-volume items more readily available for purchase. Then to improve service and attachment rates, we moved grouts, mortars and sealers closer to the tile, so customers can easily access everything needed for the job. And, like tools, ceramic tile produced low-single-digit comps in the first quarter. 
We continue to learn and improve across all facets of our day-to-day operations, and we will continue to add company-wide tools and new processes to fulfill our promise to provide better customer experiences. 
Thanks for your interest in Lowe's. And I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our first quarter financial results. Bob?"

Sales for the first quarter were $12.2 billion, which represents a 1.6% decrease from last year's first quarter. In Q1, total customer transactions decreased 2.1% while average ticket increased 0.5% to $62.51. Com",1600,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $12.2 billion, which represents a 1.6% decrease from last year's first quarter. In Q1, total customer transactions decreased 2.1% while average ticket increased 0.5% to $62.51. Comp sales were negative 3.3% for the quarter, which is below our guidance of essentially flat. For the quarter, comp transactions decreased 3.4%, and comp average ticket increased 0.1%. 
Looking at monthly credits, comps were positive 2.7% in February, negative 1.9% in March and negative 8.3% in April. The monthly comp trends reflect the difficult comparisons we had versus last year's positive 8.8% April comp, which was driven by both favorable weather and government stimulus. 
Q1 was our most difficult comparison to last year due to the impact of Cash for Appliances. In Q1 2010, Cash for Appliances aided comps by 65 basis points. We knew this going into the quarter and felt that we had a reasonable plan in place. In fact, we were ahead of our sales plan through our fiscal week 8. Then, as Rick described, unseasonable weather over the last 5 weeks of the quarter had a significant impact on our exterior categories, which represent about 40% of our sales for that 5-week period and was the primary driver of our below-plan sales for the quarter. 
With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the first quarter include rough electrical, rough plumbing, cabinets and countertops, tools, lighting, paint, flooring, home fashion, storage and cleaning, hardware and fashion plumbing. Seasonal living performed at approximately the overall corporate average. 
Gross margin for the quarter -- for the first quarter was 35.44% of sales and increased 26 basis points over last year's first quarter. The increase was driven by 34 basis points of margin rate improvement, with Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion accounting for approximately 25 basis points of the margin rate improvement. 
Additionally, gross margin benefited 28 basis points from the mix of items sold, the result of strong sales in rough plumbing as well as lower sales in outdoor power equipment and appliances. These improvements were partially offset by deleverage and distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased fuel costs and higher inventory shrink. 
SG&A for Q1 was 25.6% of sales, which deleveraged 62 basis points. The largest driver of the SG&A deleverage was insurance, both casualty and employee, was deleveraged 32 basis points. The increase in casualty was weighted to a favorable actuarial adjustment in last year's first quarter. The deleverage in employee insurance led to increased claim costs and higher dependent enrollment. 
We also experienced approximately 15 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences, expenses related to staffing up our contact center to support the insourcing of appliance repairs last year and contract labor for additional lowes.com capabilities, advancing the My Lowe's concept and continued efforts to build out our customer relationship platform.  In addition, advertising expense deleveraged approximately 10 basis points, largely due to the timing of spend versus last year. 
Lastly, while only about 5 basis points each, deleverage for the following items is worth noting: delivery due to higher fuel costs; payroll taxes related to higher state unemployment tax rates; bankcard due to higher interchange rates; and proprietary credit associated with lower sales as a result of a lower receivable related to the provision against no-payment promotions.  Somewhat offsetting these items was leverage and bonus expense. We fell short of our sales and earnings plan for the quarter, and as a result, we reduced our expected bonus payout amounts accordingly. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $371 million, which was 3.05% of sales and leveraged 15 basis points compared to last year's first quarter due to slower square-footage growth and assets becoming fully depreciated.  Earnings before interest and taxes decreased 21 basis points to 6.79% of sales. Interest expense at $88 million for the quarter deleveraged 6 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.  For the quarter, total expenses were 29.3% of sales and deleveraged 53 basis points. 
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 6.07% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 37.8% for Q1 last year. Earnings per share of $0.34 for the quarter were at the bottom end of our guidance of $0.34 to $0.38 and were flat to last year's $0.34. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $1.5 billion. Our first quarter inventory balance of $9.7 billion decreased $238 million, or 2.4%, from Q1 last year. The decrease was due to a 5.6% decrease in comp store inventory, offset by square-footage growth of 1.6% and a slight increase in distribution inventory. 
Inventory turnover, calculated by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last 5 quarters, was 3.5%, a decrease of 6 basis points from Q1 2010. Return on assets, determined using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters, increased 44 basis points to 5.63%. 
Moving to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $6.7 billion represents a 5% decrease from Q1 last year. The decrease in accounts payable is higher than our 2.4% decrease in inventory, which relates to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year.  Our debt to equity ratio was 37.7% compared to 31.9% for Q1 last year. 
At the end of the first quarter, we suggested debt to EBITDAR was 1.72, which is higher than our target of 1.8x. Return on invested capital measured using a trailing 4 quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last 5 quarters increased 75 basis points for the quarter to 8.91%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion, which is $313 million lower than Q1 2010 due to the timing of income tax payments versus last year and the decrease in accounts payable related to the timing of purchases. Cash used and profit acquired was $313 million, up $30 million over last year due to an increase in information technology spending on lowes.com, store infrastructure and the ongoing buildout of our customer relationship platform.  As a result, first quarter free cash flow of $2.1 billion was down 14% versus last year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 37.9 million shares at an average price of $26.42 for a total repurchased amount of $1 billion. We have $1.4 billion remaining share repurchase authorization. The remaining $31 million of the $1.013 billion of share repurchase -- of repurchase of common stock shown in the statement of cash flows relates to shares repurchased from employees to satisfy either the exercised price of stock options or the statutory withholding tax liability upon investing our restricted stock forwards. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. We expect second quarter total sales to increase approximately 4%, which will incorporate some comp sales increase of approximately 2% and square footage growth of approximately 1.5%. 
As we noted, our Q1 sales shortfall was driven by poor seasonal sales as a result of weather. In the second quarter, as the weather has improved, so have our sales.  In fact, sales trends for the beginning of May are much better than April, which gives us confidence in our Q2 sales outlook. 
Depreciation for Q2 is expected to be approximately $370 million and leverage about 30 basis points to last year's second quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes for the second quarter are expected to increase 20 to 30 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. 
For the quarter, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.6% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.69, which represents an increase of 12% to 19% over last year's $0.58. 
In 2011, we expect to open approximately 25 stores, resulting in an increase in square footage of approximately 1.3%.  We're estimating 2011 comp sales to be flat to positive 1%, and including the 53rd week, a total sales increase of approximately 4%. 
For the fiscal year, we're anticipating EBIT to increase by approximately 10 basis points. For 2011, depreciation expense is expected to be $1.47 billion, and interest expense is expected to be approximately $350 million.  For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.6%. Some of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.56 to $1.64, which represents an increase of 10% to 15% over 2010. 
We have tempered our outlook for the second half and for the year due to the uncertainty the impact of gas prices and overall inflation will have on consumer spending. In addition, the correction in housing continues to play up, and there is the potential that home price declines extend into 2012.
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.6 billion. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecasted to be approximately $1.8 billion with roughly $100 million funded by operating leases, resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow of $2.9 billion for the year. 
Our guidance assumes approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases for 2011. We repurchased $1 billion in Q1, with a remaining $1.4 billion expected to be spread evenly across the next 3 quarters. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

In fact, we're performing much -- we're performing better than we did in first quarter, and we are confident in our Q2 outlook. We did miss some seasonal sales in Q1. We expect to recover some of those in Q2, which leads to our 2% comp outlook for the second quarter. As it relates to margin, we are expecting some nominal margin decline in the back half of the year. Some of that comes from fuel costs. Fuel was up early in the year, still is up relative to last year. We'll see that as it sells through cost of goods negatively impacting gross margin Q2 and into the back half of the year. In addition, our shrink rate was up slightly, by 10 basis points. In the first quarter, we expected it to be up, roughly, 5 basis points for the rest of the year, which is contributing to the decline in margin for the year."

So we don't really think there were any declines in market share. And as you are aware, TraQline only relates to retail sales. It does not impact or does not track commercial sales. But we think the biggest impact is, as Bob and Rick described, during the quarter, was primarily weather-related conditions. And then secondly, we are starting to see in our consumer survey that consumers are mentioning the impact of fuel prices starting to impact their purchase decisions. And when we think about discretionary income and the fact that when fuel prices go up, it does limit their ability to spend on discretionary basis, part of that is what we've taken into account as we've looked at over the balance of the year. And I think Bob also alluded in his comments that as we look over the balance of the year with what's going on with housing, with fuel prices, those types of things, you're starting to hear some of the economists talk about potentially the bottoming in home prices extending beyond the second half of the year and, potentially, into the first half of 2012. So overall, from a market-share standpoint, we think we're executing well and continue to maintain and gain share in a lot of categories.

As I said in my comments, I think, until like week 8, we were running with -- in line -- ahead of our plan. Bob took you through the comp trends for the month, and we've actually seen for the first 2 weeks of May, we've seen seasonal categories bounce back very strong, where we've had -- which were where the biggest shortfall was. In Q1 seasonal categories bounced back very strong as weather improved in May. This weekend was a little bit of a challenge, when you look at the weather across the country. But we see the weather improve, not only just the fact of improved weather, but also the opportunity to pick up some of those sales that were delayed from the first quarter into the second quarter. It feels it leads us to being comfortable with the guidance that we've provided today. And we think we've been sufficiently conservative in that guidance to take into account the impact of fuel prices and everything else that is impacting the customers' mindset today, so -- and we've put a lot of rigor into coming up with the outlook and believe that it's achievable based on what we see out there and what we've seen quarter-to-date in the performance as we, particularly, if we look at where that performance is coming from."

I think, we've seen -- some economists say we've already seen the double-dip in home prices, and so you have economists today who were forecasting home prices to begin stabilization in the fourth quarter of 2011 now beginning to stretch that stabilization period into 2012. The risk that we're trying to monitor is really the impact of foreclosure sales in the marketplace today and how that's impacting market by market the stabilization of home values. So we're definitely being conservative when we try to understand what will happen to home prices on a regional and a market basis across all the areas that we operate in. But there are some mitigating factors out there. Robert touched on it earlier. There's -- all of our affinity scores, when we do our own customer sentiment research, are coming in as significantly higher than we've seen over the past couple of years. And these are affinity statements such as ""I enjoy conducting home improvement projects."" ""I'm willing to spend more and invest in home improvement time and money."" We're seeing some pretty interesting, strong upsurges in all of the affinity areas. So if you look at -- if you break apart your University of Michigan consumer sentiment research that Rick just released, the difference between current situation and expectations is beginning to create 2 different -- an interesting vector. And I think that's what we're trying to understand is the consumer seems poised, given certain macro-economic factors to be able to invest time and money into home improvement as we move into the second half of the year and into the beginning of 2012. Obviously, the #1 thing on their mind, and we're hearing this from both outside research and from our own consumer sentiment surveying, is gas prices. It can affect as much as 2/3 of homeowners in terms of their willingness to spend, and that's where they're going to be watching their budget. The other factor, of course, is the factor of is my home value increasing or decreasing?  Is my local housing situation improving or not improving?  And we're seeing pretty strong sentiment today on current situation that most people feel their home values and their local market are not improving. So those are the 2 watch outs, but we're also keeping an eye on the fact that from a standpoint of affinity with home improvement, we're seeing scores we haven't seen in years."

Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results.Our performance for the quarter did not meet our expectations. Sales for the",1328,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results.
Our performance for the quarter did not meet our expectations. Sales for the quarter declined 1.6%, and comparable store sales declined 3.3%. Comp average ticket was essentially flat in the first quarter, while comp traffic declined 3.4%.  But we had solid gross margin improvement and delivered earnings per share within our guidance, despite lower-than-expected sales. I would like to thank our more than 234,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.
We faced tough comparisons in the first quarter as a result of last year's government stimulus programs, such as Cash for Appliances and the Homebuyer Tax Credit as well as favorable weather conditions last year. We knew the bar was high, but we had a reasonable plan in place heading into the quarter, and we executed against that plan. In fact, our performance was solid through about week 8 of the quarter, and then we had -- and then we were impacted by the unseasonably cold, wet weather in the Northeast, North Central and Northwest regions of the U.S. and the severe storms in the southern part of the country; in particular, the unprecedented tornado season.
In fact, the Lowe's store in Sanford, North Carolina was struck by a tornado in mid-April. Fortunately, there were no customer or employee fatalities or injuries. However, the store sustained severe damage, resulting in a need to demolish and rebuild the store. Our thoughts are with the families impacted by the numerous tornadoes and widespread flooding throughout the country. As we've done in the past when natural disasters strike, Lowe's stores around the country, as well as lowes.com, became official donation sites for the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund, with Lowe's also contributing $750,000 to the relief efforts. 
Overall, the economic recovery is continuing, but uncertainty remains. And consumer confidence sagged during the quarter in response to increasing concerns around inflation, unrest in the Middle East and the impact of potential budget cuts at the federal, state and local levels. In fact, U.S. GDP growth slowed to 1.8% for the first quarter after a 3.1% rise in the fourth quarter.
More specifically, with regard to home improvement spending, the drivers were mixed. Employment and disposable income are slowly improving while housing turnover is restrained and home prices continue to decline. The implications for our business is that customers may feel better about their employment situation but are uneasy due to higher fuel, clothing and food costs as well as geopolitical issues around the world. In addition, decreasing home prices and low housing turnover mean consumers remain cautious when it comes to big-ticket discretionary spending on their homes.
According to our first quarter consumer survey, rising gas and energy prices are cited by homeowners as the top factor affecting future spending plans, followed by the state of the overall economy and inflation in general. While housing values remain a concern, we did see positive trends in home improvement affinity and project plans in our survey, which may suggest that homeowners are beginning to look for ways to enhance their homes. 
That said, our survey indicates that 84% of planned spending in the next 6 months will be small-ticket, less than $500, and 43% of that planned spending will be discretionary.
As we shared with you previously, our business has historically been 60% maintenance and 40% discretionary. But during the downturn, that mix shifted closer to 70% maintenance and 30% discretionary. 
As consumers have focused increasingly on maintenance projects, and as the cost of fuel has increased, convenience of store location is playing a growing role in consumer's choice of where to shop. Differentiation is key to combating this convenience factor in addition to our targeted store expansion strategy. These 2 factors, convenience and differentiation, as well as the opportunity to close more sales are driving our transformation from a home improvement retailer to a home improvement company.
As we discussed at our analyst conference in November, we are working diligently on our commitment to deliver better customer experiences while pulling together the best combination of possibilities, support and value for customers wherever and whenever they choose to engage, and we're building momentum behind this transformation in 2011. 
Research assumed that there are 7 stages in home improvement spending: inspiration, planning, getting supplies, getting started, making progress, finishing and enjoyment. Each stage differs in length based on the type of project the customer's undertaking, and the level of emotional engagement is generally higher in the beginning and ending stages than it is in the middle. 
Traditionally, our industry is focused on getting supplies where emotional engagement is relatively low. Our focus for the future is on all 7 stages as we strive to provide customer with a better and differentiated experience. As I said, we're building momentum behind our transformation, so let me give you some examples. 
During the quarter, our store employees began using a business community portal that puts them in touch with fellow employees throughout our chain. Through this portal, they are able to communicate with one another and offer solutions to the questions they encounter every day. We also launched a tool on lowes.com that gives customers the ability to ask product-specific questions and receive answers from a variety of sources, including Lowe's employees, other customers and product vendors. With these systems, our employees can provide more in-depth advice in-store or wherever customers choose plus allowing customers to more easily complete their projects. 
A little over a year ago, we completed our lowes.com platform redesign, and since that time, we've been making incremental improvements, fueling a 19% increase in traffic year-over-year and a 78% increase in online conversion rates. We also saw a substantial increase in customer satisfaction according to third-party data.
We have over 170,000 items available online with significant expansions planned for the remainder of the year. And also, we plan to launch the Spanish version of lowes.com this summer in an effort to better resonate with this very important demographic. We will also deliver further improvements in our multi-channeled presence this summer as we launch our first mobile app as well as foundational capabilities to support My Lowe's, our customer-focused portal that will allow customers to more efficiently manage projects and improve their homes.
Finally, we will roll out to repair services content -- concept to outdoor power equipment, or OPE, in the second quarter. Having after-sales service for this product category is expected to increase our share position while positively affecting customer satisfaction, resulting in incremental repeat customer visits and allowing us to minimize cost savings through lower OPE return rates. This initiative will also increase our ability to identify product quality concerns that we can work with our vendors to resolve. 
This transformation is about living up to our vision to provide the customer value solutions necessary to become the first choice in home improvement. It's about bringing Lowe's to the consumer on their terms regardless of the physical store presence and making the experience relevant and personal. Make no mistake, this effort is as much about maintenance items and small projects as it is larger-ticket, discretionary projects.
In the second quarter, we expect to take advantage of the late seasonal opportunities as weather patterns improve and consumers are finally able to move outdoors and tackle traditional projects as well as repair damage caused by the harsh weather. We continue to expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, given the challenging comparisons in the first half of last year as a result of government stimulus programs. However, stabilization of home prices and solid progress working through the inventory of distressed housing will be key milestones for recovery. 
Thanks again for your interest, and now I'll turn it over to Rick Damron to provide more details on the quarter. Rick?"
180871,132128456,129222,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 16, 2011",2011-05-16,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Robert, and good morning. I will review our first quarter performance, discuss the new programs under way to drive sales, then update you on ways we continue to learn and improve. As Robert mentioned, we finished the first quarter with negative",1841,"Thanks, Robert, and good morning. I will review our first quarter performance, discuss the new programs under way to drive sales, then update you on ways we continue to learn and improve. 
As Robert mentioned, we finished the first quarter with negative 3.3% comps. Performance exceeded the company average in the Southeast, South Central and desert Southwest regions of the country, where temperatures and rainfall were close to normal. On the other hand, performance lagged the company average by over 200 basis points in the Northeast and North Central regions of the country, where colder and winter conditions prevailed. 
Looking at a detailed analysis of our indoor and outdoor performance, specifically characterized by hundreds of product groups as indoor or outdoor, comp store performance of our outdoor categories were essentially flat, while our outdoor categories declined 9% for the quarter and 21% over the last 5 weeks of the quarter. Some categories actually benefited from wet weather. For instance, rough plumbing performance benefited from strong sales of pumps and tanks and air filters. 
There were some additional factors affecting category performance in the quarter. On the positive side, cabinets and countertops performed well, driven by strong performance of our special-order kitchen cabinets. Inflation drove high single-digit comps in rough electrical and helped paint to comp positively, overcoming slow sales of exterior stains, sealers and applicators. 
On the negative side, Millwork was impacted by the pull-forward of sales into 2010 from expiring energy tax credits. Further, as expected, appliances were unable to overcome a very difficult comparison to the last year's Cash for Appliances program but achieved a 2-year comp of roughly 9%. 
Installed sales generated low-single-digit comps driven by strong promotions in special-order kitchen cabinets, improve special-order lead times in appliances and customers' continued enthusiastic response to STAINMASTER Carpet.
Not surprisingly, our comp store performance was driven by April transactions, not ticket. Comparable store average ticket was essentially flat and was flat to positive in 12 of 21 domestic regions even though we were comping against the favorable impact to ticket of last year's Cash for Appliances program. 
On the other hand, comp transactions decreased 3.4% year-over-year, increasing in February, declining low single-digit in March and declining high single-digit in April. The weakest April transaction comps occurred within the Northeast and North Central areas of the country. 
Our ending first quarter inventory is 2.4% lower than first quarter of 2010, which, as a reminder, ended 9.8% higher than the first quarter of 2009. Last year, we attributed our higher inventory to optimistic purchases of appliances and flooring. So if our inventory is lower than last year, we had the right inventory to meet customer demand in the second quarter.  Further, even though our first quarter sales of seasonal products struggled, we have confidence in our ability to sell through these inventories in the second quarter and avoid significant markdowns. 
As expected, with negative comp performance, our expenses deleveraged. Bob will share more details regarding our overall expense performance, but I'd like to point that we're able to partially offset other expense deleverage through operating salaries leverage while maintaining our strong customer service scores.  Although we hired aggressively for our weekend teams, we adjusted hiring of seasonal and temporary employees to forecasted sales trends. 
Now I'd like to discuss a few programs we undertook during the first quarter to close more sales and build ticket. As mentioned on last quarter's call, we streamlined the store management structure and implemented weekend teams to provide more customer-facing hours on the weekends. And we adjusted our media mix to obtain better efficiency from each advertising dollar. So I'd like to share with you some more details about these programs. 
First, we are pleased with the initial results of our weekend teams, who provide additional customer-facing hours from Friday through Sunday. We have filled more than 90% of our weekend positions. Unlike our seasonal hires, our weekend teams will remain in place throughout the year. These teams have increased our weekend-to-date total selling hours by 150 basis points. 
One indication of the effectiveness of this program is that our first quarter growth of comparable store sales and transactions on weekends were over 140 basis points higher than for weekdays.  Additionally, we have received positive feedback from our stores that the weekend teams are enhancing the customer experience and providing the staffing flexibility needed to support weekend traffic and sales. 
Next we realigned our media spend, placing more emphasis in online media, the same media that more of our customers are moving to. Online media is also much more efficient as we can dramatically increase our media impressions per dollar versus print. Additionally, we shifted away from local to national radio, where, once again, we can gain more impressions per dollar spent. 
We also rolled out 3 programs that were not discussed on our fourth quarter call. First, we entered into a Gift Card Mall program with Blackhawk. Blackhawk manages over 85% of the Gift Card Mall distribution in the U.S., and we now have our cards available for purchase in grocery stores and other high-volume retail channels, which will significantly increase our total gift card sales. In addition, Gift Card Malls will be in all of our stores beginning late in the second half of the year. 
Second, we introduced a tax refund card at the beginning of the first quarter. This promotion coincided with the timing of many customers' tax refunds, as cards were purchased from February 8 through March 14. On March 18, 10% of the original purchase amount was added to the card. We wanted to give customers another reason to make their initial purchases at Lowe's and then return for additional purchases. Customers and stores responded positively to these cards. However, we found that many of the cards were used on purchases that customers had already planned to make at Lowe's, so the incremental sales from this program were not as significant as we had planned. 
Third, we launched a program at the end of April that provides Lowe's consumer credit cardholders with 5% off every day. For purchases above $299, we continue to offer cardholders the option of no interest financing instead of the 5% discount. You might wonder why we did this. 
Over the past year, we have experienced declines in our proprietary credit penetration, the result of regulatory changes that preclude companies from offering no-payment promotions. Those regulatory changes dramatically reduced the value proposition of our proprietary card. Since our proprietary credit programs provide a lower cost of tender, we evaluated a number of options to drive customers back to this program.  We had used credit promotions ranging from our everyday 6-month 0% interest offer to periodic use of 12-month and 18-month 0% interest offers for key promotional periods. 
And last fall, given consumer's increasing focus on maintenance projects, we tested percent-off programs to determine whether we could drive greater proportion of smaller-ticket purchases. After evaluating our test, we concluded that a combination offer would enhance the card's value to customers by giving them another choice to make their purchases even more affordable every day.
Now I'd like to discuss with you a few ways in which our organization continues to learn and improve. We have previously discussed our efforts to go local with our pricing using Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion and in market assorting, using Integrated Planning and Execution, or IP&E. We have fully implemented Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion; and IP&E is being rolled out across all of our merchandise categories this year, with the benefits coming in 2012 and beyond. 
But there is another near-term effort to go local. I believe we have an opportunity to unleash more the creativity and market-specific knowledge of our store personnel.  During our rapid growth over the past decade, we needed more of a command-and-control approach to ensure our new stores represented the Lowe's brand. As our growth has slowed, the tenure of our store managers and associates has increased, giving them greater experience and knowledge to make their stores better to serve their specific markets. 
We will always have a centralized approach to ensuring consistent standards for merchandising, store environment and customer service. But I know we can maintain our high standards while also giving more latitude to our store teams to creatively address local market needs. I call this flexibility within the framework. 
Since assuming my role, I often blog within our business portal community, which is accessible for the entire Lowe's organization. I encourage our store employees to share examples of what they have done within their own stores to better serve customers and to drive sales.  
For instance, we recently introduced a new paint tray coated with Teflon. While priced higher than a traditional tray, it makes clean-up easier and is more likely to be reused, which ultimately is a better value for the customer and more environmentally friendly. But despite strong messaging on the package, customers were not able to see the value until one associate put a simple idea into action. Take one tray, pour paint in it, let it dry and leave it for customers to see how easy it is to pull the paint right out the tray without washing or scrubbing. This simple display worked so well that the employees shared the idea on our business community portal. This display is now being used across most of the company, and sales of these trays have improved. 
Likewise, on a larger scale, we continue to measure and improve our merchandising programs and find ways to better serve customers. One great example is our tools category. We took a category that was losing share and had lower comps and overhauled the offering by introducing a channel exclusive in PORTER-CABLE handheld power tools. We also expanded our offering of DEWALT and now offer the largest assortment in our channel. We rationalized our offering at each price point, adjusting our assortments based on significant differences in market preferences, and we offered more innovative products. Our tools category has gained unit and dollar share, and we continue to drive more sales, which has led to positive low-single-digit comps for the first quarter. 
We have also improved the performance of ceramic tile flooring by increasing our offering in the warmer southern states, expanding DEWALT tile assortments, bringing the samples to the floor and making take with inventory for high-volume items more readily available for purchase. Then to improve service and attachment rates, we moved grouts, mortars and sealers closer to the tile, so customers can easily access everything needed for the job. And, like tools, ceramic tile produced low-single-digit comps in the first quarter. 
We continue to learn and improve across all facets of our day-to-day operations, and we will continue to add company-wide tools and new processes to fulfill our promise to provide better customer experiences. 
Thanks for your interest in Lowe's. And I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our first quarter financial results. Bob?"

Sales for the first quarter were $12.2 billion, which represents a 1.6% decrease from last year's first quarter. In Q1, total customer transactions decreased 2.1% while average ticket increased 0.5% to $62.51. Com",1600,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $12.2 billion, which represents a 1.6% decrease from last year's first quarter. In Q1, total customer transactions decreased 2.1% while average ticket increased 0.5% to $62.51. Comp sales were negative 3.3% for the quarter, which is below our guidance of essentially flat. For the quarter, comp transactions decreased 3.4%, and comp average ticket increased 0.1%. 
Looking at monthly credits, comps were positive 2.7% in February, negative 1.9% in March and negative 8.3% in April. The monthly comp trends reflect the difficult comparisons we had versus last year's positive 8.8% April comp, which was driven by both favorable weather and government stimulus. 
Q1 was our most difficult comparison to last year due to the impact of Cash for Appliances. In Q1 2010, Cash for Appliances aided comps by 65 basis points. We knew this going into the quarter and felt that we had a reasonable plan in place. In fact, we were ahead of our sales plan through our fiscal week 8. Then, as Rick described, unseasonable weather over the last 5 weeks of the quarter had a significant impact on our exterior categories, which represent about 40% of our sales for that 5-week period and was the primary driver of our below-plan sales for the quarter. 
With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the first quarter include rough electrical, rough plumbing, cabinets and countertops, tools, lighting, paint, flooring, home fashion, storage and cleaning, hardware and fashion plumbing. Seasonal living performed at approximately the overall corporate average. 
Gross margin for the quarter -- for the first quarter was 35.44% of sales and increased 26 basis points over last year's first quarter. The increase was driven by 34 basis points of margin rate improvement, with Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion accounting for approximately 25 basis points of the margin rate improvement. 
Additionally, gross margin benefited 28 basis points from the mix of items sold, the result of strong sales in rough plumbing as well as lower sales in outdoor power equipment and appliances. These improvements were partially offset by deleverage and distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased fuel costs and higher inventory shrink. 
SG&A for Q1 was 25.6% of sales, which deleveraged 62 basis points. The largest driver of the SG&A deleverage was insurance, both casualty and employee, was deleveraged 32 basis points. The increase in casualty was weighted to a favorable actuarial adjustment in last year's first quarter. The deleverage in employee insurance led to increased claim costs and higher dependent enrollment. 
We also experienced approximately 15 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences, expenses related to staffing up our contact center to support the insourcing of appliance repairs last year and contract labor for additional lowes.com capabilities, advancing the My Lowe's concept and continued efforts to build out our customer relationship platform.  In addition, advertising expense deleveraged approximately 10 basis points, largely due to the timing of spend versus last year. 
Lastly, while only about 5 basis points each, deleverage for the following items is worth noting: delivery due to higher fuel costs; payroll taxes related to higher state unemployment tax rates; bankcard due to higher interchange rates; and proprietary credit associated with lower sales as a result of a lower receivable related to the provision against no-payment promotions.  Somewhat offsetting these items was leverage and bonus expense. We fell short of our sales and earnings plan for the quarter, and as a result, we reduced our expected bonus payout amounts accordingly. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $371 million, which was 3.05% of sales and leveraged 15 basis points compared to last year's first quarter due to slower square-footage growth and assets becoming fully depreciated.  Earnings before interest and taxes decreased 21 basis points to 6.79% of sales. Interest expense at $88 million for the quarter deleveraged 6 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.  For the quarter, total expenses were 29.3% of sales and deleveraged 53 basis points. 
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 6.07% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 37.8% for Q1 last year. Earnings per share of $0.34 for the quarter were at the bottom end of our guidance of $0.34 to $0.38 and were flat to last year's $0.34. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $1.5 billion. Our first quarter inventory balance of $9.7 billion decreased $238 million, or 2.4%, from Q1 last year. The decrease was due to a 5.6% decrease in comp store inventory, offset by square-footage growth of 1.6% and a slight increase in distribution inventory. 
Inventory turnover, calculated by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last 5 quarters, was 3.5%, a decrease of 6 basis points from Q1 2010. Return on assets, determined using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters, increased 44 basis points to 5.63%. 
Moving to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $6.7 billion represents a 5% decrease from Q1 last year. The decrease in accounts payable is higher than our 2.4% decrease in inventory, which relates to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year.  Our debt to equity ratio was 37.7% compared to 31.9% for Q1 last year. 
At the end of the first quarter, we suggested debt to EBITDAR was 1.72, which is higher than our target of 1.8x. Return on invested capital measured using a trailing 4 quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last 5 quarters increased 75 basis points for the quarter to 8.91%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion, which is $313 million lower than Q1 2010 due to the timing of income tax payments versus last year and the decrease in accounts payable related to the timing of purchases. Cash used and profit acquired was $313 million, up $30 million over last year due to an increase in information technology spending on lowes.com, store infrastructure and the ongoing buildout of our customer relationship platform.  As a result, first quarter free cash flow of $2.1 billion was down 14% versus last year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 37.9 million shares at an average price of $26.42 for a total repurchased amount of $1 billion. We have $1.4 billion remaining share repurchase authorization. The remaining $31 million of the $1.013 billion of share repurchase -- of repurchase of common stock shown in the statement of cash flows relates to shares repurchased from employees to satisfy either the exercised price of stock options or the statutory withholding tax liability upon investing our restricted stock forwards. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. We expect second quarter total sales to increase approximately 4%, which will incorporate some comp sales increase of approximately 2% and square footage growth of approximately 1.5%. 
As we noted, our Q1 sales shortfall was driven by poor seasonal sales as a result of weather. In the second quarter, as the weather has improved, so have our sales.  In fact, sales trends for the beginning of May are much better than April, which gives us confidence in our Q2 sales outlook. 
Depreciation for Q2 is expected to be approximately $370 million and leverage about 30 basis points to last year's second quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes for the second quarter are expected to increase 20 to 30 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. 
For the quarter, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.6% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.69, which represents an increase of 12% to 19% over last year's $0.58. 
In 2011, we expect to open approximately 25 stores, resulting in an increase in square footage of approximately 1.3%.  We're estimating 2011 comp sales to be flat to positive 1%, and including the 53rd week, a total sales increase of approximately 4%. 
For the fiscal year, we're anticipating EBIT to increase by approximately 10 basis points. For 2011, depreciation expense is expected to be $1.47 billion, and interest expense is expected to be approximately $350 million.  For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.6%. Some of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.56 to $1.64, which represents an increase of 10% to 15% over 2010. 
We have tempered our outlook for the second half and for the year due to the uncertainty the impact of gas prices and overall inflation will have on consumer spending. In addition, the correction in housing continues to play up, and there is the potential that home price declines extend into 2012.
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.6 billion. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecasted to be approximately $1.8 billion with roughly $100 million funded by operating leases, resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow of $2.9 billion for the year. 
Our guidance assumes approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases for 2011. We repurchased $1 billion in Q1, with a remaining $1.4 billion expected to be spread evenly across the next 3 quarters. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

In fact, we're performing much -- we're performing better than we did in first quarter, and we are confident in our Q2 outlook. We did miss some seasonal sales in Q1. We expect to recover some of those in Q2, which leads to our 2% comp outlook for the second quarter. As it relates to margin, we are expecting some nominal margin decline in the back half of the year. Some of that comes from fuel costs. Fuel was up early in the year, still is up relative to last year. We'll see that as it sells through cost of goods negatively impacting gross margin Q2 and into the back half of the year. In addition, our shrink rate was up slightly, by 10 basis points.

As it relates to the second part of your question regarding shrink, we really don't have any concerns as it relates to inventory shrink. Our shrink is -- was at historically low levels in 2010.

So we don't really think there were any declines in market share. And as you are aware, TraQline only relates to retail sales. It does not impact or does not track commercial sales. But we think the biggest impact is, as Bob and Rick described, during the quarter, was primarily weather-related conditions. And then secondly, we are starting to see in our consumer survey that consumers are mentioning the impact of fuel prices starting to impact their purchase decisions. And when we think about discretionary income and the fact that when fuel prices go up, it does limit their ability to spend on discretionary basis, part of that is what we've taken into account as we've looked at over the balance of the year. And I think Bob also alluded in his comments that as we look over the balance of the year with what's going on with housing, with fuel prices, those types of things, you're starting to hear some of the economists talk about potentially the bottoming in home prices extending beyond the second half of the year and, potentially, into the first half of 2012. So overall, from a market-share standpoint, we think we're executing well and continue to maintain and gain share in a lot of categories.

As I said in my comments, I think, until like week 8, we were running with -- in line -- ahead of our plan. Bob took you through the comp trends for the month, and we've actually seen for the first 2 weeks of May, we've seen seasonal categories bounce back very strong, where we've had -- which were where the biggest shortfall was. In Q1 seasonal categories bounced back very strong as weather improved in May. This weekend was a little bit of a challenge, when you look at the weather across the country. But we see the weather improve, not only just the fact of improved weather, but also the opportunity to pick up some of those sales that were delayed from the first quarter into the second quarter. It feels it leads us to being comfortable with the guidance that we've provided today. And we think we've been sufficiently conservative in that guidance to take into account the impact of fuel prices and everything else that is impacting the customers' mindset today, so -- and we've put a lot of rigor into coming up with the outlook and believe that it's achievable based on what we see out there and what we've seen quarter-to-date in the performance as we, particularly, if we look at where that performance is coming from."

I think, we've seen -- some economists say we've already seen the double-dip in home prices, and so you have economists today who were forecasting home prices to begin stabilization in the fourth quarter of 2011 now beginning to stretch that stabilization period into 2012. The risk that we're trying to monitor is really the impact of foreclosure sales in the marketplace today and how that's impacting market by market the stabilization of home values. So we're definitely being conservative when we try to understand what will happen to home prices on a regional and a market basis across all the areas that we operate in. But there are some mitigating factors out there. Robert touched on it earlier. There's -- all of our affinity scores, when we do our own customer sentiment research, are coming in as significantly higher than we've seen over the past couple of years. And these are affinity statements such as ""I enjoy conducting home improvement projects."" ""I'm willing to spend more and invest in home improvement time and money."" We're seeing some pretty interesting, strong upsurges in all of the affinity areas. So if you look at -- if you break apart your University of Michigan consumer sentiment research that Rick just released, the difference between current situation and expectations is beginning to create 2 different -- an interesting vector. And I think that's what we're trying to understand is the consumer seems poised, given certain macro-economic factors to be able to invest time and money into home improvement as we move into the second half of the year and into the beginning of 2012. Obviously, the #1 thing on their mind, and we're hearing this from both outside research and from our own consumer sentiment surveying, is gas prices. It can affect as much as 2/3 of homeowners in terms of their willingness to spend, and that's where they're going to be watching their budget. The other factor, of course, is the factor of is my home value increasing or decreasing?  Is my local housing situation improving or not improving?  And we're seeing pretty strong sentiment today on current situation that most people feel their home values and their local market are not improving. So those are the 2 watch outs, but we're also keeping an eye on the fact that from a standpoint of affinity with home improvement, we're seeing scores we haven't seen in years."

Following my remarks, Bob will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results. But first, let me share a summary of our second quarter performance, as well as how we're thinking about our near-term and long-term opportunities. 
Despite some recovery from the first quarter in our seasonal business, our performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations. Sales for the quarter increased 1.3% while comparable store sales were essentially flat to last year. Comp traffic increased 0.6% in the second quarter and comp average ticket declined 0.9%. Bob Gfeller will provide more details regarding our comp performance in a few minutes. 
Gross margin contracted 37 basis in the quarter. Our 5% everyday offer for Lowe's consumer credit cardholders impacted gross margin by 11 basis points. However, the gross margin impact of this offer was more than offset by leverage in tender and other cost associated with our proprietary credit program, which are components of SG&A. Bob Hull will provide more detail regarding gross margin in a few minutes. 
We had good operating expense control in the quarter. However, as detailed in today's release, we recognized the charge associated with impairment of long-lived assets, including 7 stores that closed on August 14, which reduced pretax earnings for the quarter by $83 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.04. We generated substantial operating cash flow during the quarter, which allowed us to repurchase 59.7 million shares or $1.4 billion, exhausting our share repurchase authorization. Including the impairment charge, we delivered earnings per share of $0.64 in the second quarter.
Our second quarter consumer survey indicates that high fuel prices remain at the top of consumers' minds as they consider future spending plans. However, recent headlines regarding slowing growth and the U.S. credit rating downgrade underscored the continued weakness in the U.S. economy. The volume of negative news and the unsettling impact on equity markets is having a significant effect on already fragile consumer mindset. 
More specifically with regard to home improvement spending, consumers continue to focus on small ticket, less than $500 repair and maintenance items and projects. Even after taking into account the challenge of the macro environment, we're still not pleased with our performance this year. For both do it yourself and Commercial business customers, we must drive more trips, close more sales and build bigger baskets. So what are we doing about it? 
Earlier this year, our restructured executive team and together, we are looking at our business with a fresh perspective. We have critically evaluated our performance over the past several quarters and have identified some gaps. The gaps are in addition to convenience of store location, which we discussed in our first quarter earnings call. We have plans in place to address the gaps we've identified, but we also know that there is no silver bullet, and it's going to take time to see the full benefit of these changes. Bob Gfeller will discuss several of our near-term plans to compete more effectively in the current environment. He will also outline ways in which we will go-to-market differently beginning in the second half of this year.
We also remain focused on cost-efficient and effective operations. The management team is reviewing how we operate on a cross-functional basis to ensure consistent and connected execution, while also evaluating our organizational structure to streamline decision-making and ensuring that we have the right people in the right roles throughout the organization. We're making tough decisions in order to improve profitability, and I'm confident that the team is focused on the right areas and making the necessary decisions within the parameters of our longer-term strategy. 
Today's announcement regarding the closing of 7 stores is an example. Closing underperforming stores is always a tough decision, given the impact on hard-working employees and the local communities. But it was a fiscally responsible decision to further strengthen our financial position and drive shareholder value. Those are some of the near-term opportunities we're addressing. We previously shared with you our longer-term commitment to deliver better customer experiences while pulling together the best combination of possibility, support and value whenever and wherever customers choose to engage. We continue to differentiate Lowe's from the competition, and we're building momentum behind our transformation in 2011. 
Let me share some of the progress we've made this quarter. We completed the rollout of a repair services concepts. We now manage and repair experience for outdoor power equipment, as well as appliances. Our contact center is taking the calls, diagnosing the problems and facilitating the resolutions making after-sales service simpler for customers because they're dealing directly with us rather than the manufacturer. We tested this model in more than 100 stores and found that managing the experience ourselves positively affected customer satisfaction both incremental store visits. In addition, we expect to realize cost savings through lower product return rates and the identification of quality concerns that we'll work with our vendors to resolve. 
We continue to be excited about the performance of lowes.com. In fact, we experienced a 130 basis points increase in online unit share on a rolling 4 quarters basis. We've also generated significant amount of interest with our social media campaigns. According to third-party data, we've ranked fourth among the top 25 brands and have the most online buzz and positive sentiment. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had over 190,000 items available online, a 73% increase since the fall of 2010 with significant expansion plans for the remainder of the year. We've also recently begun shipping items to customers from search stores and regional distribution centers in addition to our dedicated Internet warehouse. This means with more arms available for parcel shipment than ever before, we can provide faster delivery and reduce our cost to fulfill orders. We're also offering for the first time preprinted labels for parcel return free of charge, a simple and convenient option for customers and a competitive advantage in home improvement industry, and there's more. 
We are launching the Spanish version of www.lowes.com this week in an effort to better resonate with this very important demographic. This launch is a full translation of our lowes.com site, including commerce. You also see our first Mobile App! in market in the coming weeks. Additionally, we will build on the fundamental capabilities that will deliver on lowes.com this quarter such as the ability to create lists and reminders as we develop My Lowe's, a set of capabilities that will revolutionize how customers interact with us to more efficiently manage projects and improve their homes. My Lowe's will launch near the end of fiscal 2011.
And finally, we are pleased to announce that we have begun deployment of approximately 42,000 handheld devices to our stores in the U.S. and Canada. We expect this rollout to be complete by the end of the fiscal year. Our goal is to make home improvement simple for customers and for our employees. Leveraging Apple's iPhone technology, our employees will check inventory availability, access how-to videos and utilize lowes.com from the aisles of the store. This is a significant step towards simplicity and seamlessness and will continue to add functionality to these devices over time.
The progress that I've outlined is building momentum behind our brand differentiation and will ultimately drive market share gains. In the interim, we are working diligently to improve sales and profitability in a way that will generate sustained customer preference and shareholder value. 
Before I turn over to Bob Gfeller to provide more details on the quarter and our near-term opportunities, I would like to thank our hardworking employees for their ongoing dedication and customer focus. Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that our Sanford, North Carolina store, which was destroyed by a tornado on April 16, will reopen to continue serving the Sanford community on Thursday, September 8. 
Thanks again for your interest. I'll now turn over to Bob."

During my time today, I will review our second quarter performance as well as describe how we are working to win the customers' heart and mind, drive sales, grow market share then I will move on to explain our merchandising direction for the next few years and how we are working across all functions to accelerate sales and differentiate our brand. 
We finished the second quarter with negative 0.3% comps. Our performance was driven by some rebound in the first quarter in nursery and lawn and landscape products, offset by tough appliance comparisons resulting from last year's Cash for Appliances stimulus program. Geographically, performance exceeded the company average in the North central and Northeast regions of the country as we energetically serve customers who have been waiting to start spring and summer projects and who needed to make repairs after a tough winter of snow and ice storms. 
Comp performance in the Gulf Coast region was significantly lower than the company average as extreme heat and severe drought dampened sales of outdoor products, most notably outdoor power equipment, nursery and lawn and landscape. We observed large regional swings in these categories but most significantly in outdoor power equipment where double-digit comps in the Northeast and high single-digit comps in the North Central offset by negative double-digit comps in the Southeast and South Central. 
In the second quarter, our outdoor categories reported roughly a positive 3% comp, and our indoor categories reported roughly a negative 2% comp. We reported strong nursery and lawn and landscape sales in the Northeast, North Central and West while building materials performed well in the Southeast, South Central and North Central regions of the country as our teams sold grouping materials and installation services to customers in the aftermath of the strong storms that hit those regions in the late spring.
Looking at indoor categories. Tools comp in the mid-single digits, driven by new Father's Day offers and the launch of our new and improved cobalt mechanics tools. The new program has premium specifications for torque, peak count, metal hardness and ergonomics as good as any other leading brand. And we have more than twice the SKUs of our prior program with a wide variety of single-socket sizes, which is what the Commercial customer demands. The new line was launched as part of our second quarter Father's Day gift offering, and it sold very well. The Lowe's tool business has now comped positively for first 6 consecutive quarters. This momentum is reflected in our 60 basis points of unit share gains on a rolling 4-quarter basis. 
Paint, the #1 home improvement project, continues to comp positively both indoors and outdoors. Our Valspar interior high def launch last year, along with the launches of our allen+roth paint palette, cobalt express deck and Valspar high def exterior paint earlier this year are driving this performance. We expect the recent launches of Olympic 1 and Valspar Plus, which is asthma and allergy certified by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation to drive continued positive paint comps into the second half of 2011. 
In addition, the paint desk area was reset in the first half to ensure customers have all products they need to complete their paint projects, organizing the way that is intuitive to them repair, prepare and paint. And this month, we introduced our first to market buy paint online and pickup in store with our exclusive 20-minute pickup guarantee. So you can see that we are taking our paint business to new levels increasing our share of the #1 home improvement project. 
Appliances reported negative mid-single digit comps as we cycled another strong quarter of the Cash for Appliances stimulus program. The good news is we have continued to gain appliance market share despite the negative comps. We are further encouraged by having just recently been named by J.D. Power as the highest-ranking major appliance retailer in customer satisfaction. This is the second year in a row and the third out of the last 4 years that we received this distinction. The basis for this ranking is a weighted average of performance across all aspects of the total appliance experience: sales staff, service, store facility, merchandise selection and availability, price, delivery services and installation. 
Appliances is our #1 category sold online, and we have new tools in place to help customers and employees research, compare and price appliances to make their shopping experience faster and simpler. The online appliance selector helps customers choose the right appliances for their needs conveniently from their own personal computer. And the lowes.com product ratings and reviews provide consumers with realtime, unbiased and unfiltered customer feedback on products already bought and in use. 
Another category with opportunity for improvement is flooring, which recorded low single-digit negative comps in the second quarter. It is a large ticket category that generally follows other projects like painting when a customer is updating a room. Today, we need to provide strong value to entice consumers with limited discretionary income to plan and complete a major flooring project. And we have some changes underway that should bear fruit in second half of this year. 
Within laminate and wood, we have completed a chain-wide reset. We now have enough SKU breadth to compete with all types of flooring store competition, and pricing has gotten sharper with opening price points on laminate flooring now under $1 per square foot. Carpet continues to perform well, and we are excited about the ways we continue to drive value in this category. Over the next few months, we will roll out a compelling opening price point program and introduce 2 new products with great wear and stain resistant qualities. 
In ceramic tile, we are resetting 25% of every ceramic floor tile set replacing over 100 SKUs. Additionally, with wall tiles sales gaining strength, this month we have added 50 new SKUs across many stores. Why? Customers want more variety in color, style and size of tile as they freshen the look of their homes by completing bath makeovers and small tile accent projects in kitchens. 
Now turning to inventory. We ended the quarter with roughly 2% more inventory than last year. We are comfortable with our inventory levels of grills, patio furniture and room air conditioners as we do not expect significant third quarter markdown pressure in connection with second quarter inventory levels.
That completes my review of second quarter performance and some category specific efforts to drive sales in the back half of 2011. Now I would like to more broadly discuss new directions for Lowe's merchandising.
As merchandising looks to attract customers to drive sales and margin dollar growth, we believe that we must present value to the customer every day, and we must differentiate ourselves by providing simple, fresh and innovative ideas and solutions. For the customer, value is price plus something more. It is that simple. So I want to take a moment to discuss how we are reinvigorating our efforts to enhance our price image in the eye of the consumer and to provide the extra something that distinguishes us from our competitors. 
High low pricing has become more influential in our sector as we and other retailers have responded through a shrinking market. As a result, customers have learned to wait on the next big deal because they know that if they wait long enough, they can get a lower price than the Every Day Low Price. So our sector has come to rely in recent years on creating compelling promotions. However, we must be vigilant to ensure that our customers perceive us to be priced competitively every day even against online retailers and smaller category killers. 
So job #1 in this economic environment is ensuring our pricing compares well on those high velocity items that are easiest to compare to other retailers. We call these high velocity and highly comparable items benchmark items. To do this, we are expanding our list of benchmark items to sharpen our everyday pricing on the most visible items, and we are starting to lessen the frequency of special advertised promotions. There may be some categories or seasons of the year, which will be more promotional than others, but we need to convince customers, both through our pricing and our messaging, that they can expect a competitive price every time they shop on lowes.com or in our stores. This effort is being made with speed and with caution and an eye to margin impact. We expect to lag between our actions and customer response as we know that it takes time and marketing investment for the customer to recognize and respond to price changes. 
Our Lowe's everyday value proposition reinforces our Every Day Low Price program with customers. As a reminder, this program provides Lowe's consumer credit card holders with 5% off everyday. For purchases above $299, we continue to offer cardholders their choice of no interest financing or the 5% off value. This program aims to provide a clear statement of value to Lowe's customers every day. It encourages them to shop for all of their household needs at Lowe's and rewards their loyalty. So far, customer response has exceeded our expectations and this program is driving increased transactions, gross margin dollars and EBIT margins.
Now to the other elements of the value equation that something that when added to Every Day Low Prices truly differentiates us from our competitors. We are focused on 2 key areas that will shout value to the customer. They are product differentiation and solutions-based merchandising. Product differentiation establishes Lowe's as the place to find the newest and most relevant products for home improvement. These products can be national brands or they can be private brands. 
As we look to successfully introduce more new products, we are working closer than ever with our key vendor partners on new product development, new display techniques and technologies. We want to pull innovation forward and make it easy to find in our stores and online creating a wow customer experience. So we are looking to partner with vendors of all sizes who are developing new high-tech products for the home improvement industry, products that further position Lowe's as the customer solutions hub. We are plowing new ground that will reap long-term benefit to our strong brand and customer franchise. 
Solutions-based merchandising redirects our merchants' focus from a product and vendor-centric view to a customer-centric view. This may sound simple, but it requires great team work across functions and products like never before. Our merchants are embracing this idea, the idea that we must assort, assemble and present solutions to the customer because the customer shops by occasion. 
So, for example, when customers want to refresh their bathrooms, they don't think about buying a vanity, a mirror, a new toilet, new faucets and bath hardware in isolation from each other. Instead, they think about how they want the bathroom to look in total, and their bathroom remodel is the occasion. Rather than making customers look for each component on separate aisles, we want to bring together different vignettes that will help them better determine what they want and more easily grab or order the items that they need. 
We have previously taken this approach to some extent, but never across as many occasions and never before pulling the inventories together for the customer in a way that helps them buy all of the various products that they need to complete the total project. Frankly, as big box, we have to get better at the tricks of the trade of great specialty retailer. We have finished experimenting with product differentiation and solutions-based merchandising in test store during the first half of this year and have seen positive customer response. 
We have also areas of these test stores reducing SKUs to create larger spaces to display complete solutions. We expect the results to be even more favorable when we expand this idea further to present solutions-based sets in an open vignette space. Expansion plans for more powerful and drop zones, as we call them, are underway. 
As we increase our focus on product differentiation and solutions-based merchandise, we're going to test and learn much more than in the past. We need to take a lot of to hit a home run. And with such a large store base, we have a great opportunity to cost effectively try many things within just a few stores to see what works and then test the winners more broadly before rolling them out chain-wide. So you will see a more aggressive and proactive testing approach from us in the future. 
I would like to share the results of one such test and have chosen a project that involved all of the merchandising additions to some degree. The goal was to showcase product innovation and value in a way that resonated with the customer. That involved bringing solutions out of the standard racking, presenting them in drop zones and vignettes that made the customer experience more simple and helpful and last, highlighting our great selection of national and private brands. 
As you can imagine, this project required that we reallocate space across the store, removing standard rack in some cases and making room for the new solutions-based presentations. And we developed new signs and messaging to communicate with the consumer. Customer feedback was extremely positive. They said it was easier to find product and solutions in the store, easier to understand product value, that Lowe's is more innovative than before and that they were more motivated to improve their home, and they were more likely to shop at Lowe's in the future.
In order to bring innovation and solutions-based merchandising to life, we are making strong progress in implementing Integrated Planning and Execution or IP&E, which will support our merchants' efforts to go local. IP&E will provide the tools and processes to make our entire organization more efficient and refined in ensuring that the right product is in the right market in the right quantity to best meet customer needs. And it will create institutional memory to maintain local assorting decisions when merchants change. 
Over 80% of the merchandising teams have product line reviews in process with this new set of processes and tools, and they are uncovering significant consumer insights that are driving different product positions. Resets from these line reviews are beginning now and will continue throughout 2012, and we should obtain sales inventory beginning in 2012 and ramping into 2013.
The IP&E process was recently used in a fashion category. The merchandising team combined its science from the IP&E tools with input from talented people from across our company to create a comprehensive view of the customer needs in each store. They use that insight to be customer advocates across all aspects of the product line review for product line design to store experience. And finally, they varied selection for each store, providing more of the finishes, price points and platforms that consumers expect to see in their local markets. The full refresh should be completed in the fall of 2011.
So in summary, we were not satisfied with second quarter performance. But my team has been reshaping the merchandising direction, implementing changes now that should advance us further in our multiyear implementation of our broader strategic vision of a customer-centric, anytime, anywhere and simpler shopping experience. As we enter this on ramp to our future, we will concentrate on delivering better value to customers, price plus something more, and we will work to differentiate our product offering and organize the customers multi-channel shopping experience around solutions. 
We expect to begin realizing the benefit of these initiatives in 2012 as we will balance a desire for speed to market with the prudent test to learn approach I discussed earlier. But we will stay focused on making the changes necessary to generate sustained customer preference and shareholder value. 
Thanks for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our second quarter financial results. Bob?"
180871,139025984,158278,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2011",2011-08-15,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $14.5 billion, which represents a 1.3% increase over last year's second quarter. In Q2, total customer transactions increased 2% while total average ticket decreased 0.7% to $62.44",1841,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $14.5 billion, which represents a 1.3% increase over last year's second quarter. In Q2, total customer transactions increased 2% while total average ticket decreased 0.7% to $62.44. Comp sales were negative 0.3% for the quarter, which was below our guidance of approximately 2%. The lower-than-expected performance was driven by less recovery than anticipated from Q1 in our seasonal businesses and by higher-than-expected impact from lumber deflation, which hurt second quarter comps by approximately 70 basis points. 
For the quarter, comp average ticket declined 0.9% while comp transactions increased 0.6%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were negative 2.7% in May, flat in June and positive 2.2% in July. The improvement in monthly comps during the quarter was driven by a few factors. First, we experienced a delay in our seasonal business, which improved as the quarter progressed. Second, demands associated with efforts to remedy store damage was moderate in May and strengthened in June and July. Lastly, the toughest Cash for Appliances comparison from Q2 last year was in May. Appliance comps for the quarter, while still negative, improved throughout the quarter. 
With regard to product categories, the product categories that had above average comps in the second quarter include building materials, rough electrical, modern landscape, nursery, tools, rough plumbing, paint, hardware and seasonal living. Year-to-date comp sales were negative 1.7%, and total sales of $46.7 billion were essentially flat to the first half of 2010. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.49% of sales, which decreased 37 basis points from last year's second quarter. In the quarter, promotional activity negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. This promotional activity was initiated by both us and the competition. As you heard from Bob earlier, we are expanding our benchmark list to sharpen our everyday pricing on the most visible items, and we are working to lessen the frequency of special advertising promotions. 
Higher transportation cost, both fuel and ocean freight, negatively impacted gross margin by estimated 15 basis points. In addition, our proprietary credit value proposition, which offers customers the choice of 5% off everyday or promotional financing negatively impacted gross margin by 11 basis points. As Robert noted, this was more than offset by a leverage in tender and other costs associated with our proprietary credit program. 
I will provide the details of SG&A impacts in a moment. Lastly, clearance activity associated with reset hurt gross margin by approximately 10 basis points. Slightly offsetting these items were Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion aided gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.93% of sales, a decrease of 8 basis points from the first half of 2010. SG&A for Q2 was 22.22% of sales, which deleveraged 1 basis point. 
During the quarter, we incurred an $83 million charge related to an evaluation of the carrying value of long life assets, including 7 stores that were closed. This compares to approximately $11 million in Q2 2010, which results in deleverage of 49 basis points. We also experienced approximately 15 basis points of deleveraged related to investments made to improve customer experiences. The expenses related to staffing up our contact center to support the in sourcing of repair services, internal and external resources for additional lowes.com capabilities, advancing the Milos concept and continued efforts to build out our customer relationship platform. 
Store payroll deleveraged 10 basis points due to a slight increase in average hourly rate and new stores. Payroll taxes deleveraged 7 basis points as a result of both higher payroll taxes and higher payroll expenses. Almost completely offsetting these items was leverage in the following areas. We experienced 44 basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program. This leverage was driven by a combination of fewer losses, as well as lower promotional financing as a direct result of customers choosing 5% off everyday versus promotional financing. In addition, tender costs were lower as the mix of proprietary credit increased 240 basis points in the quarter to 21% of sales. Also bonus expense leveraged 35 basis points in the quarter due to lower payment levels relative to plan compared with this time last year.
Year-to-date SG&A of 23.76% of sales, which deleveraged 27 basis points in the first half of 2010. During the first half of 2011, charges associated with asset impairment cost 29 basis points of SG&A deleverage. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $365 million, which was 2.51% of sales and leveraged 26 basis points compared with last year's second quarter. We estimate that our proprietary credit value propositions positively impacted EBIT by 29 basis points for the quarter. However, this was more than offset by the negative 49 basis point impact associated with impairment charges contributing to an EBIT decline of 12 basis points to 9.76% of sales for Q2. 
For the first half, EBIT was 8.41% of sales, which was 14 basis points lower than the same period last year. Interest expense was $90 million for the quarter and deleveraged 3 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, total expenses were 25.35% of sales and leveraged 22 basis points. Year-to-date, total expenses were 27.19% of sales and deleveraged 11 basis points versus last year. 
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 9.14% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% versus 37.7% for Q2 last year. Net earnings were $830 million for the quarter, which was essentially flat to Q2 2010. Earnings per share of $0.64 for the second quarter was below our guidance of $0.65 to $0.69, but please remember that the reported $0.64 includes the $0.04 per share of negative impact associated with impairment charges. Earnings per share increased 10.3% versus last year's $0.58. For the first 6 months of 2011, earnings per share of $0.98 represents a 6.5% increase over the first half of 2010. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $568 million. Our second quarter inventory balance of $8.8 billion increased $172 million or 2% versus Q2 last year. The increase was driven by new stores and an increase in distribution center inventory. 
Inventory turnover catalytic by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last 5 quarters was 3.6%, a decrease of 3 basis points from Q2 2010. Return on assets determined using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters increased 35 basis points to $0.574. 
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $5.4 billion represents a 10% increase from Q2 last year. The higher accounts payable balance relates to the timing of purchases this year relative to last year. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 39.5% compared with 29% for Q2 last year. At the end of the second quarter, we adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was 1.75x. Return on invested capital using a trailing 4 quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last 5 quarters increased 65 basis points to 9.04%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $3.3 billion, an increase of $511 million or 18% over last year largely due to the increase in accounts payable. Cash used for property acquired was $780 million, a 27% increase due to the corporate systems and store infrastructure investments we are making to provide better customer experiences. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow of $2.5 billion is 16% higher than the first half of 2010. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 59.7 million shares at an average price of $23.46 for a total repurchase amount of $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.4 billion and have exhausted our share repurchase authorization. We are continuing to assess market conditions and evaluate options regarding capital structure and future share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. The macro environment has changed dramatically over the past several weeks. We went from worrying about the customer who was stretched by fuel and other inflation to a nation watching the debt ceiling countdown and now to extremely volatile equity markets. 
Given this and the impact on consumer sentiment, we have lowered our sales outlook for the second half of 2011. We are now planning for comparable store sales to be approximately flat to last year for Q3 and Q4. Earnings before interest and taxes and earnings per share estimates have been similarly reduced to reflect the lower expected sales. 
Macro challenges aside, we are not happy with our recent performance and are working to improve sales, profitability and shareholder value. However, as you heard from Robert and Bob, these efforts take time to implement, and meaningful benefits from our actions likely won't be reflected in our financial results until 2012. We expect a third quarter total sales increase by approximately 2% with comp sales estimated to be essentially flat to last year and approximately 1.3% average square footage growth. 
Earnings before interest and taxes for the third quarter are expected to decrease 10 to 20 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. This EBIT outlook includes approximately $30 million or 25 basis points of additional expenses associated with the 7 stores that closed yesterday. 
For the quarter, interest expense was expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate was forecasted to be 37.7% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.33, including the additional expenses associated with store closings. For 2011, we are estimating comp sales to decline by approximately 1%. For the year, we expect to open approximately 25 stores, close 7, resulting in a net addition of 18 stores for an increase in average square footage of approximately 1.3%. With the estimated 1.4% impact of the 53rd week, total sales are expected to increase approximately 2%. 
For the year, we are anticipating EBIT to decrease approximately 30 basis points. This includes approximately $115 million or 25 basis points associated with asset impairment and store closing expenses. For 2011, interest expense is expected to be approximately $360 million. For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 36%. The sum of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.54, which includes approximately $0.06 per share in impairment and store closing charges. 
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.1 billion. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecasted to be approximately $2.1 billion with roughly $100 million by operating leases resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow of $2.1 billion for the year. Our guidance for 2011 includes share repurchases activity through Q2, which does not include any impact from future share repurchases.

With regard to the number of benchmark items, that's something that we don't disclose. I think the important point there is that we're expanding the number of benchmark items from where we have in the past. Several things we've done is we've kind of take this movement back to EDLP. As you know, going through the financial downturn that took place over the past several years, housing economic downturn, it naturally led to a more promotional environment. As we transition out of that, we do think that the customers are telling us that they're looking for great value everyday. So whether it's expanding the list of benchmark items to better send the message to them on an ongoing basis they can find great value everyday what we did with our 5% off value prop that we did on Lowe's credit card, the return back to EDLP and the work that Bob and his team were doing to work with our vendors and say, we won't take every thing we can out of cost so we can provide the EDLP benefit to the customer and protect margin everyday. Those are the type of things that will work. And so I think the important takeaway is not how many is on the benchmark list, but the fact that we're expanding it to really to drive that price perception with the consumer everyday."

Following my remarks, Bob Gfeller will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results. But first, let me share a summary of our second quarter performance, as well as how we're thinking about our near-term and long-term opportunities. 
Despite some recovery from the first quarter in our seasonal business, our performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations. Sales for the quarter increased 1.3%, while comparable store sales were essentially flat to last year. Comp traffic increased 0.6% in the second quarter and comp average ticket declined 09%. Bob Gfeller will provide more details regarding our comp performance in a few minutes. 
Gross margin contracted 37 basis in the quarter. Our 5% everyday offer for Lowe's consumer credit  cardholders impacted gross margin by 11 basis points. However, the gross margin impact of this offer was more than offset by leverage in tender and other cost associated with our proprietary credit program, which are components of SG&A. Bob Hull will provide more detail regarding gross margin in a few minutes. 
We had good operating expense control in the quarter. However, as detailed in today's release, we recognized the charge associated with impairment of long-lived assets, including 7 stores that closed on August 14, which reduced pretax earnings for the quarter by $83 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.04. We generated substantial operating cash flow during the quarter, which allowed us to repurchase 59.7 million shares or $1.4 billion, exhausting our share repurchase authorization. Including the impairment charge, we delivered earnings per share of $0.64 in the second quarter.
Our second quarter consumer survey indicates that high fuel prices remain at the top of consumers' minds as they consider future spending plans. However, recent headlines regarding slowing growth and the U.S. credit rating downgrade underscored the continued weakness in the U.S. economy. The volume of negative news and the unsettling impact on equity markets is having a significant effect on already fragile consumer mindset. 
More specifically with regard to home improvement spending, consumers continue to focus on small ticket, less than $500 repair and maintenance items and projects. Even after taking into account the challenge of the macro environment, we're still not pleased with our performance this year. For both do-it-yourself and commercial business customers, we must drive more trips, close more sales and build bigger baskets. So what are we doing about it? 
Earlier this year, our restructured executive team and together, we are looking at our business with a fresh perspective. We have critically evaluated our performance over the past several quarters and have identified some gaps. The gaps are in addition to convenience of store location, which we discussed in our first quarter earnings call. We have plans in place to address the gaps we've identified, but we also know that there is no silver bullet, and it's going to take time to see the full benefit of these changes. Bob Gfeller will discuss several of our near-term plans to compete more effectively in the current environment. He will also outline ways in which we will go to market differently beginning in the second half of this year.
We also remain focused on cost-efficient and effective operations. The management team is reviewing how we operate on a cross-functional basis to ensure consistent and connected execution, while also evaluating our organizational structure to streamline decision-making and ensuring that we have the right people in the right roles throughout the organization. We're making tough decisions in order to improve profitability, and I'm confident that the team is focused on the right areas and making the necessary decisions within the parameters of our longer-term strategy. 
Today's announcement regarding the closing of 7 stores is an example. Closing underperforming stores is always a tough decision, given the impact on hard-working employees and the local communities. But it was a fiscally responsible decision to further strengthen our financial position and drive shareholder value. Those are some of the near-term opportunities we're addressing. We previously shared with you our longer-term commitment to deliver better customer experiences, while pulling together the best combination of possibility, support and value whenever and wherever customers choose to engage. We continue to differentiate Lowe's from the competition, and we're building momentum behind our transformation in 2011. 
Let me share some of the progress we've made this quarter. We completed the rollout of our repair services concept. We now manage the repair experience for outdoor power equipment, as well as appliances. Our contact center is taking the calls, diagnosing the problems and facilitating the resolutions making after-sales service simpler for customers because they're dealing directly with us rather than the manufacturer. We tested this model in more than 100 stores and found that managing the experience ourselves positively affected customer satisfaction, which drove incremental store visits. In addition, we expect to realize cost savings through lower product return rates and the identification of quality concerns that we'll work with our vendors to resolve. 
We continue to be excited about the performance of lowes.com. In fact, we experienced a 130 basis points increase in online unit share on a rolling 4 quarters basis. We've also generated significant amount of interest with our social media campaigns. According to third-party data, we've ranked fourth among the top 25 brands and have the most online buzz and positive sentiment. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had over 190,000 items available online, a 73% increase since the fall of 2010 with significant expansion planned for the remainder of the year. We've also recently begun shipping items to customers from service stores and regional distribution centers in addition to our dedicated Internet warehouse. This means with more items available for partial shipment than ever before, we can provide faster delivery and reduce our cost to fulfill orders. We're also offering for the first time preprinted labels for partial returns free of charge, a simple and convenient option for customers and a competitive advantage in the home improvement industry, and there's more. 
We are launching the Spanish version of lowes.com this week, in an effort to better resonate with this very important demographic. This launch is a full translation of our lowes.com site, including commerce. You will also see our first mobile app in market in the coming weeks. Additionally, we will build on the fundamental capabilities that were  delivered on lowes.com this quarter such as the ability to create lists and reminders as we develop My Lowe's, a set of capabilities that will revolutionize how customers interact with us to more efficiently manage projects and improve their homes. My Lowe's will launch near the end of fiscal 2011.
And finally, we are pleased to announce that we have begun deployment of approximately 42,000 handheld devices to our stores in the U.S. and Canada. We expect this rollout to be complete by the end of the fiscal year. Our goal is to make home improvement simple for customers and for our employees. Leveraging Apple's iPhone technology, our employees will check inventory availability, access how-to videos and utilize lowes.com from the aisles of the store. This is a significant step towards simplicity and seamlessness and we will continue to add functionality to these devices over time.
The progress that I've outlined is building momentum behind our brand differentiation and will ultimately drive market share gains. In the interim, we are working diligently to improve sales and profitability in a way that will generate sustained customer preference and shareholder value. 
Before I turn over to Bob Gfeller to provide more details on the quarter and our near-term opportunities, I would like to thank our hardworking employees for their ongoing dedication and customer focus. Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that our Sanford, North Carolina store, which was destroyed by a tornado on April 16, will reopen to continue serving the Sanford community on Thursday, September 8. 
Thanks again for your interest. I'll now turn over to Bob."

Then, I will move on to explain our merchandising direction for the next few years and how we are working across all functions to accelerate sales and differentiate our brand. 
We finished the second quarter with negative 0.3% comps. Our performance was driven by some rebound in the first quarter in nursery and lawn and landscape products, offset by tough appliance comparisons resulting from last year's Cash for Appliances  stimulus program. Geographically, performance exceeded the company average in the North Central and Northeast regions of the country, as we energetically serve customers who have been waiting to start spring and summer projects and who needed to make repairs after a tough winter of snow and ice storms. 
Comp performance in the Gulf Coast region was significantly lower than the company average as extreme heat and severe drought dampened sales of outdoor products, most notably outdoor power equipment, nursery and lawn and landscape. We observed large regional swings in these categories but most significantly in outdoor power equipment, where double-digit comps in the Northeast and high single-digit comps in the North Central were offset by negative double-digit comps in the Southeast and South Central. 
In the second quarter, our outdoor categories recorded roughly a positive 3% comp, and our indoor categories recorded roughly a negative 2% comp. We reported strong nursery and lawn and landscape sales in the Northeast, North Central and West, while building materials performed well in the Southeast, South Central and North Central regions of the country, as our teams sold roofing materials and installation services to customers in the aftermath of the strong storms that hit those regions in the late spring.
Looking at indoor categories. Tools comped in the mid-single digits, driven by new Father's Day offers and the launch of our new and improved Kobalt  mechanics tools. The new program has premium specifications for torque, teeth count, metal hardness and ergonomics as good as any other leading brand. And we have more than twice the SKUs of our prior program with a wide variety of single-socket sizes, which is what the commercial customer demands. The new line was launched as part of our second quarter Father's Day gift offering, and it sold very well. The Lowe's tool business has now comped positively for 6 consecutive quarters. This momentum is reflected in our 60 basis points of unit share gains on a rolling 4-quarter basis. 
Paint, the #1 home improvement project, continues to comp positively both indoors and outdoors. Our Valspar interior Hi-DEF launch last year, along with the launches of our allen+roth paint palette, Kobalt Express Deck and Valspar Hi-DEF Duramax exterior paint earlier this year are driving this performance. We expect the recent launches of Olympic 1 and Valspar Plus, which is asthma and allergy certified by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation to drive continued positive paint comps into the second half of 2011. 
In addition, the paint desk area was reset in the first half to ensure customers have all the products they need to complete their paint projects, organized the way that is intuitive to them: repair, prepare and paint. And this month, we introduced our first to market buy paint online and pickup in store with our exclusive 20-minute pickup guarantee. So you can see that we are taking our paint business to new levels, increasing our share of the #1 home improvement project. 
Appliances recorded negative mid-single digit comps as we cycled another strong quarter of the Cash for Appliances stimulus program. The good news is we have continued to gain appliance market share despite the negative comps. We are further encouraged by having just recently been named by J.D. Power as the highest-ranking major appliance retailer in customer satisfaction. This is the second year in a row and the third out of the last 4 years that we received this distinction. The basis for this ranking is a weighted average of performance across all aspects of the total appliance experience: sales staff, service, store facility, merchandise selection and availability, price, delivery services and installation. 
Appliances is our #1 category sold online, and we have new tools in place to help customers and employees research, compare and price appliances to make their shopping experience faster and simpler. The online appliance selector helps customers choose the right appliances for their needs conveniently from their own personal computer. And the lowes.com product ratings and reviews provide consumers with realtime, unbiased and unfiltered customer feedback on products already bought and in use. 
Another category with opportunity for improvement is flooring, which recorded low single-digit negative comps in the second quarter. It is a large ticket category that generally follows other projects like painting, when a customer is updating a room. Today, we need to provide strong value to entice consumers with limited discretionary income to plan and complete a major flooring project. And we have some changes underway that should bear fruit in the second half of this year. 
Within laminate and wood, we have completed a chain-wide reset. We now have enough SKU breadth to compete with all types of flooring store competition, and pricing has gotten sharper with opening price points on laminate flooring now under $1 per square foot. Carpet continues to perform well, and we are excited about the ways we continue to drive value in this category. Over the next few months, we will roll out a compelling opening price point program and introduce 2 new products with great wear and stain resistant qualities. 
In ceramic tile, we are resetting 25% of every ceramic floor tile set replacing over 100 SKUs. Additionally, with wall tiles sales gaining strength, this month, we have added 50 new SKUs across many stores. Why? Customers want more variety in color, style and size of tile as they freshen the look of their homes by completing bath makeovers and small tile accent projects in kitchens. 
Now turning to inventory. We ended the quarter with roughly 2% more inventory than last year. We are comfortable with our inventory levels of grills, patio furniture and room air conditioners as we do not expect significant third quarter markdown pressure in connection with second quarter inventory levels.
That completes my review of second quarter performance and some category specific efforts to drive sales in the back half of 2011. Now I would like to more broadly discuss new directions for Lowe's merchandising.
As merchandising looks to attract customers to drive sales and margin dollar growth, we believe that we must present value to the customer every day, and we must differentiate ourselves by providing simple, fresh and innovative ideas and solutions. To the customer, value is price plus something more. It is that simple. So I want to take a moment to discuss how we are reinvigorating our efforts to enhance our price image in the eye of the consumer and to provide the extra something that distinguishes us from our competitors. 
High-low pricing has become more influential in our sector as we and other retailers have responded through a shrinking market. As a result, customers have learned to wait on the next big deal because they know that if they wait long enough, they can get a lower price than the Every Day Low Price. So our sector has come to rely in recent years on creating compelling promotions. However, we must be vigilant to ensure that our customers perceive us to be priced competitively every day, even against online retailers and smaller category killers. 
So job #1 in this economic environment is ensuring our pricing compares well on those high velocity items that are easiest to compare to other retailers. We call these high velocity and highly comparable items benchmark items. To do this, we are expanding our list of benchmark items to sharpen our everyday pricing on the most visible items, and we are starting to lessen the frequency of special advertised promotions. There may be some categories or seasons of the year, which will be more promotional than others, but we need to convince customers, both through our pricing and our messaging, that they can expect a competitive price every time they shop on lowes.com or in our stores. This effort is being made with speed and with caution and an eye to margin impact. We expect to lag between our actions and customer response, as we know that it takes time and marketing investment for the customer to recognize and respond to price changes. 
Our Lowe's everyday value proposition reinforces our Every Day Low Price program with customers. As a reminder, this program provides Lowe's consumer credit card holders with 5% off everyday. For purchases above $299, we continue to offer cardholders their choice of no interest financing or the 5% off value. This program aims to provide a clear statement of value to Lowe's customers every day. It encourages them to shop for all of their household needs at Lowe's and rewards their loyalty. So far, customer response has exceeded our expectations and this program is driving increased transactions, gross margin dollars and EBIT margins.
Now to the other elements of the value equation, that something that when added to Every Day Low Prices truly differentiates us from our competitors. We are focused on 2 key areas that will shout value to the customer. They are product differentiation and solutions-based merchandising. Product differentiation establishes Lowe's as the place to find the newest and most relevant products for home improvement. These products can be national brands or they can be private brands. 
As we look to successfully introduce more new products, we are working closer than ever with our key vendor partners on new product development, new display techniques and technologies. We want to pull innovation forward and make it easy to find in our stores and online, creating a wow customer experience. So we are looking to partner with vendors of all sizes, who are developing new high-tech products for the home improvement industry, products that further position Lowe's as the customer solutions hub. We are plowing new ground that will reap long-term benefit to our strong brand and customer franchise. 
Solutions-based merchandising redirects our merchants' focus from a product- and vendor-centric view to a customer-centric view. This may sound simple, but it requires great team work across functions and products like never before. Our merchants are embracing this idea, the idea that we must assort, assemble and present solutions to the customer because the customer shops by occasion. 
So, for example, when customers want to refresh their bathrooms, they don't think about buying a vanity, a mirror, a new toilet, new faucets and bath hardware in isolation from each other. Instead, they think about how they want the bathroom to look in total, and their bathroom remodel is the occasion. Rather than making customers look for each component on separate aisles, we want to bring together different vignettes that will help them better determine what they want and more easily grab or order the items that they need. 
We have previously taken this approach to some extent, but never across as many occasions and never before pooling the inventories together for the customer, in a way that helps them buy all of the various products that they need to complete the total project. Frankly, as a big box, we have to get better at the tricks of the trade of great specialty retailing. We have been experimenting with product differentiation and solutions-based merchandising in test store end caps during the first half of this year and have seen positive customer response. 
We have also de-rack areas of these test stores, reducing SKUs to create larger spaces to display complete solutions. We expect the results to be even more favorable when we expand this idea further to present solutions-based sets in an open vignette space. Expansion plans for more powerful end caps and drop zones, as we call them, are underway. 
As we increase our focus on product differentiation and solutions-based merchandise, and we are going to test and learn much more than in the past. We need to take a lot of at-bats to hit a home run. And with such a large store base, we have a great opportunity to cost effectively try many things within just a few stores to see what works, and then test the winners more broadly before rolling them out chain-wide. So you will see a more aggressive and proactive testing approach from us in the future. 
I would like to share the results of one such test and have chosen a project that involved all of the merchandising divisions to some degree. The goal was to showcase product innovation and value in a way that resonated with the customer. That involved bringing solutions out of the standard racking, presenting them in drop zones and vignettes that made the customer experience more simple and helpful and last, highlighting our great selection of national and private brands. 
As you can imagine, this project required that we reallocate space across the store, removing standard rack in some cases and making room for the new solutions-based presentations. And we developed new signs and messaging to communicate with the consumer. Customer feedback was extremely positive. They said it was easier to find product and solutions in the store, easier to understand product value, that Lowe's is more innovative than before and that they were more motivated to improve their home, and they were more likely to shop at Lowe's in the future.
In order to bring innovation and solutions-based merchandising to life, we are making strong progress in implementing Integrated Planning and Execution or IP&E, which will support our merchants' efforts to go local. IP&E will provide the tools and processes to make our entire organization more efficient and refined in ensuring that the right product is in the right market in the right quantity to best meet customer needs. And it will create institutional memory to maintain local assorting decisions when merchants change. 
Over 80% of the merchandising teams have product line reviews in process with this new set of processes and tools, and they are uncovering significant consumer insights that are driving different product decisions. Resets from these line reviews are beginning now and will continue throughout 2012, and we should obtain sales inventory turn benefit beginning in 2012 and ramping into 2013.
The IP&E process was recently used in a fashion category. The merchandising team combined its science from the IP&E tools with input from talented people from across our company to create a comprehensive view of the customer needs in each store. They used that insight to be customer advocates across all aspects of the product line review for product line design to store experience. And finally, they varied selection for each store, providing more of the finishes, price points and platforms that consumers expect to see in their local markets. The full refresh should be completed in the fall of 2011.
So in summary, we were not satisfied with second quarter performance. But my team has been reshaping the merchandising direction, implementing changes now that should advance us further in our multiyear implementation of our broader strategic vision of a customer-centric, anytime, anywhere and simpler shopping experience. As we enter this on ramp to our future, we will concentrate on delivering better value to customers, price plus something more and we will work to differentiate our product offering, and organize the customers multi-channel shopping experience around solutions. 
We expect to begin realizing the benefit of these initiatives in 2012, as we will balance a desire for speed to market with the prudent test-and-learn approach I discussed earlier. But we will stay focused on making the changes necessary to generate sustained customer preference and shareholder value. 
Thanks for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our second quarter financial results. Bob?"
180871,139025984,158424,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2011",2011-08-15,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $14.5 billion, which represents a 1.3% increase over last year's second quarter. In Q2, total customer transactions increased 2%, while total average ticket decreased 0.7% to $62.4",1845,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $14.5 billion, which represents a 1.3% increase over last year's second quarter. In Q2, total customer transactions increased 2%, while total average ticket decreased 0.7% to $62.44. Comp sales were negative 0.3% for the quarter, which was below our guidance of approximately 2%. The lower-than-expected performance was driven by less recovery than anticipated from Q1 in our seasonal businesses and by higher-than-expected impact from lumber deflation, which hurt second quarter comps by approximately 70 basis points. 
For the quarter, comp average ticket declined 0.9%, while comp transactions increased 0.6%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were negative 2.7% in May, flat in June and positive 2.2% in July. The improvement in monthly comps during the quarter was driven by a few factors. First, we experienced a delay in our seasonal business, which improved as the quarter progressed. Second, demands associated with efforts to remedy store damage was moderate in May and strengthened in June and July. Lastly, the toughest Cash for Appliances comparison from Q2 last year was in May. Appliance comps for the quarter, while still negative, improved throughout the quarter. 
With regard to product categories, the categories that had above average comps in the second quarter include building materials, rough electrical, modern landscape, nursery, tools, rough plumbing, paint, hardware and seasonal living. Year-to-date comp sales were negative 1.7%, and total sales of $26.7 billion were essentially flat to the first half of 2010. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.49% of sales, which decreased 37 basis points from last year's second quarter. In the quarter, promotional activity negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. This promotional activity was initiated by both us and the competition. As you heard from Bob earlier, we are expanding our benchmark list to sharpen our everyday pricing on the most visible items, and we are working to lessen the frequency of special advertised promotions. 
Higher transportation cost, both fuel and ocean freight negatively impacted gross margin by an estimated 15 basis points. In addition, our proprietary credit value proposition, which offers customers the choice of 5% off everyday or promotional financing negatively impacted gross margin by 11 basis points. As Robert noted, this was more than offset by a leverage in tender and other costs associated with our proprietary credit program. 
I will provide the details of SG&A and EBIT impacts in a moment. Lastly, clearance activity associated with resets hurt gross margin by approximately 10 basis points. Slightly offsetting these items were Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion aided gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.93% of sales, a decrease of 8 basis points from the first half of 2010. SG&A for Q2 was 22.22% of sales, which deleveraged 1 basis point. 
During the quarter, we incurred an $83 million charge related to an evaluation of the carrying value of long-life assets, including 7 stores that were closed. This compares to approximately $11 million in Q2 2010, which results in deleverage of 49 basis points. We also experienced approximately 15 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences. The expenses related to staffing up our contact center to support the in-sourcing of repair services, internal and external resources for additional lowes.com capabilities, advancing the My Lowe's concept and continued efforts to build out our customer relationship platform. 
Store payroll deleveraged 10 basis points due to a slight increase in average hourly rate and new stores. Payroll taxes deleveraged 7 basis points as a result of both higher payroll taxes and higher payroll expenses. Almost completely offsetting these items was leverage in the following areas: we experienced 44 basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program. This leverage was driven by a combination of fewer losses, as well as lower promotional financing as a direct result of customers choosing 5% off everyday versus promotional financing. In addition, tender costs were lower as the mix of proprietary credit increased 240 basis points in the quarter to 21% of sales. Also bonus expense leveraged 35 basis points in the quarter due to lower payment levels relative to plan compared with this time of last year.
Year-to-date SG&A of 23.76% of sales, which deleveraged 27 basis points in the first half of 2010. During the first half of 2011, charges associated with asset impairment cost 29 basis points of the SG&A deleverage. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $365 million, which was 2.51% of sales and leveraged 26 basis points compared with last year's second quarter. We estimate that our proprietary credit value propositions positively impacted EBIT by 29 basis points for the quarter. However, this was more than offset by the negative 49 basis point impact associated with impairment charges contributing to an EBIT decline of 12 basis points to 9.76% of sales for Q2. 
For the first half, EBIT was 8.41% of sales, which was 14 basis points lower than the same period last year. Interest expense was $90 million for the quarter and deleveraged 3 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, total expenses were 25.35% of sales and leveraged 22 basis points. Year-to-date, total expenses were 27.19% of sales and deleveraged 11 basis points versus last year. 
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 9.14% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% versus 37.7% for Q2 last year. Net earnings were $830 million for the quarter, which was essentially flat to Q2 2010. Earnings per share of $0.64 for the second quarter was below our guidance of $0.65 to $0.69, but please remember that the reported $0.64 includes the $0.04 per share of negative impact associated with impairment charges. Earnings per share increased 10.3% versus last year's $0.58. For the first 6 months of 2011, earnings per share of $0.98 represents a 6.5% increase over the first half of 2010. 
Now to a few items in the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $568 million. Our second quarter inventory balance of $8.8 billion increased $172 million or 2% versus Q2 last year. The increase was driven by new stores and an increase in distribution center inventory. 
Inventory turnover calculated by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last 5 quarters was 3.6%, a decrease of 3 basis points from Q2 2010. Return on assets determined using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters increased 35 basis points to 5.74%
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $5.4 billion represents a 10% increase from Q2 last year. The higher accounts payable balance relates to the timing of purchases this year relative to last year. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 39.5% compared with 29% for Q2 last year. At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.75x. Return on invested capital, measured using a trailing 4 quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last 5 quarters increased 65 basis points to 9.04%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $3.3 billion, an increase of $511 million or 18% over last year largely due to the increase in accounts payable. Cash used for property acquired was $780 million, a 27% increase due to the corporate systems and store infrastructure investments we are making to provide better customer experiences. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow of $2.5 billion is 16% higher than the first half of 2010. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 59.7 million shares at an average price of $23.46 for a total repurchase amount of $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.4 billion and have exhausted our share repurchase authorization. We are continuing to assess market conditions and evaluate options regarding capital structure and future share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. The macro environment has changed dramatically over the past several weeks. We went from worrying about the customer, who was stretched by fuel and other inflation to a nation watching the debt ceiling countdown and now to extremely volatile equity markets. 
Given this and the impact on consumer sentiment, we have lowered our sales outlook for the second half of 2011. We are now planning for comparable store sales to be approximately flat to last year for Q3 and Q4. Earnings before interest and taxes and earnings per share estimates have been similarly reduced to reflect the lower expected sales. 
Macro challenges aside, we are not happy with our recent performance and are working to improve sales, profitability and shareholder value. However, as you heard from Robert and Bob, these efforts take time to implement, and meaningful benefits from our actions likely won't be reflected in our financial results until 2012. We expect a third quarter total sales increase by approximately 2% with comp sales estimated to be essentially flat to last year, and approximately 1.3% average square footage growth. 
Earnings before interest and taxes for the third quarter are expected to decrease 10 to 20 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. This EBIT outlook includes approximately $30 million or 25 basis points of additional expenses associated with the 7 stores that closed yesterday. 
For the quarter, interest expense was expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate was forecasted to be 37.7% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.33, including the additional expenses associated with store closings. For 2011, we are estimating comp sales to decline by approximately 1%. For the year, we expect to open approximately 25 stores, close 7, resulting in a net addition of 18 stores for an increase in average square footage of approximately 1.3%. With the estimated 1.4% impact of the 53rd week, total sales are expected to increase approximately 2%. 
For the year, we are anticipating EBIT to decrease approximately 30 basis points. This includes approximately $115 million or 25 basis points associated with asset impairment and store closing expenses. For 2011, interest expense is expected to be approximately $360 million. For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 36%. The sum of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.54, which includes approximately $0.06 per share in impairment and store closing charges. 
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.1 billion. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecasted to be approximately $2.1 billion, with roughly $100 million funded by operating leases resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow of $2.1 billion for the year. Our guidance for 2011 includes share repurchases activity through Q2, but does not include any impact from future share repurchases.

As you know, going through the financial downturn that took place over the past several years, housing, economic downturn, it naturally led to a more promotional environment. As we transition out of that, we do think that the customers are telling us that they're looking for great value everyday. So whether it's expanding the list of benchmark items to better send the message to them on an ongoing basis that they can find great value everyday, whether it's what we did with our 5% off value prop that we did with the -- on the Lowe's credit card, the return back to EDLP and the work that Bob and his team were doing to work with our vendors and say, we're going to take everything we can out of cost, so we can provide the EDLP benefit to the customer and protect margin everyday.

Following my remarks, Bob Gfeller will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results. But first, let me share a summary of our second quarter performance, as well as how we're thinking about our near-term and long-term opportunities. 
Despite some recovery from the first quarter in our seasonal business, our performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations. Sales for the quarter increased 1.3%, while comparable store sales were essentially flat to last year. Comp traffic increased 0.6% in the second quarter and comp average ticket declined 0.9%. Bob Gfeller will provide more details regarding our comp performance in a few minutes. 
Gross margin contracted 37 basis points in the quarter. Our 5% off everyday offer for Lowe's consumer credit card holders impacted gross margin by 11 basis points. However, the gross margin impact of this offer was more than offset by leverage in tender and other costs associated with our proprietary credit program, which are components of SG&A. Bob Hull will provide more detail regarding gross margin in a few minutes. 
We had good operating expense control in the quarter. However, as detailed in today's release, we recognized a charge associated with impairment of long-lived assets, including 7 stores that closed on August 14, which reduced pretax earnings for the quarter by $83 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.04. We generated substantial operating cash flow during the quarter, which allowed us to repurchase 59.7 million shares or $1.4 billion, exhausting our share repurchase authorization. Including the impairment charge, we delivered earnings per share of $0.64 in the second quarter.
Our second quarter consumer survey indicates that high fuel prices remain at the top of consumers' minds as they consider future spending plans. However, recent headlines regarding slowing growth and the U.S. credit rating downgrade underscored the continued weakness in the U.S. economy. The volume of negative news and the unsettling impact on equity markets is having a significant effect on already fragile consumer mindset. 
More specifically with regard to home improvement spending, consumers continue to focus on small ticket, less than $500 repair and maintenance items and projects. Even after taking into account the challenge of the macro environment, we're still not pleased with our performance this year. For both do-it-yourself and commercial business customers, we must drive more trips, close more sales and build bigger baskets. So what are we doing about it? 
Earlier this year, I restructured the executive team and together, we are looking at our business with a fresh perspective. We have critically evaluated our performance over the past several quarters and have identified some gaps. The gaps are in addition to convenience of store location, which we discussed in our first quarter earnings call. We have plans in place to address the gaps we've identified, but we also know that there is no silver bullet, and it's going to take time to see the full benefit of these changes. Bob Gfeller will discuss several of our near-term plans to compete more effectively in the current environment. He will also outline ways in which we will go to market differently beginning in the second half of this year.
We also remain focused on cost-efficient and effective operations. The management team is reviewing how we operate on a cross-functional basis to ensure consistent and connected execution, while also evaluating our organizational structure to streamline decision-making and ensuring that we have the right people in the right roles throughout the organization. We're making tough decisions in order to improve profitability, and I'm confident that the team is focused on the right areas and making the necessary decisions within the parameters of our longer-term strategy. 
Today's announcement regarding the closing of 7 stores is an example. Closing underperforming stores is always a tough decision, given the impact on hard-working employees and the local communities. But it was a fiscally responsible decision to further strengthen our financial position and drive shareholder value. Those are some of the near-term opportunities we're addressing. We previously shared with you our longer-term commitment to deliver better customer experiences, while pulling together the best combination of possibility, support and value whenever and wherever customers choose to engage. We continue to differentiate Lowe's from the competition, and we're building momentum behind our transformation in 2011. 
Let me share some of the progress we've made this quarter. We completed the rollout of our repair services concept. We now manage the repair experience for outdoor power equipment, as well as appliances. Our contact center is taking the calls, diagnosing the problems and facilitating the resolutions making after-sales service simpler for customers because they're dealing directly with us rather than the manufacturer. We tested this model in more than 100 stores and found that managing the experience ourselves positively affected customer satisfaction, which drove incremental store visits. In addition, we expect to realize cost savings through lower product return rates and the identification of quality concerns that we'll work with our vendors to resolve. 
We continue to be excited about the performance of lowes.com. In fact, we experienced a 130-basis points increase in online unit share on a rolling 4 quarters basis. We've also generated significant amount of interest with our social media campaigns. According to third-party data, we've ranked fourth among the top 25 brands and have the most online buzz and positive sentiment. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had over 190,000 items available online, a 73% increase since the fall of 2010 with significant expansion planned for the remainder of the year. We've also recently begun shipping items to customers from service stores and regional distribution centers in addition to our dedicated Internet warehouse. This means with more items available for partial shipment than ever before, we can provide faster delivery and reduce our cost to fill orders. We're also offering for the first time preprinted labels for partial returns free of charge, a simple and convenient option for customers and a competitive advantage in the home improvement industry, and there's more. 
We are launching the Spanish version of lowes.com this week, in an effort to better resonate with this very important demographic. This launch is a full translation of our lowes.com site, including commerce. You will also see our first mobile app in market in the coming weeks. Additionally, we will build on the fundamental capabilities that were delivered on lowes.com this quarter such as the ability to create lists and reminders as we develop My Lowe's, a set of capabilities that will revolutionize how customers interact with us to more efficiently manage projects and improve their homes. My Lowe's will launch near the end of fiscal 2011.
And finally, we are pleased to announce that we have begun deployment of approximately 42,000 handheld devices for our stores in the U.S. and Canada. We expect this rollout to be complete by the end of the fiscal year. Our goal is to make home improvement simple for customers and for our employees. Leveraging Apple's iPhone technology, our employees will check inventory availability, access how-to videos and utilize lowes.com from the aisles of the store. This is a significant step towards simplicity and seamlessness and we will continue to add functionality to these devices over time.
The progress that I've outlined is building momentum behind our brand differentiation and will ultimately drive market share gains. In the interim, we are working diligently to improve sales and profitability in a way that will generate sustained customer preference and shareholder value. 
Before I turn over to Bob Gfeller to provide more details on the quarter and our near-term opportunities, I would like to thank our hardworking employees for their ongoing dedication and customer focus. Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that our Sanford, North Carolina store, which was destroyed by a tornado on April 16, will reopen to continue serving the Sanford community on Thursday, September 8. 
Thanks again for your interest. I'll now turn it over to Bob."

During my time today, I will review our second quarter performance, as well as describe how we are working to win the customers' hard-earned money, drive sales and grow market share. Then I will move on to explain our merchandising direction for the next few years and how we are working across all functions to accelerate sales and differentiate our brand. 
We finished the second quarter with negative 0.3% comps. Our performance was driven by some rebound in the first quarter in nursery and lawn and landscape products, offset by tough appliance comparisons resulting from last year's Cash for Appliances stimulus program. Geographically, performance exceeded the company average in the North Central and Northeast regions of the country, as we energetically served customers who had been waiting to start spring and summer projects and who needed to make repairs after a tough winter of snow and ice storms. 
Comp performance in the Gulf Coast region was significantly lower than the company average as extreme heat and severe drought dampened sales of outdoor products, most notably outdoor power equipment, nursery and lawn and landscape. We observed large regional swings in these categories but most significantly in outdoor power equipment, where double-digit comps in the Northeast and high-single digit comps in the North Central were offset by negative double-digit comps in the Southeast and South Central. 
In the second quarter, our outdoor categories recorded roughly a positive 3% comp, and our indoor categories recorded roughly a negative 2% comp. We reported strong nursery and lawn and landscape sales in the Northeast, North Central and West, while building materials performed well in the Southeast, South Central and North Central regions of the country, as our teams sold roofing materials and installation services to customers in the aftermath of the strong storms that hit those regions in the late spring.
Looking at indoor categories. Tools comped in the mid-single digits, driven by new Father's Day offers and the launch of our new and improved Kobalt mechanics tools. The new program has premium specifications for torque, teeth count, metal hardness and ergonomics as good as any other leading brand. And we have more than twice the SKUs of our prior program with a wide variety of single-socket sizes, which is what the commercial customer demands. The new line was launched as part of our second quarter Father's Day gift offering, and it sold very well. The Lowe's tool business has now comped positively for 6 consecutive quarters. This momentum is reflected in our 60 basis points of unit share gains on a rolling 4-quarter basis. 
Paint, the #1 home improvement project, continues to comp positively both indoors and outdoors. Our Valspar interior Hi-DEF launch last year, along with the launches of our allen+roth paint palette, Kobalt Express Deck and Valspar Hi-DEF Duramax exterior paint earlier this year are driving this performance. We expect the recent launches of Olympic 1 and Valspar Plus, which is asthma and allergy certified by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation to drive continued positive paint comps into the second half of 2011. 
In addition, the paint desk area was reset in the first half to ensure customers have all the products they need to complete their paint projects, organized in a way that is intuitive to them: repair, prepare and paint. And this month, we introduced our first to market buy paint online and pick up in store with our exclusive 20-minute pickup guarantee. So you can see that we are taking our paint business to new levels, increasing our share of the #1 home improvement project. 
Appliances recorded negative mid-single digit comps as we cycled another strong quarter of the Cash for Appliances stimulus program. The good news is we have continued to gain appliance market share despite the negative comps. We are further encouraged by having just recently been named by J.D. Power as the highest-ranking major appliance retailer in customer satisfaction. This is the second year in a row and the third out of the last 4 years that we’ve received this distinction. The basis for this ranking is a weighted average of performance across all aspects of the total appliance experience: sales staff, service, store facility, merchandise selection and availability, price, delivery services and installation. 
Appliances is our #1 category sold online, and we have new tools in place to help customers and employees research, compare and price appliances to make their shopping experience faster and simpler. The online appliance selector helps customers choose the right appliances for their needs conveniently from their own personal computer. And the lowes.com product ratings and reviews provide consumers with realtime, unbiased and unfiltered customer feedback on products already bought and in use. 
Another category with opportunity for improvement is flooring, which recorded low-single digit negative comps in the second quarter. It is a large-ticket category that generally follows other projects like painting, when a customer is updating a room. Today, we need to provide strong value to entice consumers with limited discretionary income to plan and complete a major flooring project. And we have some changes underway that should bear fruit in the second half of this year. 
Within laminate and wood, we have completed a chain-wide reset. We now have enough SKU breadth to compete with all types of flooring store competition, and pricing has gotten sharper with opening price points on laminate flooring now under $1 per square foot. Carpet continues to perform well, and we are excited about the ways we continue to drive value in this category. Over the next few months, we will roll out a compelling opening price point program and introduce 2 new products with great wear and stain resistant qualities. 
In ceramic tile, we are resetting 25% of every ceramic floor tile set replacing over 100 SKUs. Additionally, with wall tile sales gaining strength, this month, we have added 50 new SKUs across many stores. Why? Customers want more variety in color, style and size of tile as they freshen the look of their homes by completing bath makeovers and small tile accent projects in kitchens. 
Now turning to inventory. We ended the quarter with roughly 2% more inventory than last year. We are comfortable with our inventory levels of grills, patio furniture and room air conditioners as we do not expect significant third quarter markdown pressure in connection with second quarter inventory levels.
That completes my review of second quarter performance and some category specific efforts to drive sales in the back half of 2011. Now I would like to more broadly discuss new directions for Lowe's merchandising.
As merchandising looks to attract customers to drive sales and margin dollar growth, we believe that we must present value to the customer every day, and we must differentiate ourselves by providing simple, fresh and innovative ideas and solutions. To the customer, value is price plus something more. It is that simple. So I want to take a moment to discuss how we are reinvigorating our efforts to enhance our price image in the eye of the consumer and to provide the extra something that distinguishes us from our competitors. 
High-low pricing has become more influential in our sector as we and other retailers have responded to a shrinking market. As a result, customers have learned to wait on the next big deal because they know that if they wait long enough, they can get a lower price than the Every Day Low Price. So our sector has come to rely in recent years on creating compelling promotions. However, we must be vigilant to ensure that our customers perceive us to be priced competitively every day, even against online retailers and smaller category killers. 
So job #1 in this economic environment is ensuring our pricing compares well on those high velocity items that are easiest to compare to other retailers. We call these high velocity and highly comparable items benchmark items. To do this, we are expanding our list of benchmark items to sharpen our everyday pricing on the most visible items, and we are starting to lessen the frequency of special advertised promotions. There may be some categories or seasons of the year, which will be more promotional than others, but we need to convince customers, both through our pricing and our messaging, that they can expect a competitive price every time they shop on lowes.com or in our stores. This effort is being made with speed and with caution and an eye to margin impact. We expect a lag between our actions and customer response, as we know that it takes time and marketing investment for the customer to recognize and respond to price changes. 
Our Lowe's everyday value proposition reinforces our Every Day Low Price program with customers. As a reminder, this program provides Lowe's consumer credit card holders with 5% off everyday. For purchases above $299, we continue to offer cardholders their choice of no interest financing or the 5% off value. This program aims to provide a clear statement of value to Lowe's customers every day. It encourages them to shop for all of their household needs at Lowe's and rewards their loyalty. So far, customer response has exceeded our expectations and this program is driving increased transactions, gross margin dollars and EBIT margins.
Now to the other elements of the value equation, that something that when added to Every Day Low Prices truly differentiates us from our competitors. We are focused on 2 key areas that will shout value to the customer. They are product differentiation and solutions-based merchandising. Product differentiation establishes Lowe's as the place to find the newest and most relevant products for home improvement. These products can be national brands or they can be private brands. 
As we look to successfully introduce more new products, we are working closer than ever with our key vendor partners on new product development, new display techniques and technologies. We want to pull innovation forward and make it easy to find in our stores and online, creating a wow customer experience. So we are looking to partner with vendors of all sizes, who are developing new high-tech products for the home improvement industry, products that further position Lowe's as a customer solutions hub. We are plowing new ground that will reap long-term benefit to our strong brand and customer franchise. 
Solutions-based merchandising redirects our merchants' focus from a product- and vendor-centric view to a customer-centric view. This may sound simple, but it requires great team work across functions and products like never before. Our merchants are embracing this idea, the idea that we must assort, assemble and present solutions to the customer because the customer shops by occasion. 
So, for example, when customers want to refresh their bathrooms, they don't think about buying a vanity, a mirror, a new toilet, new faucets and bath hardware in isolation from each other. Instead, they think about how they want the bathroom to look in total, and their bathroom remodel is the occasion. Rather than making customers look for each component on separate aisles, we want to bring together different vignettes that will help them better determine what they want and more easily grab or order the items that they need. 
We have previously taken this approach to some extent, but never across as many occasions and never before pulling the inventory together for the customer, in a way that helps them buy all of the various products that they need to complete the total project. Frankly, as a big box, we have to get better at the tricks of the trade of great specialty retailing. We have been experimenting with product differentiation and solutions-based merchandising in test store end caps during the first half of this year and have seen positive customer response. 
We have also de-racked areas of these test stores, reducing SKUs to create larger spaces to display complete solutions. We expect the results to be even more favorable when we expand this idea further to present solutions-based sets in an open vignette space. Expansion plans for more powerful end caps and drop zones, as we call them, are underway. 
As we increase our focus on product differentiation and solutions-based merchandising, we are going to test and learn much more than in the past. We need to take a lot of at-bats to hit a home run. And with such a large store base, we have a great opportunity to cost effectively try many things within just a few stores to see what works, and then test the winners more broadly before rolling them out chain-wide. So you will see a more aggressive and proactive testing approach from us in the future. 
I would like to share the results of one such test and have chosen a project that involved all of the merchandising divisions to some degree. The goal was to showcase product innovation and value in a way that resonated with the customer. That involved bringing solutions out of the standard racking, presenting them in drop zones and vignettes that made the customer experience more simple and helpful and last, highlighting our great selection of national and private brands. 
As you can imagine, this project required that we reallocate space across the store, removing standard rack in some cases and making room for the new solutions-based presentations. And we developed new signs and messaging to communicate with the consumer. Customer feedback was extremely positive. They said it was easier to find product and solutions in the store, easier to understand product value, that Lowe's is more innovative than before and that they were more motivated to improve their home, and they were more likely to shop at Lowe's in the future.
In order to bring innovation and solutions-based merchandising to life, we are making strong progress in implementing Integrated Planning and Execution or IP&E, which will support our merchants' efforts to go local. IP&E will provide the tools and processes to make our entire organization more efficient and refined in ensuring that the right product is in the right market in the right quantity to best meet customer needs. And it will create institutional memory to maintain local assorting decisions when merchants change. 
Over 80% of the merchandising teams have product line reviews in process with this new set of processes and tools, and they are uncovering significant consumer insights that are driving different product decisions. Resets from these line reviews are beginning now and will continue throughout 2012, and we should obtain sales inventory turn benefit beginning in 2012 and ramping into 2013.
The IP&E process was recently used in a fashion category. The merchandising team combined science from the IP&E tools with input from talented people from across our company to create a comprehensive view of the customer needs in each store. They used that insight to be customer advocates across all aspects of the product line review for product line design to store experience. And finally, they varied selection for each store, providing more of the finishes, price points and platforms that consumers expect to see in their local markets. The full refresh should be completed in the fall of 2011.
So in summary, we were not satisfied with second quarter performance. But my team has been reshaping the merchandising direction, implementing changes now that should advance us further in our multiyear implementation of our broader strategic vision of a customer-centric, anytime, anywhere and simpler shopping experience. As we enter this on ramp to our future, we will concentrate on delivering better value to customers, price plus something more and we will work to differentiate our product offering, and organize the customers’ multi-channel shopping experience around solutions. 
We expect to begin realizing the benefit of these initiatives in 2012, as we will balance a desire for speed to market with the prudent test-and-learn approach I discussed earlier. But we will stay focused on making the changes necessary to generate sustained customer preference and shareholder value. 
Thanks for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our second quarter financial results. Bob?"
180871,139025984,158628,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2011",2011-08-15,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $14.5 billion, which represents a 1.3% increase over last year's second quarter. In Q2, total customer transactions increased 2%, while total average ticket decreased 0.7% to $62.4",1846,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $14.5 billion, which represents a 1.3% increase over last year's second quarter. In Q2, total customer transactions increased 2%, while total average ticket decreased 0.7% to $62.44. Comp sales were negative 0.3% for the quarter, which was below our guidance of approximately 2%. The lower-than-expected performance was driven by less recovery than anticipated from Q1 in our seasonal businesses and by higher-than-expected impact from lumber deflation, which hurt second quarter comps by approximately 70 basis points. 
For the quarter, comp average ticket declined 0.9%, while comp transactions increased 0.6%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were negative 2.7% in May, flat in June and positive 2.2% in July. The improvement in monthly comps during the quarter was driven by a few factors. First, we experienced a delay in our seasonal business, which improved as the quarter progressed. Second, demand associated with effort to remedy store damage was moderate in May and strengthened in June and July. Lastly, the toughest Cash for Appliances comparison from Q2 last year was in May. Appliance comps for the quarter, while still negative, improved throughout the quarter. 
With regard to product categories, the categories that had above average comps in the second quarter include building materials, rough electrical, modern landscape, nursery, tools, rough plumbing, paint, hardware and seasonal living. Year-to-date comp sales were negative 1.7%, and total sales of $26.7 billion were essentially flat to the first half of 2010. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.49% of sales, which decreased 37 basis points from last year's second quarter. In the quarter, promotional activity negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. This promotional activity was initiated by both us and the competition. As you heard from Bob earlier, we are expanding our benchmark list to sharpen our everyday pricing on the most visible items, and we are working to lessen the frequency of special advertised promotions. 
Higher transportation cost, both fuel and ocean freight, negatively impacted gross margin by an estimated 15 basis points. In addition, our proprietary credit value proposition, which offers customers the choice of 5% off every day or promotional financing negatively impacted gross margin by 11 basis points. As Robert noted, this was more than offset by a leverage in tender and other costs associated with our proprietary credit program. 
I will provide the details of SG&A and EBIT impacts in a moment. Lastly, clearance activity associated with resets hurt gross margin by approximately 10 basis points. Slightly offsetting these items were Base Price Optimization and patch area expansion aided the gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.93% of sales, a decrease of 8 basis points from the first half of 2010. SG&A for Q2 was 22.22% of sales, which deleveraged 1 basis point. 
During the quarter, we incurred an $83 million charge related to an evaluation of the carrying value of long-life assets, including 7 stores that were closed. This compares to approximately $11 million in Q2 2010, which results in deleverage of 49 basis points. We also experienced approximately 15 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences. The expenses related to staffing up our contact center to support the in-sourcing of repair services, internal and external resources for additional lowes.com capabilities, advancing the My Lowe's concept and continued efforts to build out our customer relationship platform. 
Store payroll deleveraged 10 basis points due to a slight increase in average hourly rate and new stores. Payroll taxes deleveraged 7 basis points as a result of both higher payroll taxes and higher payroll expenses. Almost completely offsetting these items was leverage in the following areas: we experienced 44 basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program. This leverage was driven by a combination of fewer losses, as well as lower promotional financing as a direct result of customers choosing 5% off everyday versus promotional financing. In addition, tender costs were lower as the mix of proprietary credit increased 240 basis points in the quarter to 21% of sales. Also bonus expense leveraged 35 basis points in the quarter due to lower payment levels relative to plan compared with this time last year.
Year-to-date SG&A of 23.76% of sales, which deleveraged 27 basis points in the first half of 2010. During the first half of 2011, charges associated with asset impairment cost 29 basis points of the SG&A deleverage. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $365 million, which was 2.51% of sales and leveraged 26 basis points compared with last year's second quarter. We estimate that our proprietary credit value propositions positively impacted EBIT by 29 basis points for the quarter. However, this was more than offset by the negative 49 basis point impact associated with impairment charges contributing to an EBIT decline of 12 basis points to 9.76% of sales for Q2. 
For the first half, EBIT was 8.41% of sales, which was 14 basis points lower than the same period last year. Interest expense was $90 million for the quarter and deleveraged 3 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, total expenses were 25.35% of sales and leveraged 22 basis points. Year-to-date, total expenses were 27.19% of sales and deleveraged 11 basis points versus last year. 
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 9.14% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% versus 37.7% for Q2 last year. Net earnings were $830 million for the quarter, which was essentially flat to Q2 2010. Earnings per share of $0.64 for the second quarter was below our guidance of $0.65 to $0.69, but please remember that the reported $0.64 includes the $0.04 per share of negative impact associated with impairment charges. Earnings per share increased 10.3% versus last year's $0.58. For the first 6 months of 2011, earnings per share of $0.98 represents a 6.5% increase over the first half of 2010. 
Now to a few items in the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $568 million. Our second quarter inventory balance of $8.8 billion increased $172 million or 2% versus Q2 last year. The increase was driven by new stores and an increase in distribution center inventory. 
Inventory turnover calculated by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last 5 quarters was 3.6%, a decrease of 3 basis points from Q2 2010. Return on assets determined using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters increased 35 basis points to 5.74%.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $5.4 billion represents a 10% increase from Q2 last year. The higher accounts payable balance relates to the timing of purchases this year relative to last year. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 39.5% compared with 29% for Q2 last year. At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.75x. Return on invested capital, measured using a trailing 4 quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last 5 quarters increased 65 basis points to 9.04%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $3.3 billion, an increase of $511 million or 18% over last year largely due to the increase in accounts payable. Cash used for property acquired was $780 million, a 27% increase due to the corporate systems and store infrastructure investments we are making to provide better customer experiences. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow of $2.5 billion is 16% higher than the first half of 2010. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 59.7 million shares at an average price of $23.46 for a total repurchase amount of $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.4 billion and have exhausted our share repurchase authorization. We are continuing to assess market conditions and evaluate options regarding capital structure and future share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. The macro environment has changed dramatically over the past several weeks. We went from worrying about the customer, who was stretched by fuel and other inflation to a nation watching the debt ceiling countdown and now to extremely volatile equity markets. 
Given this and the impact on consumer sentiment, we have lowered our sales outlook for the second half of 2011. We are now planning for comparable store sales to be approximately flat to last year for Q3 and Q4. Earnings before interest and taxes and earnings per share estimates have been similarly reduced to reflect the lower expected sales. 
Macro challenges aside, we are not happy with our recent performance and are working to improve sales, profitability and shareholder value. However, as you heard from Robert and Bob, these efforts take time to implement, and meaningful benefits from our actions likely won't be reflected in our financial results until 2012. We expect a third quarter total sales increase by approximately 2% with comp sales estimated to be essentially flat to last year, and approximately 1.3% average square footage growth. 
Earnings before interest and taxes for the third quarter are expected to decrease 10 to 20 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. This EBIT outlook includes approximately $30 million or 25 basis points of additional expenses associated with the 7 stores that closed yesterday. 
For the quarter, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million. The income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.7% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.33, including the additional expenses associated with store closings. For 2011, we are estimating comp sales to decline by approximately 1%. For the year, we expect to open approximately 25 stores, close 7, resulting in a net addition of 18 stores for an increase in average square footage of approximately 1.3%. With the estimated 1.4% impact of the 53rd week, total sales are expected to increase approximately 2%. 
For the year, we are anticipating EBIT to decrease approximately 30 basis points. This includes approximately $115 million or 25 basis points associated with asset impairment and store closing expenses. For 2011, interest expense is expected to be approximately $360 million. For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 36%. The sum of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.54, which includes approximately $0.06 per share in impairment and store closing charges. 
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.1 billion. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecasted to be approximately $2.1 billion, with roughly $100 million funded by operating leases resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow of $2.1 billion for the year. Our guidance for 2011 includes share repurchases activity through Q2, but does not include any impact from future share repurchases.

As we transition out of that, we do think that the customers are telling us that they're looking for great value every day. So whether it's expanding the list of benchmark items to better send the message to them on an ongoing basis that they can find great value every day, whether it's what we did with our 5% off value prop that we did with the -- on the Lowe's credit card, the return back to EDLP and the work that Bob and his team were doing to work with our vendors and say, we're going to take everything we can out of cost, so we can provide that EDLP benefit to the customer and protect margin every day.

Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results in detail. But first, let me share a summary of our third quarter performance",976,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results in detail. 
But first, let me share a summary of our third quarter performance, as well as how we're thinking about our business going forward. Sales for the quarter increased 2.3% while comparable store sales were positive 0.7%. Comp traffic increased 0.7% in the third quarter, and comp average ticket was flat. 
Gross margin contracted 99 basis points in the quarter. Bob Hull will provide more details regarding gross margin in a few minutes.
We had good operating expense control in the quarter third quarter, however, as detailed in today's release, we recognized charges related to store closings and discontinued projects, which, in aggregate, reduced pretax earnings for the quarter by $336 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.17. Including this charge, we delivered earnings per share of $0.18 in the third quarter. Excluding the charge, we delivered earnings per share that exceeded our guidance for the quarter.
As I said before, our performance is not at the level we expect relative to the market or frankly, that we demand of ourselves as we define success, so we're taking action. The executive team is looking at our business from a fresh perspective, and we're evaluating how we operate on a cross-functional basis to ensure consistent and connected execution. 
During the third quarter, we reorganized our store operations and merchandising organizations to improve efficiencies, increase speed to market for new products and services and enhance the shopping experience for customers. We streamlined our field organizational structure, resulting in fewer districts and regions. And we've announced the closing of 27 stores this year that were underperforming despite the tremendous effort and hard work of our employees. 
These were very difficult decisions that unfortunately affected hard-working employees and the communities we serve. Although the decision were difficult, they were absolutely necessary to right size the organization for the realities of the environment we operate in today. 
We also recognize that we need to bring excitement back to the Lowe's experience, and we are making incremental improvements to make our business better. Our near-term focus is on value improvement and product differentiation,, both of which will drive greater asset productivity. Value improvement will ensure that we're getting the lowest inventory acquisition cost by working with our vendor partners to simplify deal structures. We will also rationalize promotions, which will allow us to provide low retail prices everyday. We will also utilize our product assortments ensuring that the right product is in the right market in the right quantity. Product differentiation will establish Lowe's as the place to find the newest and most relevant products for home improvement. These products can be national brands or they can be private brands. 
We're working more closely than ever with our key vendor partners on new product development and new display techniques. In fact, we're in the process of refreshing and establishing drop zones in approximately 1/3 of our chain, highlighting innovation, value, private and national brands and creative idea solutions. This focus will also drive the expansion of line, providing customers a broader assortment of products than we stock in our stores, essentially providing customers an endless aisle. And we expect to have over 260,000 items available online by the end of the year. You'll hear more about our merchandising strategies at our Analyst and Investor Conference on December 5 and 6.
In mid-September, we launched our new brand positioning and advertising campaign Never Stop Improving. This is more than a tagline. It's a mindset for our customers and a rallying cry for our employees. We're committed to constantly innovate and improve in order to satisfy the ever-changing needs of our customers and inspire them to innovate and improve their homes. The brand positioning and advertising campaign are the results of in-depth research showing that consumers are looking for inspiration and motivation. We will lead them through the journey of home improvement from inspiration and planning to execution and enjoyment. 
We are keenly focused on improving our core business while also developing new capabilities and services for the future, and I'm pleased to announce that we launched My Lowe's in mid-October. My Lowe's is a revolutionary new online tool that makes managing, maintaining and improving homes simpler than it's ever been. Customers can create home profiles, save room dimension and favorite colors, organize owner's manuals and product warranty, create shopping to do or wish list for products, projects on the horizon, set reoccurring reminders for common maintenance items and store purchase history from all sales channels. And the capabilities of My Lowe's will grow and evolve over time based on customer and employee feedback. Customers are excited about this very relevant and personalized offering, and we're pleased with early reads on operating metrics.
The ultimate goal of My Lowe's is to consolidate spend that is currently spread across many competitors into Lowe's. We will more deeply penetrate our existing customer base garnering a greater share of wallet, as well as attract new customers with a lower cost of acquisition. You'll hear more about our commitment to deliver better customer experiences, experiences that are simple and optimized across all channels at our Analyst and Investor Conference. 
We've experienced a lot of change in the past 90 days, and disruption is inevitable when changes of this magnitude are made. However, I am confident that the team is more connected than ever and focused on the most impactful enterprise priorities. The team is energized and moving forward on a clear path that is not dependent on an unlikely near-term economic recovery. I would like to thank our hard-working employees for their ongoing dedication and customer focus during a time of significant change. Thanks again for your interest. Rick?"

During my time today, I will review our third quarter performance, as well as discuss some of the recent changes we have made to streamline our core operations and then provide an update on some of the store investments we've discussed earlier this year. 
We finished the third quarter with positive 0.7%. Hurricane Irene contributed roughly 50 basis points to our comp growth as we help customers on the Eastern shore, mid-Atlantic and New England prepare for and cleanup from high winds and flooding. There was particularly strong demand for roofing products, dehumidifiers, pumps and tanks, generators, wet dry vacuums and cleaning supplies. 
Separately, our private brands continue to provide customers with compelling value. Our new line of cobalt power tools combined with our strong national brands drove strong tool comps. Seasonal clearance of patio furniture generated strong seasonal living comps. Unfortunately, it also negatively impacted gross margin. National benefited from consumers buying more energy savings LED bulbs and stockpiling and condensed bulbs in anticipation of federal regulations phasing out 100 watt incandescent bulbs beginning in 2012. 
Large discretionary products remain pressured. Millwork recorded double-digit negative comps with the greatest weakness in entry doors, storm doors and windows. We, last year, benefited from ENERGY STAR tax credits. Cabinets and countertops, appliances and fashion plumbing also recorded negative mid to high single-digit comps in the third quarter. According to third-party measures, cabinets and countertops continue to show strong share gains but not enough to offset the contracting market for these products. 
Within appliances, we chose not to match some competitor's extremely aggressive third quarter percent off promotions. Inventory ended the quarter 5.2% or $447 million higher than the third quarter of last year. This increase was driven by an additional investment in holiday merchandise and the timing of the associated inventory build, as well as the expansion of some product loads. For instance, laminate and tile flooring and LED lamp bulbs. 
Further, last year's demand for winter storm-related items outstripped our supply. So we are more aggressively ramping up for this winter. As a result, we were well prepared to meet customer needs during the recent early winter storm. We expect year-end inventories to be 2% to 3% above last year as we sell through holiday products, reduce replenishment and rationalizing SKUs based on completed with input from our integrated planning and execution tool. 
As Robert mentioned, we have been looking at the organization with a fresh perspective and identifying ways to improve our performance, both in the short and long term. The third quarter saw significant changes to our organizational structure, store base and store and IT infrastructure. This change represents a move towards a leaner, more efficient company, better able to serve the needs of our customers whenever and wherever they shop. Taken together, these changes reflect our focus on protecting retail excellence as we seek to grow share of wallet through our existing store base. 
The new organizational structure is designed to improve speed to market, efficiency and store timing, what I referred to as flexibility within the framework on our first quarter call. By providing the right balance of oversight and assistance in order to empower our store managers to focus on taking care of our customers and driving sales opportunity. 
With the goals in mind, this quarter, we consolidated our store operations from 5 divisions to 3, from 21 regions to 14 and from 188 districts to 132 markets. Likewise, we consolidated our merchandising management from 4 business areas to 2 and from 18 to 16 merchandise divisions.
This reorganization impacted many Lowe's employees who played an integral role in the company's tremendous growth over the last decade, and we thank them for this of dedicated service and significant contributions. For the customer, our new structure should translate to an even better shopping experience. For our employees, their response has already been positive. The online conversation with our employee community portal indicates an overwhelmingly favorable response to these changes.
Disruption is inevitable when making changes of this magnitude. But we minimized them by using a structured and quick decision-making process and a transparent internal communications process to explain what changes were being made, when they were effective, why they were necessary and how they would benefit the company. Following Bob's many product transitions so the August and September timing of the changes was necessary to mitigate potential disruptions. 
The effects on SG&A are neutral this year as lower salary expense is offset by severance. We also announced this quarter the closing of 27 underperforming stores. In 2012, we expect the closing of these stores to add roughly 30 basis points to EBIT and return on invested capital. 
Additionally, after completing the comprehensive review of our pipeline of proposed new stores, we decided to discontinue a number of planned new store projects, and now we expect to open 10 to 15 stores per year in North America from 2012 forward. This is more than a 50% reduction in our expansion plan. In addition to the organization and store changes we discussed, we have been investing in our store systems and the infrastructure in order to enhance system speed and ease-of-use for our associates, providing a better experience for customers and greater productivity in our service model. 
We saw an opportunity to improve our in-store data speed, make our in-store workstations operate more efficiently, provide customers the ability to check prices against competitors and the ability to mitigate with sales associates via e-mail and provide employees with a mobile device that would allow them to better serve customers and beyond. In fact, we realize that doing these things would free up time for our associates to sell projects and serve more customers. 
So I'd like to update you on our progress. We are over 90% complete in upgrading our in-store data capacity. We have updated all of our workstations, including system speed providing better product images and providing a higher productivity through the ability to run both applications at once. We have increased the data capacity of employee mailboxes, in addition to rolling out e-mail to all remaining regular and part-time store employees. Now all regular and part-time employees are able to correspond, particularly with customers by e-mail and share images. Finally, we have rolled out mobile devices based on Apple's iPhone technology to more than 50% of our stores. We expect to complete the rollout by the end of this year. 
Customize store applications allow store employees to scan items, track inventory, print price levels and search for items without ever needing the customer. Further because the applications and operating platform are so intuitive, this is the first piece of technology we have employed to the stores without training manuals. On average, each store has 25 of these devices and is using them instead of walking to a fixed terminal about 400x a day, improving the customer experience and making our employees more productive. The feedback from our stores on all of these upgrades has been highly positive for one simple reason. Associates feel they are better equipped to serve customers. These improvements will also free up time in the stores to serve more customers, and we're taking the opportunity to quickly review our existing store processes in order to eliminate unnecessary activities. To date, we have identified opportunities to repurpose several hundred thousand labor hours from support tasks to directly serving customers. 
We have also just completed the rollout of a labor scheduling system across the United States and Canada. Store employees have responded very well to the enhanced visibility to their work schedules and to self-service features such as electronic time offer. User-friendly screens and steps allow managers to publish their work more efficiently, so they can dedicate our time to customer-facing activities. 
Store management can all learn and use one simple system instead of 3 ones. Further, this tool automate several processes that were previously manual. Early findings indicate that the average store has reduced the time spent on scheduling and timekeeping tasks by 4 hours per week. 
In addition, we are now able to provide weekly detailed payroll performance reports directly to the store and field management teams, which aligns their view of payroll performance and helps them identify efficiency opportunities. As I shared with you some of the important changes we have been making, change is never easy, but these changes provide the operating framework and IT infrastructure for future enhancements to grow share of wallet and to bring more of every dollar to the bottom line. 
Thanks for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our third quarter financial results. Bob?"

Sales for the third quarter were $11.9 billion, which represents a 2.3% increase over last year's third quarter. In Q3, total customer count increased 1.9%, and average ticket increased 0.4% to $61.84. 
Comp sales were positive 0.7% for the quarter. Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 1.4% in August, 0.3% in September, 0.4% in October. For the quarter, comp transactions were up 0.7% while comp average ticket was flat to last year. 
With regards to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the third quarter included building materials, rough plumbing, seasonal living, lawn and landscape products fashion electrical, tools and hardware. In addition, home fashion storage and cleaning and nursery were essentially in line with the company average. We estimate that our proprietary credit value proposition, which offers customers a choice of 5% off everyday or promotional financing positively impacted Q3 comps by 90 basis points. 
Likewise, sales related to Hurricane Irene positively impacted Q3 comps by 60 basis points. Our business continues to be negatively impacted by customers putting big-ticket purchases. During Q3, comps per transaction greater than $500 were negative 0.8% driven by Millwork, appliances and cabinets and countertops. Year-to-date, sales of $38.6 billion represents 0.6% increase over 2010. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 34.6% of sales, a decrease of 99 basis points from last year's third quarter. As a reminder, gross margin increased 85 [ph] basis points in Q3 2010. A decrease in gross margin was driven by number of factors. Our proprietary credit value proposition negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points. In Q3, impact was larger than the 11 basis point impact in Q2 due to the launch of the Commercial program at the end of Q2, as well as an increase in the mix of proprietary credit to total sales. This was more than offset by leverage in tender and other costs associated with our proprietary credit program. I will provide the SG&A and EBIT impacts in a moment. 
Also inflation hurt gross margin in the quarter by 23 basis points driven primarily by paint. During the quarter, higher fuel cost increased cost of sales and negatively impacted gross margin by 13 basis points. In addition, seasonal sell-through both the impact of this year, as well as in comparison to the last year's strong sell-through hurt gross margin by 10 basis points. 
As we've discussed, we are working to lessen our proportional activity and move to an Every Day Low Price philosophy. Actions taken to date negatively impacted gross margin in Q3 by approximately 10 basis points. 
Lastly, of the $336 million in charges related to store closings and discontinued project, $12 million relates to inventory markdowns associated with closed stores, which negatively impacted gross margin by 10 basis points in the quarter. Year-to-date, gross margin of 34.66% of sales represents a decrease of 36 basis points from the first 3 quarters of 2010. In 2010, gross margin increased 18 basis points versus the first 9 months of 2009. 
SG&A for Q3 was 27.27% of sales, which delevered 197 basis points. Biggest driver was asset impairment and other cost associated with store closing and discontinued projects, which totaled $324 million for the quarter. SG&A was also negatively impacted by $32 million, related primarily to asset impairment of operating locations. Together, these items compared to $52 million in expense in last year's third quarter, resulting in 256 basis points of expense deleveraged in Q3 this year. 
Also we experienced approximately 19 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences. The expenses related to the continued buildout of our customer relationship platform, internal and external resource to complete and launch My Lowe's during this quarter and the store infrastructure upgrades. 
During the quarter, expense deleverage 70 basis points as a result of current and threatened litigation matters. In addition, in Q3, we experienced 12 basis points of deleverage associated with rolling out new product differentiation sets. These include, which we expect to be in over 500 stores by year end, updated in approximately 200 top location and plumbing. While it is still early, we are pleased with the results. Leverage and proprietary credit slightly offset these items. 
We experienced 89 basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program. This leverage was driven by a combination of fewer losses, as well as lower promotional financing. In addition, tenant costs were lower as the penetration of proprietary credit decreased [ph] roughly 270 basis points over last year's third quarter to 23.1% of sales. 
For the quarter, bonus expense leveraged 14 basis points due to a lower attainment levels versus plan. Year-to-date SG&A of 24.84% of sales and deleveraged 81 basis points in the first 9 months of 2010. Through 3 quarters, the impact of asset impairment and other cost assisted with store closings and discontinued projects negatively impact SG&A by 103 basis points. 
Depreciation totaled $361 million or 3.05% of sales and leveraged 39 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes or operating margin increased 257 basis points to 3.7% of sales. Year-to-date, operating margin of 6.98% represents a decrease of 89 basis points from 2010. Store closing and asset impairment charges negatively impacted EBIT for the quarter and year-to-date by 266 and 106 basis points, respectively. 
We estimate that our proprietary credit value proposition positively impacted EBIT by 15 [ph] basis points for the quarter. Interest expense at $91 million delevered 8 basis points as a percentage of sales. In the quarter, total expenses were 31.09% of sales and delevered 166 basis points. 
Pretax earnings for the quarter were $352 million or 2.97% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.1%. The rate was lower than expected due to the settlement of certain state tax matters. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.18. Earnings per share impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects was $0.17 for the quarter. 
Now I'd like to comment on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $675 million. As Rick mentioned, our third quarter inventory balance increased $247 million or 5.2% versus last year. Inventory turnovers calculated by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales by an average inventory for the last 5 quarters was 3.6, flat to Q3 2010. Return on assets using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters decreased 31 basis points to 5.24%. 
We estimate that the impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects negatively impacted return on assets by 72 basis points. Next, I'd like to highlight a few items from the liabilities and shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, our accounts payable balance was $5.2 billion or 6% higher than last year. Increase in accounts payable relates to the timing of purchases. 
Our debt to equity ratio was 39.4% compared to 29.5% to Q3 last year. At the end of the quarter, adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.85x. We estimate that without the impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects, that debt to EBITDAR would have been 1.72x. 
Return on invested capital measured using a trailing 4 quarters plus tax adjusted interest divided by adjusted equity for the last 5 quarters decreased 18 basis points to 8.34%. We estimate that the impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects negatively impacted ROIC by 102 basis points. 
I'd like to take a moment to update you on our thinking regarding capital structure. We are increasing our previously stated lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR target from 1.8x to 2.25x, resulting in approximately $3 billion of additional debt capacity, which we expect to fully implement by the end of 2012. We feel this modest increase of leverage appropriately balance liquidity with the opportunity to return by to shareholders while providing sufficient operating and strategic flexibility. 
Our short-term credit ratings likely lowered one notch date A2/P2. In addition, we expect our long term ratings to be lower to A- A3. However, once implemented, the revised structure should reduce our weighted average cost of capital by approximately 50 basis points. We do not anticipate further adjustments to our lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR target for the foreseeable future. 
In addition, last month we successfully renewed our 5-year, $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. This credit facility serves as a backstop to our Commercial paper program. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $3.9 billion, which is up 1.5% versus the first 9 months of 2010. Cash used properties was $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2011 compared with $1 billion for the same period last year. 
As a result, year-to-date free cash flow is just over $2.6 billion. During the quarter, there were no share repurchases. Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed on business outlook. 
We expect fourth quarter total sales to increase by approximately 8% with comp sales estimated to be flat to positive 1%. We estimate that the 53rd week will add to more sales by approximately 7%. Earnings before interest taxes for the fourth quarter are expected to decrease by approximately 50 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. This EBIT outlook includes approximately $10 billion or 10 basis points of additional expenses associated with the previously announced store closings. 
Income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.6% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.23, including additional expenses associated with previously announced store closings. We estimate that the 53rd week will hurt Q4 earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.03. 
For 2011, we're estimating total sales to increase 2% to 3% with comp sales declining by approximately 1%. For the year, we expect to open approximately 26 stores, 2 of which are relocations and close 27 stores resulting in a net reduction of 3 stores. We estimate the 53rd week will increase 2011 sales by roughly 1.5%. 
For the year, we are anticipating EBIT to decrease 80 to 90 basis points. This includes approximately 80 basis points associated with store closings and discontinued projects. For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.4%. These inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.40, which includes approximately $0.20 per share of store closing and discontinued project charges. 
For the year, we are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $4 billion. We've updated our capital expenditures forecast for 2011 and now believe that they will be between $1.9 billion and $2 billion with roughly $100 million funded by operating leases, resulting in a cash capital expenditures between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. This forecast is a bit higher than our plans for the year as we elected to accelerate our store innovation technology infrastructure investment originally planned to be completed in 2012, which will now be completed on the end of this year. We will see a corresponding reduction in our 2012 capital plan. I will share more details on the future CapEx plan at our analyst conference next month. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion for the year. Our outlook does contemplate share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

And in order to do that, we really need to simplify the deal structures that we have with our vendors as part of simplifying the deal is structure is becoming less promotional. So as we are looking at our business in each business is going to be a little different certainly the big-ticket business is as Bob talk to versus what say the hardware business. We are working through a product line review cadence of all of our businesses over the next 12 months, utilizing our integrated planning execution tools that I think we've talked about in the past with a more accelerated process to make sure that we're locally assorted correctly as Robert mentioned in every market, and we're priced right appropriately to the competition in the market. At the same time that we're working to tighten up our lines as it relates to stock product, we are looking to expand our online assortments dramatically. I think Robert referenced the 260,000 items on lowes.com by year end, and we need to continue to grow that so that as customer shops Lowe's depending on the channels they shop, they can take advantage of our growing flexible fulfillment opportunities. And so as we look forward all of this is to improve our ROIC specifically as it relates to margin and timing, the implications are there is going to be margin friction as we go forward into 2012. But we expect by the time to get to the end of next year, we will have addressed 3/4 of our sales through this accelerated process, and the margin benefit of the rationalized cost is more than offset the retail price pressure by the second half of next year."

Specifically for fourth quarter, I think you can think about gross margin performance in Q4 similar to Q3, largely driven by the same factors albeit some of the impact will be different. We expect inflation to be a little bit lower. We expect GDP price impact to be a little bit greater. In addition, we'll take some markdowns as we work to start addressing underperforming inventory and production. As Bob mentioned, there's probably some negative margin pressure in the first half of 2012 flipping to margin improvement beginning second half of '12 and beyond."

As Bob indicated, I know I think it was on the second quarter our conference call that we talked about expanding our list of benchmark items. Once Bob put his improvement team in place in his merchandising organization, they went back and they've taken a number of look at the list of benchmark items so we've been a little bit delayed in rolling that out versus where we anticipated. So that's why kind of the delay that Bob talked about would be able to get a read on that. Certainly, as Bob described to you, not only how we've got this move back to EDLP or if you want to call it EDLP plus because we know there's certain big-ticket categories that you're are going to need to promote at certain times of the year.

All those things we wanted to try and so that way we could then lay out the clear path forward for the organization, get everyone refocused on where we're moving in the future. And a lot of those changes as we've said in our comments are being driven by one, where the customer's going, where the market is going, as Bob Gfeller talked about price transparency is becoming greater and greater everyday. And we think about other channels, Internet and those out there that we compete against as well, we've got to make sure that we're priced competitively everyday across those channels so that long term we're going to be able to provide the value proposition that consumers are looking for no matter what channel they choose to shop on. And that's also why we're trying to continue to expand the Internet, for example, and bring other ways to bear to be able to meet the consumers' needs whether that's transaction projects in-home, if they want to do a major project having a representative in their home whether it's buying online, whether it's buying in-store, whether it's dealing with someone at our contact center to be able to ask a question to be able to transact for that day. So we're trying to certainly approach it on a multi-channel cross-regional basis by having a great cadence to it and amount of changes certainly we understand there were some disruption in the process, and we think that we've now got most of that behind us."

Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results in detail. But first, let me share a summary of our third quarter performance",978,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results in detail. 
But first, let me share a summary of our third quarter performance, as well as how we're thinking about our business going forward. Sales for the quarter increased 2.3% while comparable store sales were positive 0.7%. Comp traffic increased 0.7% in the third quarter, and comp average ticket was flat. Gross margin contracted 99 basis points in the quarter. Bob Hull will provide more details regarding gross margin in a few minutes.
We had good operating expense control in the quarter third quarter, however, as detailed in today's release, we recognized charges related to store closings and discontinued projects, which in aggregate reduced pretax earnings for the quarter by $336 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.17. Including this charge, we delivered earnings per share of $0.18 in the third quarter. Excluding the charge, we delivered earnings per share that exceeded our guidance for the quarter.
As I said before, our performance is not at the level we expect relative to the market or frankly, that we demand of ourselves as we define success, so we're taking action. The executive team is looking at our business from a fresh perspective, and we're evaluating how we operate on a cross-functional basis to ensure consistent and connected execution. 
During the third quarter, we reorganized our store operations and merchandising organizations to improve efficiencies, increase speed to market for new products and services and enhance the shopping experience for customers. We streamlined our field organizational structure, resulting in fewer districts and regions. And we've announced the closing of 27 stores this year that were underperforming despite the tremendous effort and hard work of our employees. 
These were very difficult decisions that, unfortunately, affected hard-working employees in the communities we serve. Although the decision were difficult, they were absolutely necessary to rightsize the organization for the realities of the economic environment we operate in today. 
We also recognized that we need to bring excitement back to the Lowe's experience, and we're making incremental improvements to make our business better. Our near-term focus is on value improvement and product differentiation, both of which will drive greater asset productivity. Value improvement will ensure that we're getting the lowest inventory acquisition cost by working with our vendor partners to simplify deal structures. We will also rationalize promotions, which will allow us to provide low retail prices everyday. We will also localize our product assortments ensuring that the right product is in the right market in the right quantity. 
Product differentiation will establish Lowe's as the place to find the newest and most relevant products for home improvement. These products can be national brands or they can be private brands. We're working more closely than ever with our key vendor partners on new product development and new display techniques. In fact, we're in the process of refreshing end caps and establishing drop zones in approximately 1/3 of our chain, highlighting innovation, value, private and national brands and creative idea solutions. This focus will also drive the expansion of items online, providing customers a broader assortment of products than we stock in our stores, essentially providing customers an endless aisle. And we expect to have over 260,000 items available online by the end of the year. You'll hear more about our merchandising strategies at our Analyst and Investor Conference on December 5 and 6.
In mid-September, we launched our new brand positioning and advertising campaign Never Stop Improving. This is more than a tagline. It's a mindset for our customers and a rallying cry for our employees. We're committed to constantly innovate and improve in order to satisfy the ever-changing needs of our customers and inspire them to innovate and improve their homes. The brand positioning and advertising campaign are the results of in-depth research showing that consumers are looking for inspiration and motivation. We will lead them through the journey of home improvement from inspiration and planning to execution and enjoyment. 
We are keenly focused on improving our core business while also developing new capabilities and services for the future, and I'm pleased to announce that we launched My Lowe's in mid-October. My Lowe's is a revolutionary new online tool that makes managing, maintaining and improving homes simpler than it's ever been. Customers can create home profiles, save room dimensions and paint colors, organize owner's manuals and product warranties, create shopping to do or wish list for products, projects on the horizon, set reoccurring reminders for common maintenance items and store purchase history from all sales channels. And the capabilities of My Lowe's will grow and evolve over time based on customer and employee feedback. Customers are excited about this very relevant and personalized offering, and we're pleased with early reads on operating metrics.
The ultimate goal of My Lowe's is to consolidate spend that is currently spread across many competitors into Lowe's. We will more deeply penetrate our existing customer base garnering a greater share of wallet, as well as attract new customers with a lower cost of acquisition. You'll hear more about our commitment to deliver better customer experiences, experiences that are simple and optimized across all channels at our Analyst and Investor Conference. 
We've experienced a lot of change in the past 90 days and disruption is inevitable when changes of this magnitude are made. However, I am confident that the team is more connected than ever and focused on the most impactful enterprise priorities. The team is energized and moving forward on a clear path that is not dependent on an unlikely near-term economic recovery. I would like to thank our hard-working employees for their ongoing dedication and customer focus during a time of significant change. Thanks again for your interest. Rick?"

During my time today, I will review our third quarter performance, as well as discuss some of the recent changes we have made to streamline our core operations and then provide an update on some of the store investments we discussed earlier this year. 
We finished the third quarter with positive 0.7% of basis point comp, Hurricane Irene contributed roughly 60 basis points to our comp growth as we help customers on the Eastern shore, inland mid-Atlantic and New England prepare for work and cleanup from high winds and flooding. There was particularly strong demand for roofing products, dehumidifiers, pumps and tanks, generators, wet dry vacuums and cleaning supplies. 
Separately, our private brands continue to provide customers with compelling value. Our new line of cobalt power tools combined with our strong national brands drove strong tool comps. Seasonal clearance of patio furniture generated strong seasonal living comps, unfortunately, it also negatively impacted gross margin. [indiscernible] benefited from consumers buying more energy savings LED bulbs and stockpiling incandescent bulbs in anticipation of federal regulations phasing out 100 watt incandescent bulbs beginning in 2012. 
Large discretionary products remain pressured. Millwork recorded double-digit negative comps with the greatest weakness in entry doors, storm doors and windows, which last year benefited from ENERGY STAR tax credits. Cabinets and countertops, appliances and fashion plumbing also recorded negative mid- to high-single digit comps in the third quarter. According to third-party measures, cabinets and countertops continues to show strong share gains, but not enough to offset the contracting market for these products. 
Within appliances, we chose not to match some competitor's extremely aggressive third quarter percent off promotions. Inventories ended the quarter 5.2% or $447 million higher than the third quarter of last year. This increase was driven by an additional investment in holiday merchandise and the timing of the associated inventory build, as well as the expansion of some product lines. For instance, laminate and tile flooring and LED lamp bulbs. 
Further, last year's demand for winter-, storm-related items outstripped our supply. So we are more aggressively ramping up for this winter. As a result, we were well prepared to meet customer needs during the recent early winter storm. We expect year-end inventories to be 2% to 3% above last year as we sell-through holiday products, reduce replenishment and rationalizing SKUs based on line reviews completed with input from our integrated planning and execution tool. 
As Robert mentioned, we have been looking at the organization with a fresh perspective and identifying ways to improve our performance, both in the short and long term. The third quarter saw significant changes to our organizational structure, store base and store and IT infrastructure. This change represents a move towards a leaner, more efficient company, better able to serve the needs of our customers whenever and wherever they shop. Taken together, these changes reflect our focus on protecting retail excellence as we seek to grow share of wallet through our existing store base. 
The new organizational structure is designed to improve speed to market, efficiency and store autonomy, what I referred to is flexibility within the framework on our first quarter call. By providing the right balance of oversight and assistance in order to empower our store managers to focus on taking care of our customers and driving sales opportunity. 
With the goals in mind, this quarter, we consolidated our store operations from 5 divisions to 3, from 21 regions to 14, and from 188 districts to 132 markets. Likewise, we consolidated our merchandising management from 4 business areas to 2 and from 18 to 16 merchandise divisions. 
This reorganization impacted many Lowe's employees who played an integral role in the company's tremendous growth over the last decade, and we thank them for this of dedicated service and significant contributions, for the customer, our new structure should translate to an even better shopping experience. For our employees, their response has already been positive. The online conversation with our employee community portal indicates an overwhelmingly favorable response to these changes.
Disruption is inevitable when making changes of this magnitude. But we minimize them by using a structured and quick decision-making process and a transparent internal communications process to explain what changes were being made, when they were effective, why they were necessary and how they would benefit the company. Following Bob's many product transitions, so the August and September timing of the changes was necessary to mitigate potential disruptions. 
The effects on SG&A are neutral this year as lower salary expense is offset by severance. We also announced this quarter the closing of 27 underperforming stores. In 2012, we expect the closings of these stores to add roughly 30 basis points to EBIT and return on invested capital.  Additionally, after completing the comprehensive review of our pipeline of proposed new stores, we decided to discontinue a number of planned new store projects, and now we expect to open 10 to 15 stores per year in North America from 2012 forward. This is more than a 50% reduction in our expansion plan. 
In addition to the organization and store changes we discussed, we have been investing in our store systems and the infrastructure in order to enhance system speed and ease-of-use for our associates, providing a better experience for customers and greater productivity in our service model. 
We saw an opportunity to improve our in-store data speed, make our in-store workstations operate more efficiently, provide customers the ability to check prices against competitors and the ability to communicate with sales associates via e-mail and provide employees with a mobile device that would allow them to better serve customers in the aisle. In fact, we realized that doing these things would free up time for our associates to sell projects and serve more customers. 
So I'd like to update you on our progress. We are over 90% complete in upgrading our in-store data capacity. We have updated all of our workstations, including system speed, providing better product images and providing a higher productivity through the ability to run multiple applications at once. We have increased the data capacity of employee mailboxes, in addition to rolling out e-mail to all remaining regular and part-time store employees. Now all regular and part-time employees are able to correspond directly with customers by e-mail and share images. 
Finally, we have rolled out mobile devices based on Apple's iPhone technology to more than 60% of our stores. We expect to complete the rollout by the end of this year. Customize store applications allow store employees to scan items, track inventory, print price labels and search for items without ever leaving the customer. Further, because the applications and operating platform are so intuitive, this is the first piece of technology we have deployed to the stores without training manuals. On average, each store has 25 of these devices and is using them instead of walking to a fixed terminal about 400x a day, improving the customer experience and making our employees more productive. 
The feedback from our stores on all of these upgrades has been highly positive for one simple reason. Associates feel they are better equipped to serve customers. These improvements will also free up time in the stores to serve more customers, and we're taking the opportunity to quickly review our existing store processes in order to eliminate unnecessary activities. To date, we have identified opportunities to repurpose several hundred thousand labor hours from support tasks to directly serving customers. 
We have also just completed the rollout of a labor scheduling system across the United States and Canada. Store employees have responded very well to the enhanced visibility to their work schedules and to self-service features such as electronic time-off requests. User-friendly screens and simple steps allow managers to accomplish the work more efficiently, so they can dedicate more time to customer-facing activities. Store management can now all learn and use one simple system instead of 3  antiquated ones. 
Further, this tool automate several processes that were previously manual. Early findings indicate that the average store has reduced the time spent on scheduling and timekeeping tasks by 4 hours per week. In addition, we are now able to provide weekly detailed payroll performance reports directly to the store and field management teams, which aligns their view of payroll performance and helps them identify efficiency opportunities. I have shared with you some of the important changes we have been making. Change is never easy. But these changes provide the operating framework and the IT infrastructure for future enhancements to grow share of wallet and to bring more of every dollar to the bottom line. 
Thanks for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our third quarter financial results. Bob?"

Sales for the third quarter were $11.9 billion, which represents a 2.3% increase over last year's third quarter. In Q3, total customer count increased 1.9%, and average ticket increased 0.4% to $61.84. Comp sales were positive 0.7% for the quarter. Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 1.4% in August, 0.3% in September, 0.4% in October. For the quarter, comp transactions were up 0.7% while comp average ticket was flat to last year. 
With regards to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the third quarter included building materials, rough plumbing, seasonal living, lawn and landscape products, fashion electrical, tools and hardware. In addition, home fashion storage and cleaning and nursery performed essentially in line with the company average. We estimate that our proprietary credit value proposition, which offers customers a choice of 5% off everyday or promotional financing positively impacted Q3 comps by 90 basis points. 
Likewise, we estimate that sales related to Hurricane Irene positively impacted Q3 comps by 60 basis points. Our business continues to be negatively impacted by customers postponing big-ticket purchases. During Q3, comps per transactions greater than $500 were negative 0.8% driven by Millwork, appliances and cabinets and countertops. Year-to-date, sales of $38.6 billion represents 0.6% increase over 2010. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 34.6% of sales, a decrease of 99 basis points from last year's third quarter. As a reminder, gross margin increased 85 basis points in Q3 2010. A decrease in gross margin was driven by number a of factors. Our proprietary credit value proposition negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points. In Q3, the impact was larger than the 11 basis point impact in Q2 due to the launch of the commercial program at the end of Q2, as well as an increase in the mix of proprietary credit to total sales. This was more than offset by leverage in tender and other costs associated with our proprietary credit program. I will provide the SG&A and EBIT impacts in a moment. 
Also, inflation hurt gross margin in the quarter by 23 basis points driven primarily by paint. During the quarter, higher fuel cost increased cost of sales and negatively impacted gross margin by 13 basis points. In addition, seasonal sell-through, both the impact of more counts this year, as well as -- in comparison to the last year's strong sell-through, hurt gross margin by 10 basis points.  As we've discussed, we are working to lessen our promotional activity and move to an Every Day Low Price philosophy. Actions taken to date negatively impacted gross margin in Q3 by approximately 10 basis points. 
Lastly, of the $336 million in charges related to store closings and discontinued project, $12 million relates to inventory markdowns associated with closed stores, which negatively impacted gross margin by 10 basis points in the quarter. Year-to-date, gross margin of 34.66% of sales represent a decrease of 36 basis points from the first 3 quarters of 2010. In 2010, gross margin increased 18 basis points versus the first 9 months of 2009. 
SG&A for Q3 was 27.27% of sales, which delevered 197 basis points. The biggest driver was asset impairment and other cost associated with store closing and discontinued projects, which totaled $324 million for the quarter. SG&A was also negatively impacted by $32 million, related primarily to asset impairment of operating locations. Together, these items compared to $52 million in expense in last year's third quarter, resulting in 256 basis points of expense deleveraged in Q3 this year. 
Also, we experienced approximately 19 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences. The expenses related to the continued build out of our customer relationship platform, internal and external resource to complete and launch My Lowe's during this quarter and the store infrastructure upgrades. 
During the quarter, legal expense deleveraged 17 basis points as a result of current and present litigation matters. In addition, in Q3, we experienced 12 basis points of deleverage associated with rolling out new product differentiation sets. These include end caps and drop zones, which we expect to be in over 500 stores by year end, updated lawn and garden sets in approximately 200 deep South locations and bath display and fashion plumbing. While it is still early, we are pleased with the results. Leverage and proprietary credit in builders slightly offset these items. 
We experienced 89 basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program. This leverage was driven by a combination of fewer losses, as well as lower promotional financing. In addition, tenant costs were lower as the penetration of proprietary credit decreased roughly 270 basis points over last year's third quarter to 23.1% of sales. 
For the quarter, bonus expense leveraged 14 basis points due to a lower attainment levels versus planned. Year-to-date SG&A of 24.84% of sales and deleverage 81 basis points in the first 9 months of 2010. Through 3 quarters, the impact of asset impairment and other cost associated with store closings and discontinued projects negatively impact SG&A by 103 basis points. 
Depreciation totaled $361 million or 3.05% of sales and leveraged 39 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes or operating margin decreased 257 basis points to 3.7% of sales. Year-to-date, operating margin of 6.98% represents a decrease of 89 basis points from 2010. Store closing and asset impairment charges negatively impacted EBIT for the quarter and year-to-date by 266 and 106 basis points, respectively. We estimate that our proprietary credit value proposition positively impacted EBIT by 15 basis points for the quarter. 
Interest expense at $91 million delevered 8 basis points as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, total expenses were 31.09% of sales and delevered 166 basis points. Pretax earnings for the quarter were $352 million or 2.97% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.1%. The rate was lower than expected, due to the settlement of certain state tax matters. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.18. Earnings per share impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects was $0.17 for the quarter. 
Now I'd like to comment on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $675 million. As Rick mentioned, our third quarter inventory balance increased $447 million or 5.2% versus last year. Inventory turnovers calculated by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales with an average inventory for the last 5 quarters was 3.6, flat to Q3 2010. Return on assets driven using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters decreased 31 basis points to 5.24%. We estimate that the impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects negatively impacted return on assets by 72 basis points. 
Next, I'd like to highlight a few items from the liabilities and shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, our accounts payable balance was $5.2 billion or 6% higher than last year. Increase in accounts payable relates to the timing of purchases. Our debt to equity ratio was 39.4% compared to 29.5% to Q3 last year. At the end of the quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.85x. We estimate that without the impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR would have been 1.72x. 
Return on invested capital measured using a trailing 4 quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last 5 quarters decreased 18 basis points to 8.34%. We estimate that the impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects negatively impacted ROIC by 102 basis points. 
I'd like to take a moment to update you on our thinking regarding capital structure. We are increasing our previously stated lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR target from 1.8x to 2.25x, resulting in approximately $3 billion of additional debt capacity, which we expect to fully implement by the end of 2012. We feel this modest increase in leverage appropriately balances liquidity with the opportunity to return value to shareholders while providing sufficient operating and strategic flexibility. 
Our short-term credit ratings likely will be lowered one notch to A2/P2. In addition, we expect our long term ratings to be lowered to A-/A3. However, once implemented, the revised capital structure should reduce our weighted average cost of capital by approximately 50 basis points. We do not anticipate for further adjustments to our lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR target for the foreseeable future. In addition, last month, we successfully renewed our 5-year, $1.75 billion revolving credit facility [indiscernible] in banks. This credit facility serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $3.9 billion, which is up 1.5% versus the first 9 months of 2010. Cash used in quarters [ph] $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2011 compared with $1 billion for the same period last year. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow is just over $2.6 billion. During the quarter, there were no share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed on business outlook. We expect fourth quarter total sales to increase by approximately 8% with comp sales estimated to be flat to positive 1%. We estimate that the 53rd week will aid Q4 sales by approximately 7%. Earnings before interest taxes for the fourth quarter are expected to decrease by approximately 50 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. This EBIT outlook includes approximately $10 billion or 10 basis points of additional expenses associated with the previously announced store closings. 
Income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.6% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.23, including additional expenses associated with previously announced store closings. We estimate that the 53rd week will aid Q4 earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.03. 
For 2011, we're estimating total sales to increase of 2% to 3% with comp sales declining by approximately 1%. For the year, we expect to open approximately 26 stores, 2 of which are relocations and close 27 stores resulting in a net reduction of 3 stores. We estimate the 53rd week will increase 2011 sales by roughly 1.5%. 
For the year, we are anticipating EBIT to decrease 80 to 90 basis points. This includes approximately 80 basis points associated with store closings and discontinued projects. For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.4%. The sales of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.40, which includes approximately $0.20 per share of store closing and discontinued project charges. 
For the year, we are forecasting cash flow from operation to be approximately $4 billion. We've updated our capital expenditures forecast for 2011 and now believe that they will be between $1.9 billion and $2 billion with roughly $100 million funded by operating leases, resulting in a cash capital expenditures between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. This forecast is a bit higher than our plans for the year as we elected to accelerate our store innovation technology infrastructure investment, originally planned to be completed in 2012, which will now be completed on the end of this year. We will see a corresponding reduction in our 2012 capital plan. I will share more details on the future CapEx plan at our Analyst Conference next month. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow cash flow to $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion for the year. Our outlook does contemplate share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Regina, we are now ready for questions."

And as we look at being competitive everyday, there is price transparency in the marketplace for the customer. And we've got to make sure, therefore, that whatever channel the customer desires to search products at Lowe's, we're priced competitively. In order to be priced competitively, we've got to make sure that working with our vendors we have the lowest possible acquisition costs. And in order to do that, we really need to simplify the deal structures that we have with our vendors, and part of simplifying the deal is structure is to become less promotional. So as we are looking at our business and each business is going to be a little different certainly the big-ticket businesses that Bob talked to versus, let's say, the hardware business. We are working through a product line review cadence of all of our businesses over the next 12 months, utilizing our integrated planning and execution tools that I think we've talked about in the past with a more accelerated process to make sure that we're locally assorted correctly as Robert mentioned in every market, and we're priced right appropriately to the competition in the market. At the same time that we're working to tighten up our lines as it relates to stock product, we are looking to expand our online assortments dramatically. I think Robert referenced the 260,000 items on lowes.com by year end, and we need to continue to grow that so that as the customer shops Lowe's, again, depending on the channels they shop, they can take advantage of our growing flexible fulfillment capabilities. And so as we look forward all of this is to improve our ROIC specifically, as it relates to margin and timing. The implications are there is going to be margin friction as we go forward into 2012, but we expect by the time we get to the end of next year, we will have addressed 3/4 of our sales through this accelerated process, and the margin benefit of the rationalized cost should more than offset the retail price pressure by the second half of next year."

There's got to be some amount of disruption associated with that. That was part of the reason that we tried to consolidate all of these changes and form together and execute them as quickly as we could, be it the change in the span of control in the field organization, the changes that were done here, for example, in Bob Gfeller's area in merchandising going ahead and getting the necessary store closings behind us, the new approach to moving back to EDLP. All those things we wanted to try and so that way we could then lay out the clear path forward for the organization, get everyone refocused on where we're moving in the future. And a lot of those changes as we've said in our comments, were being driven by one, where the customer's going, where the market is going. As Bob Gfeller talked about price transparency is becoming greater and greater everyday. And we think about other channels, Internet and those out there that we compete against as well. We've got to make sure that we're priced competitively everyday across those channels so that long term, we're going to be able to provide the value proposition that consumers are looking for no matter what channel they choose to shop on. And that's also, while we're trying to continue to expand the Internet, for example, and bring other ways to bear to be able to meet the consumers' needs whether that's transaction projects in-home, if they want to do a major project and having a representatives in their home whether it's buying online, whether it's buying in store, whether it's dealing with someone at our contact center to be able to ask a question, to be able to transact for that day.

Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance, and Bob Hull will review our financial results in detail. 
But first, let me share a summary of our third quarter performance, as well as how we're thinking about our business going forward. Sales for the quarter increased 2.3% while comparable store sales were positive 0.7%. Comp traffic increased 0.7% in the third quarter, and comp average ticket was flat. Gross margin contracted 99 basis points in the quarter. Bob Hull will provide more details regarding gross margin in a few minutes.
We had good operating expense control in the quarter third quarter, however, as detailed in today's release, we recognized charges related to store closings and discontinued projects, which in aggregate reduced pretax earnings for the quarter by $336 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.17. Including this charge, we delivered earnings per share of $0.18 in the third quarter. Excluding the charge, we delivered earnings per share that exceeded our guidance for the quarter.
As I said before, our performance is not at the level we expect relative to the market or, frankly, that we demand of ourselves as we define success, so we're taking action. The executive team is looking at our business from a fresh perspective, and we're evaluating how we operate on a cross-functional basis to ensure consistent and connected execution. 
During the third quarter, we reorganized our store operations and merchandising organizations to improve efficiencies, increase speed to market for new products and services and enhance the shopping experience for customers. We streamlined our field organizational structure, resulting in fewer districts and regions. And we've announced the closing of 27 stores this year that were underperforming despite the tremendous effort and hard work of our employees. 
These were very difficult decisions that, unfortunately, affected hard-working employees in the communities we serve. Although the decisions were difficult, they were absolutely necessary to rightsize the organization for the realities of the economic environment we operate in today. 
We also recognized that we need to bring excitement back to the Lowe's experience, and we're making incremental improvements to make our business better. Our near-term focus is on value improvement and product differentiation, both of which will drive greater asset productivity. Value improvement will ensure that we're getting the lowest inventory acquisition cost by working with our vendor partners to simplify deal structures. We will also rationalize promotions, which will allow us to provide low retail prices every day. We will also localize our product assortments ensuring that the right product is in the right market in the right quantity. 
Product differentiation will establish Lowe's as the place to find the newest and most relevant products for home improvement. These products can be national brands or they can be private brands. We're working more closely than ever with our key vendor partners on new product development and new display techniques. In fact, we're in the process of refreshing end caps and establishing drop zones in approximately 1/3 of our chain, highlighting innovation, value, private and national brands and creative idea solutions. This focus will also drive the expansion of items online, providing customers a broader assortment of products than we stock in our stores, essentially providing customers an endless aisle. And we expect to have over 260,000 items available online by the end of the year. You'll hear more about our merchandising strategies at our Analyst and Investor Conference on December 5 and 6.
In mid-September, we launched our new brand positioning and advertising campaign Never Stop Improving. This is more than a tagline. It's a mindset for our customers and a rallying cry for our employees. We're committed to constantly innovate and improve in order to satisfy the ever-changing needs of our customers and inspire them to innovate and improve their homes. The brand positioning and advertising campaign are the results of in-depth research showing that consumers are looking for inspiration and motivation. We will lead them through the journey of home improvement from inspiration and planning to execution and enjoyment. 
We are keenly focused on improving our core business while also developing new capabilities and services for the future, and I'm pleased to announce that we launched My Lowe's in mid-October. My Lowe's is a revolutionary new online tool that makes managing, maintaining and improving homes simpler than it's ever been. Customers can create home profiles, save room dimensions and paint colors, organize owner's manuals and product warranties, create shopping to do or wish list for products, projects on the horizon, set reoccurring reminders for common maintenance items and store purchase history from all sales channels. And the capabilities of My Lowe's will grow and evolve over time based on customer and employee feedback. Customers are excited about this very relevant and personalized offering, and we're pleased with early reads on operating metrics.
The ultimate goal of My Lowe's is to consolidate spend that is currently spread across many competitors into Lowe's. We will more deeply penetrate our existing customer base garnering a greater share of wallet, as well as attract new customers with a lower cost of acquisition. You'll hear more about our commitment to deliver better customer experiences, experiences that are simple and optimized across all channels at our Analyst and Investor Conference. 
We've experienced a lot of change in the past 90 days and disruption is inevitable when changes of this magnitude are made. However, I am confident that the team is more connected than ever and focused on the most impactful enterprise priorities. The team is energized and moving forward on a clear path that is not dependent on an unlikely near-term economic recovery. 
I would like to thank our hard-working employees for their ongoing dedication and customer focus during a time of significant change. Thanks again for your interest. Rick?"

During my time today, I will review our third quarter performance, as well as discuss some of the recent changes we have made to streamline our core operations and then provide an update on some of the store investments we discussed earlier this year. 
We finished the third quarter with positive 0.7% of basis point comp, Hurricane Irene contributed roughly 60 basis points to our comp growth as we help customers on the Eastern shore, inland mid-Atlantic and New England prepare for work and cleanup from high winds and flooding. There was particularly strong demand for roofing products, dehumidifiers, pumps and tanks, generators, wet dry vacuums and cleaning supplies. 
Separately, our private brands continue to provide customers with compelling value. Our new line of cobalt power tools combined with our strong national brands drove strong tool comps. Seasonal clearance of patio furniture generated strong seasonal living comps, unfortunately, it also negatively impacted gross margin. [indiscernible] benefited from consumers buying more energy savings LED bulbs and stockpiling incandescent bulbs in anticipation of federal regulations phasing out 100 watt incandescent bulbs beginning in 2012. 
Large discretionary products remain pressured. Millwork recorded double-digit negative comps with the greatest weakness in entry doors, storm doors and windows, which last year benefited from ENERGY STAR tax credits. Cabinets and countertops, appliances and fashion plumbing also recorded negative mid- to high-single digit comps in the third quarter. According to third-party measures, cabinets and countertops continues to show strong share gains, but not enough to offset the contracting market for these products. 
Within appliances, we chose not to match some competitor's extremely aggressive third quarter percent off promotions. Inventories ended the quarter 5.2% or $447 million higher than the third quarter of last year. This increase was driven by an additional investment in holiday merchandise and the timing of the associated inventory build, as well as the expansion of some product lines. For instance, laminate and tile flooring and LED lamp bulbs. 
Further, last year's demand for winter-, storm-related items outstripped our supply. So we are more aggressively ramping up for this winter. As a result, we were well prepared to meet customer needs during the recent early winter storm. We expect year-end inventories to be 2% to 3% above last year as we sell-through holiday products, reduce replenishment and rationalizing SKUs based on line reviews completed with input from our integrated planning and execution tool. 
As Robert mentioned, we have been looking at the organization with a fresh perspective and identifying ways to improve our performance, both in the short and long term. The third quarter saw significant changes to our organizational structure, store base and store and IT infrastructure. Each change represents a move towards a leaner, more efficient company, better able to serve the needs of our customers whenever and wherever they shop. Taken together, these changes reflect our focus on protecting retail excellence as we seek to grow share of wallet through our existing store base. 
The new organizational structure is designed to improve speed to market, efficiency and store autonomy, what I referred to is flexibility within the framework on our first quarter call. By providing the right balance of oversight and assistance in order to empower our store managers to focus on taking care of our customers and driving sales opportunity. 
With the goals in mind, this quarter, we consolidated our store operations from 5 divisions to 3, from 21 regions to 14, and from 188 districts to 132 markets. Likewise, we consolidated our merchandising management from 4 business areas to 2 and from 18 to 16 merchandise divisions. 
This reorganization impacted many Lowe's employees who played an integral role in the company's tremendous growth over the last decade, and we thank them for this of dedicated service and significant contributions. 
For the customer, our new structure should translate to an even better shopping experience. For our employees, their response has already been positive. The online conversation with our employee community portal indicates an overwhelmingly favorable response to these changes.
Disruption is inevitable when making changes of this magnitude. But we minimize them by using a structured and quick decision-making process and a transparent internal communications process to explain what changes were being made, when they were effective, why they were necessary and how they would benefit the company. Following Bob's many product transitions, so the August and September timing of the changes was necessary to mitigate potential disruptions. 
The effects on SG&A are neutral this year as lower salary expense is offset by severance. We also announced this quarter the closing of 27 underperforming stores. In 2012, we expect the closings of these stores to add roughly 30 basis points to EBIT and return on invested capital.  Additionally, after completing the comprehensive review of our pipeline of proposed new stores, we decided to discontinue a number of planned new store projects, and now we expect to open 10 to 15 stores per year in North America from 2012 forward. This is more than a 50% reduction in our expansion plan. 
In addition to the organization and store changes we discussed, we have been investing in our store systems and the infrastructure in order to enhance system speed and ease-of-use for our associates, providing a better experience for customers and greater productivity in our service model. 
We saw an opportunity to improve our in-store data speeds, make our in-store workstations operate more efficiently, provide customers the ability to check prices against competitors and the ability to communicate with sales associates via e-mail and provide employees with a mobile device that would allow them to better serve customers in the aisle. In fact, we realized that doing these things would free up time for our associates to sell projects and serve more customers. 
So I'd like to update you on our progress. We are over 90% complete in upgrading our in-store data capacity. We have updated all of our workstations, including system speed, providing better product images and providing a higher productivity through the ability to run multiple applications at once. We have increased the data capacity of employee mailboxes, in addition to rolling out e-mail to all remaining regular and part-time store employees. Now all regular and part-time employees are able to correspond directly with customers by e-mail and share images. 
Finally, we have rolled out mobile devices based on Apple's iPhone technology to more than 60% of our stores. We expect to complete the rollout by the end of this year. Customize store applications allow store employees to scan items, track inventory, print price labels and search for items without ever leaving the customer. Further, because the applications and operating platform are so intuitive, this is the first piece of technology we have deployed to the stores without training manuals. On average, each store has 25 of these devices and is using them instead of walking to a fixed terminal about 400x a day, improving the customer experience and making our employees more productive. 
The feedback from our stores on all of these upgrades has been highly positive for one simple reason. Associates feel they are better equipped to serve customers. These improvements will also free up time in the stores to serve more customers, and we're taking the opportunity to quickly review our existing store processes in order to eliminate unnecessary activities. To date, we have identified opportunities to repurpose several hundred thousand labor hours from support tasks to directly serving customers. 
We have also just completed the rollout of a labor scheduling system across the United States and Canada. Store employees have responded very well to the enhanced visibility to their work schedules and to self-service features such as electronic time-off requests. User-friendly screens and simple steps allow managers to accomplish the work more efficiently, so they can dedicate more time to customer-facing activities. Store management can now all learn and use one simple system instead of 3  antiquated ones. 
Further, this tool automate several processes that were previously manual. Early findings indicate that the average store has reduced the time spent on scheduling and timekeeping tasks by 4 hours per week. In addition, we are now able to provide weekly detailed payroll performance reports directly to the store and field management teams, which aligns their view of payroll performance and helps them identify efficiency opportunities. 
I have shared with you some of the important changes we have been making. Change is never easy. But these changes provide the operating framework and the IT infrastructure for future enhancements to grow share of wallet and to bring more of every dollar to the bottom line. 
Thanks for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our third quarter financial results. Bob?"
180871,142587372,191766,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2011",2011-11-14,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $11.9 billion, which represents a 2.3% increase over last year's third quarter. In Q3, total customer count increased 1.9%, and average ticket increased 0.4% to $61.84. Comp sales",1955,"Thanks, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $11.9 billion, which represents a 2.3% increase over last year's third quarter. In Q3, total customer count increased 1.9%, and average ticket increased 0.4% to $61.84. Comp sales were positive 0.7% for the quarter. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 1.4% in August, 0.3% in September, 0.4% in October. For the quarter, comp transactions were up 0.7% while comp average ticket was flat to last year. 
With regards to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the third quarter included building materials, rough plumbing, seasonal living, lawn and landscape products, fashion electrical, tools and hardware. In addition, home fashion storage and cleaning and nursery performed, essentially, in line with the company average. We estimate that our proprietary credit value proposition, which offers customers a choice of 5% off every day or promotional financing positively impacted Q3 comps by 90 basis points. 
Likewise, we estimate that sales related to Hurricane Irene positively impacted Q3 comps by 60 basis points. Our business continues to be negatively impacted by customers postponing big-ticket purchases. During Q3, comps per transactions greater than $500 were negative 0.8% driven by Millwork, appliances and cabinets and countertops. Year-to-date, sales of $38.6 billion represents 0.6% increase over 2010. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 34.6% of sales, a decrease of 99 basis points from last year's third quarter. As a reminder, gross margin increased 85 basis points in Q3 2010. A decrease in gross margin was driven by a number of factors. Our proprietary credit value proposition negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points. In Q3, the impact was larger than the 11 basis point impact in Q2 due to the launch of the commercial program at the end of Q2, as well as an increase in the mix of proprietary credit to total sales. This was more than offset by leverage in tender and other costs associated with our proprietary credit program. I will provide the SG&A and EBIT impacts in a moment. 
Also, inflation hurt gross margin in the quarter by 23 basis points driven primarily by paint. During the quarter, higher fuel cost increased cost of sales and negatively impacted gross margin by 13 basis points. In addition, seasonal sell-through, both the impact of more counts this year, as well as -- in comparison to the last year's strong sell-through, hurt gross margin by 10 basis points.  As we've discussed, we are working to lessen our promotional activity and move to an Every Day Low Price philosophy. Actions taken to date negatively impacted gross margin in Q3 by approximately 10 basis points. 
Lastly, of the $336 million in charges related to store closings and discontinued project, $12 million relates to inventory markdowns associated with closed stores, which negatively impacted gross margin by 10 basis points in the quarter. Year-to-date, gross margin of 34.66% of sales represent a decrease of 36 basis points from the first 3 quarters of 2010. In 2010, gross margin increased 18 basis points versus the first 9 months of 2009. 
SG&A for Q3 was 27.27% of sales, which delevered 197 basis points. The biggest driver was asset impairment and other cost associated with store closing and discontinued projects, which totaled $324 million for the quarter. SG&A was also negatively impacted by $32 million, related primarily to asset impairment of operating locations. Together, these items compared to $52 million in expense in last year's third quarter, resulting in 256 basis points of expense deleveraged in Q3 this year. 
Also, we experienced approximately 19 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences. The expenses related to the continued build out of our customer relationship platform, internal and external resource to complete and launch My Lowe's during this quarter and the store infrastructure upgrades. 
During the quarter, legal expense deleveraged 17 basis points as a result of current and present litigation matters. In addition, in Q3, we experienced 12 basis points of deleverage associated with rolling out new product differentiation sets. These include end caps and drop zones, which we expect to be in over 500 stores by year end, updated lawn and garden sets in approximately 200 deep South locations and bath display and fashion plumbing. While it is still early, we are pleased with the results. Leverage and proprietary credit in builders slightly offset these items. 
We experienced 89 basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program. This leverage was driven by a combination of fewer losses, as well as lower promotional financing. In addition, tenant costs were lower as the penetration of proprietary credit decreased roughly 270 basis points over last year's third quarter to 23.1% of sales. 
For the quarter, bonus expense leveraged 14 basis points due to a lower attainment levels versus planned. Year-to-date SG&A of 24.84% of sales and deleverage 81 basis points in the first 9 months of 2010. Through 3 quarters, the impact of asset impairment and other cost associated with store closings and discontinued projects negatively impacted SG&A by 103 basis points. 
Depreciation totaled $361 million or 3.05% of sales and leveraged 39 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes or operating margin decreased 257 basis points to 3.7% of sales. Year-to-date, operating margin of 6.98% represents a decrease of 89 basis points from 2010. Store closing and asset impairment charges negatively impacted EBIT for the quarter and year-to-date by 266 and 106 basis points, respectively. We estimate that our proprietary credit value proposition positively impacted EBIT by 15 basis points for the quarter. 
Interest expense at $91 million delevered 8 basis points as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, total expenses were 31.09% of sales and delevered 166 basis points. Pretax earnings for the quarter were $352 million or 2.97% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.1%. The rate was lower than expected, due to the settlement of certain state tax matters. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.18. Earnings per share impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects was $0.17 for the quarter. 
Now I'd like to comment on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $675 million. As Rick mentioned, our third quarter inventory balance increased $447 million or 5.2% versus last year. Inventory turnovers calculated by taking a trailing 4 quarters cost of sales with an average inventory for the last 5 quarters was 3.6, flat to Q3 2010. Return on assets driven using a trailing 4 quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last 5 quarters decreased 31 basis points to 5.24%. We estimate that the impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects negatively impacted return on assets by 72 basis points. 
Next, I'd like to highlight a few items from the liabilities and shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, our accounts payable balance was $5.2 billion or 6% higher than last year. Increase in accounts payable relates to the timing of purchases. Our debt to equity ratio was 39.4% compared to 29.5% to Q3 last year. At the end of the quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.85x. We estimate that without the impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR would have been 1.72x. 
Return on invested capital measured using a trailing 4 quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last 5 quarters decreased 18 basis points to 8.34%. We estimate that the impact of charges for store closing and discontinued projects negatively impacted ROIC by 102 basis points. 
I'd like to take a moment to update you on our thinking regarding capital structure. We are increasing our previously stated lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR target from 1.8x to 2.25x, resulting in approximately $3 billion of additional debt capacity, which we expect to fully implement by the end of 2012. We feel this modest increase in leverage appropriately balances liquidity with the opportunity to return value to shareholders while providing sufficient operating and strategic flexibility. 
Our short-term credit ratings likely will be lowered one notch to A2/P2. In addition, we expect our long term ratings to be lowered to A-/A3. However, once implemented, the revised capital structure should reduce our weighted average cost of capital by approximately 50 basis points. We do not anticipate further adjustments to our lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR target for the foreseeable future. 
In addition, last month, we successfully renewed our 5-year, $1.75 billion revolving credit facility [indiscernible] in banks. This credit facility serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $3.9 billion, which is up 1.5% versus the first 9 months of 2010. Cash used [indiscernible] $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2011 compared with $1 billion for the same period last year. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow is just over $2.6 billion. During the quarter, there were no share repurchases. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed on business outlook. We expect fourth quarter total sales to increase by approximately 8% with comp sales estimated to be flat to positive 1%. We estimate that the 53rd week will aid Q4 sales by approximately 7%. Earnings before interest taxes for the fourth quarter are expected to decrease by approximately 50 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. This EBIT outlook includes approximately $10 billion or 10 basis points of additional expenses associated with the previously announced store closings. 
Income tax rate is forecasted to be 37.6% for the quarter. We expect earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.23, including additional expenses associated with previously announced store closings. We estimate that the 53rd week will aid Q4 earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.03. 
For 2011, we're estimating total sales to increase of 2% to 3% with comp sales declining by approximately 1%. For the year, we expect to open approximately 26 stores, 2 of which are relocations, and close 27 stores resulting in a net reduction of 3 stores. We estimate the 53rd week will increase 2011 sales by roughly 1.5%. 
For the year, we are anticipating EBIT to decrease 80 to 90 basis points. This includes approximately 80 basis points associated with store closings and discontinued projects. For the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.4%. The sales of these inputs should yield earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.40, which includes approximately $0.20 per share of store closing and discontinued project charges. 
For the year, we are forecasting cash flow from operation to be approximately $4 billion. We've updated our capital expenditures forecast for 2011 and now believe that they will be between $1.9 billion and $2 billion with roughly $100 million funded by operating leases, resulting in a cash capital expenditures between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. This forecast is a bit higher than our plans for the year as we elected to accelerate our store innovation technology infrastructure investment, originally planned to be completed in 2012, which will now be completed on the end of this year. We will see a corresponding reduction in our 2012 capital plan. I will share more details on the future CapEx plan at our Analyst Conference next month. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow cash flow to $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion for the year. Our outlook does contemplate share repurchases in the fourth quarter. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

And as we look at being competitive every day, there is price transparency in the marketplace for the customer. And we've got to make sure, therefore, that whatever channel the customer desires to search products at Lowe's, we're priced competitively. In order to be priced competitively, we've got to make sure that working with our vendors we have the lowest possible acquisition costs. And in order to do that, we really need to simplify the deal structures that we have with our vendors, and part of simplifying the deal is structure is to become less promotional. So as we are looking at our business, and each business is going to be a little different, certainly the big-ticket businesses that Bob talked to versus, let's say, the hardware business. We are working through a product line review cadence of all of our businesses over the next 12 months, utilizing our integrated planning and execution tools that I think we've talked about in the past with a more accelerated process to make sure that we're locally assorted correctly, as Robert mentioned, in every market, and we're priced right appropriately to the competition in the market. At the same time that we're working to tighten up our lines as it relates to stock product, we are looking to expand our online assortments dramatically. I think Robert referenced the 260,000 items on lowes.com by year end, and we need to continue to grow that so that as the customer shops Lowe's, again, depending on the channels they shop, they can take advantage of our growing flexible fulfillment capabilities. And so as we look forward all of this is to improve our ROIC, specifically as it relates to margin and timing. The implications are there is going to be margin friction as we go forward into 2012, but we expect by the time we get to the end of next year, we will have addressed 3/4 of our sales through this accelerated process, and the margin benefit of the rationalized cost should more than offset the retail price pressure by the second half of next year."

We expect inflation to be a little bit lower. We expect EDLP price reduction impact to be a little bit greater. In addition, we'll take some markdowns as we work to start addressing underperforming inventory and SKU reduction. As Bob mentioned, there's probably some negative margin pressure in the first half of 2012 flipping to margin improvement beginning second half of '12 and beyond."

Once Bob put his value improvement team in place in his merchandising organization, they went back and they've taken another look at the list of benchmark items. So we've been a little bit delayed in rolling that out versus where we anticipated. So that's why kind of the delay that Bob talked about with being able to get a read on that. Certainly, as Bob described to you, not only are we -- have got this move back to EDLP, or if you want to call it EDLP plus, because we know there are certain big-ticket categories that you're going to need to promote at certain times of the year. And it's a cadence that we're going through now, as Bob is going through his line review process to get the pricing right and really trying to balance the price and promotion cadence that we have, and trying to make sure that we're doing it in a way where the customer is going to give us credit for that. So Bob and his team are being very disciplined in that process. As we go through it, we're reading what we're seeing and we'll make necessary adjustments along the way.

I think when you look at the significant amount of change that we put the organization through, any time you have that level of change there's got to be some amount of disruption associated with that. That was part of the reason that we tried to consolidate all of these changes and form together and execute them as quickly as we could, be it the change in the span of control in the field organization, the changes that were done here, for example, in Bob Gfeller's area in merchandising, going ahead and getting the necessary store closings behind us, the new approach to moving back to EDLP. All those things we wanted to try, and so that way we could then lay out the clear path forward for the organization, get everyone refocused on where we're moving in the future. And a lot of those changes, as we've said in our comments, are being driven by, one, where the customer's going, where the market is going. As Bob Gfeller talked about, price transparency is becoming greater and greater every day. And we think about other channels, Internet and those out there that we compete against as well, we've got to make sure that we're priced competitively every day across those channels so that long term, we're going to be able to provide the value proposition that consumers are looking for no matter what channel they choose to shop on. And that's also, while we're trying to continue to expand the Internet, for example, and bring other ways in to bear to be able to meet the consumers' needs, whether that's transaction projects in-home, if they want to do a major project and having a representatives in their home, whether it's buying online, whether it's buying in store, whether it's dealing with someone at our contact center to be able to ask a question, to be able to transact for that day. So we're trying to certainly approach it on a multi-channel, cross-functional basis and have a great cadence to it. But in the amount of changes, certainly, we understand that there were some disruption in the process, and we think that we've now gotten most of that behind us."
