Our fourth quarter with an extremely strong finished on a fantastic year. and let me begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter was 29% from the year ago of $457 million. For the full year, we delivered approximately $1.66 billion, an increase of 27% from fiscal year '10, and we exited the year with an annual revenue run rate that now exceeds $1.8 billion. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.31 rose 3% from the year-ago period even as we accelerated our investment in us key areas of growth. We are to for cash flow in the quarter delivered approximately $170 million in operating cash, an increase of more than 80% year-over-year. For the full year, operating cash flow rose approximately 70% to roughly $460 million or 28% of revenue in fiscal year '11.
Our multi-products flooded just really taking off. Not only was Q4 the best quarter in our history, we also saw more business each of our sales, service, collaboration and platform Cloud than ever before. 
In The fourth quarter alone, we signed eight-figure transactions, including our largest deal ever at more than 30 deals. All sold we added approximately 5,100 net new customers in the quarter excluding customers from, taking our global customer community to more than 92,300. 
For the full year, we added approximately 20,000 net new customers and more than 1 million net new subscribers. We now have a global community of more than 3 million net gains subscribers.
Given strong Q4 demand and a strong pipeline of new business, we're pleased to be able to raise revenue guidance of $2.03 billion to $2.05 billion for fiscal year '12. This will make Salesforce.com the first enterprise cloud-computing company to generate more than $2 billion in revenue by the end of this year. 
As you know, we kicked off the fourth quarter with an amazing Dreamforce more than 23,000 customers, partners and developers attended our eighth annual event. I have to tell you I'm very, truly a testament to how our strategic vision our customers to Salesforce.com in their enterprises.
We're our customers path for the next phase of cloud computing with recall cloud 2. Cloud 2 is a new paradigm for computing that is inherently social, mobile and open. It redefines teams, pushes out information, real time and works with revolutionary devices, including iPad, of all, Blackberry and smart phone including Android. Salesforce.com is leading effort to bring Cloud 2 and fusing everything we offer to customers with the social collaboration from a mobility and openness that are the hallmark of this brave new world.
As you know, Chatter is at the heart of our efforts to get enterprise it to Cloud 2. we See the social computing as a strategic new enterprise category, which is why this year, you've seen us deliver Chatter, Chatter Plus, Chatter Mobile, Chatter Free and at the Super Bowl, Chatter.com. And leveraging the social features popularized by Facebook and Twitter such as Profiles, status update in real time feeds, Chatter provide a private and secure corporate social network for companies of all sizes. And because it is at the core to the Force.com platform, it's social capabilities are an integral part of every Salesforce product. 
Today, you can sign up directly at Chatter.com. And all Chatter customers can upgrade with a single button to our full range of services. 
Today, more than 80,000 of our 92,300 paying customers have deployed Chatter since its release in June. This make Salesforce.com the largest provider of enterprise social networks in the world. And now would Chatter.com, the free environment version of the service were looking to reduce the power of the cloud to employees at every company around the world. 
We've already added more than 10,000 new networks since introducing Chatter.com in our first-ever Super Bowl ad only a few weeks ago to get the momentum going. Our Super Bowl that marks a milestone at how enterprise software companies could accelerate important services and brands like Chatter.com.
New Chatter deployments in the fourth quarter included Analog Devices, AVL, Citrix, Epson McAfee and 3M. Customers also deployed Chatter into new departments and functions across the enterprise companies purchasing additional subscriptions to Chatter included BSkyB, Sony, Trend Micro and Wachovia. In addition, some bug look at what Chatter across the entire press, replacing its existing social network just as they'll did before them. Both are now standardized enterprise-wide on Salesforce's Chatter.
Customers using Chatter tell us that they're thrilled with a productivity gains of the open communication and France to their organization. In a recent survey, we commissioned more than 6,000 global Salesforce.com customers. Users reported 28%, 33% less email and a 49% increase in finding information after deploying Chatter. Those are amazing statistics. 
Customers that have deployed Chatter within our sales and service clouds also have shown higher log in rates and higher usage rates as their employee spend more time and do more work within our applications. These are amazing results from a technology that is literally religious months old. We are so delighted to see such strong results from the Chatter technology.
Our customer momentum was powered by our flagship Sales Cloud, which added more new business in Q4 than in any quarter in our history. Customers buy new or additional subscription to the Sales Cloud included Groupon, Juniper Networks, Staples and Tyco Health Care group. against oracle, we want significant new or add-on business is quarter with such as AT&T, Citi, Telefonica, and Xerox. And companies also prefer our Sales Cloud over Microsoft CRM, which is thought that kept pace with the social, mobile and open technologies the rest of the world has embraced and offers customers no competitive advantage. 
Q4 wins against Microsoft include Abbott, Gannett, Hilton and scripts. We also saw strong momentum in our Service Cloud, which racked up record new business. Approximately 15,000 companies no use our service club us to look for ways to deliver their customers both against traditional to new service channels, including social media, the web, email and telephone. Major wins are expansions of the Service Cloud include Huntington, Net Assets, NTT, Thomson Reuters and Walden. 
In addition, we see momentum building in a platform of the service category as companies demand more social, mobile and open applications to serve their employees and customers. We have the only platform for building quality applications that is trusted, Rubin solution for enterprise. and with our strategic news 2011 can multiply strategy in the last 90 days, we believe Force.com is positioned to be long-term leader in the platform as a service category.
we introduced our revolutionary database.com the first enterprise database built to the cloud, which allows developers to write apps at any language on any platform for any device. We also acquired the leading platform in the service for writing apps in Ruby on Rails. And now developers have the freedom to use any Ruby app for writing social and mobile cloud apps, Job are our for creating sophisticated enterprise of VMforce apex for building native apps on Force.com. 
And Force.com achieved some truly impressive milestones. This year, we attracted an additional 100,000 developers creating a global concern community of 340,000 developers writing on the Salesforce.com platform. And I'm excited to tell you today, that as of today, developers have now more than 1 billion lines of Apex Code. 
That is Apex, which is our language that runs within Force.com providing stored procedures and triggers to our Force.com developers. With this 1 billion lines of Apex code, the Salesforce.com community has really grown combined with more than 6 million Java developers and 1 million Ruby developers, shows that we have the opportunity to harness a vibrant ecosystem as the platform as a service market heats up and rad our customers to fully customize and deeply our customer systems into all of their corporate information and data.
And we already seen it. While the Service Cloud was our fastest-growing product for the full year, the platform business the Service Cloud is the fastest growing business within the fourth quarter. Customers that are now building on the Force.com platform or have extended their deployments include AIG, Facebook, Genentech, Honda, Mizuho among Novartis and Sony. Of course, products are only great if people use them. 
And That's why adoption is such an important indicator to customer's success. During the fourth quarter, the Force.com platform delivered roughly 30 billion transactions, an increase of nearly 80% from the year ago. That's 30 billion transactions delivered by the Force.com platform. Nothing speaks more to the value of our platform than usage.
I will to remind you that at the start of fiscal year '12, Q1, we changed transactions be wind. When we introduce Chatter desktop in October 2010, we included from the desktop the disservice when we reported our transactions. As more people adopt Chatter desktop, we think a better way is no longer to count those pings, and you see these changes directly Salesforce.com as well as all of our performance and security information and reliability information as well.
We believe the market for our applications and platform is tremendous. IBC predicts companies worldwide will spend more than $40 billion 2014 on cloud computing services. Our growth opportunity has never been more complex adding, and we intend to build out our presence in our lead in every one of our core markets. 
In fiscal 2011, we grew our sales there's a reason capacity by approximately 40%, after holding it steady in fiscal 2010. And we're being more aggressive with acquisitions, fueling innovation by buying great companies with great technologies. With euro coo, we now have the leading platform into service for writing apps and moving on rails, which is the leading language for creating apps that are on social mobile and open biggest very definition of Cloud 2. 
But the reason we bought is that it's much more than a Ruby development platform. In the future, it's open global technologies will support other popular languages providing a roadmap for the Salesforce platform that our competitors will be hard pressed to match. and data were developers will be excited to build applications in whatever language they're working in.
Broadest technology we will use to immediately accelerate development of Chatter, adding capabilities such as screen sharing, missing, presence to mirror the Facebook models combining communication and collaboration into an integrated service. Of course, we take that one step further by integrating those capabilities with business information. And apex will help us make contacts more social, a part of our service as our contacts, capability and contact management used by almost of all our customers, Apex Code to take that technology to another level. 
And finally, the deal we and we acquired a number one GAAP in the Google app marketplace. It's project management application already helps more than 50,000 organizations and individuals organize complex tasks. We're very excited to be innovating at the small business as well.
I'd like to quickly recap our fiscal 2011 because highlights many of our operating principles. We started last year with a revenue expectation of roughly $1.5 billion and beat this estimate by more than $100 million. We reinvested that money to help grow our sales capacity by more than 40% and to help offset the cost of three of the largest and most strategic acquisitions in our history. 
And even with the strategic investments in future growth, we ended fiscal 2011 within $0.03 of $1.25 to $1.27 target that we set in February 2010, although on lower operating margins. But we think this is the right trade-off, because we're exiting fiscal year 2011 far stronger than we began with a much higher growth trajectory and significantly greater distribution and product capabilities. It's been an amazing year, just amazing. 
We saw that the Dreamforce see that everyday at Salesforce.com, and we're looking forward to being the first cloud computing company to deliver more than $2 billion in revenue this year. And you should expect us to continue to invest in growth in fiscal year '12 as we start a focus on our next milestone, $3 billion. It's coming.
Before I close, I want to take this opportunity to invite you to join me next week at the first cloud forest of 2011 at March 3. It's going to be at the center in New York City. And outside of this Dreamforce, this is the biggest were going to be expecting more than 9,500 customers more than 3000 already registered to attend this event. This will be our largest domestic event outside of Dreamforce ever. I hope to see you there. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Graham."
122917,126762296,106325,"Salesforce.com, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. In addition to delivering an excellent quarter across all key financial measures, particularly cash and deferred revenue, we accelerated our pace of investment in people and technology, positioning us with continued growth in fiscal 2012. I'",1680,"Thanks, Marc. In addition to delivering an excellent quarter across all key financial measures, particularly cash and deferred revenue, we accelerated our pace of investment in people and technology, positioning us with continued growth in fiscal 2012. I'll begin with us on the financial highlights for the quarter. 
Fourth quarter on revenue of $457 million was well above our outlook, entering the quarter primarily the result of a strong new business quarter Marc has already discussed. Approximately 94% of fourth quarter revenue was generated by subscription and support. That's up from 93% a year ago. As we're moving increasingly toward base model from implementation consulting, we expect the percentage of professional services revenue to gradually decline.
For the six consecutive quarter. Our dollar attrition rate expressed as the amount of annual of value revenue loss as a percentage of the prior year order value remains in the mid-teens range as it was in the third quarter. Given the approximately half of the value of our annual invoicing fourth quarter, strong Q4 renewals will help our top line growth in FY12. 
Turning to pricing, when we compare a net price for the professional and price unlimited service additions over the past eight quarters, we continue to see very little change. While others in our market compete largely on price, we continue to focus on value and technologies like Chatter, Jigsaw to differentiate our products.
Slightly bigger dollar in Q4 added a nominal $1 million to or sequential revenue performance. But the year-over-year comparison included the currency headwind of approximately $4 million. In local currency terms, fourth quarter revenue grew 30% year-over-year. 
We showed excellent growth in all regions in the Americas revenue rose by 26% to approximately $309 million. In Europe, revenue of roughly $83 million was up 30% in dollars and 41% in local currency. And in Asia, revenue of $65 million rose 43% in dollars and 35% in local currency. In total, international revenue comprised 32% of total revenue, and that's versus 31% in fiscal 2010. 
Growing our International business is important goal for Salesforce.com, and we continue to focus on sales and marketing resources in the largest offer markets in the world. Our product mix is also becoming more diversified over time. To give you one Q4 data point led by our service and platforms cloud, approximately 35% of new business in the quarter came from nonsales type services, and that compares with 30% in Q4 of last year.
Turning to the income statement. Non-GAAP gross margins were at 82% in the fourth quarter, unchanged from both Q3 and a year-ago quarter. Turning next to OpEx, which I will discuss in non-GAAP terms, at 71%, Q4 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue trended higher from the year-ago quarter. 
Sales and marketing expenses increased to 46% of revenue, up from 44% in FY '10, primarily as a result of three things. First, sales headcount additions; second, commission expense, because we had a significantly higher percentage of our sales teams being above quarter in on a accelerated commission rates; and third, of course, the biggest Dreamforce in our history, which as predicted, had a net EPS impact of around $0.05 in the quarter. 
R&D expenses increased 11% of revenue versus the percent a year ago, primarily as a result of increased headcount both through organic as well as by acquisitions. And finally, G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue remains flat at 14% of revenue.
During the quarter, we added roughly 550 people to finish the quarter with just over 5,300 employees. Approximately 65 of those additions came via by acquisitions that closed in Q4. Year-over-year, our employee population is grown by over 1,300, including just over 200 from acquisitions. The great majority of our hiring continues to be in growth critical functions like sales and R&D.
Non-GAAP operating margin of 11% was down from 15% a year ago in Q4. But last year, we added about 160 people in the fourth quarter. And as I just said, this year we added 550 people. So hopefully, it's clear what's change. 
Importantly for the fourth quarter, we still delivered non-GAAP EPS with the high end of our guidance range. At the beginning of Q4, we guided non-GAAP EPS to $0.27 to $0.28 and then reduce that range by $0.03 as a result of our acquisitions of your Roku ending them. 
Up $0.31 non-GAAP EPS results for Q4 included a onetime tax benefit of approximately $8 million or approximately $0.55 associated with the extension of a federal R&D tax credit. We ended the year with a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. 
moving on to cash flow. operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was just over $166 million for the quarter. An increase of roughly 81% from a year ago. Our fourth quarter results included approximately $25 million in onetime benefit related to our recent tax change on the accounting treatment of employees stock expense. I'd like to emphasize that this should be really viewed as a windfall on a affecting our overall cash performance for the quarter and the year and our growth rate for fiscal 2012.
For the full year, we generated more than $459 million in operating cash flow, that's an increase of more than 69% from a year ago. Capital expenditures for the quarter was just under $31 billion. The primary drivers of CapEx was certain components of our data build out, primarily here in the U.S. and also leasehold improvements to support our growing employee population. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was also strong at just over $135 million. And that's an increase of roughly 60% from last year. For the full year, our free cash flow was just over $368 million, an increase of 70% from fiscal 2010.
But looking to fiscal 2012, we think operating cash flow will grow in the low to mid-teens percentage-wise for three principal reasons. First, the onetime tax benefit of $25 million that I just mentioned; second, our headcount increase of 850 people in the second half of FY '11 was nearly 3x the number we added in the second half of FY 10. These late year headcount additions will cause cash compensation expenses to grow much more rapidly in the early part of fiscal 2012 and in the corresponding period in fiscal 2011; and finally, company over performance in Q4 and fiscal 2011 generally will result in higher commission of the bonus payouts in Q1 when compared with last year. 
Longer term, we continue to expect operating cash flow to grow about the same rate as revenue. Focusing on Q1, we expect operating cash flow to be lower than last year for the second and third reasons that I just mentioned a few moments ago.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents, including marketable securities, finished the quarter at approximately $1.4 billion. Despite our strong operating cash performance, cash and equivalents declined by nearly $400 million during the quarter, primarily due to acquisition-related payments totaling approximately $250 million for your Roku ending them, and approximately $270 million paid for our land purchase here in San Francisco. These thing two factors were the primary drivers of the significant increases to goodwill and property and equipment, respectively, in the quarter.
Our strong fourth quarter new business pushed deferred revenue to $935 million. That's an increase of 33% year-over-year. This was our strongest growth rate in nine quarters. The results included a $1 million foreign exchange benefit year-over-year at an approximately $3 million sequential headwind on currency. 
Invoiced durations work remain consistent with historical trends. but in Consistent with the last several years, we expect seasonal invoicing patterns to reduce deferred revenue from Q4 to Q1. And as another Q4 data point, our unbilled the third revenue, which is off balance sheet, was approximately $1.5 billion, and that's an increase of roughly 50% from the previous year end amount.
Turning to the outlook. We discussed in the past our goal of improving non-GAAP operating margins by 100 basis points each year. Clearly, the six acquisitions in total that we made in fiscal 2011 had a significant impact to margins, adding roughly $15 million of revenue to $45 million of expense. So we came in on that goal but we think are the very best pieces. what you can see reflected in our third quarter and of course our year end deferred revenue balance is was a significant uptick in demand and an amazing sales execution against that demand. And as Marc described earlier, when he discussed our operating principles, we decided to use that overachievement to dramatically increase our sales and development capacity in the fourth quarter.
So in that context, we now expect 2012 revenue in the range of approximately $2.03 billion to $2.05 billion, while non-GAAP EPS for the full year is expected to be $1.35 to $1.38. Earnings are expected to be somewhat more back-end loaded during the year due to the aggressive second half hiring that I've already discussed. We expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2012.  For Q1, we're projecting revenue in the range of approximately $480 million to $482 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.26 to $0.07. 
Another important just about this year is the timing pub Dreamforce. This year, Dreamforce will be in Q3 instead of Q4 as it has been for the past few years. To be clear, that net cost will now move from Q4 to Q3 and will likely have about a $0.06 impact on Q3 EPS in fiscal 2012. That range is likely to keep Q3 non-GAAP EPS approximately flat year-over-year and result in Q4 EPS being the highest of the year.
All of the underlying assumptions for our non-GAAP guidance as well as our GAAP guidance in the complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found on our earnings press release. With that, let me thank you all for joining us today and I'd like to open the call up for questions."

And that's why I think the platforms exciting, that think that's the Service Cloud is exciting as well. And I think as we head to next week, it's going to be a big week, March 2 are going to see the next iPad release, which will be awesome. And then on March 3, we're going to talk about our strategy and our vision for how do take their growth and their acceleration of that product and others and help CIL succeed.

You've seen existing customers to go enterprise-wide, where before, we were point solution like with that they'll, we had 30,000 users. We've got 100-something thousand users of their now because of Chatter. So we're helping to transform our customers business.

And that is just being really well received. And when you compare that against what our competitors position, it's pretty highly and completely highly differentiated. I mean, it's a different story. So I think that you see a broad recovery. where you get existing customers adding again, which is great because we have almost 100,000 customers every time you have one customer, you have a user, it's going to speak.

So we've sort of taking a little more cautious view on FX this year because I think we all viewed the euro as being very volatile sort of currency right now against the dollar, where you can see it done array around it does a lot of volatility. And then secondly, I think, yes, we've added a huge amount of sales capacity. But obviously, as we talked about at length on our analyst events and so on, there's a ramp type of sales people. So we hired a lot in the second half but we'll be working hard to put it in productive. So we'll see them really come on stream in terms of revenue more in the second half of the year. And then cash, I think we just because as again that $25 million that ended up in Q4 kind of unusual single onetime item.

When we talk about it does kind of separate processor but products lines, it's not. It was one integrated service. And mostly we communicated using these brand names because that's what customers usually expect from other vendors. They get a server or multiple servers and their independent code basis. And the thing that's interesting about our technology is that they are really one code base and they're one integrated offerings. That's why when we do a major upgrade, everything gets upgraded at the same time. Three or four times at year. And it's very often that a Sales Cloud will start integrate and use knowledge management from the Service Cloud. Or a Service Cloud user will obviously use contact and account about it from the Sales Cloud. Both of those guys for sure are going to draw from the platform to customize the build out Apex Code that provides the integrity and of the store procedures. with a deeply integrated data management technology, deeply integrated application development and deployment functionality, and then, cooperation. when we built Chatter, Chatter is deeply integrated into the services. It's in the database, is in the platform. It's in all of the apps and if it sounded better that. And the power of that is your building a database.com you can tap back of the Profiles during Salesforce, sales letter going to be using Chatter and these are not independent technologies snaps. it's all one integrated thing. What we've seen is first brought update on this technology across the broad. and then when we find killer new technology or like Chatter is the best example. You see it just see it take off all the customers that's we're 82,000 of them the running Chatter. And the only thing that we have independent that revise and then we tried to integrate those very rapidly so if the same unified experience. in some cases, we're going to get them likely coupled like, for example, the Jigsaw, we're providing native integration and Salesforce.com, but the core Jigsaw service is separate. That's been a huge home run we just can't believe the success we've seen with the Jigsaw if ability, is one of the core different shaders of the Sales Cloud in addition to the platform of in addition to Chatter, in addition to our iPad mobility support. Or probably the best example right now that's service that's rude independent and fully this intermediate from there but even amid you're going to see tighter and tighter integration into all of our services because that's the way we architect that Salesforce."

They built Debian our platform for the last several years and they now delivered remedy, which is help desk service moving their mainstream product over to be Force.com platform. And that power of those four clouds, I really think that it's this unified strategy that we really helping our customers to manage and share all their customer information in the cloud. I mean, at the end of the day, that is our vision. That's what we're helping our customers do. They look wasn't to us the manage and share that customer information in ways that they never did before. And we're making it better with Chatter. We're helping them to augment them in many cases with custom applications, using our platform. But over and over again, we're the source of the customer information in our customer's databases. And they look to us to manage that data really well for them, whether it's the Sales Cloud, whether it's the Service Cloud, whether it's collaboration, whether it's platform, and those are four points of investment. I think clarity of focus we've so well, it's acting is why we've been able to do right acquisitions this year. when you look at the Sales Cloud, we've made four acquisitions they are like the Jigsaw and etax when we look at the Service Cloud as I mentioned. For acquisitions like InStranet and a TiVo when we look at the platform of core acquisitions like Symbian. And even in the collaboration space when we look at four acquisitions like we just did with, that's how we think about our business with those four clouds moving forward. And because they're tightly integrated, the customers just tremendously benefit from that innovation and technology momentum."

Our fourth quarter was an extremely strong finished to a fantastic year. And let me begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights. Revenue for the fourth quarter was 29% from the year ago to $457 million. For the full year,",2188,"Thanks, David. Our fourth quarter was an extremely strong finished to a fantastic year. And let me begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter was 29% from the year ago to $457 million. For the full year, we delivered approximately $1.66 billion, an increase of 27% from fiscal year '10, and we exited the year with an annual revenue run rate that now exceeds $1.8 billion. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.31 rose 3% from the year-ago period even as we accelerated our investment in key areas of growth. We also set a company record for cash flow in the quarter delivering approximately $170 million in operating cash, an increase of more than 80% year-over-year. For the full year, operating cash flow rose approximately 70% to roughly $460 million or 28% of revenue in fiscal year '11.
Our multi-products strategy is really taking off. Not only was Q4 the best quarter in our history, we also saw a more new business from each of our sales, service, collaboration and platform Clouds than ever before. 
In the fourth quarter alone, we signed two eight-figure transactions, including our largest deal ever and more than 30 seven-figure deals. Also we added approximately 5,100 net new customers in the quarter excluding customers from Heroku and Dimdim, taking our global customer community to more than 92,300. 
For the full year, we added approximately 20,000 net new customers and more than 1 million net new subscribers. We now have a global community of more than 3 million net gain subscribers.
Given strong Q4 demand and a strong pipeline of new business, we're pleased to be able to raise revenue guidance of $2.03 billion to $2.05 billion for fiscal year '12. This will make Salesforce.com the first enterprise cloud-computing company to generate more than $2 billion in revenue by the end of this year. 
As you know, we kicked off the fourth quarter with an amazing Dreamforce, more than 23,000 customers, partners and developers attended our eighth annual event. I have to tell you I'm rarely tell such excitement from the crowd. Truly a testament to how our strategic vision, our customers view Salesforce.com in their enterprises.
We're our customers path for the next phase of cloud computing with we call Cloud 2. Cloud 2 is a new paradigm for computing that is inherently social, mobile and open. It redefines teams, pushes out information real time and works with revolutionary devices, including the iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry and smartphones using Android. Salesforce.com is leading the effort to bring Cloud 2 to the enterprise infusing everything we offer to customers with the social collaboration, mobility and openness that are the hallmark of this brave new world.
As you know, Chatter is at the heart of our efforts to lead the enterprise into Cloud 2. We see the social computing as a strategic new enterprise category, which is why this year, you've seen us deliver Chatter, Chatter Plus, Chatter Mobile, Chatter Free and at the Super Bowl, Chatter.com. And leveraging the social features popularized by Facebook and Twitter such as profiles, status update and real time feeds, Chatter provide a private and secure corporate social network for companies of all sizes. And because it is at the core to the Force.com platform, it's social capabilities are an integral part of every Salesforce product.  Today, you can sign up directly at Chatter.com. And all Chatter customers can upgrade with a single button to our full range of services. 
Today, more than 80,000 of our 92,300 paying customers have deployed Chatter since its release in June. This make Salesforce.com the largest provider of enterprise social networks in the world. And now with Chatter.com, the free and viral version of the service were looking to introduce the power of the cloud to employees at every company around the world. 
We've already added more than 10,000 new networks since introducing Chatter.com in our first-ever Super Bowl ad only a few weeks ago to get the momentum going. Our Super Bowl ad marks a milestone in how enterprise software companies can accelerate important services and brands like Chatter.com.
New Chatter deployments in the fourth quarter included Analog Devices, Avaya, Avis Budget, Citrix, Epson, McAfee and 3M. Customers also deployed Chatter into new departments and functions across the enterprise and companies purchasing additional subscriptions to Chatter included BSkyB, Sony, Trend Micro and Wachovia. In addition, SunGard will deploy Chatter across the entire enterprise, replacing its existing enterprise social network just as Dell did before them. Both are now standardized enterprise-wide on Salesforce's Chatter.
Customers using Chatter fell the thrill of the productivity gains in the open communication that brings to their organizations. In a recent survey, we commissioned more than 6,000 global Salesforce.com customers. Users reported 28%, pure medians, 33% less email and a 49% increase in finding information after deploying Chatter. Those are amazing statistics. 
Customers that have deployed Chatter within our sales and service clouds also have shown higher log in rates and higher usage rates as their employee spend more time and do more work within our applications. These are amazing results from a technology that is literally just months old. We are so delighted to see such strong results from the Chatter technology.
Our customer momentum was powered by our flagship Sales Cloud, which added more new business in Q4 than in any quarter in our history. Customers buy new or additional subscription to the Sales Cloud included Groupon, Juniper Networks, Staples and Tyco Health Care Group. Against Oracle, we want significant new or add-on business this quarter with customers such as AT&T, Citi, Telefonica, and Xerox. And companies also prefer our Sales Cloud over Microsoft CRM, which just is not kept pace with the social, mobile and open technologies the rest of the world has embraced and offers customers no competitive advantage. 
Q4 wins for new or add-on business against Microsoft include Abbott, Gannett, Hilton and Scripts. We also saw a strong momentum in our Service Cloud, which racked up record new business. Approximately 15,000 companies now use our service Cloud as they look for ways to connect with their customers both against traditional and new service channels, including social media, the web, email and telephone. Major wins or expansions of the Service Cloud include Huntington, Net Assets, NTT, Thomson Reuters and Valiant. 
In addition, we see momentum building in a platform of the service category as companies demand more social, mobile and open applications to serve their employees and customers. We have the only platform for building quality applications that is trusted, proven solution for the enterprise. And with our strategic news towards an open multi-language, multi-develop strategy in the last 90 days, we believe Force.com is positioned to be long-term leader in the platform as a service category.
We introduced our revolutionary database.com, the first enterprise database build for the cloud, which allows developers to write apps at any language on any platform for any device. We also acquired Heroku, the leading platform as a service for writing apps in Ruby on Rails. And now developers have the freedom to use any Ruby app for writing social and mobile cloud apps on Heroku. Job of recruiting sophisticated enterprise apps of VMforce, and Apex for building native apps on Force.com.  And Force.com achieved some truly impressive milestones. This year, we attracted an additional 100,000 developers creating a global customer community of more than 340,000 developers writing on the Salesforce.com platform. And I'm excited to tell you today, that as of today, developers have now written more than 1 billion lines of Apex code. 
That is Apex, which is our language that runs within Force.com providing stored procedures and triggers to our Force.com developers. With this 1 billion lines of Apex code, the Salesforce.com community has really grown combined with more than 6 million Java developers and 1 million Ruby developers, shows that we have the opportunity to harness a vibrant ecosystem as the platform as a service market heats up and rallying our customers to fully customize and deeply integrate our customer information systems into all of their corporate information and data.
And we already seen it. While the Service Cloud was our fastest-growing product for the full year, the Platform business edge out the Service Cloud as the fastest growing business within the fourth quarter. Customers that are now building on the Force.com platform or have extended their deployments include AIG, Facebook, Genentech, Honda, Mizuho, Novartis and Sony. Of course, products are only great if people use them.  And that's why adoption is such an important indicator of customer success. During the fourth quarter, the Force.com platform delivered roughly 30 billion transactions, an increase of nearly 80% from the year ago. That's 30 billion transactions delivered by the Force.com platform. Nothing speaks more to the value of our platform than usage.
I want to remind you that at the start of fiscal year '12, Q1, we changed how we count transactions. When we introduce Chatter Desktop in October 2010, we included pings from the desktop to the servers when we reported our transactions. As more people adopt Chatter desktop, we think a better way is no longer to count those pings, and you see these changes directly at Salesforce.com as well as all of our performance and security information and reliability information as well.
We believe the market for our applications and platform is tremendous. IBC predicts companies worldwide will spend more than $40 billion in 2014 on cloud computing services. Our growth opportunity has never been more exciting, and we intend to build out our presence and our lead in every one of our core markets. 
In fiscal 2011, we grew our sales distribution capacity by approximately 40%, after holding it steady in fiscal 2010. And we're being more aggressive with acquisitions, fueling innovation by buying great companies with great technologies. With Heroku, we now have the leading platform as a service for writing apps and Ruby on Rails, which is the leading language for creating an apps that are on social mobile and open. It's the very definition of Cloud 2. 
But the reason we bought Heroku is that it's much more than a Ruby development platform. In the future, it's open global technologies will support other popular languages providing a roadmap for the Salesforce platform that our competitors will be hard pressed to match. And that our developers will be excited to build applications in whatever language they're working in.
Dimdim, broadest technology, we will use to immediately accelerate the development of Chatter, adding vital communication capabilities such as screen sharing, messaging and presence, to mirror the proven Facebook models combining communication and collaboration into an integrated service. Of course, we take that's one step further by integrating those capabilities with business information. And eTech will help us make contacts more social, at the heart of our service as our contacts, capability and contact management used by almost of all our customers, eTech is going to take that technology to another level. 
And finally, the deal we closed earlier this month, we acquired the number one app in the Google app marketplace, Manymoon. It's project management application already helps more than 50,000 organizations and individuals organize complex tasks. We're very excited to be innovating at the small business as well.
I'd like to quickly recap our fiscal 2011 because of the highlights many of our operating principles. We started last year with a revenue expectation of roughly $1.5 billion and beat this estimate by more than $100 million. We reinvested that money to help grow our sales capacity by more than 40% and to help offset the cost of three of the largest and most strategic acquisitions in our history. 
And even with the strategic investments in future growth, we ended fiscal 2011 within $0.03 of the $1.25 to $1.27 target that we set in February 2010, although on lower operating margins. But we think this is the right trade-off, because we're exiting fiscal year '11 far stronger than we began with a much higher growth trajectory and significantly greater distribution and product capabilities. It's been an amazing year, just amazing. 
We saw that at the Dreamforce. We see that everyday at Salesforce.com, and we're looking forward to being the first cloud computing company to deliver more than $2 billion in revenue this year. And you should expect us to continue to invest in growth in fiscal year '12 as we start to focus on our next milestone, $3 billion. It's coming.
Before I close, I want to take this opportunity to invite you to join me next week at the First Cloudforce of 2011 on March 3. It's going to be at the Javits Center in New York City. And outside of Dreamforce, this is our biggest customer event of the year. We're going to be expecting more than 2,500 customers, more than 3,000 have already registered to attend this event. This will be our largest domestic event outside of Dreamforce ever. I hope to see you there. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Graham."
122917,126762296,106498,"Salesforce.com, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. In addition to delivering an excellent quarter across all key financial measures, particularly cash and deferred revenue, we accelerated our pace of investment in people and technology, positioning us for continued growth in fiscal 2012. I'l",1690,"Thanks, Marc. In addition to delivering an excellent quarter across all key financial measures, particularly cash and deferred revenue, we accelerated our pace of investment in people and technology, positioning us for continued growth in fiscal 2012. I'll begin with some of the financial highlights for the quarter. 
Fourth quarter revenue of $457 million was well above our outlook, entering the quarter primarily the result of a strong new business quarter Marc has already discussed. Approximately 94% of fourth quarter revenue was generated by a subscription and support. That's up from 93% a year ago. As we're moving increasingly toward the half of base model from implementation consulting, we expect the percentage of professional services revenue to gradually decline.
Dollar attrition fell for the six consecutive quarter. Our dollar attrition rate expressed as the amount of annual order value lost as a percentage of the prior year order value remains in the mid-teens range as it was in the third quarter. Given though approximately half of the value of our annual invoicing occurs in the fourth quarter, strong Q4 renewals will help our top line growth in FY12. 
Turning to pricing, when we compare the net price proceed for the professional enterprise and unlimited service additions over the past eight quarters, we continue to see very little change. While others in our market compete largely on price, we continue to focus on value and technologies like Chatter, Jigsaw, to differentiate our products.
A slightly bigger dollar in Q4 added a nominal $1 million to our sequential revenue performance. But the year-over-year comparison included the currency headwind of approximately $4 million. In local currency terms, fourth quarter revenue grew 30% year-over-year. 
We showed excellent growth in all regions in the Americas, revenue rose by 26% to approximately $309 million. In Europe, revenue of roughly $83 million was up 30% in dollars and 41% in local currency. And in Asia, revenue of $65 million rose 43% in dollars and 35% in local currency. In total, international revenue comprised 32% of total revenue, and that's versus 31% in fiscal 2010. 
Growing our International business is an important goal for Salesforce.com, and we continue to focus our sales and marketing resources in the largest software markets in the world. Our product mix is also becoming more diversified over time. To give you one Q4 data point led by our service and platforms cloud, approximately 35% of new business in the quarter came from non-sales cloud services, and that compares with 30% in Q4 of last year.
Turning to the income statement. Non-GAAP gross margins were at 82% in the fourth quarter, unchanged from both Q3 and the year-ago quarter. Turning next to OpEx, which I will discuss in non-GAAP terms, at 71%, Q4 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue trended higher from the year-ago quarter. 
Sales and marketing expenses increased to 46% of revenue, up from 44% in FY '10, primarily as a result of three things. First, sales headcount additions; second, commission expense, because we had a significantly higher percentage of our sales teams being above quarter and on accelerated commission rates; and third, of course, the biggest Dreamforce in our history, which as predicted, had a net EPS impact of around $0.05 in the quarter. 
R&D expenses increased to 11% of revenue versus 9% a year ago, primarily as a result of increased headcount both through organic hiring as well as by our acquisitions. And finally, G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue remains flat at 14% of revenue.
During the quarter, we added roughly 550 people to finish the quarter with just over 5,300 employees. Approximately 65 of those additions came via acquisitions that closed in Q4. Year-over-year, our employee population has grown by over 1,300, including just over 200 from acquisitions. The great majority of our hiring continues to be in growth critical functions like sales and R&D.
Non-GAAP operating margin of 11% was down from 15% a year ago in Q4. But last year, we added about 160 people in the fourth quarter. And as I just said, this year we added 550 people. So hopefully, it's clear what's change. 
Importantly for the fourth quarter, we still delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our guidance range. At the beginning of Q4, we guided non-GAAP EPS at $0.27 to $0.28 and then reduced that range by $0.03 as a result of our acquisitions of Heroku and Dimdim. 
Our $0.31 non-GAAP EPS results for Q4 included a onetime tax benefit of approximately $8 million or approximately $0.055 associated with the extension of the federal R&D tax credit. We ended the year with a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. 
Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was just over $166 million. An increase of roughly 81% from a year ago. Our fourth quarter results included approximately $25 million in onetime benefit related to a recent tax change on the accounting treatment of employees stock expense. I'd like to emphasize that this should be really viewed as a windfall on affecting our overall cash performance for the quarter and the year and our growth rate for fiscal 2012.
For the full year, we generated more than $459 million in operating cash flows, that's an increase of more than 69% from a year ago. Capital expenditure for the quarter was just under $31 million. The primary drivers of CapEx was certain components of our data center build outs, primarily here in the U.S. and also leasehold improvements to support our growing employee population. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was also strong at just over $135 million. And that's an increase of roughly 60% from last year. For the full year, our free cash flow was just over $368 million, an increase of 70% from fiscal 2010.
Looking to fiscal 2012, we think operating cash flow will grow in the low to mid-teens percentage-wise for three principal reasons: First, the onetime tax benefit of $25 million that I just mentioned; second, our headcount increase of 850 people in the second half of FY '11 was nearly 3x the number we added in the second half of FY 10, these late year headcount additions will cause cash compensation expenses to grow much more rapidly in the early part of fiscal 2012 and in the corresponding period in fiscal 2011; and finally, company overperformance in Q4 and fiscal 2011 generally will result in higher commission of bonus payouts in Q1 when compared with last year. 
Longer term, we continue to expect operating cash flow to grow at about the same rate as revenue. Focusing on Q1, we expect operating cash flow to be lower than last year for the second and third reasons that I just mentioned a few moments ago.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents, including marketable securities, finished the quarter at approximately $1.4 billion. Despite our strong operating cash performance, cash and equivalents declined by nearly $400 million during the quarter, primarily due to acquisition-related payments totaling approximately $250 million for Heroku and Dimdim, and approximately $270 million paid for our land purchase here in San Francisco. These same two factors were the primary drivers of the significant increases to goodwill and property and equipment, respectively, in the quarter.
Our strong fourth quarter new business pushed deferred revenue to some $935 million. That's an increase of up 33% year-over-year. This was our strongest growth rate in nine quarters. The result included a $1 million foreign exchange benefit year-over-year and an approximately $3 million sequential headwind on currency. 
Invoiced durations remain consistent with historical trends. And consistent with the last several years, we expect seasonal invoicing patterns to reduce deferred revenue from Q4 to Q1. And as another Q4 data point, our unbilled deferred revenue, which is off balance sheet, was approximately $1.5 billion, and that's an increase of roughly 50% from the previous year end amount.
Turning to the outlook. We discussed in the past our goal of improving non-GAAP operating margins by 100 to 300 basis points each year. Clearly, the six acquisitions in total that we made in fiscal 2011 had a significant impact to margins, adding roughly $15 million of revenue or about $45 million of expense. So we came in under that goal but we think for the very best reasons. 
What you can see reflected in our third quarter and of course our year end deferred revenue balances was a significant uptick in demand and amazing sales execution against that demand. And as Marc described earlier, when he discussed our operating principles, we decided to use that over achievement to dramatically increase our sales and development capacity in the fourth quarter.
So with that context, we now expect 2012 revenue in the range of approximately $2.03 billion to $2.05 billion, while non-GAAP EPS for the full year is expected to be at a $1.35 to a $1.38. Earnings are expected to be somewhat more back-end loaded during the year due to the aggressive second half hiring that I've already discussed. We expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2012.  For Q1, we're projecting revenue in the range of approximately $480 million to $482 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.26 to $0.27. 
One other important changes to note this year is the timing of Dreamforce. This year, Dreamforce will be in Q3 instead of Q4 as it has been for the past two years. To be clear, that net cost will now move from Q4 to Q3 and will likely have about a $0.06 impact on Q3 EPS in fiscal 2012. That range is likely to keep Q3 non-GAAP EPS approximately flat year-over-year and result in Q4 EPS being the highest of the year.
All of the underlying assumptions for our non-GAAP guidance as well as our GAAP guidance and the complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found on our earnings press release. With that, let me thank you all for joining us today, and I'd like to open the call up for questions."

It's been a tremendous transformation of the company, and the speed of growth has been awesome. And then we have the platform. And with the platform, of course, we also just added Heroku, which was an incredible acquisition. It's technology like I've never seen. You've already seen it delivering Ruby on Rails as a service, and you're going to start to see some amazing capabilities from that group as we head towards Dreamforce. And so both of these are just very fast-growing product lines. Graham, would you like to add to that?"

And we think that it's neither the Service Cloud this year or the platform. We think this is really the year of Cloud 2. Heather what's going on with our customers is they are just seeing this dramatic shift to a new type of IT. Some of them calling it the consumerization of IT. I really call it Cloud 2. Where Cloud 1 was really about low cost and fast and easy to use, now we really see this huge shift to the next version of Cloud 2, which is social, driven a lot by a billion people on Facebook and Twitter and mobile with -- you see iPad's growth has been unbelievable and analysts saying that they are going to see another 50 million tablets in use this year, sold this year. In addition, it's already been sold, and then we're going to see really open systems. And I think this has been a huge opportunity for us. A lot of our customers had been very worried about the old vendors, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP lock in to mend [ph] their own proprietary standards like .NET and C#. And they've been looking for these new open standards like Ruby and Java, and that's where we've really tried to deliver. And we're really focused on this next paradigm of computing and moving customers to that as quickly as possible, and the uptake has been awesome. And then when customers look to build those apps, they're using our platform because our platform lets you build these apps that are inherently social, mobile and open. And that's why I think the platform is exciting. That's also why I think the Service Cloud is exciting as well. And I think as we head to next week, it's going to be a big week. On March 2, we're going to see the next iPad release, which will be awesome. And then on March 3, we're going to talk about our strategy and our vision for how to take their growth and their acceleration and their momentum with that product and others and help CIO succeed. We're seeing more CIO interest in deploying iPads in the enterprises than ever before. It's phenomenal. Hope that answers your question."

It was a monster quarter, and the deal flow in the quarter was just awesome. And a lot of that, I think, really has to do with a couple of things. First, I think we have seen a broad recovery from a couple of years ago, where existing customers were not adding new users. And I think that we can safely say we're over that hurdle, and that really contributed to this recovery. Two, we continue to see just really strong demand from existing customers. You've seen existing customers go enterprise-wide, where before we were at point solution like with Dell. We had 30,000 users. We've got 100-and-something thousand users there now because of Chatter. So we're helping to transform our customers' business. We want our customers to be more successful, and we can give them an enterprise-wide transformational story about how to bring in these new technologies like their tablets and their mobile devices and their social paradigm and become better companies. And that is just being really well received. And when you compare that against what our competitors' position, it's pretty and completely highly differentiated. I mean, it's a different story. So I think that you see a broad recovery where you get existing customers adding again, which is great because we have almost 100,000 customers. So every time you have one customer add a user, it's tremendous. Two, you've got a situation where our product is helping our customers go enterprise-wide. And three, we've got a tremendously well differentiated solution against the competition. And those three things, I think, are really working well together and that's what we've really worked for this year.

Clearly, it's 28%, and then we taper that towards the back half of the year. And I think clearly, we have less visibility to the back half of the year than Q1 and Q2. And I think it's fair to say we're anticipating, and I think recent events would support our theory that it's still going to -- we live in a very volatile world. So we've sort of taken a little more of a cautious view on FX this year, because I think we all view the euro as being a very volatile sort of currency right now against the dollar or you could say it the other way around, I think. There's a lot of volatility. And then secondly, I think yes, we've added a huge amount of sales capacity. But obviously, as we talked about at length at our analysts events and so on, there's a ramp time for salespeople. So we hired a lot in the second half, but we'll be working hard to get them productive. So we'll see them really come on stream in terms of revenue more in the second half of the year. And then Kash, I think you just got to -- I'll emphasize again that $25 million that ended up in Q4 and that's kind of unusual, single, one-time item. I think it's really best to assess our cash guidance and our commentary taking that number out. That gives you a better sense of really what's going on, and I gave you several other reasons why we just think first half cash flow is going to be a little tighter than it was in the same period last year."

And it's computer science that I've just never seen before. Using this kind of strong development model organized around the Jet with Ruby on Rails has given these Ruby developers the ability to build and deliver applications just more rapidly and more successfully than ever before. And I think they're adding about 3,000 new apps a week, if I am correct in that. I don't think we mentioned in the script. I mean, I have to check the exact number, but that's the last thing that I remember from Byron [Sebastian]. And I'll tell you that the reason, of course, that we bought the technology is not just that we're huge fans of Ruby, but we're really huge fans of Heroku. And what we saw there was them running multiple languages already. And we're not ready to announce new languages. We're not ready to talk about what they are. We're not ready to start revealing which languages are next down the Heroku pipeline, but we do hope to have a full range of languages on Heroku by the time we get to Dreamforce.

We certainly do not pretend to be experts in managing and working with developers.

When we talk about it as kind of separate Cloud or separate product lines, it's not. It's one integrated service. And mostly, we communicated using these brand names because that's what customers usually expect from other vendors. They get a server or multiple servers and their independent code basis. And the thing that's interesting about our technology is that they are really one-code based and they're one integrated offering. That's why when we do a major upgrade, everything gets upgraded at the same time, three or four times a year. And it's very often that a Sales Cloud user will start to integrate and use knowledge management from the Service Cloud, or a Service Cloud user will obviously start to use contact and account functionality from the Sales Cloud. And both of those guys for sure are going to draw from the platform to customize and to build that Apex Code that provides the referential integrity of the stored procedures. We have a deeply integrated data management technology, deeply integrated application development and deployment functionality. And then, collaboration. When we built Chatter, Chatter is deeply integrated into these services. It's in the database, it's in the platform, it's in all of the apps and it's its own independent app. And the power of that is if you're building on Database.com, you can tap into profiles and feeds if you're in Salesforce. In the Sales Cloud, you're going to be using Chatter. If you're in the Service Cloud, you're using Chatter. And these are not independent technologies steps. It's all one integrated thing. And so what you end up seeing is this broad uptick of this technology across-the-broad. And then when we find a killer new technology that just really works like Apex, or like Chatter is the best example, you just see it take off throughout all the customers. That's why over 80,000 of them now running the Chatter. And the only things that we have that are independent tend to be things that we buy, and then we try to integrate those very rapidly so that it's the same unified experience. In some cases, we're going to keep them lightly coupled. Like, for example, with Jigsaw, we're providing native integration in salesforce.com, but the core Jigsaw service is separate. That's been a huge home run for us. We just can't believe the success we've seen with the Jigsaw capability. It's one of the core differentiators of the Sales Cloud in addition to the platform, in addition to Chatter, in addition to our iPad and our mobility support. Or Heroku is probably the best example right now with service that's truly independent and fully disintermediated from all of our other services. But even with Heroku, you're going to see tighter and tighter integration into all of our services because that's the way we architect that Salesforce."

And I've obviously been a huge cheerleader and fan of the technology. But at the end of the day, we really saw two things that really motivated us. One was just the huge support of Facebook and Twitter. I mean, combined, those guys have got almost a billion users, and they're training people on how to use these services. And we know that that's the way customers want to operate inside these organizations today. You look at those benefits of using Chatter, email use down a third in Chatter organizations. That's incredible. Median is down 25%, access to customer information of 50%. Those are some unbelievable numbers. I've never seen technology do that before. And then two, we saw here the independent social networks emerge, and some of those emerging inside our customers. But the reason we've been able to replace those, like, for example, in Dell and SunGard and others is because they're not integrated with the corporate data. They're not integrated in the data, they're not integrated in the applications, they're not integrated into the fundamental business processes of our customers. And when we show them the combination of those two things and then running them in the mobile world, it's been a game changer. The only thing I use to run Salesforce is Chatter on the iPad. I mean, I get everything I need from that, and it's been transformational for me and I know for so many of our customers as well."

I think that, that was kind of one of the things that got misunderstood at Dreamforce and I'll talk more about that next week in New York. But our four core product lines are the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the platform and of course, the Collaboration Cloud. And these are four core areas of focus for the company and continue to be. As part of that, of course, there's other products that fit into that, like, for example, we have Jigsaw, which is a huge part of the Sales Cloud. We've got Heroku, which is a huge part of the platform. As is our Remedy Force, which is our efforts with BMC. They've built, as you know, natively on our platform for the last several years and have now delivered Remedy, which is help desk as a service, moving their mainstream product over to the Force.com platform. And that power those four clouds. I really think that it's this unified strategy that we are really helping our customers to manage and share all their customer information in the Cloud. I mean, at the end of the day, that is our vision. That's what we're helping our customers do. They look to us to manage and share that customer information in ways that they never did before, and we're making it better with Chatter. We're helping them to augment them, in many cases, with custom applications using our platform. But over and over again, we're the source of the customer information in our customers' databases. And they look to us to manage that data really well for them, whether it's the Sales Cloud, whether it's the Service Cloud, whether it's Collaboration, whether it's platform. And those are our four points of investment. I think because we have that clarity of focus, we've been able to do so well. I think it's why we've been able to make the right acquisitions this year. When you look at the Sales Cloud, we've made core acquisitions there like with Jigsaw and eTax. When we look at the Service Cloud, as I mentioned, the core acquisitions like InStranet and Activa. When we look at the platform, core acquisitions like Symbian and like Heroku. And even in the Collaboration space, when we look at core acquisitions like we just did with Dimdim. That's how we think about our business around those four clouds moving forward. And because they're tightly integrated, the customers just tremendously benefit from that innovation and technology momentum."

Our fourth quarter was an extremely strong finish to a fantastic year. And let me begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights.

And let me begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter was 29% from the year ago to $457 million. For the full year, we delivered approximately $1.66 billion, an increase of 27% from fiscal year '10, and we exited the year with an annual revenue run rate that now exceeds $1.8 billion. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.31 rose 3% from the year-ago period, even as we accelerated our investment in key areas of growth. We also set a company record for cash flow in the quarter delivering approximately $170 million in operating cash, an increase of more than 80% year-over-year. For the full year, operating cash flow rose approximately 70% to roughly $460 million or 28% of revenue in fiscal year '11.
Our multi-products strategy is really taking off. Not only was Q4 the best quarter in our history, we also signed more new business from each of our sales, service, collaboration and platform clouds than ever before. 
In the fourth quarter alone, we signed two eight-figure transactions, including our largest deal ever, and more than 30 seven-figure deals. Also, we added approximately 5,100 net new customers in the quarter, excluding customers from Heroku and Dimdim, taking our global customer community to more than 92,300. 
For the full year, we added approximately 20,000 net new customers and more than 1 million net new subscribers. We now have a global community of more than 3 million net gain subscribers.
Given strong Q4 demand and a strong pipeline of new business, we're pleased to be able to raise revenue guidance of $2.03 billion to $2.05 billion for fiscal year '12. This will make Salesforce.com the first enterprise cloud-computing company to generate more than $2 billion in revenue by the end of this year. 
As you know, we kicked off the fourth quarter with an amazing Dreamforce, more than 23,000 customers, partners and developers attended our eighth annual event. I have to tell you, I'm rarely felt such excitement from a crowd. Truly a testament to how our strategic vision, our customers view Salesforce.com in their enterprises.
We're our customers' path for the next phase of cloud computing, which we call Cloud 2. Cloud 2 is a new paradigm for computing that is inherently social, mobile and open. It redefines teams, pushes out information in real time and works with revolutionary devices, including the iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry and smartphones using Android. Salesforce.com is leading the effort to bring Cloud 2 to the enterprise, infusing everything we offer to customers with the social collaboration, mobility and openness that are the hallmark of this brave new world.
As you know, Chatter is at the heart of our efforts to lead the enterprise into Cloud 2. We see social computing as a strategic new enterprise category, which is why this year you've seen us deliver Chatter, Chatter Plus, Chatter Mobile, Chatter Free and, at the Super Bowl, Chatter.com. 
And leveraging the social features popularized by Facebook and Twitter such as profiles, status updates and real time feeds, Chatter provide a private and secure corporate social network for companies of all sizes. 
And because it is at the core to the Force.com platform, its social capabilities are an integral part of every Salesforce product.  Today, you can sign up directly at Chatter.com. And all Chatter customers can upgrade with a single button for our full range of services. 
Today, more than 80,000 of our 92,300 paying customers have deployed Chatter since its release in June. This makes Salesforce.com the largest provider of enterprise social networks in the world. And now with Chatter.com, the free and viral version of the service, we're looking to introduce the power of the cloud to employees at every company around the world. 
We've already added more than 10,000 new networks since introducing Chatter.com in our first-ever Super Bowl ad only a few weeks ago to get the momentum going. Our Super Bowl ad marks a milestone in how enterprise software companies can accelerate important new services and brands like Chatter.com.
New Chatter deployments in the fourth quarter included Analog Devices, Avaya, Avis Budget, Citrix, Epson, McAfee and 3M. Customers also deployed Chatter into new departments and functions across the enterprise and companies purchasing additional subscriptions to Chatter included BSkyB, Sony, Trend Micro and Wachovia. 
In addition, SunGard will deploy Chatter across the entire enterprise, replacing its existing enterprise social network, just as Dell did before them. Both are now standardized enterprise-wide on Salesforce's Chatter.
Customers using Chatter tell us they're thrilled of the productivity gains and the open communication it brings to their organizations. In a recent survey, we commissioned more than 6,000 global Salesforce.com customers. Users reported 28% fewer medians, 33% less email, and a 49% increase in finding information after deploying Chatter. Those are amazing statistics. 
Customers that have deployed Chatter within our sales and service clouds also have shown higher log in rates and higher usage rates as their employee spend more time and do more work within our applications. These are amazing results from a technology that is literally just months old. We are so delighted to see such strong results from the Chatter technology.
Our customer momentum was powered by our flagship Sales Cloud, which added more new business in Q4 than in any quarter in our history. Customers buy new or additional subscription to the Sales Cloud included Groupon, Juniper Networks, Staples and Tyco Health Care Group. 
Against Oracle, we want significant new or add-on business this quarter with customers such as AT&T, Citi, Telefonica, and Xerox. And companies also prefer our Sales Cloud over Microsoft CRM, which just is not kept pace with the social, mobile and open technologies the rest of the world has embraced and offers customers no competitive advantage. Q4 wins for new or add-on business against Microsoft include Abbott, Gannett, Hilton and Scripts. 
We also saw a strong momentum in our Service Cloud, which racked up record new business. Approximately 15,000 companies now use our Service Cloud as they look for ways to connect with their customers both against traditional and new service channels, including social media, the web, email and telephone. Major wins or expansions of the Service Cloud include Huntington, Net Assets, NTT, Thomson Reuters and Valiant. 
In addition, we see momentum building in the platform as a service category as companies demand more social, mobile and open applications to serve their employees and customers. We have the only platform for building quality applications that is a trusted, proven solution for the enterprise. And with our strategic news towards an open multi-language, multi-develop strategy in the last 90 days, we believe Force.com is positioned to be long-term leader in the platform as a service category.
We introduced our revolutionary Database.com, the first enterprise database built for the cloud, which allows developers to write apps in any language on any platform for any device. We also acquired Heroku, the leading platform as a service for writing apps in Ruby on Rails. And now developers have the freedom to use any Ruby app for writing social and mobile cloud apps on Heroku, Java for creating sophisticated enterprise apps with VMforce, and Apex for building native apps on Force.com.  
And Force.com achieved some truly impressive milestones. This year, we attracted an additional 100,000 developers creating a global customer community of more than 340,000 developers writing on the Salesforce.com platform. 
And I'm excited to tell you today, that as of today, developers have now written more than 1 billion lines of Apex code. That is Apex, which is our language that runs within Force.com providing stored procedures and triggers to our Force.com developers. With this 1 billion lines of Apex code, the Salesforce.com community has really grown. Combined with more than 6 million Java developers and 1 million Ruby developers, shows that we have the opportunity to harness a vibrant ecosystem as the platform as a service market heats up, and allowing our customers to fully customize and deeply integrate our customer information systems into all of their corporate information and data.
And we've already seen it, while the Service Cloud was our fastest-growing product for the full year, the Platform business edged out the Service Cloud as the fastest growing business within the fourth quarter. Customers that are now building on the Force.com platform or have extended their deployments include AIG, Facebook, Genentech, Honda, Mizuho, Novartis and Sony. 
Of course, products are only great if people use them.  And that's why adoption is such an important indicator of customer success. During the fourth quarter, the Force.com platform delivered roughly 30 billion transactions, an increase of nearly 80% from the year ago. That's 30 billion transactions delivered by the Force.com platform. Nothing speaks more to the value of our platform than usage.
I want to remind you that at the start of fiscal year '12, Q1, we changed how we count transactions. When we introduce Chatter Desktop in October 2010, we included pings from the desktop to the servers when we reported our transactions. As more people adopt Chatter desktop, we think a better way is no longer to count those pings, and you see these changes directly at Salesforce.com, as well as all of our performance and security information, and reliability information as well.
We believe the market for our applications and platform is tremendous. IBC predicts companies worldwide will spend more than $40 billion in 2014 on cloud computing services. Our growth opportunity has never been more exciting, and we intend to build out our presence and our lead in every one of our core markets. 
In fiscal 2011, we grew our sales distribution capacity by approximately 40%, after holding it steady in fiscal 2010. And we're being more aggressive with acquisitions, fueling innovation by buying great companies with great technologies. With Heroku, we now have the leading platform as a service for writing apps in Ruby on Rails, which is the leading language for creating apps that are on social, mobile and open. It's the very definition of Cloud 2. 
But the reason we bought Heroku is that it's much more than a Ruby development platform. In the future, it's open and scalable technologies will support other popular languages providing a roadmap for the Salesforce platform that our competitors will be hard-pressed to match. And that our developers will be excited to build applications in whatever language they're working in.
Dimdim brought us technology we will use to immediately accelerate the development of Chatter, adding vital communication capabilities such as screen sharing, messaging and presence, to mirror the proven Facebook models combining communication and collaboration into an integrated service. 
Of course, we take that one step further by integrating those capabilities with business information. And Etacts will help us make contacts more social, at the heart of our service is our contacts, capability and contact management used by almost all our customers, Etacts is going to take that technology to another level. 
And finally, the deal we closed earlier this month, we acquired the number one app in the Google app marketplace, Manymoon. Its project management application already helps more than 50,000 organizations and individuals organize complex tasks. We're very excited to be innovating at the small business as well.
I'd like to quickly recap our fiscal 2011 because it highlights many of our operating principles. We started last year with a revenue expectation of roughly $1.5 billion and beat this estimate by more than $100 million. We reinvested that money to help grow our sales capacity by more than 40% and to help offset the cost of three of the largest and most strategic acquisitions in our history. 
And even with the strategic investments in future growth, we ended fiscal 2011 within $0.03 of the $1.25 to $1.27 target that we set in February 2010, although on lower operating margins. Well, we think this is the right trade-off, because we're exiting fiscal year '11 far stronger than we began with a much higher growth trajectory and significantly greater distribution and product capabilities. It's been an amazing year, just amazing.  
We saw that at the Dreamforce. We see that every day at Salesforce.com, and we're looking forward to being the first cloud computing company to deliver more than $2 billion in revenue this year. And you should expect us to continue to invest in growth in fiscal year '12 as we start to focus on our next milestone, $3 billion. It's coming.
Before I close, I want to take this opportunity to invite you to join me next week at the First Cloudforce of 2011 on March 3. It's going to be at the Javits Center in New York City. And outside of Dreamforce, this is our biggest customer event of the year. We're going to be expecting more than 2,500 customers, more than 3,000 have already registered to attend this event. This will be our largest domestic event outside of Dreamforce ever. I hope to see you there. 
And with that, I'll hand it back over to Graham."
122917,126762296,106511,"Salesforce.com, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. In addition to delivering an excellent quarter across all key financial measures, particularly cash and deferred revenue, we accelerated our pace of investment in people and technology, positioning us for continued growth in fiscal 2012. I'l",1681,"Thanks, Marc. In addition to delivering an excellent quarter across all key financial measures, particularly cash and deferred revenue, we accelerated our pace of investment in people and technology, positioning us for continued growth in fiscal 2012. I'll begin with some of the financial highlights of the quarter. 
Fourth quarter revenue of $457 million was well above our outlook entering the quarter, primarily the result of a strong new business quarter Marc has already discussed. Approximately 94% of fourth quarter revenue was generated by subscription and support. That's up from 93% a year ago. As we move increasingly towards a partner-based model for implementation consulting, we expect the percentage of professional services revenue to gradually decline.
Dollar attrition fell for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our dollar attrition rate expressed as the amount of annual order value lost as a percentage of the prior year order value remains in the mid-teens range as it was in the third quarter. Given that approximately half of the value of our annual invoicing occurs in the fourth quarter, strong Q4 renewals will help our top line growth in FY12. 
Turning to pricing, when we compare the net price per seat for the professional enterprise and unlimited service additions over the past eight quarters, we continue to see very little change. While others in our market compete largely on price, we continue to focus on value and technologies, like Chatter, Jigsaw, to differentiate our products.
A slightly weaker dollar in Q4 added a nominal $1 million to our sequential revenue performance. But the year-over-year comparison included a currency headwind of approximately $4 million. In local currency terms, fourth quarter revenue grew 30% year-over-year. 
We showed excellent growth in all regions. In the Americas, revenue rose by 26% to approximately $309 million. In Europe, revenue of roughly $83 million was up 30% in dollars and 41% in local currency. And in Asia, revenue of $65 million rose 43% in dollars and 35% in local currency. In total, international revenue comprised 32% of total revenue, and that's versus 31% in fiscal 2010. 
Growing our International business is an important goal for Salesforce.com, and we continue to focus our sales and marketing resources in the largest software markets in the world. Our product mix is also becoming more diversified over time. To give you one Q4 data point led by our service and platform cloud, approximately 35% of new business in the quarter came from non-sales cloud services, and that compares with 30% in Q4 of last year.
Turning to the income statement. Non-GAAP gross margins were at 82% in the fourth quarter, unchanged from both Q3 and the year-ago quarter. Turning next to OpEx, which I will discuss in non-GAAP terms, at 71%, Q4 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue trended higher from the year-ago quarter. 
Sales and marketing expenses increased to 46% of revenue, up from 44% in FY '10, primarily as a result of three things. First, sales headcount additions; second, commission expense, because we had a significantly higher percentage of our sales teams being above quota on accelerated commission rates; and third, of course, the biggest Dreamforce in our history, which as predicted, had a net EPS impact of around $0.05 in the quarter. 
R&D expenses increased to 11% of revenue versus 9% a year ago, primarily as a result of increased headcount, both through organic hiring as well as by our acquisitions. And finally, G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue remains flat at 14% of revenue.
During the quarter, we added roughly 550 people, to finish the quarter with just over 5,300 employees. Approximately 65 of those additions came via acquisitions that closed in Q4. Year-over-year, our employee population has grown by over 1,300, including just over 200 from acquisitions. The great majority of our hiring continues to be in growth critical functions like sales and R&D.
Non-GAAP operating margin of 11% was down from 15% a year ago in Q4. But last year, we added about 160 people in the fourth quarter. And as I just said, this year we added 550 people. So hopefully, it's clear what's changed.
Importantly for the fourth quarter, we still delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our guidance range. At the beginning of Q4, we guided non-GAAP EPS at $0.27 to $0.28, and then reduced that range by $0.03 as a result of our acquisitions of Heroku and Dimdim. 
Our $0.31 non-GAAP EPS results for Q4 included a onetime tax benefit of approximately $8 million or approximately $0.055 associated with the extension of the federal R&D tax credit. We ended the year with a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. 
Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was just over $166 million, an increase of roughly 81% from a year ago. Our fourth quarter results included approximately $25 million in a onetime benefit related to a recent tax change on the accounting treatment of employee stock expense. I'd like to emphasize that this should be really viewed as a windfall on affecting our overall cash performance for the quarter and the year and our growth rate for fiscal 2012.
For the full year, we generated more than $459 million in operating cash flows, that's an increase of more than 69% from a year ago. Capital expenditure for the quarter was just under $31 million. The primary drivers of CapEx was certain components of our data center build-outs, primarily here in the U.S. and also leasehold improvements to support our growing employee population. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was also strong at just over $135 million. And that's an increase of roughly 60% from last year. For the full year, our free cash flow was just over $368 million, an increase of 70% from fiscal 2010.
Looking to fiscal 2012, we think operating cash flow will grow in the low to mid-teens percentage-wise for three principal reasons: First, the onetime tax benefit of $25 million that I just mentioned; second, our headcount increase of 850 people in the second half of FY '11 was nearly 3x the number we added in the second half of FY '10, these late year headcount additions will cause cash compensation expenses to grow much more rapidly in the early part of fiscal 2012 than in the corresponding period in fiscal 2011; and finally, company overperformance in Q4 and fiscal 2011 generally will result in higher commission of bonus payouts in Q1 when compared with last year. 
Longer term, we continue to expect operating cash flow to grow at about the same rate as revenue. Focusing on Q1, we expect operating cash flow to be lower than last year for the second and third reasons that I just mentioned a few moments ago.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents, including marketable securities, finished the quarter at approximately $1.4 billion. Despite our strong operating cash performance, cash and equivalents declined by nearly $400 million during the quarter, primarily due to acquisition-related payments totaling approximately $250 million for Heroku and Dimdim, and approximately $270 million paid for our land purchase here in San Francisco. These same two factors were the primary drivers of the significant increases to goodwill and property and equipment, respectively, in the quarter.
Our strong fourth quarter new business pushed deferred revenue to $935 million. That's an increase of 33% year-over-year. This was our strongest growth rate in nine quarters. The result included a $1 million foreign exchange benefit year-over-year and an approximately $3 million sequential headwind on currency. 
Invoiced durations remain consistent with historical trends. And consistent with the last several years, we expect seasonal invoicing patterns to reduce deferred revenue from Q4 to Q1. And as another Q4 data point, our unbilled deferred revenue, which is off balance sheet, was approximately $1.5 billion, and that's an increase of roughly 50% from the previous year end amount.
Turning to the outlook. We discussed in the past our goal of improving non-GAAP operating margins by 100 to 300 basis points each year. Clearly, the six acquisitions in total that we made in fiscal 2011 had a significant impact to margins, adding roughly $15 million of revenue or $45 million of expense. So we came in under that goal but we think for the very best reasons. 
What you can see reflected in our third quarter, and of course our year end deferred revenue balances, was a significant uptick in demand and amazing sales execution against that demand. And as Marc described earlier when he discussed our operating principles, we decided to use that overachievement to dramatically increase our sales and development capacity in the fourth quarter.
So with that context, we now expect 2012 revenue in the range of approximately $2.03 billion to $2.05 billion, while non-GAAP EPS for the full year is expected to be at $1.35 to $1.38. Earnings are expected to be somewhat more back-end loaded during the year due to the aggressive second half hiring that I've already discussed. 
We expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2012.  For Q1, we're projecting revenue in the range of approximately $480 million to $482 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.26 to $0.27. 
One other important change to note this year is the timing of Dreamforce. This year, Dreamforce will be in Q3 instead of Q4 as it has been for the past two years. To be clear, that net cost will now move from Q4 to Q3 and will likely have about a $0.06 impact on Q3 EPS in fiscal 2012. That range is likely to keep Q3 non-GAAP EPS approximately flat year-over-year and result in Q4 EPS being the highest of the year.
All of the underlying assumptions for our non-GAAP guidance as well as our GAAP guidance and the complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found on our earnings press release. 
With that, let me thank you all for joining us today, and I'd like to open the call up for questions."

So that gives the platform a little bit more opportunity to grow faster. But both of these are such fast-growing products, it's really impossible for me to know. I mean, we've just seen spectacular growth of the Service Cloud, as you probably know, in the last two years. Since we purchased InStranet, it's been a huge accelerator for the Service Cloud. We also bought a tremendous new product called Activa, which adds chat capabilities to the Service Cloud. And we just have great leadership on that team. It's been a tremendous transformation for the company, and the speed of growth has been awesome. And then we have the platform. And with the platform, of course, we also just added Heroku, which was an incredible acquisition. It's technology like I've never seen. You've already seen it delivering Ruby on Rails as a service, and you're going to start to see some amazing capabilities from that group as we head towards Dreamforce. And so both of these are just very fast-growing product lines. Graham, would you like to add to that?"

Heather, what's going on with our customers is they are just seeing this dramatic shift to a new type of IT. Some of them calling it the consumerization of IT. I really call it Cloud 2. Where Cloud 1 was really about low cost and fast and easy to use, now we really see this huge shift to the next version of Cloud 2, which is social, driven a lot by a billion people on Facebook and Twitter and mobile with -- you see iPad's growth has been unbelievable, and analysts saying that they are going to see another 50 million tablets in use this year, sold this year in addition to what's already been sold. And then we're going to see really open systems. And I think this has been a huge opportunity for us. A lot of our customers had been very worried about the old vendors, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, locking them in to their old proprietary standards like .NET and C#. And they've been looking for these new open standards like Ruby and Java, and that's where we've really tried to deliver. And we're really focused on this next paradigm of computing and moving customers to that as quickly as possible, and the uptake has been awesome. And then when customers look to build those apps, they're using our platform because our platform lets you build these apps that are inherently social, mobile and open. And that's why I think the platform is exciting. That's also why I think the Service Cloud is exciting as well. And I think as we head to next week, it's going to be a big week. On March 2, we're going to see the next iPad release, which will be awesome. And then on March 3, we're going to talk about our strategy and our vision for how to take their growth and their acceleration and their momentum with that product and others and help CIO succeed. We're seeing more CIO interest in deploying iPads in the enterprises than ever before. It's phenomenal. Hope that answers your question."

It was a monster quarter. And the deal flow in the quarter was just awesome. And a lot of that, I think, really has to do with a couple of things. First, I think we have seen a broad recovery from a couple of years ago, where existing customers were not adding new users. And I think that we can safely say we're over that hurdle, and that really contributed to this recovery. Two, we continue to see just really strong demand from existing customers. You've seen existing customers go enterprise-wide, where before we were at point solution, like with Dell, we had 30,000 users. We've got 100-and-something thousand users there now because of Chatter. So we're helping to transform our customers' business. We want our customers to be more successful, and we can give them an enterprise-wide transformational story about how to bring in these new technologies like their tablets and their mobile devices and their social paradigm and become better companies. And that is just being really well received. And when you compare that against what our competitors' position, it's pretty and completely highly differentiated. I mean, it's a different story. So I think that you see a broad recovery where you get existing customers adding again, which is great because we have almost 100,000 customers so every time you have one customer add a user, it's tremendous. Two, you've got a situation where our product is helping our customers go enterprise-wide. And three, we've got a tremendously well differentiated solution against the competition. And those three things, I think, are really working well together, and that's what we've really worked for this year.

Clearly, it's 28%, and then we've tapered that towards the back half of the year. And I think, clearly, we have less visibility to the back half of the year than Q1 and Q2. And I think it's fair to say we're anticipating, and I think recent events would support our theory, that it's still going to -- we live in a very volatile world, so we've sort of taken a little more of a cautious view on FX this year. Because I think we all view the euro as being a very volatile sort of currency right now against the dollar, or you could say it the other way around, I think. There's a lot of volatility. And then secondly, I think yes, we've added a huge amount of sales capacity. But obviously, as we talked about at length at our analysts events and so on, there's a ramp time for salespeople. So we've hired a lot in the second half, but we'll be working hard to get them productive. So we'll see them really come on stream in terms of revenue more in the second half of the year. And then, Kash, I think you've just got to -- I'll emphasize again that $25 million that ended up in Q4, and that's kind of unusual, single, onetime item. I think it's really best to assess our cash guidance and our commentary taking that number out. That gives you a better sense of really what's going on, and I gave you several other reasons why we just think first half cash flow is going to be a little tighter than it was in the same period last year."

I mentioned some numbers specifically. When we close a large transaction, it's rare that we're going into an account for the first time and closing a large deal without them really knowing us.

The company is really only a few blocks away from our headquarters. And when you walk into the office, when you meet the founders, when you hear about the technical vision, it's just stunning. And it's computer science that I've just never seen before. Using this kind of strong development model organized around the Jet with Ruby on Rails has given these Ruby developers the ability to build and deliver applications just more rapidly and more successfully than ever before. And I think they're adding about 3,000 new apps a week, if I am correct in that. I don't think we mentioned in the script, I mean, I have to check the exact number, but that's the last thing that I remember from Byron [Sebastian]. And I'll tell you that the reason, of course, that we bought the technology is not just that we're huge fans of Ruby, but we're really huge fans of Heroku. And what we saw there was them running multiple languages already. And we're not ready to announce new languages. We're not ready to talk about what they are. We're not ready to start revealing which languages are next down the Heroku pipeline, but we do hope to have a full range of languages on Heroku by the time we get to Dreamforce. And we're empowering and enabling that team. We're running that as an independent organization. We're giving them the autonomy and authority. We certainly do not pretend to be experts in managing and working with developers. That's why we did do the largest acquisition of our time because we think it's a game changer on Platform as a Service. And for the customers that we've rolled it out to, to the customers they already have, they agree. And if you haven't checked out Heroku and if your company's not building apps on Heroku, you should definitely give it a look."

When we talk about it as ki",514,"One of the things that's really unique about Salesforce, and for those of you who have studied our technology in depth, you probably know Salesforce, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Collaboration Cloud and the platform. When we talk about it as kind of separate clouds or separate product lines, it's not. It's one integrated service. And mostly, we communicated using these brand names because that's what customers usually expect from other vendors. They get a server or multiple servers and their independent code basis. And the thing that's interesting about our technology is that they are really one-code based and they're one integrated offering. That's why when we do a major upgrade, everything gets upgraded at the same time, three or four times a year. And it's very often that a Sales Cloud user will start to integrate and use knowledge management from the Service Cloud, or a Service Cloud user will obviously start to use contact and account functionality from the Sales Cloud. And both of those guys, for sure, are going to draw from the platform to customize and to build that Apex Code that provides the referential integrity of the stored procedures. We have a deeply integrated data management technology, deeply integrated application development and deployment functionality. And then, collaboration. When we built Chatter, Chatter is deeply integrated into these services. It's in the database, it's in the platform, it's in all of the apps and it's its own independent app. And the power of that is, if you're building on Database.com you can tap into profiles and feeds. If you're in Salesforce, in the Sales Cloud, you're going to be using Chatter. If you're in the Service Cloud, you're using Chatter. And these are not independent technology steps, it's all one integrated thing. And so what you end up seeing is this broad uptick of this technology across-the-broad. And then when we find killer new technology that just really works, like Apex or like Chatter is the best example, you just see it take off throughout all the customers. That's why over 80,000 of them are now running the Chatter. And the only things that we have that are independent tend to be things that we buy, and then we try to integrate those very rapidly so that it's the same unified experience. In some cases, we're going to keep them lightly coupled. Like, for example, with Jigsaw, we're providing native integration in Salesforce.com, but the core Jigsaw service is separate. That's been a huge home run for us. We just can't believe the success we've seen with the Jigsaw capability. It's one of the core differentiators of the Sales Cloud in addition to the platform, in addition to Chatter, in addition to our iPad and our mobility support. Or Heroku is probably the best example right now with service that's truly independent and fully disintermediated from all of our other services. But even with Heroku, you're going to see tighter and tighter integration into all of our services because that's the way we architect that Salesforce."

And I've obviously been a huge cheerleader and fan of the technology. But at the end of the day, we really saw two things that really motivated us. One was just the huge support of Facebook and Twitter. I mean, combined, those guys have got almost a billion users, and they're training people on how to use these services. And we know that, that's the way customers want to operate inside these organizations today. You look at those benefits of using Chatter, email use down a third in Chatter organizations. That's incredible. Median is down 25%, access to customer information up 50%. Those are some unbelievable numbers. I've never seen technology do that before. And then two, we saw here the independent social networks emerge, and some of those emerging inside our customers. But the reason we've been able to replace those, like, for example, in Dell and SunGard and others, is because they're not integrated with the corporate data. They're not integrated in the data, they're not integrated in the applications, they're not integrated into the fundamental business processes of our customers. And when we show them the combination of those two things and then running them in the mobile world, it's been a game changer. The only thing I use to run Salesforce is Chatter on the iPad. I mean, I get everything I need from that. And it's been transformational for me, and I know for so many of our customers as well."

I think that, that was kind of one of the things that got misunderstood at Dreamforce and I'll talk more about that next week in New York. But our four core product lines are the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Platform and, of course, the Collaboration Cloud. And these are our four core areas of focus for the company, and continue to be. As part of that, of course, there's other products that fit into that. Like for example, we have Jigsaw, which is a huge part of the Sales Cloud. We've got Heroku, which is a huge part of the platform. As is our Remedy Force, which is our efforts with BMC. They've built, as you know, natively on our platform for the last several years and have now delivered Remedy, which is help desk as a service, moving their mainstream product over to the Force.com platform. And that power of those four clouds, I really think that it's this unified strategy that we are really helping our customers to manage and share all their customer information in the cloud. I mean, at the end of the day, that is our vision. That's what we're helping our customers do. They look to us to manage and share that customer information in ways that they never did before, and we're making it better with Chatter. We're helping them to augment them, in many cases, with custom applications using our platform. But over and over again, we're the source of the customer information in our customers' databases. And they look to us to manage that data really well for them, whether it's the Sales Cloud, whether it's the Service Cloud, whether it's Collaboration, whether it's platform. And those are our four points of investment. I think because we have that clarity of focus, we've been able to do so well. I think it's why we've been able to make the right acquisitions this year. When you look at the Sales Cloud, we've made core acquisitions there like with Jigsaw and Etacts. When we look at the Service Cloud, as I mentioned, the core acquisitions like InStranet and Activa. When we look at the platform, core acquisitions like Symbian and like Heroku. And even in the Collaboration space, when we look at core acquisitions like we just did with Dimdim. That's how we think about our business around those four clouds moving forward. And because they're tightly integrated, the customers just tremendously benefit from that innovation and technology momentum."

Our first quarter was indeed a fantastic kick off to fiscal year 2012, continuing the momentum we experienced in fiscal year 2011. And I'm thrilled to report that just one quarter into our fiscal year, we have crossed the threshold of the $2 billion annual revenue run rate. As you can see from the revenue, we are absolutely delighted now to be at a new level of performance of our company, and our revenue growth rate is accelerating.
Let me begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights of the quarter. Revenue of $504 million was 34% from the year ago quarter. Deferred revenue, also accelerated to $915 million, a 38% year-over-year increase, incredible. And we also delivered $140 million of operating cash flow, and over the past 12 months, we've generated roughly $460 million in operating cash, an increase of more than 40% from a year ago period.
Finally, David, we are pleased to be able to raise revenue guidance to $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, a significant increase once again to our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2012, and our second increase this year, the first one after we acquired Radian6.
Now I'd like to say a few words about Japan and the Japan disaster before we begin. First of all, let me personally and on behalf of salesforce.com and our employees and our shareholders and our condolences to the victims of the Japan disaster. Our sadness is overwhelming, and we are deeply with you, and we send our wishes for a quick recovery.
Now like many companies, of course, our business is also affected by the earthquake in Japan. However, the diligence of our Japan team ended the quarter closer to their original plan than we could really have ever expected. 
In fact, one of our 10 largest transactions for the quarter was from Japan. It's also important to note that none of our Japanese customers, including our largest customer, the Japanese government, suffered any service interruptions because of the disaster. salesforce.com delivered 100% reliability and availability during the disaster.
This is truly a testament to the power of our cloud computing model, which we think will play a key role in Japan's building efforts and rebuilding efforts, and we'll be talking more about that next week. I'll be in Tokyo, and I will be making several announcements about our commitment to Japan, the opening of our new Japan data center and new strategic agreements that we're reaching with customers in Japan.
We are truly doubling down on our commitment to Japan. We've raised more than $1 million for the victims of the disaster, and in my discussions next week, we'll be having several strategic announcements that we hope will inspire Japan's innovators, Japan's customers, as well as our global shareholders.  And I look forward to speaking to all of you from our headquarters in Tokyo next week.
Our financial momentum in the quarter was powered by our strategic decision to bring social, mobile and open cloud technologies of what we have been calling for over a year, Cloud 2 to the enterprise. And third parties agree that these trends are really the future of our industry. 
A recent independent survey by McKinsey and Company reported that companies that are using what we call Cloud 2, or social networking technologies within the enterprise that are more flexible, collaborate better, achieve greater markets share and have higher margins.
It's just a very exciting shift for companies all over the world were able to bring in the power of mobility, the power of social and the power of open, coupled with the cloud computing model that we've been talking about now for over a decade. And in the February report, Morgan Stanley confirmed that enterprises are embracing mobile devices. 51% of the CIOs they surveyed expected to buy tablets for employees this year, and another 16% will allow employees to use their own devices to access corporate data. 
Now I can tell you that personally, in the quarter, I met with over 170 customers, many of them in small lunches and dinners, as well as in one-on-one meetings throughout the quarter. I spent an extended amount of time in the field and around the world with our customers. And the reason why is because this shift is so big, so broad and so unique that I really felt I personally had to get out and really talk to customers about what they're going through, and what amazed me was I would say approximately or more than half, certainly more than half of all of the attendees brought their iPads in to meetings with me. That really blew me away. 
Now of course, while I'm in these meetings with them I have an iPad as well and I'm showing them Salesforce Chatter on their iPad, and that's important because as you know, Chatter is the foundation of our Cloud 2 Mission. As a stand-alone product, Chatter opens stores for us with these C level executives, and they can see the benefits of open, transparent workplaces and newbie into this new social enterprise model.
But more important, the private and secure social network has supercharged all of our offerings in sales, with the Sales Cloud and service with the Service Cloud and data with Jigsaw, and our Force.com platform, with Heroku and of course, with our new offerings, with Radian6. 
And now, all of our customers have a media to access to a social layer, where regardless of whether you're using Salesforce, or more than that one of 20,000 custom apps built on Force.com. And the response from our customers as I've traveled around, and feedback from all of our executives to this vision of Cloud 2 is really amazing. In Q1, we added 5,400 net new customers, taking the global community of our core apps and platforms to more than 97,710 customers, a 26% year-over-year increase in customers and of course, that does not include Heroku, that does not include Manymoon, that does not include Radian6. That's 97,700 core-paying customers. We obviously have many more paying customers and of course, our foundation has free customers as well which are the nonprofits and the NGOs that we offer our products for free to, and we're also offering our products for free to many companies affected in the Japan disaster, and we'll be talking about that in Tokyo next week.
Today, we see customers buying more. There is definitely a higher buying environment going on, and more kinds of our products. In fact, 1/3 of new business in the first quarter came from nonsales cloud services. A couple great examples are two of our marquee transactions in the quarter, which are Groupon, which is the newer company in Chicago, and Bank of America. 
Groupon is the world's fastest-growing company, offering daily deals on events and food and services in 44 countries, and while they initially talk to us about their Sales Cloud, which has been the heart of their growth of their sales and marketing efforts, we showed them how the platform, Force.com and a full range of services could supercharge their business and deliver the quality and scale they need to maintain their phenomenal growth rate. And now the Force.com platform will cut nearly every aspect of Groupon's business, whether it's their management of merchants, the core of their business, their city planning and merchandising efforts, their customer service and consumer support, whether it's the development of their coupons, Force.com will help them to re-architecting their company for the future.
And Bank of America has entrusted us the thousands of Service Cloud seats, enabling its home loan service reps to quickly and accurately solve problems across all of their support channels and customer touch points, and we're also delivering tremendous successes and seeing momentums in companies like General Electric, where a healthy major divisions, including GE Capital, and GE Energy and GE Transportation, and GE Healthcare, find new, unique ways to use our apps and platforms form deeper relationships with their customers. Our flagship Sales Cloud continue to crush the competition in the quarter.
Microsoft's desperate strategy of undercutting pricing with undifferentiated with highly proprietary products, basically has had the same impact on our business, as the Windows tablet and Zune did against the iPad and iTouch. We call Microsoft strategy the Zune strategy. 
It's the process that they can take a proprietary, undifferentiated offering at a lower price and somehow, they can impact on a high-value, highly differentiated product that's loved by customers. Microsoft has not changed our exceptional win rates or affected our average selling price with the Zune strategy.
Customers continue to want visionary products that give them a competitive advantage, not the need to Zune-type projects, locking them in these old, proprietary desktop driven platforms that are dying off.
Against Microsoft, we won significant new, our add-on business at companies like Eli Lilly, Cargill, Honeywell, Ingram Micro, Shanghai Airport in Singapore, Bombardier, Banc of Espirito Santo, Biotech, Finland, Greenway Medical, LQ Management, LXP, Misys, Monumental Sports Entertainment, and the New Zealand Defense Force. These wins against Microsoft were new wins, but we also signed companies that have bought the Microsoft Zune CRM, tried it and threw it out, and customers included the Advantage, brokerage, Support Services, Andy's List, CHC Helicopter, DemandTec and the OC Tanner. 
Against Oracle, which is trying to convince customers to low proprietary software onto proprietary mainframes, the strategy made popular by IBM in the '60s, we won significant new, our add-on business with customers such as Bridgestone, Office Depot, Sony, and Suntech, and believe there's still bring an opportunity ahead with millions of businesses around the world who are looking to lead these proprietary models. The combination of Chatter, the seamless integration of Jigsaw data and mobility, set the Sales Cloud apart. It's a unique offering. It's highly differentiated, it's innovative, it's creative and it's one of the most highly rated CRM services in the world today.
Certainly, it's the most loved. We also saw a customer velocity in our Service Cloud, our fastest growing business in the first quarter. Today, approximately 16,000 companies are using The Service Cloud to connect with customers across both traditional and new service channels, including e-mail, telephone, social media and the Web. 
In March, we unveiled Service Cloud 3, with select companies directly engaged with their customers over Facebook, Twitter, and the broad range of social communities and leveraging new mobile capabilities like Apple space. Essentially, Service Cloud 3 let's customers go where their customers are, in the cloud, provide them with the customer service, the call-center, the contact center, the portal, the technology they need to provide that customer service capability. salesforce Service Cloud 3 is a uniquely differentiated and highly successful product him and just last month, The Service Cloud is positioned in the leader's quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for CRM customer service and contact centers, pretty incredible considering this is a relatively new entrant from salesforce.com to see its Service Cloud so highly rated by Gartner in the Magic Quadrant.
Major wins and expansions in The Service Cloud during the quarter included: Bank of America, and Nissan North America, Paychex, Mining, RBS, Script, Sony. And finally, the Force.com platform continues to be the only proven enterprise Cloud Platform as a Service on the market today, delivering the highest levels of reliability, scalability and performance, delivering our customers with the tools they need to build their own cloud applications to help integrate their products into the cloud, and to help them rapidly deploying new technologies using Force.com. And because Chatter is integrated into Force.com, the platform gives developers and customers instant access to these next-generation social capabilities.
But more than that, the platform also provides the foundation for apps that are mobile and open. Last quarter, we introduced database.com, the first enterprise database built for the cloud, which includes developers, to build write apps in any language, any platform on any device, and do it all in the cloud. We also acquired Heroku, the leading Platform as a Service for writing apps, and Ruby On Rails, and Heroku was designed from the start to support multiple languages, and we hope to be talking about our strategy in offering many, many languages in the cloud using the Heroku capability.
We believe Force.com and Heroku will attract the diverse community of developers and partners who want to create Cloud 2 apps, and it's already happening. Over the last 12 months, we added more than 130,000 developers, creating a global community of more than 380,000. Our open strategy will push that even further as more developers write enterprise cloud apps, whether it's using Ruby or Heroku, whether it's job on VMforce, or whether it's apex on Force.com, and we're now managing more than 1 billion lines of code, using these technologies from our customers on our cloud, 1 billion lines of code.
Customers now building on the Force.com platform or that have extended their deployment include: Genentech, Hitachi, Medtronic, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan, and the UnitedHealthcare Services. And our customers and partners continue to increase their usage of our platforms. 
During the quarter, Force.com delivered 31 billion transactions, that is 31 billion complex database transactions for our customers, up more than 60% from a year ago, and that's almost 2.5x Twitter's 13 billion tweets in the same period.
Last year, salesforce.com educated the market on the benefits of social collaboration in the enterprise. We've shown how Chatter is transforming the way companies work and employees doing their jobs and improving productivity, sharing insights, connecting with experts and making better decisions, all in realtime. 
A new Chatter deployments in the first quarter included: Akamai, Cigna, L'Oréal, Seagate, VMware and Vodafone. And as companies discover the breakthroughs into mitigation and collaboration that Chatter provides, they're taking it across the enterprise. Chatter is also helping salesforce.com reach entirely new customers, giving us a pipeline for selling other products and new services. 
Customers expanding their deployments of Chatter in the first quarter included: GlaxoSmithKline, '02, Sony, and Starwood Hotels, all deploying Chatter in the first quarter. In addition, our largest Chatter deployment at Phil and SunGard, new enterprise-wide deployments now include Avaya and Bausch & Lomb, VMC, Juniper, Kelly, Symantec and many, many others. 
By leveraging our cloud strategy, we're becoming a more strategic partner to our customers, and now when I need with CEOs and CIOs of the world's biggest companies, they want to hear how we help them, use these social mobile and open cloud computing to partner and become more innovative and responsive, so they can serve your own customers and become social enterprises.  That's why we're investing so aggressively for growth in people and technology and in partnerships. Of course with people over the last 12 months, we added 1,400 employees, which will help us to sell even more into the future. 
And second, with technology, our earlier this month, we completed our purchase of Radian6, the leading platform for monitoring, engaging the millions of conversations happening every day, on Facebook, on Twitter, on social communities, on websites. Soon, customers will be able to monitor and join in these public conversations from within our products, including Chatter. 
And if you haven't had the opportunity of the Radian6 and it's spectacular products, and one of the most exciting technologies I've ever had the opportunity to work with, you can check it out yourself at Radian6.com, and monitor how your brands, how your employees, how your companies and your competitors are interacting throughout the Internet. It's a realtime view into the Internet that makes all of our customers more competitive.
We believe this is a massive opportunity to redefine cloud computing. It's giving customers the social intelligence they want with the business context they need, and it opens the opportunity for us to sell more strategically in the marketing departments. It further differences The Sales Cloud, The Service Cloud. It further differentiates the platform and Chatter. 
And then finally, with partnerships in the first quarter that we announced the strategic Allianz with into it, which will integrate Salesforce CRM in their QuickBooks, financial applications, and we sell it to the Intuit space of 4 million QuickBoook customers. This alliance dramatically extends their reach into small business, with a partner that's the gold standard for small business computing.
And as we look for future small business initiatives, like our recent acquisition of ManyMoon, we see that as a growing and strategic part of our business as well. Today, customers, developers and ISVs like BMC and Computer Associates view us as a strategic partner, who could help them understand and profit from social computing. It's been an exciting time for us to build these strategic relations with ISVs and you'll see many more relationships as we head towards Dreamforce.
So now before I close, I want to invite you to join me in San Francisco on August 30 through September 2 for the world's largest cloud computing event, Dreamforce 2011. We'll have a lot of exciting announcements between now and Dreamforce. And Dreamforce will be the culmination and discussion and revelation of what is the social enterprise for our customers. 
Dreamforce will have the biggest selection of cloud computing products ever under one roof, and the largest gathering of cloud experts. More than 450 sessions on cloud computing, it is the place to learn about the next generation of cloud and to collaborate with others in the industry, and I will look forward to seeing all of you there. And with that, I'll hand it over to Graham."
122917,132269343,130690,"Salesforce.com, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 19, 2011",2011-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an exciting start to fiscal 2012. Revenues of $504 million rose 34% year-over-year, well above our outlook entering the quarter. This sex overachievement was a result of three factors. First, the strong new business performance that M",1991,"Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an exciting start to fiscal 2012. Revenues of $504 million rose 34% year-over-year, well above our outlook entering the quarter. This sex overachievement was a result of three factors. First, the strong new business performance that Marc described earlier, second, there was significant strengthening in the year in the yen, and then finally, continued reduction in our attrition rate.
On the attrition front, our dollar attrition when compared to year ago, continued its steady decline from its peak back in the second quarter of fiscal  2010. But remains in the mid-teen percentage. Obviously in improving global economy, it's helping customer retention rates but given its importance, we're continuing to invest in areas critical to customer success, such as customer onboarding and enhanced training and usage analysis and predictive monitoring.
Because the cost to renew and grow existing customers is much lower than the cost of acquiring new ones, these efforts are an extremely important part of our long-term growth strategy.
Turning next to geographic performance, we saw strengthen all three major geographies. In Q1, Americas revenue rose 31% year-over-year to approximately $340 million. International revenue rose 40% in dollars, and 53% in constant currency versus the year ago quarter, and now represents roughly 33% of total company revenue. That's up from 31% a year ago.
The stronger euro and yen contributed roughly two points of FX benefits to our reported company revenue growth in Q1.
Looking at some regional details, in EMEA, revenues of $94 million rose 41% in dollars, and 36% in constant currency and in Asia, revenue increased by 38% in dollars and 29% in constant currency to roughly $70 million.
Marc already mentioned other business and looking ahead, it's difficult to project the extent or duration of the current slowdown. Our revenue growth in Asia was affected in Q1, and we've tried to factor in a realistic forecast for Japan for the remainder of the year. Fortunately, the strength of our other businesses in the Americas and EMEA has resulted in still being able to raise revenue guidance overall.
Looking on to the income statement, first quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 82% remained essentially flat both sequentially and year-over-year. There are a couple of points to highlight in Q1. First, due to our strong production growth trend, we continue to make investments in our service delivery infrastructure. 
Q1 we had the full expense impact of our third and fourth U.S. data centers, as well as some early cost associated with the buildout of our Japan data center.  The net affect of these investments was to reduce year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin for our subscription subversion business by roughly two points.
Offsetting the impact of these investments was the continuing revenue mix shift away from our lower margin special services business. As our partners take an ever increasing share of the implementation services.
Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 11% was unchanged from Q4 but down five points from a year ago. Three primary factors are driving the year-over-year increase in operating expenses. First, we have acquired seven companies since Q1 last year. While Jigsaw is on track to get to non-GAAP break even in the six to eight quarter timeframe we discussed last year, there of any acquisitions are dilutive to operating margins. Nevertheless, we believe these acquisitions are important to extend our Cloud 2 vision around social, mobile and open, and the strength of our Q1 performance reflects this believe.
Second, as we indicated in Q4, accelerated hiring in the second half of last year is helping new business momentum but increasing expenses. Q1, we really felt the full effect of the roughly 850 employees we added in Q3 and Q4. 
In addition, we added approximately 200 people in the first quarter, taking our employee population to just over 5,500. Because growth is our top priorities, and because our people fuel that growth, you should expect is the continued to hire aggressively for the remainder of fiscal 2012.
And finally, in Q1, we spent significantly on marketing programs. Our first ever Superbowl Lab, our Wall Street Journal, Chatter ad campaign, our large Cloudforce events in New York and Paris were among the many investments made in our brand building awareness of our industry-leading products. 
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 35%. As a result of the Radian6 acquisition, we expect to incur a slightly lower overall tax rate for fiscal 2012. We now estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 30% in Q2, and 33% in Q3 and Q4 for a full-year estimated non-GAAP rate of 33%.  This decrease in our estimated 2012 tax rate will add $0.02 to EPS in Q2, and $0.01 to EPS in each of Q3 and Q4 for a total net benefit of $0.04 for the year, which I'll cover in my guidance comments later.
The diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 in Q1, about $0.01 higher above our guidance range, but it was down 7% from the $0.30 we recorded in Q1 last year. 
I'd like to just spend a minute on discussing our operating principles as we head into fiscal 2012.  We're clearly managing the business to maximize revenue growth as our number one priority. We've just passed the $2 billion revenue run rate, and our focus on getting to $3 billion as rapidly as possible. We want to invest in distribution capacity, product development, service delivery to provide our customers and prospects with strategic partnership they need, as they transform their businesses with the cloud model. We believe that our accelerating growth rate reflects our customers' desire to transformation and the market shift to cloud computing.
Historically, we've discussed 100 to 300 basis points of operating margin improvement each year as one of our financial goals. We achieve that goal consistently in fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010. However, during those years, our only significant acquisition was InStranet. 
Over the past four quarters, as I mentioned earlier, we've completed seven acquisitions, including Jigsaw, Heroku and now Radian6. So while we'll always focus on increasing operational efficiency, our efforts does not necessarily visible in our reported operating margin while we're adding strategic, fast-growing but nevertheless, dilutive acquisitions to expand our Cloud 2 vision.
So our approach for fiscal 2012, is to provide quarterly and full-year revenue and earnings guidance and to deliver on that guidance, to the extent they have upside on revenue in any particular quarter, we look to invest that upside in accelerating our growth through hiring, marketing programs and data center capacity. If we execute well, we will have higher revenue growth and slightly lower operating margins, but still hit our earnings goals. Fundamentally, we believe that investing in growth is the best way to create long-term shareholder value.
Now onto cash flow and balance sheet. First quarter operating cash generation was $140 million, down just slightly from last year's number of $143 billion. As I discussed on our last call, higher sales commission and bonus payouts from our strong fiscal 2011 finish, together with the increased hiring I mentioned a while back, affected our first quarter cash flow. 
Capital spending was $27 million in Q1, primarily the result of leasehold improvements in three different office locations and investments in our service delivery infrastructure.
Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $112 million in the quarter, that's down 15% from last year. Our definition of CapEx for this purpose excludes cash outflows relating to land activity and campus building improvement, which is just $1 million in the first quarter.
As we look that are made of the year, our strong first quarter operating cash flow invoicing gives me confidence to raise our operating cash flow estimate. We now expect full-year operating cash flow to grow at a mid- to high-teens percentage rate, up from our prior guidance of low to mid-teen percentage rate. Given our business model, we believe operating cash flow continues to be an important measure of our success.
Turning to the balance sheet, total cash and equivalents come include a short and long-term marketable securities, finished the quarter at roughly $1.5 billion, that's up about $115 million from Q4 but down approximately $379 million from Q1 last year, primarily as a result of our acquisition activity in the past four quarters. 
Please remember that we already paid approximately $285 million in early May as part of the Radian6 purchase consideration.
Our $575 million of convertible notes are significantly in the money, and it's important to understand that the note conversion feature increased our fully-diluted share count this quarter by approximately 3 million shares. 
However, please remember that the hedge we executed at the same time as these notes will eliminate all but roughly 500,000 shares of this dilution when the notes reach maturity in January 2015.
Also, please note that because the conversion trigger provision was met at the end of Q4 and at the end of Q1, the convertible notes are now shown under current liabilities.
Deferred revenue finished the quarter at roughly $915 million, that's an increase of 38% from the year ago quarter, our largest increase since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Sequentially, deferred revenue declined by $20 million, a result that included approximately $15 million of sequential FX benefit, and about $21 million of FX benefit versus Q1 last year. 
Historically, deferred revenue tends to be roughly flat from Q1 to Q2. This year, given our strong Q1 results and some significant currency benefit in our first quarter number, we expect deferred revenue to be flat-to-down slightly through the end of Q2.
And finally, strong invoicing pushed Q1 receivables up 47% year-over-year to approximately $271 million. The result was a four-day year-over-year increase in DSO to 48 days. This increase was purely a function of the strength of our business in Q1, our first quarter collections were great, and our receivables aging is in good shape.
Let me close with our outlook. I'm very pleased to be able to raise the high-end of our full year revenue outlook by $17 million to a range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion. The high-end of the revenue range represents the year-over-year revenue growth rate of both 30%. 
Please remember that this range includes approximately $20 million of benefit from the adoption of the new revenue Accounting Standard 08-01. The incremental revenue recognized by the new Accounting Standard in Q1 was approximately $1.5 million, but we do expect it affect to ramp up across the quarters this year.  We now project non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.30 to $1.32. This range reflects the $0.11 diluted impact to the Radian6 acquisition, offset by the $0.01 overachievement that we just reported in Q1, and the $0.04 improvement in earnings from our lower estimated effective tax rate that I discussed earlier.
Although we are raising our overall EPS outlook for the year, I would like to remind you that Dreamforce will have a significant impact. We estimate at least $0.06 of EPS in our Q3 results.
Second quarter revenue is projected to be in the range of $526 million to $528 million. This estimate includes approximately $5 million relating to revenue recognized on the cash basis for Radian6. I just want to point out that we have no prior experience at managing Radian6 as receivables. We expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.29 to $0.30 in the second quarter.
Before I close, I remind that all of the underlying assumptions listed in our Q2 and full-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance, as well as our GAAP at us and our assumptions can be found in our earnings press release. Please note that because we've not yet complete of the purchase price of Radian6, our GAAP EPS forecast contains estimates of the Radian6 acquisition accounting.
So with that, I'd like to thank you, all for joining us today and open the call up to your questions. Operator?"

Each of their executives that I've met and their individual employees does have a very unique view and a very powerful view of the future of our industry. It certainly does have this foundation for a marketing cloud for salesforce. It's the right place to start the marketing cloud when you look at today's world. That's been driven by social networks, it's the most part of the marketing is what's going on in these communities, and your brand has become a realtime conversation. It's not about advertising any more. It's not about campaigns, it's not about event. It's all about the conversation on the Internet, and Radian6 is the leader in monitoring and managing that conversation from more than half of the Fortune 100 and they're really just getting going. It's a great team, great product, great technology. And if you haven't seen them, Laura, you get an account, it's Radian6.com. You can sign up with the keywords that are key to you, I call the account that you follow, all the executives you follow, the products you follow, the competitors you follow. You put all that in, and Radian6 is going to give you the information you need to make better decisions. So it really is the beginning of the marketing cloud."

I think that, that is just -- you can see it in our run rate, you can see it in our deferred, you can see the momentum that we have around the world. No success is linear, that's something that Mike Odel always tells me, and I believe that. But I also look at nine quarters now we're accelerating revenue run rate, pretty awesome. And we see a big buying environment out there. And as I said, I met with 170 customers this quarter. They're all buying. And they're all looking to rebuild their enterprises, and we have to execute against that, opportunity, sales execution is a difficult thing as you know. We did make a major investment last year. And we've talked extensively with you about a 40% increase in our distribution organization, the vast majority of that is really probably, you had to come online, and that's, as I've said, publicly before the upside. We have great products, The Sales Cloud, we've got The Service Cloud, we've got Jigsaw, we've got Radian6, we've got the Force.com platform, we've got Chatter, we've got plenty to sell. Customers want this next generation of technology. They want to build these social enterprises, you're going to see me next week in Japan with a major auto manufacturer talking about how we're bringing their products into the social networks. And how cars are becoming your friends in social networks, not just people. And that's true for all of our customers. They're looking at products in terms of how are their products integrated with our technology. We see our customers wanting to become cloud providers, not just Groupon, but a lot of our customers who are maybe traditional products manufacturers, whether it's consumer product goods, or the traditional manufacturing, they want to build products that are operating in the cloud, and the reason why? Their customers are in the cloud, they need to get in the cloud to get their customers. We're that avenue, we're the bridge. How are you going to do that with SAP? How are you going to do that with a Microsoft server? How are you going to do that with an Oracle Exadata mainframe? You just can't do it. And that's where we're getting the action, because customers realize they're going to build new apps with our platform, they're going to deploy new types of social sales, new kind of social service, social marketing with Radian6, please see our social data collection and reporting through Jigsaw, it's a great opportunity. And it's really our sales challenge to get out there and to continue to close the deal, to do like what Laura was saying to create the extraordinary transactions, and that's our opportunity and that's also our challenge."

I mean I think that as I've said, publicly, or if you go to my Wikipedia Page, you can see the report I wrote in 2005 on the President of the United States on that cyber security as a crisis, the prioritization for the government and for a lot of companies. And I think that cyber security is tough. There's no finish line when it comes to cyber security. Everybody's got problems, everybody will have problems. Computers are not perfect, and you've got to double down on cyber security if you're in our business and honestly, if you're in any business. I really think that this is one of the reasons that we are more successful, is because our customers cannot do this. It's tough and there's no finish line when it comes the security, and there is no perfection when it comes to security. So we have to work harder and we have to be a surrogate for a lot of our customers in providing that capability. I think what area that we have a unique model that we have benefited from, is I think every day, baby tour three of our customer show up and do security reviews of us. They're reviewing our data centers, they're reviewing our code, they're reviewing our networks. In many cases, those customers are only doing a couple of security reviews themselves a year. They've got a vendor, I don't know how many vendors Sony has, for example. We're obviously a vendor to Sony, but in terms of cyber security to Sony, how many vendors they have checking their technology in a regular basis. Most companies have a couple, they check a couple of times a year. We're fortunate we've got people checking us everyday. Is that the panacea? Is that going to be the be-all end-all? No, it's not. And so we have to double down everybody does, and if it's as I said, if the Gartner Symposium last year, if security is not your number one issue for your company, it should be. In regards to kind of reliability issues, with Amazon, they obviously had a problem. They got through it. They're obviously is stronger forward, it's one of the benefits of the model. We've had our own the liability issues along the way, I'm sure you remember, and no computer is perfect. But if you look at, for example, our operating history now over 12 years of operating in our service, I think we're about better than any of our customers. I don't know a customer that's had better reliability in operating history than salesforce.com over the last decade. So I think cloud computing is the right model. Will there be issues? Of course.

I want to no our customers using this product, are they managing and storing their data in the system, are we providing value to these customers? And that's why for years now, we've provided the transparency to you, our investors, so that you can also watch these numbers, we're unique in that. Microsoft has no such thing. There is no trust.microsoft.com, it's an oxymoron. There's no trust.oracle.com, there is no trust.SAP.com. The very thought of it makes them cringe in horror. But for us and for you, we need to see trust.salesforce.com to see it at a level of performance, growth, to see when things are going well, to see where things are not going well, to make sure that we're improving, to make sure we have our key our eye on the ball. There's nothing more important to our company than the trust and success of our customers, and that's why we have trust.salesforce.com. And I believe also, as we've seen with the important and critical announcements that have been made by regulators around the world, transparency like we're talking about is going to be critical to cloud computing.

Now there was in terms of deferred revenue, Brent, there was nothing unusual in terms of a shift in our billing mix or anything like that. We had very, very consistent receivables kind of profile in the first quarter. We just had a really, really strong invoicing quarter. And obviously, that's why we feel better about our cash flow forecast for the remainder of the year as well. So no unusual things in the deferred revenue number other than currency, as you mentioned. In terms of attrition, my recollection was when we first started reporting a dollar attrition number, it was sort of in the mid-teens, and I think it went up into the high teens, and now it's sort of come back down at the mid-teens. So I don't have data that sort of dates back three, four, five years even before I was at the company. So it would be pretty difficult I think to go back and reconstruct that. So I've always said I think publicly, we feel with the right set of circumstances, with the right economic backdrop, with the right programs in place, internally, we could get attrition, hopefully, into the low-teens. But as you can tell, even though we are putting alluded to this, economy is definitely improving, it's a slow decline that we just want to keep that steady decline each quarter going."

It's our differentiator, it's our third most used feature by all of our customers. It's really the heart and soul of the company, and kind of just taking on the comments on the database, we don't really make a CRM map. We have a core of a Sales Cloud and a Service Cloud, and when we demo that and show it, it looks like an app, but really it's a platform, it really is about our customers' ability to get in there to customize the tabs, the feel, the screen layouts to write the triggers, the procedures, the remote procedure calls, to add in the social networking, to integrate it with the services that they we use, that tie into our APIs. That's why we bought a company last year, Site Master, because websites have become so important to our customers as an integrated part of their CRM experience. And that's why we bought Heroku. And we look at the platform as a critical part of what we do for our customers and certainly when we talk about these extraordinary transactions that we have, like the ones that we're talking about on the call today, these are platform-driven opportunities. When we're in there, we're winning these deals because when you use our platform, it's just not like anything else that's out there. It's not a fixed app, it's not a fixed app in your e-mail, it's not a fixed app running on your PC, it's a database that lets you manage and share your information to a much lower cost, to integrate it deeply into the social networks and run it on your mobile devices, and this is really what customers want. And they integrate it into your website, and they integrate it into your Internet sites, and they build custom app, and on and on and on. And as we look at the Heatmaps for our customers, we look at how far is the platform driving into their enterprises. We had a customer speaker at our management meeting a couple of weeks ago, and they've put out a heap map of how far we've gone into their enterprise, because there were 15 apps that they have built all into their platforms. And that's very much their strategy in our customers."

It's definitely an innovative step in the history of our industry where you can load software onto a server that may have, not have the level of efficiency that you want as a large corporate customer, and you make that server be able to run multiple applications and multiple databases and multiple operating systems through this virtualization software. And that is virtualization. But that's not cloud computing, right? I mean that's not the public cloud. That's not the low-cost, efficient, shared model, that's not the 100,000 customers that we have running on 2,500 shared PCs, that's not kind of our cloud brethren, right, which are the very fast-growing companies who were delivering services. These are companies who are more running more multi-tenant architectures, that are shared systems that are delivering these applications directly over the Internet to millions of customers around the world.

I'd like to welcome everyone to Salesforce.com's first quarter fiscal year 2012 results call. Joining me to discuss our results today as always are: Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; and Graham Smith, our CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open things up for your questions. As always, I ask as a courtesy to your peers, please limit yourself to one question today.
A complete disclosure of our first quarter results can be found in a press release issued about an hour ago, as well as in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Additional financial information, including detailed historical financial statements and facts, is available on our website.
Our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for both our reported results and our forward guidance can be found in our press release. At times in our prepared comments today or in responses to your questions, we may offer incremental metrics to provide a greater understanding of our business or our quarterly results. Please be advised that some of these disclosures are one time in nature and we may or cannot update those metrics in the future.
Also of importance, beginning in the third quarter, we will no longer be reporting our customer count metric on a quarterly basis. We said we plan to update that metrics when we receive notable milestones. We're making this change because recent acquisitions, primarily Heroku and Manymoon have added a large number of users. Linking those users to specific customer organizations can be extremely challenging and in some cases impossible. As result, we believe our traditional customer metric will become less meaningful overtime. We plan to report the customer metric using our traditional measure one last time in Q2.
With that, let me make this call official with a brief Safe Harbor. The primary purpose of today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fiscal first quarter 2012 performance. Some of our discussion and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
All of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, as well as other as well as other information on potential factors that could affect our financial results are included in our reports filed with the SEC, including our most recent report on Form 10-K, particularly under the heading Risk Factors.
Two access our first quarter press release, including the GAAP to non-GAAP affiliations, rhetorical result, any of our SEC disclosures or simply to learn more about Salesforce.com, I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website. In addition, a webcast of today's call will be available for 90 days and a dial-in replay will be available through June 16.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Marc, please be advised that we may reference certain unreleased services or features that are not available in today's discussion. We can't guarantee that future timing of or availability of these services or features and as such, customers who purchase our services should make their purchase decisions based on services and features that are currently available.
With that, let me turn the call over to Marc to discuss our excellent first quarter results. Marc?"

Our first quarter was indeed a fantastic kick off to fiscal year 2012, continuing the momentum we experienced in fiscal year 2011. And I'm thrilled to report that just one quarter into our fiscal year, we have crossed the threshold of the $2 billion annual revenue run rate. As you can see from the revenue, we are absolutely delighted now to be at a new level of performance of our company, and our revenue growth -- and our revenue growth rate is accelerating.
Let me begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights of the quarter. Revenue of $504 million was 34% from the year-ago quarter. Deferred revenue also accelerated to $915 million, a 38% year-over-year increase. Incredible. And we also delivered $140 million of operating cash flow. And over the past 12 months, we've generated roughly $460 million in operating cash, an increase of more than 40% from a year-ago period.
Finally, David, we are pleased to be able to raise revenue guidance to $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, a significant increase once again to our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2012, and our second increase this year, the first one after we acquired Radian6.
Now I'd like to say a few words about Japan and the Japan disaster before we begin. First of all, let me personally and on behalf of Salesforce.com and our employees and our shareholders, send our condolences to the victims of the Japan disaster. Our sadness is overwhelming, and we are deeply with you, and we send our wishes for a quick recovery.
Now like many companies, of course, our business is also affected by the earthquake in Japan. However, the diligence of our Japan team ended the quarter closer to their original plan than we could really have ever expected.
In fact, one of our 10 largest transactions for the quarter was from Japan. It's also important to note that none of our Japanese customers, including our largest customer, the Japanese government, suffered any service interruptions because of the disaster. Salesforce.com delivered 100% reliability and availability during the disaster.
This is truly a testament to the power of our cloud computing model, which we think will play a key role in Japan's building efforts and rebuilding efforts, and we'll be talking more about that next week. I'll be in Tokyo, and I will be making several announcements about our commitment to Japan, the opening of our new Japan data center and new strategic agreements that we're reaching with customers in Japan.
We are truly doubling down on our commitment to Japan. We've raised more than $1 million for the victims of the disaster, and in my discussions next week, we'll be having several strategic announcements that we hope will inspire Japan's innovators, Japan's customers, as well as our global shareholders. And I look forward to speaking to all of you from our headquarters in Tokyo next week.
Our financial momentum in the quarter was powered by our strategic decision to bring social, mobile and open cloud technologies or what we have been calling for over a year, Cloud 2, to the enterprise. And third parties agree that these trends are really the future of our industry.
A recent independent survey by McKinsey & Company reported that companies that are using what we call Cloud 2, or social networking technologies within the enterprise that are more flexible, collaborate better, achieve greater market share and have higher margins.
It's just a very exciting shift for companies all over the world what we're able to bring in, the power of mobility, the power of social and the power of open, coupled with the cloud computing model that we've been talking about now for over a decade. And in the February report, Morgan Stanley confirmed that enterprises are embracing mobile devices. 51% of the CIOs they surveyed expected to buy tablets for employees this year, and another 16% will allow employees to use their own devices to access corporate data.
Now I can tell you that personally in the quarter, I met with over 170 customers, many of them in small lunches and dinners, as well as in one-on-one meetings throughout the quarter. I spent an extensive amount of time in the field and around the world with our customers. And the reason why is because this shift is so big, so broad and so unique that I really felt I personally had to get out and really talk to customers about what they're going through, and what amazed me was I would say approximately or more than half, certainly more than half of all of the attendees brought their iPads in to meetings with me. That really blew me away.
Now of course, while I'm in these meetings with them I have an iPad as well and I'm showing them Salesforce Chatter on the iPad, and that's important because as you know, Chatter is the foundation of our Cloud 2 Mission. As a stand-alone product, Chatter opens doors for us with these C level executives, and they can see the benefits of open, transparent workplaces and moving into this new social enterprise model.
But more important, the private and secure social network has supercharged all of our offerings in sales, with the Sales Cloud, in service with the Service Cloud and data with Jigsaw in our Force.com platform with Heroku and of course, with our new offerings with Radian6.
And now, all of our customers have immediate access to a social layer, where regardless of whether they're using Salesforce or more than the 220,000 custom apps built on Force.com. And the response from our customers, as I've traveled around, and feedback from all of our executives to this vision of Cloud 2 is really amazing. In Q1, we added 5,400 net new customers, taking the global community of our core apps and platform to more than 97,710 customers, a 26% year-over-year increase in customers. And of course, that does not include Heroku, that does not include Manymoon, that does not include Radian6. That's 97,700 core-paying customers. We obviously have many more paying customers and of course, our foundation has free customers as well which are the nonprofits and the NGOs that we offer our products for free to, and we're also offering our products for free to many companies affected in the Japan disaster, and we'll be talking about that in Tokyo next week.
Today, we see customers buying more. There is definitely a higher buying environment going on and more kinds of our products. In fact, 1/3 of new business in the first quarter came from non-Sales Cloud services. A couple of great examples are two of our marquee transactions in the quarter, which are Groupon, which is the nouveau-riche company in Chicago, and Bank of America. 
Groupon is the world's fastest-growing company, offering daily deals on events and food and services in 44 countries, and while they initially talked us about the Sales Cloud, which has been the heart of their growth of their sales and marketing efforts, we showed them how the platform, Force.com and a full range of services, could supercharge their business and deliver the quality and scale they need to maintain their phenomenal growth rate. And now the Force.com platform will touch nearly every aspect of Groupon's business, whether it's their management of merchants, the core of their business, their city planning and merchandising efforts, their customer service and consumer support, whether it's the development of their coupons, Force.com will help them to re-architecting their company for the future.
And Bank of America has entrusted us to help out thousands of Service Cloud seats, enabling its home loan service reps to quickly and accurately solve problems across all of their support channels and customer touch points, and we're also delivering tremendous successes and seeing momentums in companies like General Electric, where a healthy major divisions, including GE Capital, and GE Energy, GE Transportation, GE Healthcare, and find new unique ways to use our apps and platforms to form deeper relationships with their customers. Our flagship, Sales Cloud, continued to crush the competition in the quarter.
Microsoft's desperate strategy of underfunding, pricing with undifferentiated and highly proprietary products basically has had the same impact on our business as the Windows tablet and Zune did against the iPad and iPod. We call Microsoft's strategy, ""the Zune strategy"". 
It's the process that they can take a proprietary, undifferentiated offering at a lower price and somehow make an impact on a high-value, highly differentiated product that's loved by customers. Microsoft has not changed our exceptional win rates or affected our average selling price with the Zune strategy.
Customers continue to want visionary products that give them a competitive advantage, not the need to Zune-type products locking them into these old, proprietary, desktop-driven platforms that are dying off.
Against Microsoft, we won significant new or add-on business at companies like Eli Lilly, Cargill, Honeywell, Ingram Micro, Changi Airport in Singapore, Bombardier, Bank of Espirito Santo, Biotech [ph], DGI Finland [ph], Greenway Medical, LQ Management, LXE, Misys, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, and the New Zealand Defence Force. These wins against Microsoft were new wins, but we also signed companies that had bought the Microsoft Zune CRM, tried it and threw it out, and customers included the Advantage Brokerage Support Services, Angie's List, CHC Helicopter,the Nemetschek Allplan and the O.C. Tanner.
Against Oracle, which is trying to convince customers to low proprietary software onto proprietary mainframes, a strategy made popular by IBM in the '60s, we won significant new, our add-on business with customers such as Bridgestone, Office Depot, Sony, and Suntech, and believe there's still plenty of opportunity ahead with millions of businesses around the world who are looking to lead these proprietary models. The combination of Chatter, the seamless integration of Jigsaw data and mobility, set the Sales Cloud apart. It's a unique offering. It's highly differentiated, it's innovative, it's creative and it's one of the most highly rated CRM services in the world today.  Certainly, it's the most loved.
We also saw customer velocity in our Service Cloud, our fastest growing business in the first quarter. Today, approximately 16,000 companies are using The Service Cloud to connect with customers across both traditional and new service channels, including e-mail, telephone, social media and the Web.
In March, we unveiled Service Cloud 3, with select companies directly engaged with their customers over Facebook, Twitter, and a broad range of social communities and leveraging new mobile capabilities like Apple space. Essentially, Service Cloud 3 let's customers go where their customers are, in the Cloud, provide them with the customer service, the call center, the contact center, the portal, the technology they need to provide that customer service capability. Salesforce Service Cloud 3 is a uniquely differentiated and highly successful product, and just last month, the Service Cloud was positioned in the leaders' quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for CRM customer service and contact centers. Pretty incredible considering this is a relatively new entrant from Salesforce.com to see Service Cloud so highly rated by Gartner in the Magic Quadrant.
Major wins or expansions of the Service Cloud during the quarter included: Bank of America, and Nissan North America, Paychex, Phoenix Mining, RBS, Scripps, Sony. And finally, the Force.com platform continues to be the only proven enterprise-class platform that's in service on the market today, delivering the highest levels of reliability, scalability and performance, delivering our customers with the tools they need to build their own cloud applications, to help integrate their products into the cloud and to help them rapidly deploying new technologies using Force.com. And because Chatter is integrated into Force.com, the platform gives developers and customers instant access to these next-generation social capabilities.
But more than that, the platform also provides the foundation for apps that are mobile and open. Last quarter, we introduced Database.com, the first enterprise database built for the cloud, which includes developers to be able to write apps in any language, on any platform, on any device, and do it all in the cloud. We also acquired Heroku, the leading platform that's in service for writing apps, and Ruby On Rails. And Heroku was designed from the start to support multiple languages, and we hope to be still be talking about our strategy in offering many, many languages in the cloud using the Heroku capability.
We believe Force.com and Heroku will attract a diverse community of developers and partners who want to create Cloud 2 apps, and it's already happening. Over the last 12 months, we added more than 130,000 developers, creating a global community of more than 380,000. Our open strategy will push that even further as more developers write enterprise cloud apps, whether it's using Ruby on Heroku, whether it's job on VMforce, or whether it's APEX on Force.com, and we're now managing more than 1 billion lines of code, using these technologies from our customers on our cloud -- 1 billion lines of code.
Customers now building on the Force.com platform or that have extended their deployment include: Genentech, Hitachi, Medtronic, Med-E [ph], the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan, and the UnitedHealthcare Services. And our customers and partners continue to increase their usage of our platforms.
During the quarter, Force.com delivered 31 billion transactions, that is 31 billion complex database transactions for our customers, up more than 60% from a year ago, and that's almost 2.5x Twitter's 13 billion tweets in the same period.
Last year, Salesforce.com educated the market on the benefits of social collaboration in the enterprise. We've shown how Chatter is transforming the way companies work and then employees do their jobs, improving productivity, sharing insights, connecting with experts and making better decisions, all in realtime.
And new Chatter deployments in the first quarter included: Akamai, CIGNA, L'Oreal, Seagate, Tata, VMware and Vodafone. And as companies discover the breakthroughs in communication and collaboration that Chatter provides, they're taking it across the enterprise. Chatter is also helping Salesforce.com reach entirely new customers, giving us a pipeline for selling other products and new services.
Customers expanding their deployments of Chatter in the first quarter included: GlaxoSmithKline, '02, Sony, and Starwood Hotels, all deploying Chatter in the first quarter. In addition, our largest Chatter deployment [indiscernible] and SunGard, new enterprise-wide deployments now include: Avaya and Bausch & Lomb, VMC, Juniper, Kelly, Symantec and many, many others.
By leveraging our Cloud 2 strategy, we're becoming a more strategic partner to our customers, and now when I meet with CEOs and CIOs of the world's biggest companies, they want to hear how we help them use these social, mobile and open cloud computing to partner and become more innovative and responsive so they can serve your own customers and become social enterprises. That's why we're investing so aggressively for growth in people and technology and in partnerships. First with people over the last 12 months, we added 1,400 employees, which will help us to sell even more into the future.
And second, with technology, earlier this month, we completed our purchase of Radian6, the leading platform for monitoring, engaging the millions of conversations happening every day on Facebook, on Twitter, on social communities, on websites. Soon, customers will be able to monitor and join in these public conversations from within our products, including Chatter.
And if you haven't had the opportunity to see Radian6 and it's spectacular products, and one of the most exciting technologies I've ever had the opportunity to work with, you can check it out yourself at radian6.com, and monitor how your brands, how your employees, how your companies and your competitors are interacting throughout the Internet. It's a realtime view into the Internet that makes all of our customers more competitive.
We believe this is a massive opportunity to redefine cloud computing. It's giving customers the social intelligence they want with the business context they need, and it opens the opportunity for us to sell more strategically in the marketing departments. It further differentiates the Sales Cloud, The Service Cloud. It further differentiates the platform and Chatter. 
And then finally, with partnerships in the first quarter, we announced the strategic alliance with Intuit, which will integrate Salesforce CRM in their QuickBooks, financial applications, and we sell it to the Intuit space of 4 million QuickBoook customers. This alliance dramatically extends their reach into a small business, with a partner that's the gold standard for small business computing.
And as we look for future small business initiatives, like our recent acquisition of ManyMoon, we see that as a growing and strategic part of our business as well. Today, customers, developers and ISVs like BMC and Computer Associates view us as the strategic partner, who could help them understand and profit from social computing. It's been an exciting time for us to build these strategic relations with ISVs and you'll see many more relationships as we head towards Dreamforce.
So now before I close, I want to invite you to join me in San Francisco on August 30 through September 2 for the world's largest cloud computing event, Dreamforce 2011. We'll have a lot of exciting announcements between now and Dreamforce. And Dreamforce will be the culmination and discussion and revelation of what is the social enterprise for our customers.
Dreamforce will have the biggest selection of cloud computing products ever under one roof, and the largest gathering of cloud experts. More than 450 sessions on cloud computing, it is the place to learn about the next generation of cloud and to collaborate with others in the industry. And I will look forward to seeing all of you there.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Graham."
122917,132269343,130775,"Salesforce.com, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 19, 2011",2011-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an exciting start to fiscal 2012. Revenues of $504 million rose 34% year-over-year, well above our outlook entering the quarter. This significant overachievement was a result of three factors. First, the strong new business performanc",1995,"Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an exciting start to fiscal 2012. Revenues of $504 million rose 34% year-over-year, well above our outlook entering the quarter. This significant overachievement was a result of three factors. First, the strong new business performance that Marc described earlier; second, there was significant strengthening in the euro and the yen; and then finally, continued reduction in our attrition rate.
On the attrition front, our dollar attrition when compared to year ago, continued its steady decline from its peak back in the second quarter of fiscal  2010. But remains in the mid-teens percentage. Obviously in improving global economy, it's helping customer retention rates but given its importance, we're continuing to invest in areas critical to customer success, such as customer onboarding, enhanced training and usage analysis and predictive monitoring. Because the cost to renew and grow existing customers is much lower than the cost of acquiring new ones, these efforts are an extremely important part of our long-term growth strategy.
Turning next to geographic performance, we saw strengthen all three major geographies. In Q1, Americas revenue rose 31% year-over-year to approximately $340 million. International revenue rose 40% in dollars, and 53% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter, and now represents roughly 33% of total company revenue. That's up from 31% a year ago.
The stronger euro and yen contributed roughly 2 points of FX benefit to our reported company revenue growth in Q1. Looking at some regional details, in EMEA, revenues of $94 million rose 41% in dollars, and 36% in constant currency and in Asia, revenue increased by 38% in dollars and 29% in constant currency to roughly $70 million.
Marc already mentioned our Japan business and looking ahead, it's difficult to predict the extent or duration of the current slowdown. Our revenue growth in Asia was affected in Q1, and we've tried to factor in a realistic forecast for Japan for the remainder of the year. Fortunately, the strength of our other businesses in the Americas and EMEA has resulted in us still being able to raise revenue guidance overall.
Looking on to the income statement, our first quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 82% remained essentially flat, both sequentially and year-over-year. There are a couple of points to highlight in Q1. First, due to our strong production growth trend, we continue to make investments in our service delivery infrastructure.
Q1, we had the full expense impact of our third and fourth U.S. data centers as well as some early costs associated with the build out of our Japan data center. The net affect of these investments was to reduce year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin for our Subscription business by roughly two points.
Offsetting the impact of these investments was the continuing revenue mix shift away from our lower margin Professional Services business as our partners take an ever increasing share of the implementation service.
Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 11% was unchanged from Q4 but down 5 points from a year ago. Three primary factors are driving the year-over-year increase in operating expenses. First, we have acquired seven companies since Q1 last year. While Jigsaw is on track to get to non-GAAP break even in the 6 to 8 quarter timeframe we discussed last year, all of the remaining acquisitions are dilutive to operating margins. Nevertheless, we believe these acquisitions are important to extend our Cloud 2 vision around social, mobile and open, and the strength of our Q1 performance reflects this belief.
Second, as we indicated in Q4, accelerated hiring in the second half of last year is helping new business momentum but increasing expenses. Q1, we really felt the full effect of the roughly 850 employees we added in Q3 and Q4. 
In addition, we added approximately 200 people in the first quarter, taking our employee population to just over 5,500. Because growth is our top priority, and because our people fuel that growth, you should expect us to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of fiscal 2012.
And finally, in Q1, we spent significantly on marketing programs. Our first ever Superbowl ad, our Wall Street Journal, Chatter ad campaign, and the large Cloudforce events in New York and Paris were among the many investments we made in our brand-building awareness of our industry-leading products.
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 35%. As a result of the Radian6 acquisition, we expect to incur a slightly lower overall tax rate for fiscal 2012. We now estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 30% in Q2, and 33% in Q3 and Q4 for a full-year estimated non-GAAP rate of 33%. This decrease in our estimated 2012 tax rate will add $0.02 to EPS in Q2, and $0.01 to EPS in each of Q3 and Q4 for a total net benefit of $0.04 for the year, which I'll cover in my guidance comments later. We delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 in Q1, but $0.01 higher -- $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range, but it was down 7% from the $0.30 we recorded in Q1 last year.
I'd like to just spend a minute on discussing our operating principles as we head into fiscal 2012.  We're clearly managing the business to maximize revenue growth as our #1 priority. We've just passed the $2 billion revenue run rate, and are focused on getting to $3 billion as rapidly as possible. We want to invest in distribution capacity, product development, service delivery to provide our customers and prospects with strategic partnership they need as they transform their businesses with the cloud model. We believe that our accelerating growth rate reflects our customers' desire for transformation and the market shift to cloud computing.
Historically, we've discussed 100 to 300 basis points of operating margin improvement each year as one of our financial goal. We achieved that goal consistently in fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010. However, during those years, our only significant acquisition was InStranet. 
Over the past four quarters, as I mentioned earlier, we've completed seven acquisitions, including Jigsaw, Heroku and now Radian6. So while we're always focused on increasing operational efficiency, our efforts are not necessarily visible in our reported operating margin, while we're adding strategic, fast-growing but nevertheless, dilutive acquisitions to expand our Cloud 2 vision.
So our approach for fiscal 2012, is to provide quarterly and full-year revenue and earnings guidance and to deliver on that guidance. To the extent they have upside on revenue in any particular quarter, we look to invest that upside in accelerating our growth through hiring, marketing programs and data center capacity. If we execute well, we will have higher revenue growth and slightly lower operating margins, but still hit our earnings goals. Fundamentally, we believe that investing in growth is the best way to create long-term shareholder value.
Now onto cash flow and balance sheet. First quarter operating cash generation was $140 million, down just slightly from last year's number of $143 billion. As I discussed on our last call, higher sales commission and bonus payouts from our strong fiscal 2011 finish, together with the increased hiring I mentioned a while back, affected our first quarter cash flow.
Capital spending was $27 million in Q1, primarily result of leasehold improvements in 3 different office locations and investments in our service delivery infrastructure.
Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $112 million in the quarter, that's down 15% from last year. Our definition of CapEx for this purpose excludes cash outflows relating to land activity and campus building improvements, which is just $1 million in the first quarter.
As we look through the remainder of the year, our strong first quarter operating cash flow invoicing gives me confidence to raise our operating cash flow estimate. We now expect full year operating cash flow to grow at a mid- to high-teens percentage rate, up from our prior guidance of low- to mid-teens percentage rate. Given our business model, we believe operating cash flow continues to be an important measure of our success.
Turning to the balance sheet, total cash and equivalents, including short- and long-term marketable securities, finished the quarter at roughly $1.5 billion, that's up about $115 million from Q4 but down approximately $379 million from Q1 last year, primarily as a result of our acquisition activity in the past four quarters.
Please remember that we already paid approximately $285 million in early May as part of the Radian6 purchase consideration. Our $575 million of convertible notes are significantly in the money, and it's important to understand that the note conversion feature increased our fully-diluted share count this quarter by approximately 3 million shares.
However, please remember that the hedge we executed at the same time as these notes will eliminate all but roughly 500,000 shares of this dilution when the notes reach maturity in January 2015. Also, please note that because the conversion trigger provision was met at the end of Q4 and at the end of Q1, the convertible notes are now shown under current liabilities.
Deferred revenue finished the quarter at roughly $915 million, that's an increase of 38% from the year-ago quarter, our largest increase since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Sequentially, deferred revenue declined by $20 million, a result that included approximately $15 million of sequential FX benefit and about $21 million of FX benefit versus Q1 last year.
Historically, deferred revenue tends to be roughly flat from Q1 to Q2. This year, given our strong Q1 results and some significant currency benefit in our first quarter number, we expect deferred revenue to be flat-to-down slightly through the end of Q2.
And finally, strong invoicing pushed Q1 receivables up 47% year-over-year to approximately $271 million. The result was a fourth-day year-over-year increase in DSO to 48 days. This increase was purely a function of the strength of our business in Q1, our first quarter collections were great, and our receivables aging is in good shape.
Let me close with our outlook. I'm very pleased to be able to raise the high-end of our full year revenue outlook by $17 million to a range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion. The high end of the revenue range represents the year-over-year revenue growth rate of both 30%.
Please remember that this range includes approximately $20 million of benefit from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, 08-01. The incremental revenue recognized under this new accounting standard in Q1 was approximately $1.5 million, but we do expect its effect to ramp up across the quarters this year. We now predict non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.30 to $1.32. This range reflects the $0.11 dilutive impact to the Radian6 acquisition, offset by the $0.01 overachievement that we just reported in Q1, and the $0.04 improvement in earnings from our lower estimated effective tax rate that I discussed earlier.
Although we are raising our overall EPS outlook for the year, I would like to remind you that Dreamforce will have a significant impact, we estimate at least $0.06 of EPS in our Q3 results.
Second quarter revenue is projected to be in the range of $526 million to $528 million. This estimate includes approximately $5 million relating to revenue recognized on a cash basis for Radian6. I just want to point out that we have no prior experience at managing Radian6's receivables. We expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.29 to $0.30 in the second quarter.
Before I close, I remind that all of the underlying assumptions listed in our Q2 and full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance, as well as our GAAP guidance and assumptions can be found in our earnings press release. Please note that because we've not yet completed the purchase price [indiscernible] Radian6, our GAAP EPS forecast contains estimates of the Radian6 acquisition accounting.
So with that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today and open the call up to your questions. Operator?"

Each of their executives that I've met and their individual employees just have a very unique view and a very powerful view of the future of our industry. It certainly does have this foundation, for a marketing cloud, for salesforce. It's the right place to start a marketing cloud when you look at today's world that's being driven by social networks. The most part of the marketing is what's going on in these communities and your brand has become a realtime conversation. It's not about advertising any more. It's not about campaigns, it's not about events. It's all about the conversation on the Internet, and Radian6 is the leader in monitoring and managing that conversation for more than half of the Fortune 100 and they're really just getting going. It's a great team, great product, great technology.

You put all that in, and Radian6 is going to give you the information you need to make better decisions. So it really is the beginning of the marketing cloud."

Of course, we're going to be the biggest cloud player, but we want to be one of the top five software companies in the world. That's our next goal. You've seen us pass $2 billion, you're going to see us pass $3 billion. I think that, that is just -- you can see it in our run rate, you can see it in our deferred, you can see the momentum that we have around the world. No success is linear, that's something that Mike Odel always tells me and I believe that. But I also look at 9 quarters now accelerating revenue run rate. Pretty awesome. And we see a big buying environment out there. And as I said, I met with 170 customers this quarter. They're all buying. And they're all looking to rebuild their enterprises, and we have to execute against that opportunity, sales execution is a difficult thing as you know. We did make a major investment last year. We've talked extensively with you about a 40% increase in our distribution. Organization, the vast majority of that is really probably yet to come online, and that's, as I've said publicly before, the upside. We have great products, The Sales Cloud, we've got The Service Cloud, we've got Jigsaw, we've got Radian6, we've got the Force.com platform, we've got Chatter, we've got plenty to sell. Customers want this next generation of technology. They want to build these social enterprises, you're going to see me next week in Japan with a major auto manufacturer talking about how we're bringing their products into the social networks. And how cars are becoming your friends in social networks, not just people. And that's true for all of our customers. They're looking at products in terms of how are their products integrated with our technology. We see our customers wanting to become cloud providers, not just Groupon, but a lot of our customers who are maybe traditional products manufacturers, whether it's consumer product goods or traditional manufacturing, they want to build products that are operating in the cloud. And the reason why? Their customers are in the cloud, they need to get in the cloud to build their customers. We're that avenue, we're the bridge. How are you going to do that with SAP? How are you going to do that with a Microsoft server? How are you going to do that with an Oracle Exadata mainframe? You just can't do it. And that's where we're getting the action, because customers realize they're going to build new apps with our platform, they're going to deploy new types of social sales, new kind of social service, social marketing with Radian6. They see our social data collection and reporting through Jigsaw, it's a great opportunity. And it's really our sales challenge to get out there and to continue to close the deals, to do like what Laura was saying, to create the extraordinary transactions, and that's our opportunity and that's also our challenge."

I mean, I think that, as I've said publicly, and if you go to my Wikipedia page, you can see a report that I wrote in 2005 on the President of the United States on the cyber security as a crisis, a prioritization for the government and for a lot of companies. And I think that cyber security is tough. There's no finish line when it comes to cyber security. Everybody's got problems, everybody will have problems. Computers are not perfect, and you've got to double down on cyber security if you're in our business and honestly, if you're in any business. I really think that this is one of the reasons that we are more successful, is because our customers cannot do this. It's tough and there's no finish line when it comes the security, and there is no perfection when it comes to security. So we have to work harder and we have to be a surrogate for a lot of our customers in providing that capability. I think what area that we have a unique model that we benefited from, is I think every day, maybe 2 or 3 of our customers show up and do security reviews with us. They're reviewing our data centers, they're reviewing our code, they're reviewing our networks. In many cases, those customers are only doing a couple of security reviews themselves a year. They've got an out-vendor, I don't know how many vendors Sony has, for example. We're obviously a vendor to Sony, but in terms of cyber security to Sony, how many vendors do they have checking their technology on a regular basis. Most companies have a couple, they check a couple of times a year. We're fortunate, we've got people checking us everyday. Is that the panacea? Is that going to be -- is that the be-all end-all? No, it's not. And so we have to -- we have to double down everybody does. And if it's, as I said at the Gartner symposium last year, if security is not your number one issue for your company, it should be. In regards to kind of reliability issues, with Amazon, they obviously had a problem. They got through it. They're obviously is stronger forward, it's one of the benefits of the model. We've had our own reliability issues along the way, I'm sure you remember, and no computer is perfect. But if you look at, for example, our operating history now, over 12 years of operating in our service, I think we're about better than any of our customers. I don't know a customer that's had better reliability in operating history than Salesforce.com over the last decade. So I think cloud computing is the right model. Will there be issues? Of course. And we've got or you've got to deal with those issues head-on and move on. And that's the reality of our industry."

And obviously, that's why we feel better about our cash flow forecast of the remainder of the year as well. So no unusual things in deferred revenue number other than currency, as you mentioned. In terms of attrition, my recollection was when we first started reporting a dollar attrition number, it was sort of in the mid-teens, and I think it went up into the high-teens, and now it's obviously come back down into the mid-teens. So I don't have data that sort of dates back 3, 4, 5 years, even before I was at the company. So it would be pretty difficult I think to go back and reconstruct that. So I've always said, I think, publicly, that we feel with the right set of circumstances, with the right economic backdrop, with the right programs in place internally, we could get attrition, hopefully, into the low-teens. But as you can tell, even though we're putting a lot into this, and economy is definitely improving it, so it's a slow decline. So we just want to keep that steady decline each quarter going."

It's our differentiator, it's our third most used feature by all of our customers. It's really the heart and soul of the company, and kind of just taking on the comments on the database, we don't really make a CRM app. We have a core through the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud, and when we demo that and show it, it looks like an app, but really it's a platform, it really is about our customers' ability to get in there to customize the tabs, the feel, the screen layouts to write the triggers, the stored procedures, the remote procedure calls, to add in the social networking, to integrate it with the services that they use to tie in to our APIs. That's why we bought a company last year, Sitemaster, because websites have become so important to our customers as an integrated part of their CRM experience. And that's why we bought Heroku. And we look at the platform as a critical part of what we do for our customers and certainly when we talk about these extraordinary transactions that we have. Like the ones that we're talking about on the call today, these are platform-driven opportunities. When we're in there, we're winning these deals because when you use our platform, it's just not like anything else that's out there. It's not a fixed app, it's not a fixed app in your e-mail, it's not a fixed app running on your PC, it's a database that lets you manage and share your information to a much lower cost, to integrate it deeply into the social networks and run it on your mobile devices, and this is really what customers want. And they integrate it into your websites, and they integrate it into your Internet sites, and they build custom apps, and on and on and on. And as we look at the heat maps for our customers, we look at how far is the platform driving into their enterprises. We had a customer speaker at our management meeting a couple of weeks ago, and they've put up a heat map of how far we've gotten to their enterprises, there were 15 apps that they had built, all in the platform.

It's definitely an innovative step in the history of our industry where you can load software onto a server that may have not have the level of efficiency that you want as a large corporate customer, and you make that server be able to run multiple applications and multiple databases and multiple operating systems through this virtualization software. And that is virtualization. But that's not cloud computing, right? I mean that's not the public cloud. That's not the low-cost, efficient, shared model. That's not the 100,000 customers that we have running on 2,500 shared PCs. That's not kind of our cloud brethren, right, which are the very fast-growing companies we're delivering services.

Honestly, the problem is we're in a lot of things already that are hot. So I mean we're an collaboration that's hot. We're in sales that's hot, we're in service that's hot. We're in platform that's very hot, we're in data that's very hot. And now we're touching marketing. But before we, like, rush ahead and do building out the marketing cloud, which we obviously could easily do, because there's a lot of exciting assets there, there's a lot of exciting companies there, but we're very cautious about doing that because if we go ahead and build that out right now, what will suffer, we will have our eye off the ball and one of these other critical areas. And that -- so I would say we're at the beginning of that and certainly, we've got a tremendous, tremendous position with a tremendous company with Radian6. And from there, we will, I'm sure, build a complete and full product line, but it's not an urgent item on my agenda."

I'd like to welcome everyone to Salesforce.com's first quarter fiscal year 2012 results call. Joining me to discuss our results today as always are: Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; and Graham Smith, our CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open things up for your questions. As always I ask as a courtesy to your peers, please limit yourself to one question today.
A complete disclosure of our first quarter results can be found in a press release issued about an hour ago, as well as in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Additional financial information, including detailed historical financial statements and facts, is available on our website.
Our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for both our reported results and our forward guidance can be found in our press release. 
At times in our prepared comments today or in responses to your questions, we may offer incremental metrics to provide a greater understanding of our business or our quarterly results. Please be advised that some of these disclosures are one time in nature and we may or cannot update those metrics in the future.
Also of importance, beginning in the third quarter, we will no longer be reporting our customer count metric on a quarterly basis. We said we plan to update that metrics when we receive notable milestones. We're making this change because recent acquisitions, primarily Heroku and Manymoon, have added a large number of users. Linking those users to specific customer organizations can be extremely challenging and in some cases impossible. As result, we believe our traditional customer metric will become less meaningful overtime. We plan to report the customer metric using our traditional measure one last time in Q2.
With that, let me make this call official with a brief Safe Harbor. The primary purpose of today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fiscal first quarter 2012 performance. Some of our discussion and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
All of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, as well as other information on potential factors that could affect our financial results are included in our reports filed with the SEC, including our most recent report on Form 10-K, particularly under the heading Risk Factors.
To access our first quarter press release, including the GAAP to non-GAAP affiliations or rhetorical results, any of our SEC disclosures or simply to learn more about Salesforce.com, I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website. 
In addition, a webcast of today's call will be available for 90 days, and a dial-in replay will be available through June 16.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Marc, please be advised that we may reference certain unreleased services or features that are not currently available in today's discussion. We can't guarantee that future timing of or availability of these services or features and, as such, customers who purchase our services should make their purchase decisions based on services and features that are currently available.
With that, let me turn the call over to Marc to discuss our excellent first quarter results. Marc?"

Our first quarter was indeed a fantastic kickoff to fiscal year 2012, continuing the momentum we experienced in fiscal year 2011. And I'm thrilled to report that just one quarter into our fiscal year, we have crossed the threshold of the $2",2951,"Thanks, David. Our first quarter was indeed a fantastic kickoff to fiscal year 2012, continuing the momentum we experienced in fiscal year 2011. And I'm thrilled to report that just one quarter into our fiscal year, we have crossed the threshold of the $2 billion annual revenue run rate. As you can see from the revenue, we are absolutely delighted now to be at a new level of performance of our company, and our revenue growth rate is accelerating.
Let me begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights of the quarter. Revenue of $504 million was 34% from the year-ago quarter. Deferred revenue also accelerated to $915 million, a 38% year-over-year increase. Incredible. And we also delivered $140 million of operating cash flow. And over the past 12 months, we've generated roughly $460 million in operating cash, an increase of more than 40% from a year-ago period.
Finally, David, we are pleased to be able to raise revenue guidance to $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, a significant increase once again to our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2012, and our second increase this year, the first one after we acquired Radian6.
Now I'd like to say a few words about Japan and the Japan disaster before we begin. First of all, let me personally and on behalf of Salesforce.com and our employees and our shareholders, send our condolences to the victims of the Japan disaster. Our sadness is overwhelming, and we are deeply with you, and we send our wishes for a quick recovery.
Now like many companies, of course, our business is also affected by the earthquake in Japan. However, the diligence of our Japan team ended the quarter closer to their original plan than we could really have ever expected.
In fact, one of our 10 largest transactions for the quarter was from Japan. It's also important to note that none of our Japanese customers, including our largest customer, the Japanese government, suffered any service interruptions because of the disaster. Salesforce.com delivered 100% reliability and availability during the disaster.
This is truly a testament to the power of our cloud computing model, which we think will play a key role in Japan's building efforts and rebuilding efforts, and we'll be talking more about that next week. I'll be in Tokyo, and I will be making several announcements about our commitment to Japan, the opening of our new Japan data center and new strategic agreements that we're reaching with customers in Japan.
We are truly doubling down on our commitment to Japan. We've raised more than $1 million for the victims of the disaster, and in my discussions next week, we'll be having several strategic announcements that we hope will inspire Japan's innovators, Japan's customers, as well as our global shareholders. And I look forward to speaking to all of you from our headquarters in Tokyo next week.
Our financial momentum in the quarter was powered by our strategic decision to bring social, mobile and open cloud technologies, or what we have been calling for over a year Cloud 2, to the enterprise. And third parties agree that these trends are really the future of our industry.
A recent independent survey by McKinsey & Company reported that companies that are using what we call Cloud 2, or social networking technologies within the enterprise that are more flexible, collaborate better, achieve greater market share and have higher margins.
It's just a very exciting shift for companies all over the world who are able to bring in the power of mobility, the power of social and the power of open, coupled with the cloud computing model that we've been talking about now for over a decade. And in the February report, Morgan Stanley confirmed that enterprises are embracing mobile devices. 51% of the CIOs they surveyed expected to buy tablets for employees this year, and another 16% will allow employees to use their own devices to access corporate data.
Now I can tell you that personally in the quarter, I met with over 170 customers, many of them in small lunches and dinners, as well as in one-on-one meetings throughout the quarter. I spent an extensive amount of time in the field and around the world with our customers. And the reason why is because this shift is so big, so broad and so unique that I really felt I personally had to get out and really talk to customers about what they're going through. And what amazed me was I would say approximately, or more than half, certainly more than half of all of the attendees, brought their iPads in to meetings with me. That really blew me away.
Now of course, while I'm in these meetings with them I have an iPad as well and I'm showing them Salesforce Chatter on the iPad. And that's important because as you know, Chatter is the foundation of our Cloud 2 mission. As a stand-alone product, Chatter opens doors for us with these C level executives, and they can see the benefits of open, transparent workplaces and moving into this new social enterprise model.
But more important, the private and secure social network has supercharged all of our offerings in sales with the Sales Cloud, in service with The Service Cloud, and data with Jigsaw in our Force.com platform with Heroku, and of course with our new offerings with Radian6.
And now, all of our customers have immediate access to a social layer, where regardless of whether they're using Salesforce or more than the 220,000 custom apps built on Force.com. And the response from our customers, as I've traveled around, and feedback from all of our executives to this vision of Cloud 2 is really amazing. 
In Q1, we added 5,400 net new customers, taking the global community of our core apps and platform to more than 97,700 paying customers, a 26% year-over-year increase in customers. And of course, that does not include Heroku, that does not include Manymoon, that does not include Radian6. That's 97,700 core-paying customers. 
We obviously have many more paying customers, and of course our foundation has free customers as well which are the nonprofits and the NGOs that we offer our products for free to. And we're also offering our products for free to many companies affected in the Japan disaster, and we'll be talking about that in Tokyo next week.
Today, we see customers buying more. There is definitely a higher buying environment going on and more kinds of our products. In fact, 1/3 of new business in the first quarter came from non-Sales Cloud services. A couple of great examples are two of our marquee transactions in the quarter, which are Groupon, which is the nouveau-riche company in Chicago, and Bank of America. 
Groupon is the world's fastest-growing company, offering daily deals on events and food and services in 44 countries, and while they initially talked us about The Sales Cloud, which has been the heart of their growth of their sales and marketing efforts, we showed them how the platform, Force.com and a full range of services, could supercharge their business and deliver the quality and scale they need to maintain their phenomenal growth rate. 
And now the Force.com platform will touch nearly every aspect of Groupon's business, whether it's their management of merchants, the core of their business, their city planning and merchandising efforts, their customer service and consumer support, whether it's the development of their coupons, Force.com will help them to re-architect their company for the future.
And Bank of America has entrusted us to help out thousands of Service Cloud seats, enabling its home loan service reps to quickly and accurately solve problems across all of their support channels and customer touch points. 
And we're also delivering tremendous success and seeing momentums in companies like General Electric, where we're helping major divisions, including GE Capital, and GE Energy, GE Transportation, GE Healthcare, find new unique ways to use our apps and platforms to form deeper relationships with their customers. 
Our flagship, Sales Cloud, continued to crush the competition in the quarter. Microsoft's desperate strategy of underfunding, pricing with undifferentiated and highly proprietary products basically has had the same impact on our business as the Windows tablet and Zune did against the iPad and iPod. We call Microsoft's strategy, ""the Zune strategy"". 
It's the concept that they can take a proprietary, undifferentiated offering at a lower price and somehow make an impact on a high-value, highly differentiated product that's loved by customers. Microsoft has not changed our exceptional win rates or affected our average selling price with this Zune strategy.
Customers continue to want visionary products that give them a competitive advantage, not the me-too Zune-type products locking them into these old, proprietary, desktop-driven platforms that are dying off.
Against Microsoft, we won significant new or add-on business at companies like Eli Lilly, Cargill, Honeywell, Ingram Micro, Changi Airport in Singapore, Bombardier, Bank of Espirito Santo, Biotec, Digia Finland, Greenway Medical, LQ Management, LXE, Misys, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, and the New Zealand Defence Force. 
These wins against Microsoft were new wins, but we also signed companies that had bought the Microsoft Zune CRM, tried it and threw it out, and customers included the Advantage Brokerage Support Services, Angie's List, CHC Helicopter, the Nemetschek Allplan and the O.C. Tanner.
Against Oracle, which is trying to convince customers to low proprietary software onto proprietary mainframes, a strategy made popular by IBM in the '60s, we won significant new or add-on business with customers such as Bridgestone, Office Depot, Sony, and Suntech, and believe there's still plenty of opportunity ahead with millions of businesses around the world who are looking to leave these proprietary models. 
The combination of Chatter, the seamless integration of Jigsaw data and mobility, sets The Sales Cloud apart. It's a unique offering. It's highly differentiated. It's innovative. It's creative. And it's one of the most highly rated CRM services in the world today.  Certainly, it's the most loved.
We also saw customer velocity in our Service Cloud, our fastest growing business in the first quarter. Today, approximately 16,000 companies are using The Service Cloud to connect with customers across both traditional and new service channels, including e-mail, telephone, social media and the Web.
In March, we unveiled Service Cloud 3, which let companies directly engage with their customers over Facebook, Twitter, and a broad range of social communities and leveraging new mobile capabilities, like Apple's Face Time. Essentially, Service Cloud 3 lets customers go where their customers are, in the Cloud, provide them with the customer service, the call center, the contact center, the portal, the technology they need to provide that customer service capability. 
Salesforce Service Cloud 3 is a uniquely differentiated and highly successful product. And just last month, The Service Cloud was positioned in the leaders' quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for CRM customer service and contact centers. Pretty incredible considering this is a relatively new entrant from Salesforce.com to see Service Cloud so highly rated by Gartner in the Magic Quadrant.
Major wins or expansions of The Service Cloud during the quarter included: Bank of America, and Nissan North America, Paychex, Phoenix Mining, RBS, Scripps, Sony. And finally, the Force.com platform continues to be the only proven enterprise-class platform as a service on the market today, delivering the highest levels of reliability, scalability and performance, delivering our customers with the tools they need to build their own cloud applications, to help integrate their products into the cloud, and to help them rapidly deploy new technologies using Force.com. And because Chatter is integrated into Force.com, the platform gives developers and customers instant access to these next-generation social capabilities.
But more than that, the platform also provides the foundation for apps that are mobile and open. Last quarter, we introduced Database.com, the first enterprise database built for the cloud, which includes developers to be able to write apps in any language, on any platform, on any device, and do it all in the cloud. 
We also acquired Heroku, the leading platform as a service for writing apps in Ruby On Rails. And Heroku was designed from the start to support multiple languages, and we hope to be soon be talking about our strategy in offering many, many languages in the cloud using the Heroku capability.
We believe Force.com and Heroku will attract a diverse community of developers and partners who want to create Cloud 2 apps, and it's already happening. Over the last 12 months, we added more than 130,000 developers, creating a global community of more than 380,000. Our open strategy will push that even further as more developers write enterprise cloud apps, whether it's using Ruby on Heroku, whether it's Java on VMforce, or whether it's APEX on Force.com. And we're now managing more than 1 billion lines of code, using these technologies from our customers on our cloud. 1 billion lines of code.
Customers now building on the Force.com platform or that have extended their deployment include: Genentech; Hitachi; Medtronic; METI, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan; and the UnitedHealthcare Services. And our customers and partners continue to increase their usage of our platforms.
During the quarter, Force.com delivered 31 billion transactions, that is 31 billion complex database transactions for our customers, up more than 60% from a year ago. And that's almost 2.5x Twitter's 13 billion tweets in the same period.
Last year, Salesforce.com educated the market on the benefits of social collaboration in the enterprise. We've shown how Chatter is transforming the way companies work and how their employees do their jobs, improving productivity, sharing insights, connecting with experts and making better decisions, all in realtime.
And new Chatter deployments in the first quarter included: Akamai, CIGNA, L'Oreal, Seagate, Tata, VMware and Vodafone. And as companies discover the breakthroughs in communication and collaboration that Chatter provides, they're taking it across the enterprise. Chatter is also helping Salesforce.com reach entirely new customers, giving us a pipeline for selling other products and new services.
Customers expanding their deployments of Chatter in the first quarter included: GlaxoSmithKline, O2, Savvis, Sony, and Starwood Hotels, all deploying Chatter in the first quarter. In addition, our largest Chatter deployment [indiscernible] and SunGard, new enterprise-wide deployments now include: Avaya and Bausch & Lomb, VMC, Juniper, Kelly, Symantec and many, many others.
By leveraging our Cloud 2 strategy, we're becoming a more strategic partner to our customers, and now when I meet with CEOs and CIOs of the world's biggest companies, they want to hear how we help them use these social, mobile and open cloud computing to partner and become more innovative and responsive so they can serve your own customers and become social enterprises. That's why we're investing so aggressively for growth in people and technology and in partnerships. First with people over the last 12 months, we added 1,400 employees, which will help us to sell even more into the future.
And second, with technology, earlier this month, we completed our purchase of Radian6, the leading platform for monitoring, engaging the millions of conversations happening every day on Facebook, on Twitter, on social communities, on websites. Soon, customers will be able to monitor and join in these public conversations from within our products, including Chatter.
And if you haven't had the opportunity to see Radian6 -- and it's a spectacular product and one of the most exciting technologies I've ever had the opportunity to work with -- you can check it out yourself at radian6.com, and monitor how your brands, how your employees, how your companies and your competitors are interacting throughout the Internet. It's a realtime view into the Internet that makes all of our customers more competitive.
We believe this is a massive opportunity to redefine cloud computing. It's giving customers the social intelligence they want with the business context they need. And it opens the opportunity for us to sell more strategically in the marketing departments. It further differentiates The Sales Cloud, The Service Cloud. It further differentiates the platform and Chatter. 
And then finally, with partnerships in the first quarter, we announced the strategic alliance with Intuit, which will integrate Salesforce CRM in their QuickBooks, financial applications, and we sell it to the Intuit space of 4 million QuickBook customers. This alliance dramatically extends their reach into a small business, with a partner that's the gold standard for small business computing.
And as we look for future small business initiatives, like our recent acquisition of ManyMoon, we see that as a growing and strategic part of our business as well. Today, customers, developers and ISVs, like BMC and Computer Associates, view us as the strategic partner, who could help them understand and profit from social computing. It's been an exciting time for us to build these strategic relations with ISVs. And you'll see many more relationships as we head towards Dreamforce.
So now before I close, I want to invite you to join me in San Francisco on August 30 through September 2 for the world's largest cloud computing event, Dreamforce 2011. We'll have a lot of exciting announcements between now and Dreamforce. And Dreamforce will be the culmination and discussion and revelation of what is the social enterprise for our customers.
Dreamforce will have the biggest selection of cloud computing products ever under one roof, and the largest gathering of cloud experts. More than 450 sessions on cloud computing. It is the place to learn about the next generation of cloud and to collaborate with others in the industry. And I will look forward to seeing all of you there.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Graham."
122917,132269343,130786,"Salesforce.com, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 19, 2011",2011-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an exciting start to fiscal 2012. Revenues of $504 million rose 34% year-over-year, well above our outlook entering the quarter. This significant overachievement was a result of three factors. First, the strong new business performanc",1995,"Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an exciting start to fiscal 2012. Revenues of $504 million rose 34% year-over-year, well above our outlook entering the quarter. This significant overachievement was a result of three factors. First, the strong new business performance that Marc described earlier; second, there was significant strengthening in the euro and the yen; and then finally, continued reduction in our attrition rate.
On the attrition front, our dollar attrition when compared to year ago, continued its steady decline from its peak back in the second quarter of fiscal  2010. But remains in the mid-teens percentage. Obviously in improving global economy, it's helping customer retention rates but given its importance, we're continuing to invest in areas critical to customer success, such as customer onboarding, enhanced training and usage analysis and predictive monitoring. Because the cost to renew and grow existing customers is much lower than the cost of acquiring new ones, these efforts are an extremely important part of our long-term growth strategy.
Turning next to geographic performance, we saw strength in all three major geographies. In Q1, Americas revenue rose 31% year-over-year to approximately $340 million. International revenue rose 40% in dollars, and 53% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter, and now represents roughly 33% of total company revenue. That's up from 31% a year ago.
The stronger euro and yen contributed roughly 2 points of FX benefit to our reported company revenue growth in Q1. Looking at some regional details, in EMEA, revenues of $94 million rose 41% in dollars, and 36% in constant currency. And in Asia, revenue increased by 38% in dollars and 29% in constant currency to roughly $70 million.
Marc already mentioned our Japan business and looking ahead, it's difficult to predict the extent or duration of the current slowdown. Our revenue growth in Asia was affected in Q1, and we've tried to factor in a realistic forecast for Japan for the remainder of the year. Fortunately, the strength of our other businesses in the Americas and EMEA has resulted in us still being able to raise revenue guidance overall.
Looking on to the income statement, our first quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 82% remained essentially flat, both sequentially and year-over-year. There are a couple of points to highlight in Q1. First, due to our strong production growth trend, we continue to make investments in our service delivery infrastructure.
Q1, we had the full expense impact of our third and fourth U.S. data centers as well as some early costs associated with the build out of our Japan data center. The net effect of these investments was to reduce year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin for our Subscription business by roughly two points.
Offsetting the impact of these investments was the continuing revenue mix shift away from our lower margin Professional Services business as our partners take an ever-increasing share of the implementation service.
Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 11% was unchanged from Q4 but down 5 points from a year ago. Three primary factors are driving the year-over-year increase in operating expenses. First, we have acquired seven companies since Q1 last year. While Jigsaw is on track to get to non-GAAP break even in the 6 to 8 quarter timeframe we discussed last year, all of the remaining acquisitions are dilutive to operating margins. Nevertheless, we believe these acquisitions are important to extend our Cloud 2 vision around social, mobile and open, and the strength of our Q1 performance reflects this belief.
Second, as we indicated in Q4, accelerated hiring in the second half of last year is helping new business momentum but increasing expenses. Q1, we really felt the full effect of the roughly 850 employees we added in Q3 and Q4. 
In addition, we added approximately 200 people in the first quarter, taking our employee population to just over 5,500. Because growth is our top priority, and because our people fuel that growth, you should expect us to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of fiscal 2012.
And finally, in Q1, we spent significantly on marketing programs. Our first ever Superbowl ad, our Wall Street Journal, Chatter ad campaign, and the large Cloudforce events in New York and Paris were among the many investments we made in our brand-building awareness of our industry-leading products.
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 35%. As a result of the Radian6 acquisition, we expect to incur a slightly lower overall tax rate for fiscal 2012. We now estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 30% in Q2, and 33% in Q3 and Q4 for a full-year estimated non-GAAP rate of 33%. This decrease in our estimated 2012 tax rate will add $0.02 to EPS in Q2, and $0.01 to EPS in each of Q3 and Q4 for a total net benefit of $0.04 for the year, which I'll cover in my guidance comments later. We delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 in Q1, but $0.01 higher -- $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range, but it was down 7% from the $0.30 we recorded in Q1 last year.
I'd like to just spend a minute on discussing our operating principles as we head into fiscal 2012.  We're clearly managing the business to maximize revenue growth as our #1 priority. We've just passed the $2 billion revenue run rate, and are focused on getting to $3 billion as rapidly as possible. We want to invest in distribution capacity, product development, service delivery to provide our customers and prospects with strategic partnership they need as they transform their businesses with the cloud model. We believe that our accelerating growth rate reflects our customers' desire for transformation and the market shift to cloud computing.
Historically, we've discussed 100 to 300 basis points of operating margin improvement each year as one of our financial goal. We achieved that goal consistently in fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010. However, during those years, our only significant acquisition was InStranet. 
Over the past four quarters, as I mentioned earlier, we've completed seven acquisitions, including Jigsaw, Heroku and now Radian6. So while we're always focused on increasing operational efficiency, our efforts are not necessarily visible in our reported operating margin, while we're adding strategic, fast-growing but nevertheless dilutive acquisitions to expand our Cloud 2 vision.
So our approach for fiscal 2012, is to provide quarterly and full-year revenue and earnings guidance and to deliver on that guidance. To the extent they have upside on revenue in any particular quarter, we look to invest that upside in accelerating our growth through hiring, marketing programs and data center capacity. If we execute well, we will have higher revenue growth and slightly lower operating margins, but still hit our earnings goals. Fundamentally, we believe that investing in growth is the best way to create long-term shareholder value.
Now onto cash flow and balance sheet. First quarter operating cash generation was $140 million, down just slightly from last year's number of $143 billion. As I discussed on our last call, higher sales commission and bonus payouts from our strong fiscal 2011 finish, together with the increased hiring I mentioned a while back, affected our first quarter cash flow.
Capital spending was $27 million in Q1, primarily result of leasehold improvements in 3 different office locations and investments in our service delivery infrastructure.
Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $112 million in the quarter, that's down 15% from last year. Our definition of CapEx for this purpose excludes cash outflows relating to land activity and campus building improvements, which was just $1 million in the first quarter.
As we look through the remainder of the year, our strong first quarter operating cash flow invoicing gives me confidence to raise our operating cash flow estimates. We now expect full year operating cash flow to grow at a mid- to high-teens percentage rate, up from our prior guidance of low- to mid-teens percentage rate. Given our business model, we believe operating cash flow continues to be an important measure of our success.
Turning to the balance sheet, total cash and equivalents, including short- and long-term marketable securities, finished the quarter at roughly $1.5 billion. That's up about $115 million from Q4 but down approximately $379 million from Q1 last year, primarily as a result of our acquisition activity in the past four quarters.
Please remember that we already paid approximately $285 million in early May as part of the Radian6 purchase consideration. 
Our $575 million of convertible notes are significantly in the money, and it's important to understand that the note conversion feature increased our fully-diluted share count this quarter by approximately 3 million shares.
However, please remember that the hedge we executed at the same time as these notes will eliminate all but roughly 500,000 shares of this dilution when the notes reach maturity in January 2015. 
Also, please note that because the conversion trigger provision was met at the end of Q4 and at the end of Q1, the convertible notes are now shown under current liabilities.
Deferred revenue finished the quarter at roughly $915 million, that's an increase of 38% from the year-ago quarter, our largest increase since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Sequentially, deferred revenue declined by $20 million, a result that included approximately $15 million of sequential FX benefit and about $21 million of FX benefit versus Q1 last year.
Historically, deferred revenue tends to be roughly flat from Q1 to Q2. This year, given our strong Q1 results and some significant currency benefit in our first quarter number, we expect deferred revenue to be flat-to-down slightly through at end of Q2.
And finally, strong invoicing pushed Q1 receivables up 47% year-over-year to approximately $271 million. The result was a fourth-day year-over-year increase in DSO to 48 days. This increase was purely a function of the strength of our business in Q1, our first quarter collections were great, and our receivables aging is in good shape.
Let me close with our outlook. I'm very pleased to be able to raise the high-end of our full year revenue outlook by $17 million to a range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion. The high end of the revenue range represents the year-over-year revenue growth rate of both 30%.
Please remember that this range includes approximately $20 million of benefit from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, 08-01. The incremental revenue recognized under this new accounting standard in Q1 was approximately $1.5 million, but we do expect its effect to ramp up across the quarters this year. We now predict non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.30 to $1.32. This range reflects the $0.11 dilutive impact to the Radian6 acquisition, offset by the $0.01 overachievement that we just reported in Q1, and the $0.04 improvement in earnings from our lower estimated effective tax rate that I discussed earlier.
Although we are raising our overall EPS outlook for the year, I would like to remind you that Dreamforce will have a significant impact, we estimate at least $0.06 of EPS, on our Q3 results.
Second quarter revenue is projected to be in the range of $526 million to $528 million. This estimate includes approximately $5 million relating to revenue recognized on a cash basis for Radian6. I just want to point out that we have no prior experience at managing Radian6's receivables. We expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.29 to $0.30 in the second quarter.
Before I close, I remind that all of the underlying assumptions listed in our Q2 and full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance, as well as our GAAP guidance and assumptions can be found in our earnings press release. Please note that because we've not yet completed the purchase price [indiscernible] Radian6, our GAAP EPS forecast contains estimates of the Radian6 acquisition accounting.
So with that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today and open the call up for your questions. Operator?"

It's probably the fastest-growing of all the cloud computing companies that I've ever seen. The management team is spectacular. I think that probably one of the best parts of the acquisition was the CEO. Marcel is just a tremendous executive and a great new addition to Salesforce.com's management team. Each of their executives that I've met and their individual employees just have a very unique view and a very powerful view of the future of our industry. It certainly does set the foundation, for a marketing cloud, for Salesforce. It's the right place to start a marketing cloud when you look at today's world that's being driven by social networks. The most important thing in marketing is what's going on in these communities, and your brand has become a realtime conversation. It's not about advertising anymore. It's not about campaigns. It's not about events. It's all about the conversation on the Internet. And Radian6 is the leader in monitoring and managing that conversation for more than half of the Fortune 100. And they're really just getting going. It's a great team, great product, great technology. And if you haven't seen it, Laura, you get an account at radian6.com and you can sign up with the keywords that manage to you -- that are key to you, like all of the accounts that you follow, all the executives you follow, the products you follow, the competitors you follow. You put all that in, and Radian6 is going to give you the information you need to make better decisions. So it really is the beginning of the marketing cloud."

Of course, we're going to be the biggest cloud player, but we want to be one of the top five software companies in the world. That's our next goal. You've seen us pass $2 billion, you're going to see us pass $3 billion. I think that, that is just -- you can see it in our run rate, you can see it in our deferred, you can see the momentum that we have around the world. No success is linear, that's something that Mike Odel always tells me and I believe that. But I also look at 9 quarters now accelerating revenue run rate. Pretty awesome. And we see a big buying environment out there. And as I said, I met with 170 customers this quarter. They're all buying. And they're all looking to rebuild their enterprises. And we have to execute against that opportunity. Sales execution is a difficult thing, as you know. We did make a major investment last year. We've talked extensively with you about a 40% increase in our distribution. Organization, the vast majority of that is really probably yet to come online. And that's, as I've said publicly before, the upside. We have great products, The Sales Cloud, we've got The Service Cloud, we've got Jigsaw, we've got Radian6, we've got the Force.com platform, we've got Chatter. We've got plenty to sell. Customers want this next generation of technology. They want to build these social enterprises. You're going to see me next week in Japan with a major auto manufacturer talking about how we're bringing their products into the social networks. And how cars are becoming your friends in social networks, not just people. And that's true for all of our customers. They're looking at products in terms of how are their products integrated with our technology. We see our customers wanting to become cloud providers. Not just Groupon, but a lot of our customers who are maybe traditional products manufacturers, whether it's consumer product goods or traditional manufacturing. They want to build products that are operating in the cloud. And the reason why? Their customers are in the cloud, they need to get in the cloud to build their customers. We're that avenue, we're the bridge. How are you going to do that with SAP? How are you going to do that with Microsoft server? How are you going to do that with an Oracle Exadata mainframe? You just can't do it. And that's where we're getting the action. Because customers realize they're going to build new apps with our platform. They're going to deploy new types of social sales, new kind of social service, social marketing with Radian6. They see our social data collection and reporting through Jigsaw. It's a great opportunity. And it's really our sales challenge to get out there and to continue to close the deals, to do like what Laura was saying, to create the extraordinary transactions. And that's our opportunity and that's also our challenge."

I mean, I think that, as I've said publicly, and if you go to my Wikipedia page, you can see a report that I wrote in 2005 to the President of the United States on the cyber security as a crisis, a prioritization for the government and for a lot of companies. And I think that cyber security is tough. There's no finish line when it comes to cyber security. Everybody's got problems. Everybody will have problems. Computers are not perfect. And you've got to double-down on cyber security if you're in our business, and honestly if you're in any business. I really think that this is one of the reasons that we are more successful, is because our customers cannot do this. It's tough. And there's no finish line when it comes the security. And there is no perfection when it comes to security. So we have to work harder and we have to be a surrogate for a lot of our customers in providing that capability. I think one area that we have a unique model that we've benefited from, is I think every day, maybe 2 or 3 of our customers show up and do security reviews with us. They're reviewing our data centers. They're reviewing our code. They're reviewing our networks. In many cases, those customers are only doing a couple of security reviews themselves a year. They've got an out-vendor, I don't know how many vendors Sony has, for example. We're obviously a vendor to Sony, but in terms of cyber security to Sony, how many vendors do they have checking their technology on a regular basis. Most companies have a couple, they check it a couple of times a year. We're fortunate, we've got people checking us every day. Is that the panacea? Is that going to be -- is that the be-all end-all? No, it's not. And so we have to -- we have to double-down, everybody does. And if it's, as I said at the Gartner symposium last year, if security is not your number one issue for your company, it should be. In regards to kind of reliability issues, with Amazon, they obviously had a problem. They got through it. They're obviously stronger for it, it's one of the benefits of the model. We've had our own reliability issues along the way, I'm sure you remember, and no computer is perfect. But if you look at, for example, our operating history now, over 12 years of operating in our service, I think we're about better than any of our customers. I don't know a customer that's had better reliability in operating history than Salesforce.com over the last decade. So I think cloud computing is the right model. Will there be issues? Of course. And we've got, or you've got to deal with those issues head-on and move on. And that's the reality of our industry."

It's not a fixed app running on your PC. It's a database that lets you manage and share your information at a much lower cost, to integrate it deeply into the social networks and run it on your mobile devices. And this is really what customers want. And they integrate it into your websites. And they integrate it into your Internet sites. And they build custom apps, and on and on and on. And as we look at the heat maps for our customers, we look at how far is the platform driving into their enterprises. We had a customer speaker at our management meeting a couple of weeks ago, and they've put up a heat map of how far we've gotten into their enterprises. There were 15 apps that they had built, all in the platform. And that's very much our strategy in our customers."

I'll assess in detail next week. But our brand and our commitment to Japan, I think, has never been stronger. And we will double-down on our commitments to Japan. And we hope to be able to show customers through our outstanding reliability, scalability and availability during the disaster, that we are absolutely the right thing for Japan. Our data center in Tokyo is running well in test mode. It had no interruptions during this disaster. And we will turn it on to production shortly as well, which will be great for Japanese customers. And we continue to expect a very strong Japanese business."

It's a software product that you buy, install, upgrade and maintain to virtualize your servers, to make them more efficient. It's definitely a innovative step in the history of our industry where you can load software onto a server that may have not had the level of efficiency that you want as a large corporate customer, and you make that server be able to run multiple applications and multiple databases and multiple operating systems through this virtualization software. And that is virtualization. But that's not cloud computing, right? I mean that's not the public cloud. That's not the low-cost, efficient, shared model. That's not the 100,000 customers that we have running on 2,500 shared PCs. That's not kind of our cloud brethren, right, which are the very fast-growing companies who are delivering services. These are companies who are more running multi-tenant architectures, that are shared systems, that are delivering these applications directly over the Internet to millions of customers around the world. And that is the difference between kind of, what I would say our cloud computing model and the false cloud.

Following Marc and Graham's prepared remarks today, we'll open things up to your questions. We now have 43 analysts covering the company and because we want to get as many of you as possible, we will be limiting each of you to one question today. A complete disclosure of our second quarter results can be found in a press release issued about an hour ago, as well as in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Additional financial information, including detailed historical financial statements and facts is available on our website. Our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for both our reported results and our forward guidance can be found in our earnings press release. 
At times in our prepared comments, during responses to your questions, we may offer incremental metrics to provide a greater understanding of our business or our quarterly results. Please be advised that these additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not update them in the future. 
In addition, I remind you that this quarter is the last quarter in which the customer count metric will be provided as a regular part of our quarterly report. In the future, we expect to offer this metric periodically on a milestone basis. We're making this change because several of our recent acquisitions have had large number of users were linking those users to specific customer organizations can be extremely challenging and in some cases impossible. As a result, we believe our traditional customer metric will be less meaningful over time.

Some of our discussions and responses to questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, studies and assumptions.

I'm absolutely delighted to discuss the strong second quarter results, just 2 quarters now into our fiscal year and we will soon exceed a $2.2 billion annual revenue run rate, validating both our growth strategy and our ability to execute on the incredible opportunity. 
I'll begin by reviewing some of these financial highlights. Number one, revenue of $546 million rose by 38%, and we haven't seen revenue grow that fast in almost 3 years, and that was one we are less than 1/2 our current size. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 was at the high-end of our guided range, and we delivered that result even as our headcount has grown by more than 800 during the quarter. Deferred revenue increased by 37% to finish the quarter at $935 million, and operating cash flow rose by 9% to $83 million in the quarter, and we exit the quarter with nearly $1.2 billion of cash and equivalents at our balance sheet. 
Our financial success was powered by another quarter of tremendous customer success. And during the quarter, we added roughly 6,300 net new customers. That's a company record, smashing past 100,000 customer milestone. And let me just say that while we ended the quarter with 104,000 customers using our core Salesforce services, that number does not include the thousands more who are using Heroku and Radian6, which are 2 of our most recent acquisitions. 
We also saw continued strength in big deals during the second quarter and all we signed more than 60, we signed more than 60 7-figure transactions a 40% increase compared with last year and we signed 3, 3 8-figure megadeals. In addition, I'm thrilled to tell you we closed an additional 8-figure megadeal just after the quarter ended with a large telecommunications company that we will be announcing at Dreamforce. 
Given this strong financial and customer momentum, we're again raising our full year fiscal year '12 of revenue guidance which we now project at $2.22 billion to $2.23 billion. 
Over the quarter, I had the opportunity to travel around the world, discussing the power of cloud computing with customers, prospects, partners. And I started the quarter with an exciting trip to Japan where I announced our Toyota Friend vision with Toyota CEO Toyoda-San in Tokyo. The idea of Toyota Friend is simple. If I have friends on Facebook, why is my car not one of those friends? With Toyota Friend, Toyota is building a product social network where its employees, customers, dealers and its products, the cars themselves are all collaborating to a private and secure enterprise social network. 
The car is talking to me, telling me when it needs to be charged, where the service station is or important updates from dealers or the factory. It's a vision of a social enterprise that has awakened us to the opportunity of showing our customers a new way of delighting their customers. 
I then traveled to Washington DC to present at a sold-out Cloudforce of over 1,400 registered attendees where I announced that Salesforce.com has received a U.S. General Services Administration Moderate Level of Authority to Operate. We had exciting presentations in DC from a variety of salesforce customers including the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, the GSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Now I'm able to announce that one of the 8-digit deals in the quarter was with the GSA, which has signed an enterprise license agreements for 12,000 users. When we went on to Boston, again, we are greeted by sold-out crowd of over 1,700 attendees. There, we further articulated the power of cloud computing and showed the power of cloud, combined with social and mobile, fundamentally changes our companies, their employees partners and customers' collaborated, share and manage information. This time, it was network who showed not only an employee social network and a customer social network but also a product social network based on their new chatter-enabled switch. This vision of a next-generation social enterprise inspired us further that customers looking for exciting new ways to transform their business using the cloud. 
And finally, we went to Minneapolis, not exactly a city known for large crowds showing up for technology events, but we are greeted by a record 1,000 registered attendees. And we refined the social enterprise messaging based on our experiences in Tokyo in DC and Boston, and we showed the amazing social experience in the next generation of apps for Disney theme parks built on our Heroku platform. The Disney apps are tightly integrated with Facebook and can be seen at www.facebook.com/disneyland. Take a look and try out those amazing Heroku apps. They showed attendees how one of the world's most important brands has refined interactivity with its customers and develop a customer social network.  
And by the time we get to Dreamforce just a few days from today, where we expect over 40,000 people to register to attend, we will be showing a further assigned story of this NexGen of computing.  We'll demonstrate how companies, their employees, their customers, their products use the cloud social mobile technologies to create the social enterprise. 
We have seen the power of this transformation in small, medium and large customers around the world, and we believe we are witnessing a transformation of our industry based on this social revolution.  A revolution that's has shown our customers how to delight their customers in a whole new way. This revolution is only possible through the power of the cloud. With the cloud, we're able to deliver whatever a company is asking for, a solution that is fast to get going, easy to use and open all the major industry standards. And the social resolution is also changing the relationship we have with our customers. We're now engaging at a higher, more strategic level than ever before. 
That's certainly evidenced by the number of large transactions that we closed in the quarter, and customers are buying a broad selection of our services as you can see by the growth across all of our clouds. 
Sale Cloud. Hey, I'd like to start with our flagship Sales Cloud where our social enterprise message gives us a solution that is highly differentiated, enabling customers to sell with greater collaboration, mobility, productivity than ever before. A great example is Chartis Property and Casualty, which selected Salesforce for 10,000 seats of the Sales Cloud and 40,000 chatter seats. Chartis's vision for the social enterprise is an employee social network that fuels a new level of collaboration between their sales people and other and global employees across 117 countries. The Chartis Social Enterprise will allow sales teams to engage customers in a whole new way and proactively reach out to customers before policies expire. 
Other new or add-on deals for the Sales Cloud this quarter included Continental Casualty and ING, Medium Social Penske and Reco. And as I mentioned, the social enterprise message makes the Sales Cloud highly differentiated, allowing us to crush the competition. Against Microsoft, we won or add-on business of companies like Cisco, Decks 1, First National Bank of Omaha, George P. Johnson, Mutual Generale in France Transamerica Life and VHA.  
And against Oracle, we won deals including the Bank of New Zealand, Continental Casualty, JVWare, Integra Telecom and K-12. Against SAP, we won deals with Ashland, Dolby, Fujitsu and P&H Mining. As exciting as our Sales Cloud momentum is making at the #1 sales application in the world, perhaps nowhere is the social enterprise messaging as critical as customer service. 
Companies realize they need to meet customers where they are today on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. That's why we saw a continued strong growth in The Service Cloud as customers look for a new generation of technology designed from the ground up for a cloud, social and mobile world. An amazing example this is our largest Service Cloud transaction in the quarter, Tyco ADT, the leading home security company. ADT will be taking the social enterprise directly to the customer by arming its 4,000 field reps with iPads. These iPads will be loaded with mobile apps that allow ADT to deliver as much more powerful service than ever before. And to think that at the beginning of last year, iPad didn't even exist. The pace at which these companies are embracing social enterprise is amazing. 
Other new or significant add-on deals in The Service Cloud include GE Energy, Honeywell and Toto.  And today, I'm thrilled to tell you that more than 100,000 customers are now actively using Chatter, making it our most successful product introduction ever. We believe Chatter is the largest, most actively used social network in the world. These aren't 100,000 trials, these are 100,000 active social networks. 
Chatter lies at the heart of the social enterprise, giving companies a new level of collaboration, transparency and speed.  And in addition to elevating our conversation with customers into the C Suite, Chatter's also taking our deployments enterprisewide. New enterprisewide deployments this quarter included Chartis Property & Casualty, which I mentioned is deploying Chatter to more than 40,000 users; ADP, which is deploying Chatter to 42,000 users; MCA which extended Chatter to 14,000 users. They join a growing list of enterprises taking Chatter wall-to-wall including Dell and SunGard. 
Of course, the social enterprise needs a social enterprise platform. We've built Force.com and Heroku from the ground up to be social mobile and open, and that strategy has propelled us an incredible level of momentum. The market for cloud platforms is growing faster than ever, and we're thrilled that the salesforce platform was selected by Forrester as the leading cloud platform for developers, companies and ISPs. In this quarter, Force.com was our fastest growing business, outpacing even The Service Cloud, which continues to exceed overall company growth. 
This quarter, one of the world's great luxury brands, Burberry, selected Force.com to create a social enterprise with employees, partners, suppliers and customers. You'll meet Burberry at Dreamforce and you'll find out how they plan to create an employee social network tailored to Burberry's exacting brand standards that would allow us associates, creative teams, partners and vendors to collaborate like never before.  And Burberry will also be delivering next generation social apps that let customers experience the Burberry brand and culture anywhere on any device. It's an amazing vision, it's only possible to social enterprise platform. 
Other new or add-on Force.com customers this quarter included the GSA, LaRoche and Information Service International Densu. This quarter, we are seeing great traction with developers and partners building their own social enterprise apps. Force.com boasts now more than 400,000 developers and 240,000 custom apps. And Heroku has dramatically expanded its developer community, now supporting over 170,000 social and mobile apps written in Ruby On Rails. That's more than 3x last year's number, and if you can expect some exciting announcements about Heroku at Dreamforce. 
Of course, products are only great if people use them, and that's why adoption is such an important indicator of customer success. During the second quarter, the Force.com platform delivered a record 36 billion transactions. That's more than 500 million transactions from Force.com every business day. 
Look, companies realize that cloud, social and mobile are the future. Forrester predicts that the public cloud will grow from 25 billion in this year to nearly 160 billion in 2020, and we expect our strategy of transforming companies in the social enterprise will help us to taking a bigger share of that market than we already have. We see tremendous growth opportunities ahead, and you're going to see us invest in growth through hiring, through product development, through events and more.  
And finally, I want to remind you that we're only 8 business days from the world's largest cloud computing event and soon, the industry's largest enterprise software conference, Dreamforce, which runs August 30 to September 2 right here in San Francisco. Dreamforce is the place to hear how customers use the cloud, social, mobile technologies to create a next generation of social enterprise. 
In addition to hosting the biggest selection of cloud products under one roof, with nearly 300 partners in the expo, which is going to be amazing, we will have a number special guests this year including Krouse, the European Commissioner for Digital Agenda; Vivek Kundra, the former CIO of the U.S. federal government; Google Chairman, Eric Schmidt; Metallica and will.i.am.

122917,138944248,160628,"Salesforce.com, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2011",2011-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter. Our business results reflected both great execution and continued healthy business demand. Second quarter revenue of $546 million was 38% from the year ago quarter. The main drivers for the top li",2082,"Thanks, Marc. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter. Our business results reflected both great execution and continued healthy business demand. Second quarter revenue of $546 million was 38% from the year ago quarter. The main drivers for the top line growth were: first, new business which Marc has already discussed. Not only did we add a record 6,300 net new customers in the quarter but we also saw strong add-on and upgrade business in our customer base. In fact, more than 1/2 of new business sales in the quarter were Internet customer based. 
As you know, many of our most successful customers start small and grow over time. With over 100,000 accounts now and an expanding portfolio of products, our customer base represents a huge growth opportunity. 
Second, a continued reduction in our attrition rate. Dollar attrition fell for the eighth consecutive quarter and continues to be in the mid-teens percentage range when compared to the year-ago quarter. As we said in the past, minimizing attrition is an important foundation for growth especially as our business scales over time.  
And lastly, a weaker dollar. Excluding a year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately $18 million, constant-currency revenue growth was 34%. We didn't see any changes in pricing based on our rolling quarter trends for both regions and additions. 
On a regional basis, revenue in the Americas grew 34% from a year ago to $367 million. European revenue of $102 million rose 56% year-over-year in dollars and 36% in constant currency. Within the region, the U.K. had a particularly strong year-over-year in new business quarter. And finally, Asia revenue of roughly $77 million increased 42% in dollars and 33% in constant currency versus Q2 a year ago. While second quarter new business in Japan was down slightly versus a year ago, the demand environment improved significantly from Q1. So we're incrementally more optimistic Japan in the second half of the year. 
Our revenue mix was 93% subscription and support and 7% professional services. On a year-over-year basis, the 1-point increase in the consulting proportion was primarily the result of implementing the EITF 08-01 Accounting Standard that we discussed at the start of the year. Our vision of the social enterprise that Marc described earlier will likely require that we build a small team of architecture and user interface specialists to spearhead some of implementation teams. 
We've consulting headcount while it's flat for the last 2 years so the combination of building this team, together with a more favorable accounting treatment for consulting revenue, will likely result in this smaller mix shift back to professional services for the remainder of fiscal 2012. 
Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Non-GAAP gross margin remained unchanged from Q1, and the year-ago quarter approximately 82%. While non-GAAP gross margin through our subscription and support business was flat sequentially at 86%, it was down a bit from last year, primarily as a result of some of our acquired businesses like Heroku and Radian6, as well as the buildout of our Japan data center, which we expect to become operational by the end of fiscal '12. 
Similar to the first quarter, year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin for our Professional Services business went from a negative to positive in Q2 improving to 18%. This margin improvement in the first half is the result of 2 factors: First, at the beginning of fiscal 2012, we reduced some of the headcount in non-billing roles in Professional Services; and second, Accounting Standard EITF 08-01 has had the effect of bringing forward certain project-related revenues that were previously deferred. 
Now onto expenses. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were roughly 71% of revenue for Q2. That's unchanged from Q1 but up 5 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of our accelerated M&A activity over the past year, as well as our continued aggressive hiring. 
During the quarter, we added more than 800 people. That includes more than 300 from the acquisition of Radian6. Our total employee population is now more than 6,300, that's an increase of more than 1,900 or about 40% from a year ago. As in the past, our hiring focus continues to be in the area of sales and engineering capacity, and acquisitions are obviously also fueling our employee growth. At this point, we expect aggressive hiring to continue through the second half of fiscal 2012. 
R&D was our fastest growing expense category in Q2, up 60% year-over-year to 11% of revenue.  In the importance of product innovation, we'll continue to invest in hiring and retaining the best software engineers in the world. 
Sales and marketing expenses were up 50% year-over-year at 46% of revenue. In addition to hiring, our sales and marketing expense reflects a very active event campaign through the second quarter, including Cloudforce events in Washington, New York, Boston and Minneapolis. As you know, we view these events as important not just for near-term revenue growth through pipeline generation. We're also building awareness in Salesforce.com. 
Q2 sales and marketing expenses also included the approximately $0.04 per share costs of the one-time charge related to the settlement for a California state wage lawsuit which was disclosed mid-quarter in an 8-K filing. 
Finally, G&A costs rose by 33% from a year ago and was 13% of revenue. While G&A costs can be somewhat lumpy as we scale for growth and integrate acquisitions, we remain fully committed to our long-term goal of reducing G&A as a percentage of revenue. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin was flat from Q1 at 11% but down roughly 5 points from last year. The biggest driver, of course, is the fact that we've acquired 9 companies over the past 15 months, all of which were either technology purchases such as the Heroku or fast-growing businesses such as Jigsaw and Radian6, which have yet to achieve G&A break even. 
While we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles in our non-GAAP results, it's important to remember the impact these acquired companies are having on our fiscal 2012 GAAP operating results. 
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 was roughly 26%. This was a bit lower than our guided rate of 30%, primarily due to a larger-than-expected tax benefit relating to the acquisition of Radian6 and as well to the bigger-than-anticipated federal R&D tax credits benefit. Because of the lower Q2 tax rate, we now estimate our full year fiscal 2012 tax rate to be approximately 32%, that's a point better than our last estimate. Looking ahead to the fiscal 2013, we do expect our tax rate increase, probably to a level somewhere between fiscal 2010 and 2011 levels due to the scheduled expiration of the federal R&D tax credits and also because of Radian6 acquisition's will cause a slight drag on our tax rate next year versus having a benefit this year. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.30 for the quarter, at the high end of our guidance range and during the quarter. While we did benefit by roughly $0.02 from the lower tax rate I just mentioned, we were also able to absorb the approximately $0.04 charge from the legal settlement that I discussed earlier. Strong execution and above planned growth enable us to overcome that net deficit and deliver on our EPS guidance. 
Moving on to the cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased by 9% from a year ago to just under $83 million in Q2. However, it's important to note that we prepaid just over $13 million of Dreamforce expenses in Q2 compared with $0 in the comparable quarter last year. We still expect full year operating cash flow to grow by the mid to high teens percentage rate that I highlighted on our last call. We project Q3 operating cash flow growth well above the Q2 level. And without Dreamforce in the fourth quarter numbers, we should see a record cash flow quarter to end the year. 
CapEx finished the quarter at around $45 million. This was a little higher than we've seen recently so let me take a moment just to drill into that detail. The biggest driver of capital spending continues to be employee growth, both in the form of the leasehold improvements and computer equipment for employees. In fiscal '12, we expect about 1/2 of all CapEx to be employee growth related. 
The second largest category is data centers, primarily the data center buildout and core components which includes cages, power and network infrastructure. This category is by nature little lumpy and in Q2 was higher than normal because of the Japan data center buildout. And just to remind everybody, we do lease most of the service and storage equipment that goes into the data center so those items are not included in CapEx. 
The third largest category is capitalized and software costs for our service delivery and for large IT projects. And finally, we also spent $6.5 million purchasing domain names and where we don't expect to be a regular. CapEx is up 83%. For the full year, we would expect it to increase by approximately 50% based on anticipated hiring and the completion of the Japan data center. We expect Q3 CapEx to be down from Q2. 
With that background, Q2 free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less reported CapEx, was approximately $38 million, that's down 22% compared to a year ago. However, given my operating cash flow commentary above, we are projecting free cash flow growth in Q3 and Q4. 
Cash and equivalents, including short and long-term operational securities, finished the quarter just under $1.3 billion. This was down approximately $200 million from Q1, primarily as a result of acquisition of Radian6 earlier in the quarter. The deferred revenue finished the quarter at $935 million, that's an increase of 37% from the year ago quarter. Our deferred revenue result included about $2 million of sequential FX headwind and approximately $80 million of tailwind from the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for FX, year-over-year constant currency growth for deferred revenue was 34%. 
Receivables were once again well managed during the quarter. DSO of 58 days was up slightly over the prior year number of 53 days but well within the range we would expect for business with an accelerating top line. Our receivables aging remains excellent. 
Obviously, our acquisition of Radian6 affected several balance sheet accounts, most notably goodwill, moved higher by $265 million. In addition, capitalized software increased by $70 million, almost all of which was the result of the acquired Radian6 technology. And Radian6 was also the primary driver of changes to prepaid income taxes and income taxes payable.  
And finally, we're executing well on Radian6 cash collections. The cash basis full year revenue recognition that I discussed when we announced the deal is expected to cause a smaller revenue spike in Q4. 2 quarters out, it's is difficult to predict the Q4 to Q1 revenue transition with a lot of precision but it's possible that Radian6 revenue may actually decline slightly in Q1 as we complete the transition from cash to invoice-based revenue recognition. 
As we look to the remainder of the year, our strong first half performance and pipeline of business are encouraging. While we are mindful of the macro environment, and we'll be watching for any changes to our strong business trends, growth continues to be our top priority. 
With that backdrop, we are projecting third quarter revenue of approximately $568 million to $570 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.30 to $0.31 per share. For the full year, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.23 billion. This represents an increase of $65 million from the midpoint of prior guidance, a new midpoint and prior full year revenue growth of approximately 34%. We plan to invest this revenue outside back into the business, particularly in distribution capacity. In that context, we are leaving our full year non-GAAP EPS estimate unchanged at $1.30 to $1.32. 
Before I close, I'd like to personally invite all of you to Dreamforce 2011. As Marc indicated, we're expecting a biggest and most amazing Dreamforce ever. In addition to the customer or partner events that you should plan to attend on the first 2 days, David and I will be hosting an estimate on the Wednesday from 2:00 until 3;30, and we really look forward to seeing you all there.

Each month was very strong. We had a strong finish to the quarter. It would have been a blowout quarter except for that fourth 8-digit transaction that I mentioned, came in the week after the quarter which is setup. This quarter was a strong start. And our -- I was out in the market very aggressively during the quarter, as I mentioned, in Japan, DC, Boston, Minneapolis, and I just want to tell you that when I show up in Minneapolis, I expect a crowd of 200 to 300 people, not 1,000.  And in each of these environments, I'm seeing 2x to 3x what I would normally expect in terms of physical turnout.  And when we look at kind of already the registrations that are done for Dreamforce, and the ones that are easiest to spot are the paid registrations, our numbers are up, I think, 30% to 40% year-over-year. So we don't see a soft rate environment, we see for our business a very strong and accelerating environment, and that's why we're raising guidance. If the environment would change, we would, of course, we would let you know. And we think we're really well positioned for the future. We certainly are -- we certainly saw also in the quarter with a number of very large transactions that were happening just a robust acceleration of our existing customers of going deeper with us. And I think that, that's going to be very, very powerful. I also want to say, attrition was really low during the quarter, which was amazing, we saw attrition drop.  And so attrition is really, really down from where we saw it peak out in 2009. And that's, of course, should help in the quarter as well."

You'll remember that last year, we onboarded approximately 40% distribution capacity increase. And I think that you're seeing that payout when you see 38% year-over-year growth and 37% growth in deferred. We spied a lot of that coming from this distribution capacity that we added last year that's still coming online. So our gut reaction is adding more distribution capacity because the more distribution capacity we add, the more sales and more market share we get.  And we're still very small in our distribution organization in terms of size compared to a Microsoft, Oracle or SAP which are really our target and so we want to grow aggressively.  And I think that if there's anything you're going to see us do, we are going to invest, we're going to grow and we are going to hire because we want to take advantage of this opportunity.  And if you look back at things different times of turbulence in the last 10 years that I've been CEO of Salesforce, the biggest mistake I ever made in any one particular time was when I did not hire aggressively. Hiring has always paid out for this company. And the market is so enormous and so exciting on a global basis. And right now, the products in such a mature and exciting point in being able to handle very large companies or very small companies, we want to be able to satisfy that demand through our distribution organization.

But really, Radian6 is the first company that we've bought where we really feel like it's transforming the company.  And that's really what Radian6 has done. I mean, when we bought Radian6, we talked about, ""Well, it's the beginning of the marketing cloud, which it certainly is, and it's about social listening which is certainly is."" But what Radian6 did was it opened our eyes to the opportunities in the social enterprise.  And if you go to YouTube and you type Gatorade social media monitoring or you type Dell social media command center others, you're going to find these social media command centers that Radian6 is building all over the world to help companies monitor and manage what's going on in the social enterprise. And that really woke us up to what are all the other things that we should be doing in regards to social monitor and social enterprise.

We've seen salesforce deliver enterprise license agreements but it just has not been a big focus for us as we've moved to the social enterprise our customers are saying, ""What about social enterprise license agreements?"" And when we look at these SELAs, we're like, ""Wow, how do we deliver to this customer a full social enterprise license?""

Are you buying more BA? Are you buying net lever? These are last generation technologies. Lotus Notes, SharePoint, I mean, these are more -- this is more server, more servers and more software and not more solutions.  And I think customers have seen with Force.com, they can basically build at 5x faster at half the cost. That's proven over and over again by every major independent analyst firm that's out there. And they can do it whether they want to do it clicks or code and now we're extended it with Heroku given the another tremendous option in terms of opening the platform of Ruby On Rails and you're going to see the platform opening up much further with exciting new languages that we have been foreshadowing at Dreamforce. And we're high on Platform-as-a-Service. And at the heart of the social enterprise agreements, we talk about you've got to build your employee social network, which is getting your collaboration employees with Chatter and your sales people in place with our Sales Cloud and the service organization. And then we get right into, ""Okay, let's build some custom applications and automate and extend what you're doing in Force.com plays right into that."" Then we start to talk about like as Tom mentioned in the call here like with Disneyland, let's build some sites for public consumption like we've done at facebook.com/disneyland, and then let's move into the partner social networks and the product social networks and that are listening through the Radian6. It's a big indicator the customers as they need to move the Force.com and to Heroku to maximize their investments of salesforce and thousands and thousands have.  And it's really because those old software companies have not stepped up with new tools and new solutions. They have been -- they look a little bit long in the tooth. It's a little bit too much if your grandfather's enterprise software and it's not enough about cloud, mobile and social. And that's a big opportunity for salesforce and when you get the Dreamforce, you're going to see that the out even further."

And that's really why we've always talked about Chatter as an entry point to us, and in many cases, a Trojan horse for us, and in many ways, it's really establishing our position wall-to-wall for the first time inside of a customer. And the Chatter price points have been, I would say, very exciting but not as exciting as a very rich price point of traditional CRM systems or data management systems or even application development and deployment systems.  And that's been 100% our expectation all along. There is no sexier demo and no more exciting place to enter a company than with Chatter. If you've been watching every Monday in the Wall Street Journal, we have a different customer being featured, and we've had CEO after CEO after CEO in those ads, and there's a line of them still coming. We did not have a product that CEOs were using before.  And when you see those CEOs using that product on their iPads, that is a kind of positioning we want that we want to be able to go into this easy to that of your message of audio think you can increase or productivity get your company going faster and get greater alignment and collaboration. That's what Chatter is all about. But in terms of building a social enterprise, well, it's much more than just Chatter, it's about the Sales Cloud, The Service Cloud and Force.com, Heroku, Radian6 and all the other technology that we have.  And when you put all of that together, that is exactly, as you said, opportunity for the social enterprise license agreement and those, with those large customers that are all over the country that we've been building up over time, more and more, we hear, we want a one price for the next 3 years and the true-up opportunity so that we can really double down on your technology.  And we're really working on understanding how to do that, and I think by Dreamforce, we'll have the first introduction of that capability."

But it seems to me that some of the things that people are concerned about, you're actually better positioned than others.  And I just wanted to know if you could share with us a little bit more. I know for EMEA exposure, you're somewhere 20%, maybe a little less than that which, by the way, is an opportunity you started a year, and you're a relatively young company makes sense that you have less exposure than the average software company. But what about public sector and financial services exposure? Can you tell us a little bit about how much of your revenue or bookings are even generally comes from those 2 verticals?"

We're probably very unique as a software company, number one, in that we have such a huge stratification of enterprises that we work with in size from the very smallest to the very large. So if it's all about SMB, maybe it's just up to the enterprise. If it's all about the enterprise, maybe it's just down to the SMB. And then, we are again diversified our portfolio across the 8 main countries that we do business in. And then, we have a number of industries that we have strengthened but no one industry and no one market and no one geography, except for maybe the United States, really is are we that dependent on, I would say.  And public sector is not something that we have really ever been able to turn and -- we've never focused on it honestly. It's probably a mistake that I've made. I probably shouldn't be focusing more on the last 13 years on public sector. I just haven't really gotten around to it because we've had so many other exciting opportunities. Some of our competitors have been able to move into public sector because we haven't. And that hasn't been a big focus. They've come more to us. You saw that transaction with the GSA this quarter. We see more opportunity in the federal government obviously in the future. We've had great success in Japan. And obviously, Japan has not been the best environment in the last couple of quarters because of the disaster. It's happened there but we continue to have a robust business there. So I have really focused on building this company to be having a very diverse portfolio of business, and I think that is why, when you look at the last recession in 2008 and 2009, and I don't think we are going into another recession, by the way. I'm not an economist but that's my off-the-hand comment. I think that we can see that this company came out of it roaring, and the reason why is because we maintain our customers and we mitigate their risk, and they want to double down with us because they don't want to buy more software and hardware. There's nothing riskier in the technology industry than loading up with another Exadata mainframe or another huge piece of enterprise software where you're not going to see return for 2 to 3 years. The way to get value and the way to get innovation in your company and the way to get your company rightsized and growing is get them on the cloud and get them on the public cloud, not this kind of false cloud called which is the virtualization train. So I say, here's another great opportunity. Every time I see these somewhat volatile markets where companies are working to mitigate their risks, I'm like, ""Here we go. Let's just ramp up sales because this is the opportunity to take advantage of customers' desire to innovate in an ever-changing environment but to do it without burning themselves without all that traditional Oracle technology."""

Well, I think where we are certainly in the first inning. And when you look at it, we've been talking a lot for the last couple of years now about something called Cloud 2, which is we kind of moved from the first generation of cloud, which is where we started which is people still have their notebooks and their laptops, which they have less and less every day of. And they have this more stable browser environment, they have HTML and we were able to deliver them enterprise-class services right into the browser customized exactly for them. That was really Cloud 2. Cloud 2 was we saw this huge shift from social networks, with Facebook, with Twitter and Google+, with the mobile environment, with the iPhone and the iPad and the Android accelerations and then the continued amplification of the cloud itself being more robust, more scalable, more scalable than ever before. And then customers would say, ""Well, what is Cloud 3?"" And when we saw Cloud 3, we're like, ""We're not sure when we're going to have Cloud 3. What is Cloud 3?"" And then all of a sudden, something amazing happened to me personally last December, which was the CEO of Toyota came over to my house and he said, ""What am I supposed to do with my company?"" And I kind of was, ""Well, I'm not exactly sure."" I looked down and I grabbed my hat and I pulled a rabbit out of it, and I said, ""You need a friend and your friend should be your car in the way of a Toyota Corolla and a Toyota Tacoma. You should have -- And you have a Prius, you should have a Toyota friend."" And the Toyota Friend should be a car on the social network that is talking to you. And then as we start to build it out for him, I started to lay out all the things that he should do for Toyota, build the Toyota Friend, put in Chatter and build an employee social network, get your sales force aligned, build in -- build this customer service, get his dealers onboard, get it rebuilt these kind of legacy factory applications and build this integrated environment. And then at the end of it, I'm like, ""Wow, what is this?"" And after we looked at it and we're obviously positioned it to him and he's become a huge fan of this and others, we're like, ""Well, are we building a customer cloud? Is that what it is?"" Well, ""that's not exactly it."" And then we're like, ""This is not really the social enterprise. This is the next step in business."" And as we've defined that and been able to articulate it had, it's very large clouds, customers are really observed at the end of that it does the way where they can really understand and accept our product strategy and how they can action it.  And that actionable aspect of it is very powerful for the company, and now we've done is we've taken our management team and we've pushed them back out to our top 1,000 customers and said, ""Go out and define. Here's the Toyota example."" And there's other examples I won't tell you which ones they are. We've talked about some of them previously and the last call Groupon was another one came out of this exercise. And now for our top 1,000 customers, we're defining from them at the sea level what the social enterprise is. Every executive, Graham has one, I have. Every executive has multiple customers, and we're all out there positioning what is the social enterprise, and we have really found our way to help companies go to the next level. They worked a lot on their back offices. Their ledgers, their payables, their receivables, they've got the Oracle, or their SAP all those horrible stuff in there but on their front office, they just have not really evolved that and a long time and it's not just about FSA or a call center. It's about rethinking their customer experience. And that is the company we want to be. We want to be a company that defines what you do with your customers and the way you're going to interact with your customers and be more successful than ever before is by becoming a social enterprise.  And that's what Salesforce.com has articulated and that's what you will see further articulated at Dreamforce. And it's a solution sell, it's not a product sell, it's an advisory role and customers are really loving it and looking at us as in a whole new way, and that's why I think you're going to see the deals get bigger."

And as we buy these companies really for the first time in the last 12 months that we bought the big companies with Jigsaw, Heroku and Radian6, it's really impacted that GAAP number. And as CEO, my job and how I look at it at this point in this company's history is not to focus on that GAAP profit number. I think I've said that a number of times that we are really focused on that top line and the market share opportunity. And if we were focused on the GAAP number, we would not be buying anybody, number one.  And we would be probably running a much leaner machine, and we would not be as excited as on market share gains.  And so what I really instructed the company to do is to blow it out on the top line, and that's why there are too many enterprise software companies of the $2 billion-plus level of delivering a 38% top line growth this quarter, and you can forecast that out through the next year as well. And the cost of that comes in the GAAP line, of course, and the GAAP profit line. I'm sure there will be a day in the future where we'll say, ""Well, we're not going to buy any more companies. We're already satisfied where we are. And now, we're going to maximize GAAP profit."" And we've shown that we can do that by slowing hiring or whatever. That's not where this company is. This is a growth company, this is a growth story, this is about the next-generation and you aren't going to build a great company if you focus only on GAAP profit.

I'd like to welcome everyone to Salesforce.com's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results Call.

I'd like to welcome everyone to Salesforce.com's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results Call. Here today to discuss our strong quarterly performance, are Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; as well as Graham Smith, our CFO. 
Following Marc and Graham's prepared remarks today, we'll open things up to your questions. We now have 43 analysts covering the company and because we want to get as many of you as possible, we will be limiting each of you to one question today. A complete disclosure of our second quarter results can be found in a press release issued about an hour ago, as well as in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Additional financial information, including detailed historical financial statements and facts is available on our website. Our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for both our reported results and our forward guidance can be found in our earnings press release. 
At times in our prepared comments or in responses to your questions, we may offer incremental metrics to provide a greater understanding of our business or our quarterly results. Please be advised these additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not update them in the future. 
In addition, I remind you that this quarter is the last quarter in which the customer count metric will be provided as a regular part of our quarterly report. In the future, we expect to offer this metric periodically on a milestone basis. We're making this change because several of our recent acquisitions have had large number of users were linking those users to specific customer organizations can be extremely challenging and in some cases, impossible. As a result, we believe our traditional customer metric will be less meaningful over time. 
With that, let me make this call official with a brief Safe Harbor. The primary purpose of today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fiscal second quarter performance. Some of our discussions or responses to questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. All of these risks and uncertainties and assumptions, as well as other information on potential factors that could affect our financial results are included in our reports filed with the SEC, including our recent report on Form 10-Q, particularly under the heading Risk Factors. 
To access our Q2 release, including the GAAP to non-GAAP recons, our historical results, any of our SEC disclosures, a webcast replay today's call, or simply to learn more about salesforce, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations website at salesforce.com/investors.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Marc, please be advised that we may reference certain unreleased services or features that is not yet available on today's discussion. We can't guarantee the future timing or availability of these services or features. As such, customers who purchase our services should make their purchase decisions based on services and features that are currently available. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Marc to discuss our excellent second quarter. Marc?"
122917,138944248,160721,"Salesforce.com, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2011",2011-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. I'm absolutely delighted to discuss these strong second quarter results, just 2 quarters now into our fiscal year and we will soon exceed a $2.2 billion annual revenue run rate, validating both our growth strategy and our ability to execute",2180,"Thanks, David. I'm absolutely delighted to discuss these strong second quarter results, just 2 quarters now into our fiscal year and we will soon exceed a $2.2 billion annual revenue run rate, validating both our growth strategy and our ability to execute on the incredible opportunity.  I'll begin by reviewing some of these financial highlights. Number one, revenue of $546 million rose by 38%, and we haven't seen revenue grow that fast in almost 3 years, and that was one we are less than 1/2 our current size. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 was at the high-end of our guided range, and we delivered that result even as our headcount has grown by more than 800 during the quarter. Deferred revenue increased by 37% to finish the quarter at $935 million, and operating cash flow rose by 9% to $83 million in the quarter, and we exit the quarter of nearly $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheets. 
Our financial success was powered by another quarter of tremendous customer success. And during the quarter, we added roughly 6,300 net new customers, that's a company record, smashing past 100,000 customer milestone. And let me just say that, while we ended the quarter with 104,000 customers using our core Salesforce services, that number does not include the thousands more who are using Heroku and Radian6, which are 2 of our most recent acquisitions. 
We also saw continued strength in big deals during the second quarter and all we signed more than 60, we signed more than sixty 7-figure transactions a 40% increase compared with last year, and we signed three, three 8-figure megadeals. In addition, I'm thrilled to tell you, we closed an additional 8-figure megadeal just after the quarter ended with a large telecommunications company that we will be announcing at Dreamforce. 
Given this strong financial and customer momentum, we're again, raising our full year fiscal year '12 revenue guidance, which we now project at $2.22 billion to $2.23 billion. 
Over the quarter, I had the opportunity to travel around the world, discussing the power of cloud computing with customers, prospects, partners. And I started the quarter with an exciting trip to Japan where I announced our Toyota Friend vision with Toyota CEO Toyoda-san in Tokyo. The idea of Toyota Friend is simple. If I have friends on Facebook, why is my car not one of those friends? With Toyota Friend, Toyota is building a product social network, where its employees, customers, dealers and its products, the cars themselves are all collaborating to a private and secure enterprise social network. 
The car is talking to me, telling me when it needs to be charged, where the service station is or important updates from dealers or the factory. It's a vision of a social enterprise that has awakened us to the opportunity of showing our customers a new way of delighting their customers. I then traveled to Washington DC to present at a sold-out Cloudforce of over 1,400 registered attendees, where I announced that Salesforce.com has received a U.S. General Services Administration Moderate Level of Authority to Operate. We had exciting presentations in DC from a variety of salesforce customers, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, the GSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Now I'm able to announce that one of the 8-digit deals in the quarter was with the GSA, which has signed an enterprise license agreement for 12,000 users. When we went on to Boston, again, we were greeted by sold-out crowd of over 1,700 attendees. There, we further articulated the power of cloud computing and showed the power of cloud, combined with social and mobile, fundamentally changes our companies, their employees partners and customers' collaborated, share and manage information. This time, it was Enterasys Networks who showed not only an employee social network and a customer social network, but also a product social network based on their new chatter-enabled switch. This vision of a next-generation social enterprise inspired us further that customers looking for exciting new ways to transform their business using the cloud. 
And finally, we went to Minneapolis, not exactly a city known for a large crowds showing up for technology events, but we are greeted by a record 1,000 registered attendees. And we refined our social enterprise messaging based on our experiences in Tokyo and DC and Boston, and we showed the amazing social experience in the next generation of apps for Disney's theme parks, built on our Heroku platform. The Disney apps are tightly integrated with Facebook and can be seen at www.facebook.com/disneyland. Take a look and try out those amazing Heroku apps. They showed attendees how one of the world's most important brands has refined interactivity with its customers and develop a customer social network.  
And by the time we get to Dreamforce just a few days from today, where we expect over 40,000 people to register to attend, we will be showing a further assigned story of this nextgen of computing. We'll demonstrate how companies, their employees, their customers, their products use the cloud social mobile technologies to create the social enterprise. 
We have seen the power of this transformation at small, medium and large customers around the world, and we believe we are witnessing a transformation of our industry based on this social revolution. A revolution that has shown our customers how to delight their customers in a whole new way. This revolution is only possible through the power of the cloud. With the cloud, we're able to deliver what every company is asking for, a solution that is fast to get going, easy to use and open to all the major industry standards. And the social resolution is also changing the relationship we have with our customers. We're now engaging at a higher, more-strategic level than ever before. 
That's certainly evidenced by the number of large transactions that we closed during the quarter, and customers are buying a broad selection of our services as you can see by the growth across all of our clouds. Sale Cloud, ""hey, I'd like to start with our flagship Sales Cloud where our social enterprise message gives us a solution that is highly differentiated, enabling customers to sell with greater collaboration, mobility, productivity than ever before."" A great example is Chartis Property and Casualty, which selected Salesforce for 10,000 seats of the Sales Cloud and 40,000 chatter seats. Chartis's vision for the social enterprise is an employee social network that fuels a new level of collaboration between their sales people and other in global employees across 117 countries. The Chartis Social Enterprise will allow sales teams to engage customers in a whole new way and proactively reach out to customers before policies expire. 
Other new or add-on deals for the Sales Cloud this quarter included Continental Casualty and ING, and LivingSocial Penske and REECO. And as I mentioned, the social enterprise message makes the Sales Cloud highly differentiated, allowing us to crush the competition. Against Microsoft, we won new or add-on business of companies like Cisco, Dex One, First National Bank of Omaha, George P. Johnson, Mutual Générale in France, Transamerica Life and VHA.  
And against Oracle, we won deals including the Bank of New Zealand, Continental Casualty, JBWere, Integra Telecom and K-12. Against SAP, we won deals with Ashland, Dolby, Fujitsu and P&H Mining. As exciting as our Sales Cloud momentum is making it the #1 sales application in the world, perhaps nowhere is the social enterprise messaging as critical as customer service. 
Companies realize they need to meet customers where they are today on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. That's why we saw a continued strong growth in The Service Cloud as customers look for a new generation of technology designed from the ground up for a cloud, social and mobile world. An amazing example of this is our largest Service Cloud transaction in the quarter, Tyco ADT, the leading home security company. ADT will be taking the social enterprise directly to the customer by arming its 4,000 field reps with iPads. These iPads will be loaded with mobile apps that allow ADT to deliver as much more powerful service than ever before. And to think that at the beginning of last year, iPad didn't even exist. The pace at which these companies are embracing social enterprise is amazing. 
Other new or significant add-on deals in The Service Cloud include GE Energy, Honeywell and Toto.  And today, I'm thrilled to tell you that more than 100,000 companies are now actively using Chatter, making it our most successful product introduction ever. We believe Chatter is the largest, most actively used social network in the world. These aren't 100,000 trials, these are 100,000 active social networks. 
Chatter lies at the heart of the social enterprise, giving companies a new level of collaboration, transparency and speed. And in addition to elevating our conversation with customers into the C-suite, Chatter's also taking our deployments enterprise-wide. New enterprise-wide deployments this quarter include Chartis Property & Casualty, which I mentioned is deploying Chatter to more than 40,000 users; ADP, which is deploying Chatter to 42,000 users; MCA which extended Chatter to 14,000 users. They join a growing list of enterprises taking Chatter wall-to-wall, including Dell and SunGard. 
Of course, the social enterprise needs a social enterprise platform. We've built Force.com and Heroku from the ground up to be social mobile and open, and that strategy has propelled us to an incredible level of momentum. The market for cloud platforms is growing faster than ever, and we're thrilled that the salesforce platform was selected by Forrester as the leading cloud platform for developers, companies and ISPs. In this quarter, Force.com was our fastest growing business, outpacing even The Service Cloud, which continues to exceed overall company growth. 
This quarter, one of the world's great luxury brands, Burberry, selected Force.com to create a social enterprise for it's employees, partners, suppliers and customers. You'll meet Burberry at Dreamforce and you'll find out how they plan to create an employee social network tailored to Burberry's exact theme brand standards that will allow it's associates, creative teams, partners and vendors to collaborate like never before. And Burberry will also be delivering next generation social apps that let customers experience the Burberry brand and culture anywhere on any device. It's an amazing vision, it's only possible to social enterprise platform. 
Other new or add-on Force.com customers this quarter included the GSA, F. Hoffman-LaRoche and Information Service International, Dentsu. This quarter, we are seeing great traction with developers and partners building their own social enterprise apps. Force.com boasts now more than 400,000 developers and 240,000 custom apps. And Heroku has dramatically expanded its developer community, now supporting over 170,000 social and mobile apps written in Ruby on Rails. That's more than 3x last year's number, and if you can expect some exciting announcements about Heroku at Dreamforce. 
Of course, products are only great if people use them, and that's why adoption is such an important indicator of customer success. During the second quarter, the Force.com platform delivered a record of 36 billion transactions. That's more than 500 million transactions from Force.com every business day. 
Look if companies realize that cloud, social and mobile are the future, Forrester predicts that the public cloud will grow from 25 billion this year to nearly 160 billion in 2020, and we expect our strategy of transforming companies in the social enterprise will help us take even bigger share of that market than we already have. We see tremendous growth opportunities ahead, and you're going to see us invest in growth through hiring, through product development, through events and more.  
And finally, I want to remind you that we're only 8 business days away from the world's largest cloud computing event and soon, the industry's largest enterprise software conference, Dreamforce, which runs August 30 to September 2 right here in San Francisco. Dreamforce is the place to hear how customers use the cloud, social, mobile technologies to create a next generation of social enterprise. 
In addition to hosting the biggest selection of cloud products under one roof, with nearly 300 partners in the expo, which is going to be amazing, we will have a number special guests this year including Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for Digital Agenda; Vivek Kundra, the former CIO of the U.S. Federal Government; Google Chairman, Eric Schmidt; Metallica and will.i.am. Also performing, Neil Young, Alanis Morrissette and Jay Leno in our UCSF Children's Hospital Fundraiser, which will be happening in the night of September 1. Tickets for that event are still available and you can get further information by contacting my office. 
Also, we'd love to see you at Dreamforce. Just register, go to www.dreamforce.com. And whether we see you at Dreamforce, at one of our keynotes, at Metallica or at our UCSF benefit on September 1, we look forward to seeing you all in San Francisco. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Graham for the final -- financial details of our second quarter."
122917,138944248,160721,"Salesforce.com, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2011",2011-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter. Our business results reflected both great execution and continued healthy business demand. Second quarter revenue of $546 million was 38% from the year ago quarter. The main drivers or the top lin",2100,"Thanks, Marc. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter. Our business results reflected both great execution and continued healthy business demand. Second quarter revenue of $546 million was 38% from the year ago quarter. The main drivers or the top line growth were: first, new business which Marc has already discussed. Not only did we add a record 6,300 net new customers in the quarter, but we also saw strong add-on and upgrade business in our customer base. In fact, more than 1/2 of new business sales in the quarter were Internet customer based. As you know, many of our most successful customers start small and grow over time. With over 100,000 accounts now and an expanding portfolio of products, our customer base represents a huge growth opportunity. 
Second, a continued reduction in our attrition rate. Dollar attrition fell for the eighth consecutive quarter and continues to be in the mid-teens percentage range when compared to the year-ago quarter. As we said in the past, minimizing attrition is an important foundation for growth, especially as our business scales over time.  
And lastly, a weaker dollar. Excluding a year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately $18 million, constant-currency revenue growth was 34%. We didn't see any changes in pricing based on our rolling 8 quarter trends for both regions and additions. 
On a regional basis, revenue in the Americas grew 34% from a year ago to $367 million. European revenue of $102 million rose 56% year-over-year in dollars and 36% in constant currency. Within the region, the U.K. had a particularly strong year-over-year in new business quarter. And finally, Asia revenue of roughly $77 million increased 42% in dollars and 33% in constant currency versus Q2 a year ago. While second quarter new business in Japan was down slightly versus a year ago, the demand environment improved significantly from Q1. So we're incrementally more optimistic for Japan in the second half of the year. 
Our revenue mix was 93% subscription and support and 7% professional services. On a year-over-year basis, the 1-point increase in the consulting proportion was primarily the result of implementing the EITF 08-01 accounting standard that we discussed at the start of the year. Our vision of the social enterprise that Marc described earlier will likely require that we build a small team of architecture and user interface specialists to spearhead some of implementation teams. 
We've kept our bill of consulting headcount while it's flat for the last 2 years, so the combination of building this team, together with a more-favorable accounting treatment for consulting revenue, will likely result in this small mix shift back to professional services for the remainder of fiscal 2012. 
Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Non-GAAP gross margin remained unchanged from Q1, and the year-ago quarter approximately 82%. While non-GAAP gross margin for our subscription and support business was flat sequentially at 86%, it was down a bit from last year, primarily as a result of some of our acquired businesses like Heroku and Radian6, as well as the buildout of our Japan data center, which we expect to become operational by the end of fiscal '12. 
Similar to the first quarter, year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin for our Professional Services business went from a negative to a positive in Q2, improving to 18%. This margin improvement in the first half is the result of 2 factors: First, at the beginning of fiscal 2012, we reduced some of the headcount in non-billing roles in Professional Services; and second, accounting standard EITF 08-01 has had the effect of bringing forward certain project-related revenues that were previously deferred. 
Now onto expenses. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were roughly 71% of revenue for Q2. That's unchanged from Q1, but up 5 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of our accelerated M&A activity over the past year, as well as our continued aggressive hiring. 
During the quarter, we added more than 800 people. That includes more than 300 from the acquisition of Radian6. Our total employee population is now more than 6,300, that's an increase of more than 1,900 or about 40% from a year ago. As in the past, our hiring focus continues to be in the area of sales and engineering capacity, and acquisitions are obviously also fueling our employee growth. At this point, we expect aggressive hiring to continue through the second half of fiscal 2012. 
R&D was our fastest growing expense category in Q2, up 60% year-over-year to 11% of revenue. In the importance of product innovation, we'll continue to invest in hiring and retaining the best software engineers in the world. 
Sales and marketing expenses were up 50% year-over-year at 46% of revenue. In addition to hiring, our sales and marketing expense reflects a very active event campaign through the second quarter, including Cloudforce events in Washington, New York, Boston and Minneapolis. As you know, we view these events as important not just for near-term revenue growth through pipeline generation, but also the building awareness of Salesforce.com. 
Q2 sales and marketing expenses also included the approximately $0.04 per share costs of the one-time charge related to the settlement for a California state wage in our lawsuit which was disclosed mid-quarter in an 8-K filing. 
Finally, G&A costs rose by 33% from a year ago and was 13% of revenue. While G&A costs can be somewhat lumpy as we scale for growth and integrate acquisitions, we remain fully committed to our long-term goal of reducing G&A as a percentage of revenue. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin was flat from Q1 at 11% but down roughly 5 points from last year. The biggest driver, of course, is the fact that we've acquired 9 companies over the past 15 months, all of which were either technology purchases such as Dimdim the Heroku, or fast-growing businesses such as Jigsaw and Radian6, which have yet to achieve in our break even. While we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles in our non-GAAP results, it's important to remember the impact these acquired companies are having on our fiscal 2012 GAAP operating results. 
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 was roughly 26%. This was a bit lower than our guided rate of 30%, primarily due to a larger-than-expected tax benefit relating to the acquisition of Radian6 and as well to -- as to the bigger-than-anticipated federal R&D tax credits benefit. Because of the lower Q2 tax rate, we now estimate our full year fiscal 2012 tax rate to be approximately 32%, that's a point better than our last estimate. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2013, we do expect our tax rate to increase, probably to a level somewhere between fiscal 2010 and 2011 levels due to the scheduled expiration of the federal R&D tax credits, and also because the Radian6 acquisition will cause a slight drag on our tax rate next year versus actually being a benefit this year. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.30 for the quarter, at the high end of our guidance range entering the quarter. While we did benefit by roughly $0.02 from the lower tax rate I just mentioned, we were also able to absorb the approximately $0.04 charge from the legal settlement that I discussed earlier. Strong execution and above planned growth enabled us to overcome that net $0.02 deficit and deliver on our EPS guidance. 
Moving on to the cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased by 9% from a year ago to just under $83 million in Q2. However, it's important to note that we prepaid just over $13 million of Dreamforce expenses in Q2 compared with $0 in the comparable quarter last year. We still expect full year operating cash flow to grow by the mid to high teens percentage rate that I highlighted on our last call. We project Q3 operating cash flow growth well above the Q2 level. And without Dreamforce in the fourth quarter numbers, we should see a record cash flow quarter to end the year. 
CapEx finished the quarter at around $45 million. This was a little higher than we've seen recently, so let me take a moment just to drill into that detail. The biggest driver of capital spending continues to be employee growth, both in the form of leasehold improvements and computer equipment for employees. In fiscal '12, we expect about 1/2 of all CapEx to be employee-growth related. 
The second largest category is data centers, primarily the data center build out and core components, which includes cager[ph], power and network infrastructure. This category is by nature, a little lumpy and in Q2 was higher than normal because of the Japan data center build out. And just to remind everybody, we do lease most of the service and storage equipment that goes into the data centers. So those items are not included in CapEx. 
The third largest category is capitalized, internal software costs for our service delivery and for large IT projects. And finally, we also spent $6.5 million purchasing domain names [indiscernible] we don't expect to be regularizing. If the CapEx is up 83%, for the full year, we would expect it to increase by approximately 50% based on anticipated hiring and the completion of the Japan data center. We expect Q3 CapEx to be down from Q2. 
With that background, Q2 free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less reported CapEx, was approximately $38 million, that's down 22% compared to a year ago. However, given my operating cash flow commentary above, we are projecting free cash flow growth in Q3 and Q4. 
Cash and equivalents, including short and long-term marketable securities finished the quarter of just under $1.3 billion, this was down approximately $200 million from Q1, primarily, a result of our acquisition of Radian6 earlier in the quarter. Deferred revenue finished the quarter at $935 million, that's an increase of 37% from the year ago quarter. Our deferred revenue result included about $2 million of sequential FX headwind, and approximately $80 million of tailwind from the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for FX, year-over-year constant currency growth for deferred revenue was 34%. 
Receivables were once again well managed during the quarter. DSO of 58 days was up slightly over the prior year number of 53 days but well within the range we would expect for a business with an accelerating top line. Our receivables aging remains excellent. 
Obviously, our acquisition of Radian6 affected several balance sheet accounts, most notably goodwill, moved higher by $265 million. In addition, capitalized software increased by $70 million, almost all of which was the result of the acquired Radian6 technology. And Radian6 was also the primary driver of changes to prepaid income taxes and income taxes payable.  
And finally, we're executing well on Radian6 cash collections. The cash basis full year revenue recognition that I discussed when we announced the deal is expected to cause a small revenue spike in Q4. 2 quarters out, it's difficult to predict the Q4 to Q1 revenue transition with a lot of precision but it's possible that Radian6 revenue may actually decline slightly in Q1 as we complete the transition from cash to invoice-based revenue recognition. 
As we look to the remainder of the year, our strong first half performance and pipeline of business are encouraging. While we are mindful of the macro environment, and we'll be watching for any changes to our strong business trends, growth continues to be our top priority. 
With that backdrop, we are projecting third quarter revenue of approximately $568 million to $570 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.30 to $0.31 per share. For the full year, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.23 billion. This represents an increase of $65 million from the midpoint of prior guidance, a new midpoint and a prior full year revenue growth of approximately 34%. We plan to invest this revenue upside back into the business, particularly in distribution capacity. In that context, we are leaving our full year non-GAAP EPS estimate unchanged at $1.30 to $1.32. 
Before I close, I'd like to personally invite all of you to Dreamforce 2011. As Marc indicated, we're expecting our biggest and most amazing Dreamforce ever. In addition to the customer or partner events that you should plan to attend on the first 2 days, David and I will be hosting an analyst summit on the Wednesday from 2:00 until 3:30, and we really look forward to seeing you all there.

It would have been a blowout quarter except for that fourth 8-digit transaction that I mentioned, came in the week after the quarter which is setup. This quarter was a strong start. And our -- I was out in the market very aggressively during the quarter, and as I mentioned, in Japan, in DC, Boston, Minneapolis, and I just want to tell you that when I show up in Minneapolis, I expect a crowd of 200 to 300 people, not 1,000. And in each of these environments, I'm seeing 2x to 3x what I would normally expect in terms of physical turnout. And when we look at kind of already the registrations that are done for Dreamforce, and the ones that are easiest for us to spot are the paid registrations, our numbers are up, I think, 30% to 40% year-over-year. So we don't see a soft rate environment, we see for our business, a very strong and accelerating environment, and that's why we're raising guidance. If the environment would change, we would, of course, we would let you know. And we think we're really well positioned for the future. We certainly are -- we certainly saw also in the quarter with a number of very large transactions that were happening just a robust acceleration of our existing customers of going deeper with us. And I think that, that's going to be very, very powerful. I also want to say, attrition was really low during the quarter, which was amazing, we saw attrition drop. And so attrition is really, really down from where we saw it peak out in 2009. And that's, of course, a help in the quarter as well."

Our hiring plans are very aggressive this year. We are onboarding another 30% increase in distribution capacity this year. You'll remember that last year, we onboarded approximately 40% distribution capacity increase. And I think that you're seeing that payout when you see 38% year-over-year growth and 37% growth in deferred, we spied a lot of that coming from this distribution capacity that we added last year, that's still coming online. So our gut reaction is adding more distribution capacity because the more distribution capacity we add, the more sales and more market share we get. And we're still very small in our distribution organization in terms of size compared to a Microsoft, Oracle or SAP, which are really our targets, and so we want to grow aggressively. And I think that if there's anything you're going to see us do, we are going to invest, we are going to grow and we are going to hire, because we want to take advantage of this opportunity. And if you look back at things different times of turbulence in the last 10 years that I've been CEO of Salesforce, the biggest mistake I ever made in any one particular time was when I did not hire aggressively. Hiring has always paid out for this company. And the market is so enormous and so exciting on a global basis. And right now, the products in such a mature and exciting point in being able to handle very large companies or very small companies, we want to be able to satisfy that demand through our distribution organization.  And I believe we're still a distribution constrained organization. So we're hiring, and if you heard of a hiring freeze, that may be one of our competitors but that's not at Salesforce.com."

But really, Radian6 is the first company that we've bought where we really feel like it's transforming the company. And that's really what Radian6 has done. I mean, when we bought Radian6, we talked about, ""Well, it's the beginning of the marketing cloud, which it certainly is, and it's about social listening which is certainly is."" But what Radian6 did was it opened our eyes to the opportunities in the social enterprise. And if you go to YouTube and you type Gatorade social media monitoring or you type Dell social media command center or others, you're going to find these social media command centers that Radian6 is building all over the world to help companies monitor and manage what's going on in the social enterprise. And that really woke us up to what are all the other things that we should be doing in regards to social monitor and social enterprise. And we were already in employee, in social, what we call kind of employee social networks. That was our -- that was Chatter, right? And then we're like, ""Well, we're thinking about moving into customer social networks."" And you're going to see some exciting technology at Dreamforce around new types of customer social networks, and we're excited about that, new products coming. And then we saw the product social networks with the Toyota examples, and other examples. But it is where the Radian6 that we have been inspired to do all of this. And when we're out there demoing this -- their technology, it really shows how all of this can work together, and we have not yet even done the total deep technical integration because we haven't had the property that long. So we're growing them, we're expanding their sales organization, we're hiring in Halifax if you're interested, Jason, we got some great opportunities up there in Fredericton, Nova Scotia, it's beautiful this time of year.

I think that, that was certainly a great way to get going with the product, but wow, we have seen companies, so many companies build so many apps on Force.com that I think we're ready to start talking about per app pricing, not just per user pricing. And that's an evolution. I think another major evolution is enterprise license agreements. We've seen salesforce deliver enterprise license agreements, but it just has not been a big focus for us as we've moved to the social enterprise, our customers are saying, ""What about social enterprise license agreements?"" And when we look at these SELAs, we're like, ""Wow, how do we deliver to this customer a full social enterprise license?"" I was in plenty of customers this quarter where they're like, ""Well, I don't know about this per user pricing over here, and I don't know about the Force.com pricing over there. And what about Radian6 over here? And what about the Jigsaw pricing over there, and blah, blah, blah?"" And we're like, ""We've got to take this off the table and give these customers the ability to step way out with SELAs."" And I think that's another huge opportunity that we just have not played out yet. So though you're touching in and you're stepping in, I think, one of the really great areas for us to optimize which is pricing, which we just have not touched in a long time and we can offer customers much better deals."

Like we've done at facebook.com/disneyland, and then let's move into the partner social networks and the product social networks and the listening through Radian6, it's a big indicator to customers that they need to move the Force.com and to Heroku to maximize their investments of salesforce and thousands and thousands have, and it's really because those old software companies have not stepped up with new tools and new solutions. They have -- they look a little bit long on the tooth. There, it's a little bit too much if your grandfather's enterprise software, and it's not enough about cloud, mobile and social.

And that's really why we've always talked about Chatter as an entry point to us, and in many cases, a Trojan horse for us, and in many ways, it's really establishing our position wall-to-wall for the first time inside of a customer.

And that's been 100% our expectation all along. There is no sexier demo and no more exciting place to enter a company than with Chatter. If you've been watching every Monday in the Wall Street Journal, we have a different customer being featured, and we've had CEO after CEO after CEO in those ads, and there's a line of them still coming. We did not have a product that CEOs were using before.

We're probably very unique as a software company, number one, in that we have such a huge stratification of enterprises that we work with in size from the very smallest to the very large. So if it's all about SMB, maybe it's shifts up to the enterprise. If it's all about the enterprise, maybe it shifts down to the SMB. And then, we are again, diversified our portfolio across the 8 main countries that we do business in. And then, we have a number of industries that we have strengthened but no one industry and no one market and no one geography, except for maybe the United States, really is, are we that dependent on, I would say. And public sector is not something that we have really ever been able to turn in -- we've never focused on it honestly. It's probably a mistake that I've made. I probably should be focusing more in the last 13 years on public sector. I just haven't really gotten around to it because we've had so many other exciting opportunities. Some of our competitors have been able to move into the public sector because we haven't. And that hasn't been a big focus. They've come more to us. You saw that transaction with the GSA this quarter. We see more opportunity in the federal government obviously in the future. We've had great success in Japan. And obviously, Japan has not been the best environment in the last couple of quarters because of the disaster. It's happened there but we continue to have a robust business there. So I have really focused on building this company to be having a very diverse portfolio of business and I think that is why, when you look at the last recession in 2008 and 2009, and I don't think we are going into another recession, by the way. I'm not an economist, but that's my off-hand comment. I think that we can see that this company came out of it roaring, and the reason why is, because we maintain our customers and we mitigate their risk, and they want to double down with us because they don't want to buy more software and hardware. There's nothing riskier in the technology industry than loading up with another Exadata mainframe or another huge piece of enterprise software where you're not going to see a return for 2 to 3 years. The way to get value and the way to get innovation in your company, and the way to get your company rightsized and growing, is get them on the cloud and get them on the public cloud, not this kind of false cloud called which is the virtualization train. So I say, here's another great opportunity. Every time I see these somewhat volatile markets, where companies are working to mitigate their risks, I'm like, ""Here we go.

But it seems to resonate with certain companies whereas other companies don't yet have an executive level mandate to pursue this kind of social strategy. And so I'm wondering what inning do you think we're in? And overall, is it reminiscent of how customers responded to idea of the Sales Cloud, say 6 or 7 years ago before it was really mainstream?"

Well, I think that where we are is certainly in the first inning. And when you look at it, we've been talking a lot for the last couple of years now about something called Cloud 2, which is, we kind of moved from the first generation of cloud, which is where we started, which was people still have their notebooks and their laptops, which they have less and less every day of. And they have this more stable browser environment, they had HTML and we were able to deliver them enterprise-class services right into the browser, customized exactly for them. That was really Cloud 1. Cloud 2 was when we saw this huge shifts from -- into social networks, with Facebook, with Twitter, Google+, with the mobile environment, with the iPhone and the iPad and the Android accelerations. And then the continued amplification of the cloud itself being more robust, more scalable, more secure than ever before. And then customers would say, ""Well, what is Cloud 3?"" And when we saw Cloud 3, we're like, ""We're not sure when we're going to have Cloud 3. What is Cloud 3?"" And then all of a sudden, something amazing happened to me personally last December, which was the CEO of Toyota came over to my house and he said, ""What am I supposed to do with my company?"" And I kind of was, ""Well, I'm not exactly sure."" I looked down and I grabbed my hat and I pulled a rabbit out of it, and I said, ""You need a friend and your friend should be your car in the way of a Toyota Corolla and a Toyota Tacoma. You should have -- And you have a Prius, you should have a Toyota friend."" And the Toyota Friend should be a car on the social network that is talking to you, and then as we start to build it out for him, I started to lay out all the things that he should do for Toyota, build the Toyota Friend, put in Chatter and build an employee social network, get your sales force aligned, build in -- custom build his customer service, get his dealers onboard, get it rebuilt with these kind of legacy factory applications, and build this integrated environment. And then at the end of it, I'm like, ""Wow, what is this?"" And after we looked at it and we're obviously positioned it to him and he's become a huge fan of this and others, we're like, ""Well, are we building a customer cloud? Is that what it is?"" And we're like ""Well, that's not exactly it."" And then we're like, ""This is really the social enterprise. This is the next step in business."" And as we've defined that and been able to articulate it, it's very large crowds, customers are really absorbed it and looked at it as the way where they can really understand and accept our product strategy, and how they can action it. And that actionable aspect of it is very powerful for the company, and now, we've done is we've taken our management team and we've pushed them back out to our top 1,000 customers and said, ""Go out and define. Here's the Toyota example."" And there's other examples I won't tell you which ones they are. We've talked about some of them previously in the last call, Groupon was another one came out of this exercise. And now for our top 1,000 customers, we're defining for them at the sea level, what the social enterprise is. Every executive, Graham has one, I have, every executive has multiple customers, and we're all out there positioning what is the social enterprise, and we have really found a way to help companies go to the next level. They've worked a lot on their back offices. Their ledgers, their payables, their receivables, they've got their Oracle, their SAP, all these horrible stuff in there, but on their front office, they just have not really evolved it in a long time, and it's not just about SFA or call center, it's about rethinking their customer experience. And that is the company we want to be. We want to be a company that defines what you do with your customers, and the way you're going to interact with your customers and be more successful than ever before, is by becoming a social enterprise. And that's what Salesforce.com has articulated and that's what you will see further articulated at Dreamforce. And it's a solution sell, it's not a product sell, it's an advisory role and customers are really loving it and looking at us as in a whole new way, and that's why I think you're going to see the deals get bigger. Alright operator, we can take a couple of more questions, and we'll wrap things up."

And as we buy these companies really for the first time in the last 12 months that we bought 3 big companies with Jigsaw, Heroku and Radian6, it's really impacted that GAAP number. And as CEO, my job and how I look at it at this point in this company's history is not to focus on that GAAP profit number. I think I've said that a number of times, that we are really focused on that top line and the market share opportunity. And if we were focused on the GAAP number, we would not be buying anybody, number one.  And we would be probably running a much leaner machine, and we would not be as excited as on market share gains. And so what I really instructed the company to do is to blow it out on the top line, and that's why there are too many enterprise software companies at the $2 billion-plus level, delivering a 38% top line growth this quarter. And you can forecast that out through the next year as well. And the cost of that comes in the GAAP line, of course, and the GAAP profit line. I'm sure there will be a day in the future where we'll say, ""Well, we're not going to buy any more companies. We're already satisfied where we are. And now, we're going to maximize GAAP profit."" And we've shown how we can do that by slowing hiring or whatever. That's not where this company is. This is a growth company, and this is a growth story, this is about the next-generation and you aren't going to build a great company if you focus only on GAAP profit. And that's why the non-GAAP number is very important but the ultimate number and the most important number is the top line. And Graham, do you want to add to that?"

Here today to discuss our strong quarterly performance, are Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; as well as Graham Smith, our CFO. 
Following Marc and Graham's prepared remarks today, we'll open things up to your questions. We now have 43 analysts covering the company and because we want to get as many of you as possible, we will be limiting each of you to one question today. A complete disclosure of our second quarter results can be found in a press release issued about an hour ago, as well as in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Additional financial information, including detailed historical financial statements and facts is available on our website. Our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for both our reported results and our forward guidance can be found in our earnings press release. 
At times in our prepared comments or in responses to your questions, we may offer incremental metrics to provide a greater understanding of our business or our quarterly results. Please be advised these additional details may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not update them in the future. 
In addition, I remind you that this quarter is the last quarter in which the customer count metric will be provided as a regular part of our quarterly report. In the future, we expect to offer this metric periodically on a milestone basis. We're making this change because several of our recent acquisitions have had large number of users were linking those users to specific customer organizations can be extremely challenging and in some cases, impossible. As a result, we believe our traditional customer metric will be less meaningful over time. 
With that, let me make this call official with a brief Safe Harbor. The primary purpose of today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fiscal second quarter performance. Some of our discussions or responses to questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. All of these risks and uncertainties and assumptions, as well as other information on potential factors that could affect our financial results are included in our reports filed with the SEC, including our recent report on Form 10-Q, particularly under the heading Risk Factors. 
To access our Q2 release, including the GAAP to non-GAAP recons, our historical results, any of our SEC disclosures, a webcast replay today's call, or simply to learn more about salesforce, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations website at salesforce.com/investors.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Marc, please be advised that we may reference certain unreleased services or features that is not yet available on today's discussion. We can't guarantee the future timing or availability of these services or features. As such, customers who purchase our services should make their purchase decisions based on services and features that are currently available. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Marc to discuss our excellent second quarter. Marc?"

I'm absolutely delighted to discuss these strong second quarter results, just 2 quarters now into our fiscal year and we will soon exceed a $2.2 billion annual revenue run rate, validating both our growth strategy and our ability to execute",2180,"Thanks, David. I'm absolutely delighted to discuss these strong second quarter results, just 2 quarters now into our fiscal year and we will soon exceed a $2.2 billion annual revenue run rate, validating both our growth strategy and our ability to execute on the incredible opportunity.  I'll begin by reviewing some of these financial highlights. Number one, revenue of $546 million rose by 38%, and we haven't seen revenue grow that fast in almost 3 years, and that was one we are less than 1/2 our current size. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 was at the high-end of our guided range, and we delivered that result even as our headcount has grown by more than 800 during the quarter. Deferred revenue increased by 37% to finish the quarter at $935 million, and operating cash flow rose by 9% to $83 million in the quarter, and we exit the quarter of nearly $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheets. 
Our financial success was powered by another quarter of tremendous customer success. And during the quarter, we added roughly 6,300 net new customers, that's a company record, smashing past 100,000 customer milestone. And let me just say that, while we ended the quarter with 104,000 customers using our core Salesforce services, that number does not include the thousands more who are using Heroku and Radian6, which are 2 of our most recent acquisitions. 
We also saw continued strength in big deals during the second quarter and all we signed more than 60, we signed more than sixty 7-figure transactions a 40% increase compared with last year, and we signed three, three 8-figure megadeals. In addition, I'm thrilled to tell you, we closed an additional 8-figure megadeal just after the quarter ended with a large telecommunications company that we will be announcing at Dreamforce. 
Given this strong financial and customer momentum, we're again, raising our full year fiscal year '12 revenue guidance, which we now project at $2.22 billion to $2.23 billion. 
Over the quarter, I had the opportunity to travel around the world, discussing the power of cloud computing with customers, prospects, partners. And I started the quarter with an exciting trip to Japan where I announced our Toyota Friend vision with Toyota CEO Toyoda-san in Tokyo. The idea of Toyota Friend is simple. If I have friends on Facebook, why is my car not one of those friends? With Toyota Friend, Toyota is building a product social network, where its employees, customers, dealers and its products, the cars themselves are all collaborating to a private and secure enterprise social network. 
The car is talking to me, telling me when it needs to be charged, where the service station is or important updates from dealers or the factory. It's a vision of a social enterprise that has awakened us to the opportunity of showing our customers a new way of delighting their customers. I then traveled to Washington, D.C. to present at a sold-out Cloudforce of over 1,400 registered attendees, where I announced that Salesforce.com has received a U.S. General Services Administration Moderate Level of Authority to Operate. We had exciting presentations in D.C. from a variety of salesforce customers, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, the GSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Now I'm able to announce that one of the 8-digit deals in the quarter was with the GSA, which has signed an enterprise license agreement for 12,000 users. When we went on to Boston, again, we were greeted by sold-out crowd of over 1,700 attendees. There, we further articulated the power of cloud computing and showed the power of cloud, combined with social and mobile, fundamentally changes our companies, their employees partners and customers' collaborated, share and manage information. This time, it was Enterasys Networks who showed not only an employee social network and a customer social network, but also a product social network based on their new chatter-enabled switch. This vision of a next-generation social enterprise inspired us further that customers looking for exciting new ways to transform their business using the cloud. 
And finally, we went to Minneapolis, not exactly a city known for a large crowds showing up for technology events, but we are greeted by a record 1,000 registered attendees. And we refined our social enterprise messaging based on our experiences in Tokyo and DC and Boston, and we showed the amazing social experience in the next generation of apps for Disney's theme parks, built on our Heroku platform. The Disney apps are tightly integrated with Facebook and can be seen at www.facebook.com/disneyland. Take a look and try out those amazing Heroku apps. They showed attendees how one of the world's most important brands has refined interactivity with its customers and develop a customer social network.  
And by the time we get to Dreamforce just a few days from today, where we expect over 40,000 people to register to attend, we will be showing a further assigned story of this nextgen of computing. We'll demonstrate how companies, their employees, their customers, their products use the cloud social mobile technologies to create the social enterprise. 
We have seen the power of this transformation at small, medium and large customers around the world, and we believe we are witnessing a transformation of our industry based on this social revolution. A revolution that has shown our customers how to delight their customers in a whole new way. This revolution is only possible through the power of the cloud. With the cloud, we're able to deliver what every company is asking for, a solution that is fast to get going, easy to use and open to all the major industry standards. And the social resolution is also changing the relationship we have with our customers. We're now engaging at a higher, more-strategic level than ever before. 
That's certainly evidenced by the number of large transactions that we closed during the quarter, and customers are buying a broad selection of our services as you can see by the growth across all of our clouds. Sale Cloud, ""hey, I'd like to start with our flagship Sales Cloud where our social enterprise message gives us a solution that is highly differentiated, enabling customers to sell with greater collaboration, mobility, productivity than ever before."" A great example is Chartis Property and Casualty, which selected Salesforce for 10,000 seats of the Sales Cloud and 40,000 chatter seats. Chartis's vision for the social enterprise is an employee social network that fuels a new level of collaboration between their sales people and other in global employees across 117 countries. The Chartis Social Enterprise will allow sales teams to engage customers in a whole new way and proactively reach out to customers before policies expire. 
Other new or add-on deals for the Sales Cloud this quarter included Continental Casualty and ING, and LivingSocial Penske and REECO. And as I mentioned, the social enterprise message makes the Sales Cloud highly differentiated, allowing us to crush the competition. Against Microsoft, we won new or add-on business of companies like Cisco, Dex One, First National Bank of Omaha, George P. Johnson, Mutual Générale in France, Transamerica Life and VHA.  
And against Oracle, we won deals including the Bank of New Zealand, Continental Casualty, JBWere, Integra Telecom and K-12. Against SAP, we won deals with Ashland, Dolby, Fujitsu and P&H Mining. As exciting as our Sales Cloud momentum is making it the #1 sales application in the world, perhaps nowhere is the social enterprise messaging as critical as customer service. 
Companies realize they need to meet customers where they are today on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. That's why we saw a continued strong growth in The Service Cloud as customers look for a new generation of technology designed from the ground up for a cloud, social and mobile world. An amazing example of this is our largest Service Cloud transaction in the quarter, Tyco ADT, the leading home security company. ADT will be taking the social enterprise directly to the customer by arming its 4,000 field reps with iPads. These iPads will be loaded with mobile apps that allow ADT to deliver as much more powerful service than ever before. And to think that at the beginning of last year, iPad didn't even exist. The pace at which these companies are embracing social enterprise is amazing. 
Other new or significant add-on deals in The Service Cloud include GE Energy, Honeywell and Toto.  And today, I'm thrilled to tell you that more than 100,000 companies are now actively using Chatter, making it our most successful product introduction ever. We believe Chatter is the largest, most actively used social network in the world. These aren't 100,000 trials, these are 100,000 active social networks. 
Chatter lies at the heart of the social enterprise, giving companies a new level of collaboration, transparency and speed. And in addition to elevating our conversation with customers into the C-suite, Chatter's also taking our deployments enterprise-wide. New enterprise-wide deployments this quarter include Chartis Property & Casualty, which I mentioned is deploying Chatter to more than 40,000 users; ADP, which is deploying Chatter to 42,000 users; MCA which extended Chatter to 14,000 users. They join a growing list of enterprises taking Chatter wall-to-wall, including Dell and SunGard. 
Of course, the social enterprise needs a social enterprise platform. We've built Force.com and Heroku from the ground up to be social mobile and open, and that strategy has propelled us to an incredible level of momentum. The market for cloud platforms is growing faster than ever, and we're thrilled that the salesforce platform was selected by Forrester as the leading cloud platform for developers, companies and ISPs. In this quarter, Force.com was our fastest growing business, outpacing even The Service Cloud, which continues to exceed overall company growth. 
This quarter, one of the world's great luxury brands, Burberry, selected Force.com to create a social enterprise for it's employees, partners, suppliers and customers. You'll meet Burberry at Dreamforce and you'll find out how they plan to create an employee social network tailored to Burberry's exact theme brand standards that will allow it's associates, creative teams, partners and vendors to collaborate like never before. And Burberry will also be delivering next generation social apps that let customers experience the Burberry brand and culture anywhere on any device. It's an amazing vision, it's only possible to social enterprise platform. 
Other new or add-on Force.com customers this quarter included the GSA, F. Hoffman-LaRoche and Information Service International, Dentsu. This quarter, we are seeing great traction with developers and partners building their own social enterprise apps. Force.com boasts now more than 400,000 developers and 240,000 custom apps. And Heroku has dramatically expanded its developer community, now supporting over 170,000 social and mobile apps written in Ruby on Rails. That's more than 3x last year's number, and if you can expect some exciting announcements about Heroku at Dreamforce. 
Of course, products are only great if people use them, and that's why adoption is such an important indicator of customer success. During the second quarter, the Force.com platform delivered a record of 36 billion transactions. That's more than 500 million transactions from Force.com every business day. 
Look if companies realize that cloud, social and mobile are the future, Forrester predicts that the public cloud will grow from 25 billion this year to nearly 160 billion in 2020, and we expect our strategy of transforming companies in the social enterprise will help us take even bigger share of that market than we already have. We see tremendous growth opportunities ahead, and you're going to see us invest in growth through hiring, through product development, through events and more.  
And finally, I want to remind you that we're only 8 business days away from the world's largest cloud computing event and soon, the industry's largest enterprise software conference, Dreamforce, which runs August 30 to September 2 right here in San Francisco. Dreamforce is the place to hear how customers use the cloud, social, mobile technologies to create a next generation of social enterprise. 
In addition to hosting the biggest selection of cloud products under one roof, with nearly 300 partners in the expo, which is going to be amazing, we will have a number special guests this year including Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for Digital Agenda; Vivek Kundra, the former CIO of the U.S. Federal Government; Google Chairman, Eric Schmidt; Metallica and will.i.am. Also performing, Neil Young, Alanis Morrissette and Jay Leno in our UCSF Children's Hospital Fundraiser, which will be happening in the night of September 1. Tickets for that event are still available and you can get further information by contacting my office. 
Also, we'd love to see you at Dreamforce. Just register, go to www.dreamforce.com. And whether we see you at Dreamforce, at one of our keynotes, at Metallica or at our UCSF benefit on September 1, we look forward to seeing you all in San Francisco. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Graham for the final -- financial details of our second quarter."
122917,138944248,160737,"Salesforce.com, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2011",2011-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter. Our business results reflected both great execution and continued healthy business demand. Second quarter revenue of $546 million was 38% from the year ago quarter. The main drivers or the top lin",2101,"Thanks, Marc. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter. Our business results reflected both great execution and continued healthy business demand. Second quarter revenue of $546 million was 38% from the year ago quarter. The main drivers or the top line growth were: first, new business which Marc has already discussed. Not only did we add a record 6,300 net new customers in the quarter, but we also saw strong add-on and upgrade business in our customer base. In fact, more than 1/2 of new business sales in the quarter were Internet customer based. As you know, many of our most successful customers start small and grow over time. With over 100,000 accounts now and an expanding portfolio of products, our customer base represents a huge growth opportunity. 
Second, a continued reduction in our attrition rate. Dollar attrition fell for the eighth consecutive quarter and continues to be in the mid-teens percentage range when compared to the year-ago quarter. As we said in the past, minimizing attrition is an important foundation for growth, especially as our business scales over time.  
And lastly, a weaker dollar. Excluding a year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately $18 million, constant-currency revenue growth was 34%. We didn't see any changes in pricing based on our rolling 8 quarter trends for both regions and additions. 
On a regional basis, revenue in the Americas grew 34% from a year ago to $367 million. European revenue of $102 million rose 56% year-over-year in dollars and 36% in constant currency. Within the region, the U.K. had a particularly strong year-over-year in new business quarter. And finally, Asia revenue of roughly $77 million increased 42% in dollars and 33% in constant currency versus Q2 a year ago. While second quarter new business in Japan was down slightly versus a year ago, the demand environment improved significantly from Q1. So we're incrementally more optimistic for Japan in the second half of the year. 
Our revenue mix was 93% subscription and support and 7% professional services. On a year-over-year basis, the 1-point increase in the consulting proportion was primarily the result of implementing the EITF 08-01 accounting standard that we discussed at the start of the year. Our vision of the social enterprise that Marc described earlier will likely require that we build a small team of architecture and user interface specialists to spearhead some of implementation teams. 
We've kept our bill of consulting headcount while it's flat for the last 2 years, so the combination of building this team, together with a more-favorable accounting treatment for consulting revenue, will likely result in this small mix shift back to professional services for the remainder of fiscal 2012. 
Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Non-GAAP gross margin remained unchanged from Q1, and the year-ago quarter approximately 82%. While non-GAAP gross margin for our subscription and support business was flat sequentially at 86%, it was down a bit from last year, primarily as a result of some of our acquired businesses like Heroku and Radian6, as well as the buildout of our Japan data center, which we expect to become operational by the end of fiscal '12. 
Similar to the first quarter, year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin for our Professional Services business went from a negative to a positive in Q2, improving to 18%. This margin improvement in the first half is the result of 2 factors: First, at the beginning of fiscal 2012, we reduced some of the headcount in non-billing roles in Professional Services; and second, accounting standard EITF 08-01 has had the effect of bringing forward certain project-related revenues that were previously deferred. 
Now on to expenses. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were roughly 71% of revenue for Q2. That's unchanged from Q1, but up 5 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of our accelerated M&A activity over the past year, as well as our continued aggressive hiring. 
During the quarter, we added more than 800 people. That includes more than 300 from the acquisition of Radian6. Our total employee population is now more than 6,300, that's an increase of more than 1,900 or about 40% from a year ago. As in the past, our hiring focus continues to be in the area of sales and engineering capacity, and acquisitions are obviously also fueling our employee growth. At this point, we expect aggressive hiring to continue through the second half of fiscal 2012. 
R&D was our fastest growing expense category in Q2, up 60% year-over-year to 11% of revenue. In the importance of product innovation, we'll continue to invest in hiring and retaining the best software engineers in the world. 
Sales and marketing expenses were up 50% year-over-year at 46% of revenue. In addition to hiring, our sales and marketing expense reflects a very active event campaign through the second quarter, including Cloudforce events in Washington, New York, Boston and Minneapolis. As you know, we view these events as important not just for near-term revenue growth through pipeline generation, but also the building awareness of Salesforce.com. 
Q2 sales and marketing expenses also included the approximately $0.04 per share costs of the one-time charge related to the settlement for a California state wage in our lawsuit, which was disclosed mid-quarter in an 8-K filing. 
Finally, G&A costs rose by 33% from a year ago and was 13% of revenue. While G&A costs can be somewhat lumpy as we scale for growth and integrate acquisitions, we remain fully committed to our long-term goal of reducing G&A as a percentage of revenue. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin was flat from Q1 at 11%, but down roughly 5 points from last year. The biggest driver, of course, is the fact that we've acquired 9 companies over the past 15 months, all of which were either technology purchases such as Dimdim the Heroku, or fast-growing businesses such as Jigsaw and Radian6, which have yet to achieve in our break even. While we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles in our non-GAAP results, it's important to remember the impact these acquired companies are having on our fiscal 2012 GAAP operating results. 
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 was roughly 26%. This was a bit lower than our guided rate of 30%, primarily due to a larger-than-expected tax benefit relating to the acquisition of Radian6 and as well to -- as to the bigger-than-anticipated federal R&D tax credits benefit. Because of the lower Q2 tax rate, we now estimate our full year fiscal 2012 tax rate to be approximately 32%, that's a point better than our last estimate. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2013, we do expect our tax rate to increase, probably to a level somewhere between fiscal 2010 and 2011 levels due to the scheduled expiration of the federal R&D tax credits, and also because the Radian6 acquisition will cause a slight drag on our tax rate next year versus actually being a benefit this year. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.30 for the quarter, at the high end of our guidance range entering the quarter. While we did benefit by roughly $0.02 from the lower tax rate I just mentioned, we were also able to absorb the approximately $0.04 charge from the legal settlement that I discussed earlier. Strong execution and above planned growth enabled us to overcome that net $0.02 deficit and deliver on our EPS guidance. 
Moving on to the cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased by 9% from a year ago to just under $83 million in Q2. However, it's important to note that we prepaid just over $13 million of Dreamforce expenses in Q2 compared with $0 in the comparable quarter last year. We still expect full year operating cash flow to grow by the mid to high teens percentage rate that I highlighted on our last call. We project Q3 operating cash flow growth well above the Q2 level. And without Dreamforce in the fourth quarter numbers, we should see a record cash flow quarter to end the year. 
CapEx finished the quarter at around $45 million. This was a little higher than we've seen recently, so let me take a moment just to drill into that detail. The biggest driver of capital spending continues to be employee growth, both in the form of leasehold improvements and computer equipment for employees. In fiscal '12, we expect about 1/2 of all CapEx to be employee-growth related. 
The second largest category is data centers, primarily the data center build out and core components, which includes CAGR, power and network infrastructure. This category is by nature, a little lumpy and in Q2 was higher than normal because of the Japan data center build out. And just to remind everybody, we do lease most of the service and storage equipment that goes into the data centers. So those items are not included in CapEx. 
The third largest category is capitalized, internal software costs for our service delivery and for large IT projects. And finally, we also spent $6.5 million purchasing domain names [indiscernible] we don't expect to be regularizing. If the CapEx is up 83%, for the full year, we would expect it to increase by approximately 50% based on anticipated hiring and the completion of the Japan data center. We expect Q3 CapEx to be down from Q2. 
With that background, Q2 free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less reported CapEx, was approximately $38 million, that's down 22% compared to a year ago. However, given my operating cash flow commentary above, we are projecting free cash flow growth in Q3 and Q4. 
Cash and equivalents, including short and long-term marketable securities finished the quarter of just under $1.3 billion, this was down approximately $200 million from Q1, primarily, a result of our acquisition of Radian6 earlier in the quarter. Deferred revenue finished the quarter at $935 million, that's an increase of 37% from the year ago quarter. Our deferred revenue result included about $2 million of sequential FX headwind, and approximately $80 million of tailwind from the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for FX, year-over-year constant currency growth for deferred revenue was 34%. 
Receivables were once again well managed during the quarter. DSO of 58 days was up slightly over the prior year number of 53 days but well within the range we would expect for a business with an accelerating top line. Our receivables aging remains excellent. 
Obviously, our acquisition of Radian6 affected several balance sheet accounts, most notably goodwill, moved higher by $265 million. In addition, capitalized software increased by $70 million, almost all of which was the result of the acquired Radian6 technology. And Radian6 was also the primary driver of changes to prepaid income taxes and income taxes payable.  
And finally, we're executing well on Radian6 cash collections. The cash basis full year revenue recognition that I discussed when we announced the deal is expected to cause a small revenue spike in Q4. 2 quarters out, it's difficult to predict the Q4 to Q1 revenue transition with a lot of precision but it's possible that Radian6 revenue may actually decline slightly in Q1 as we complete the transition from cash to invoice-based revenue recognition. 
As we look to the remainder of the year, our strong first half performance and pipeline of business are encouraging. While we are mindful of the macro environment, and we'll be watching for any changes to our strong business trends, growth continues to be our top priority. 
With that backdrop, we are projecting third quarter revenue of approximately $568 million to $570 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.30 to $0.31 per share. For the full year, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.23 billion. This represents an increase of $65 million from the midpoint of prior guidance, a new midpoint and a prior full year revenue growth of approximately 34%. We plan to invest this revenue upside back into the business, particularly in distribution capacity. In that context, we are leaving our full year non-GAAP EPS estimate unchanged at $1.30 to $1.32. 
Before I close, I'd like to personally invite all of you to Dreamforce 2011. As Marc indicated, we're expecting our biggest and most amazing Dreamforce ever. In addition to the customer or partner events that you should plan to attend on the first 2 days, David and I will be hosting an analyst summit on the Wednesday from 2:00 until 3:30, and we really look forward to seeing you all there.

Each month was very strong. We had a strong finish to the quarter. It would have been a blowout quarter except for that fourth 8-digit transaction that I mentioned, came in the week after the quarter which is setup. This quarter was a strong start. And our -- I was out in the market very aggressively during the quarter, and as I mentioned, in Japan, in DC, Boston, Minneapolis, and I just want to tell you that when I show up in Minneapolis, I expect a crowd of 200 to 300 people, not 1,000. And in each of these environments, I'm seeing 2x to 3x what I would normally expect in terms of physical turnout. And when we look at kind of already the registrations that are done for Dreamforce, and the ones that are easiest for us to spot are the paid registrations, our numbers are up, I think, 30% to 40% year-over-year. So we don't see a soft rate environment, we see for our business, a very strong and accelerating environment, and that's why we're raising guidance. If the environment would change, we would, of course, we would let you know. And we think we're really well positioned for the future. We certainly are -- we certainly saw also in the quarter with a number of very large transactions that were happening just a robust acceleration of our existing customers of going deeper with us. And I think that, that's going to be very, very powerful. I also want to say, attrition was really low during the quarter, which was amazing, we saw attrition drop. And so attrition is really, really down from where we saw it peak out in 2009. And that's, of course, a help in the quarter as well."

Our hiring plans are very aggressive this year. We are onboarding another 30% increase in distribution capacity this year. You'll remember that last year, we onboarded approximately 40% distribution capacity increase. And I think that you're seeing that payout when you see 38% year-over-year growth and 37% growth in deferred, we spied a lot of that coming from this distribution capacity that we added last year, that's still coming online. So our gut reaction is adding more distribution capacity because the more distribution capacity we add, the more sales and more market share we get. And we're still very small in our distribution organization in terms of size compared to a Microsoft, Oracle or SAP, which are really our targets, and so we want to grow aggressively. And I think that if there's anything you're going to see us do, we are going to invest, we are going to grow and we are going to hire, because we want to take advantage of this opportunity. And if you look back at things different times of turbulence in the last 10 years that I've been CEO of Salesforce, the biggest mistake I ever made in any one particular time was when I did not hire aggressively. Hiring has always paid out for this company. And the market is so enormous and so exciting on a global basis. And right now, the products in such a mature and exciting point in being able to handle very large companies or very small companies, we want to be able to satisfy that demand through our distribution organization.

But really, Radian6 is the first company that we've bought where we really feel like it's transforming the company. And that's really what Radian6 has done. I mean, when we bought Radian6, we talked about, ""Well, it's the beginning of the marketing cloud, which it certainly is, and it's about social listening which is certainly is."" But what Radian6 did was it opened our eyes to the opportunities in the social enterprise. And if you go to YouTube and you type Gatorade social media monitoring or you type Dell social media command center or others, you're going to find these social media command centers that Radian6 is building all over the world to help companies monitor and manage what's going on in the social enterprise. And that really woke us up to what are all the other things that we should be doing in regards to social monitor and social enterprise. And we were already in employee, in social, what we call kind of employee social networks. That was our -- that was Chatter, right?

I was in plenty of customers this quarter where they're like, ""Well, I don't know about this per user pricing over here, and I don't know about the Force.com pricing over there. And what about Radian6 over here? And what about the Jigsaw pricing over there, and blah, blah, blah?"" And we're like, ""We've got to take this off the table and give these customers the ability to step way out with SELAs."" And I think that's another huge opportunity that we just have not played out yet. So though you're touching in and you're stepping in, I think, one of the really great areas for us to optimize which is pricing, which we just have not touched in a long time and we can offer customers much better deals."

Are you buying more BA? Are you buying NetWeaver? These are last generation technologies. Lotus Notes, SharePoint, I mean, these are more -- this is more server, more servers and more software and not more solutions. And I think customers have seen with Force.com, they can basically build at 5x faster at 1/2 the cost. That's proven over and over again by every major independent analyst firm that's out there. And they can do it whether they want to do it clicks or code and now we're extended it with Heroku, giving them another tremendous option in terms of opening the platform of Ruby on Rails, and you're going to see the platform open up much further with exciting new languages, that we have been foreshadowing at Dreamforce. And we're high on Platform-as-a-Service. And at the heart of these social enterprise agreements, we talk about you've got to build your employee social network, which is getting your collaboration employees with Chatter and your sales people in place with our Sales Cloud and the service organization. And then we get right into, ""Okay, let's build some custom applications and automate and extend what you're doing and Force.com plays right into that."" Then we start to talk about like what Tom mentioned on the call here like with Disneyland, let's build some sites for public consumption. Like we've done at facebook.com/disneyland, and then let's move into the partner social networks and the product social networks and the listening through Radian6, it's a big indicator to customers that they need to move the Force.com and to Heroku to maximize their investments of salesforce and thousands and thousands have, and it's really because those old software companies have not stepped up with new tools and new solutions. They have -- they look a little bit long on the tooth. There, it's a little bit too much if your grandfather's enterprise software, and it's not enough about cloud, mobile and social. And that's I think, the opportunity for salesforce and when you get to Dreamforce, you're going to see that play out even further."

And that's really why we've always talked about Chatter as an entry point to us, and in many cases, a Trojan horse for us, and in many ways, it's really establishing our position wall-to-wall for the first time inside of a customer. And the Chatter price points have been, I would say, very exciting but not as exciting as a very rich price point of traditional CRM systems or data management systems, or even application development and deployment systems. And that's been 100% our expectation all along. There is no sexier demo and no more exciting place to enter a company than with Chatter. If you've been watching every Monday in the Wall Street Journal, we have a different customer being featured, and we've had CEO after CEO after CEO in those ads, and there's a line of them still coming. We did not have a product that CEOs were using before.

That's what Chatter is all about. But in terms of building a social enterprise, well, it's much more than just Chatter, it's about the Sales Cloud, The Service Cloud and Force.com, Heroku, Radian6 and all the other technology that we have. And when you put all of that together, that is exactly, as you said, the opportunity for the social enterprise license agreement, and those, with those large customers that are all over the country that we've been building up over time, more and more, we hear, we want a one price for the next 3 years, and the true-up opportunity, so that we can really double down on your technology. And we're really working on understanding how to do that, and I think by Dreamforce, we'll have the first introduction of that capability."

But it seems to me that some of the things that people are concerned about, you're actually better positioned than others. And I just wanted to know if you could share with us a little bit more. I know for EMEA exposure, you're somewhere around 20%, maybe a little less than that? Which, by the way, is an opportunity you started here, and you're a relatively young company, it makes sense that you have less exposure than the average software company. But what about public sector and financial services exposure? Can you tell us a little bit about how much of your revenue or bookings, or even generally, comes from those 2 verticals?"

We're probably very unique as a software company, number one, in that we have such a huge stratification of enterprises that we work with in size from the very smallest to the very large. So if it's all about SMB, maybe it's shifts up to the enterprise. If it's all about the enterprise, maybe it shifts down to the SMB. And then, we are again, diversified our portfolio across the 8 main countries that we do business in. And then, we have a number of industries that we have strengthened but no one industry and no one market and no one geography, except for maybe the United States, really is, are we that dependent on, I would say. And public sector is not something that we have really ever been able to turn in -- we've never focused on it honestly. It's probably a mistake that I've made. I probably should be focusing more in the last 13 years on public sector. I just haven't really gotten around to it because we've had so many other exciting opportunities. Some of our competitors have been able to move into the public sector because we haven't. And that hasn't been a big focus. They've come more to us. You saw that transaction with the GSA this quarter. We see more opportunity in the federal government obviously in the future. We've had great success in Japan. And obviously, Japan has not been the best environment in the last couple of quarters because of the disaster. It's happened there but we continue to have a robust business there. So I have really focused on building this company to be having a very diverse portfolio of business and I think that is why, when you look at the last recession in 2008 and 2009, and I don't think we are going into another recession, by the way. I'm not an economist, but that's my off-hand comment. I think that we can see that this company came out of it roaring, and the reason why is, because we maintain our customers and we mitigate their risk, and they want to double down with us because they don't want to buy more software and hardware. There's nothing riskier in the technology industry than loading up with another Exadata mainframe or another huge piece of enterprise software where you're not going to see a return for 2 to 3 years. The way to get value and the way to get innovation in your company, and the way to get your company rightsized and growing, is get them on the cloud and get them on the public cloud, not this kind of false cloud called which is the virtualization train. So I say, here's another great opportunity. Every time I see these somewhat volatile markets, where companies are working to mitigate their risks, I'm like, ""Here we go. Let's just ramp up sales because this is the opportunity to take advantage of customers' desire to innovate in an ever-changing environment, but to do it without burdening themselves, without all that traditional horrible technology."""

Well, I think that where we are is certainly in the first inning. And when you look at it, we've been talking a lot for the last couple of years now about something called Cloud 2, which is, we kind of moved from the first generation of cloud, which is where we started, which was people still have their notebooks and their laptops, which they have less and less every day of. And they have this more stable browser environment, they had HTML and we were able to deliver them enterprise-class services right into the browser, customized exactly for them. That was really Cloud 1. Cloud 2 was when we saw this huge shift from -- into social networks, with Facebook, with Twitter, Google+, with the mobile environment, with the iPhone and the iPad and the Android accelerations. And then the continued amplification of the cloud itself being more robust, more scalable, more secure than ever before. And then customers would say, ""Well, what is Cloud 3?"" And when we saw Cloud 3, we're like, ""We're not sure when we're going to have Cloud 3. What is Cloud 3?"" And then all of a sudden, something amazing happened to me personally last December, which was the CEO of Toyota came over to my house and he said, ""What am I supposed to do with my company?"" And I kind of was, ""Well, I'm not exactly sure."" I looked down and I grabbed my hat and I pulled a rabbit out of it, and I said, ""You need a friend and your friend should be your car in the way of a Toyota Corolla and a Toyota Tacoma. You should have -- And you have a Prius, you should have a Toyota friend."" And the Toyota Friend should be a car on the social network that is talking to you, and then as we start to build it out for him, I started to lay out all the things that he should do for Toyota, build the Toyota Friend, put in Chatter and build an employee social network, get your sales force aligned, build in -- custom build his customer service, get his dealers onboard, get it rebuilt with these kind of legacy factory applications, and build this integrated environment. And then at the end of it, I'm like, ""Wow, what is this?"" And after we looked at it and we're obviously positioned it to him and he's become a huge fan of this and others, we're like, ""Well, are we building a customer cloud? Is that what it is?"" And we're like ""Well, that's not exactly it."" And then we're like, ""This is really the social enterprise. This is the next step in business."" And as we've defined that and been able to articulate it, it's very large crowds, customers are really absorbed it and looked at it as the way where they can really understand and accept our product strategy, and how they can action it. And that actionable aspect of it is very powerful for the company, and now, we've done is we've taken our management team and we've pushed them back out to our top 1,000 customers and said, ""Go out and define. Here's the Toyota example."" And there's other examples I won't tell you which ones they are. We've talked about some of them previously in the last call, Groupon was another one came out of this exercise. And now for our top 1,000 customers, we're defining for them at the sea level, what the social enterprise is. Every executive, Graham has one, I have, every executive has multiple customers, and we're all out there positioning what is the social enterprise, and we have really found a way to help companies go to the next level. They've worked a lot on their back offices. Their ledgers, their payables, their receivables, they've got their Oracle, their SAP, all these horrible stuff in there, but on their front office, they just have not really evolved it in a long time, and it's not just about SFA or call center, it's about rethinking their customer experience. And that is the company we want to be. We want to be a company that defines what you do with your customers, and the way you're going to interact with your customers and be more successful than ever before, is by becoming a social enterprise. And that's what Salesforce.com has articulated and that's what you will see further articulated at Dreamforce. And it's a solution sell, it's not a product sell, it's an advisory role and customers are really loving it and looking at us as in a whole new way, and that's why I think you're going to see the deals get bigger.

I think I've said that a number of times, that we are really focused on that top line and the market share opportunity. And if we were focused on the GAAP number, we would not be buying anybody, number one.  And we would be probably running a much leaner machine, and we would not be as excited as on market share gains. And so what I really instructed the company to do is to blow it out on the top line, and that's why there are too many enterprise software companies at the $2 billion-plus level, delivering a 38% top line growth this quarter. And you can forecast that out through the next year as well. And the cost of that comes in the GAAP line, of course, and the GAAP profit line. I'm sure there will be a day in the future where we'll say, ""Well, we're not going to buy any more companies. We're already satisfied where we are. And now, we're going to maximize GAAP profit."" And we've shown how we can do that by slowing hiring or whatever. That's not where this company is.

I am absolutely delighted to share these amazing third quarter results, and I'll begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the quarter. 
First, revenue of $584 million rose by amazingly 36%. Our annual revenue run rate is now more than $2.3 billion, and it makes us the first enterprise cloud company to reach this milestone. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 was absolutely above our guided range, and we delivered that while hosting a world-class Dreamforce here in San Francisco but now, it is the largest enterprise software event in the world of more than 46,000 registered attendees. 
Deferred revenues increased by 32% and finished the quarter at $918 million, and third quarter operating cash flow rose by 74% year-over-year to $129 million in the quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents on our balance sheet. 
Now in fiscal year 2012, we became the first enterprise cloud company to surpass a $2 billion annual revenue run rate. And today, I'm delighted to announce that we expect to retake $3 billion annual revenue run rate during our next fiscal year. That is just spectacular growth. Our financial success in the third quarter was powered by a tremendous response from customers to our new social enterprise strategy. We're now engaged with customers at a higher more strategic level than ever before, and we've seen more large deals this quarter as a result of that strategy than we have seen in other quarters this year. 
At Dreamforce, we show how some of the world's best companies such as Burberry, Toyota, Verizon are all transforming into social enterprises. In fact, I'm delighted to share with you, one of our largest transaction in the quarter was Verizon and signed up for 80,000 subscribers of chatter, 7,000 subscribers to the sales cloud and Data.com. Now Verizon's vision for the social enterprise is to build an employee social network connecting retail stores and office-based employees, fueling a new level of global collaboration. And by mobilizing their workforce on iPads, Verizon plans to delight customers in an entirely new way. Today, we're seeing customers buy a broader selection of our services as evidenced by growth of all of our product lines. 
For the Sales Cloud, we signed Maersk, one of the world's largest shipping companies in the world based in Europe. And they swapped out Oracle and selected salesforce to their entire global sales team. We also won deals against Oracle with Fair, Eli Lilly, Telstra, Fuji Xerox, Japan Post, Unisys, PTC Parametric and Diebold Securities, all strong wins against Oracle. But in Q3, we also won against Microsoft, closing major deals with Pfizer, AXA, CenturyLink, American Teleconferencing Services, Gates Corp., Bank Pacifica, Orion, M&G and Tripwire. Other newer add-on transactions for the Sales Cloud from the third quarter included Adobe, Avaya, and Kasperky Labs. 
As our Sales Cloud to this, perhaps nowhere is the social enterprise message as critical as it is in customer service. In fact, 5 of our top 10 transactions in the quarter included the Service Cloud. A great example is Electronic Arts, who wanted to create a next-generation customer service center before the release of their highly-anticipated videogame, Battlefield 3. Electronic Arts was able to deploy an employee social network with 1,200 agents in just 6 weeks, allowing them to portals serving up over 20 million site page views and handling 150,000 cases in the first week alone, a really great win for Salesforce.com against Oracle. 
Other new or add-on service cloud transactions from the third quarter include Australia Post, Frontier Communications, GE, Western Digital, Investec Asset Management and KDDI. Chatter, which is at the heart of our social enterprise strategy, continue to drive our success in the third quarter. Another great example is Avaya, who plans to deploy more than 17,000 subscribers of Chatter and the Sales Cloud. Avaya will be rolling out an employee social network to improve collaboration and boost productivity. They also plan to replace their legacy content management systems with a next-generation social portal built on our application development and deployment platform, Force.com. 
And GE signed up for 20,000 subscribers of Chatter. In just 3 weeks, GE created a private customer social network called GE Edge, where their customers can collaborate with peers and get access to experts and research. 
Other Chatter wins in the quarter included Toyota with 10,000 subscribers of Chatter and, with 5,000 subscribers of Chatter. And while Chatter helps companies collaborate internally on private social networks, Radian6 is helping companies to listen and engage with customers on public social networks, redefining what it means to do social monitoring. We're thrilled with the success that Radian6 has seen with major customers around the world. Wins from the quarter included Conde Nast, Delta Airlines, LinkedIn, Nestlé, New York Times and Warner Brothers. 
Force.com achieved some truly important milestones in the quarter, delivering triple-digit growth year-over-year. Today, nearly 450,000 developers have built and deployed than 260,000 cloud apps on Force.com. And usage of the platform continues to increase. Force.com delivered 40 billion transactions, up 10% quarter-over-quarter and 62% from a year ago. Phenomenal. That's more than 600 million transactions on Force.com every business day. 
One of the great Force.com wins for the quarter is with USAA. They're standardizing on Force.com to power a range of employee-facing social apps such as property management, claim tracking, recruiting and more. 
Other new or add-on Force.com transactions for the quarter include Amgen, Japan Post, Toyota, City of New York and Yahoo!. In addition, new ISPs like Concur, Kennedy and Workday join our developer community to deliver next-generation apps on Force.com. 
And the average across a new milestone was more than 1 million apps installed by our customers worldwide, another amazing milestone that was crossed during the quarter. 
Over last year, we extended our platform strategy beyond Force.com with Database.com and Heroku and Data.com, giving developer solutions to replace state legacy tools. This quarter, Database.com became generally available, and Heroku added support for 5 additional languages, including Java. 
Heroku also became the first and to date the only cloud platform built right in the Facebook's development center. Right from within Facebook, you can start building Heroku applications in Java, in Python, in Ruby in Closure or the language of your choice. Within 24 hours of the announcement at Facebook's F8 Conference, Facebook developers had built more than 30,000 new apps on Heroku. Phenomenal. 
Recently, we announced some exciting acquisitions and new products. In the third quarter, you saw us acquire, a pioneer in the world of customer service and helpdesk applications for small businesses. We also launched the public beta of Do.com, a social project management system for small businesses. And early this week, we announced our intent to acquire Model Metrics, which is expected to close during the fiscal quarter. Model Metrics is a strategic services company that is helping to empower our global partner ecosystem with their outstanding mobile and social capabilities. You've seen so many of our top customers go to Model metrics to build custom mobile and social applications. We're delighted to welcome them to the Salesforce.com family. 
I want to remind all of you that on November 30th, we're hosting Cloudforce New York City at the Javits Convention Center. We expect more than 10,000 people to register to attend this event, making it the largest cloud computing event held on the East Coast and our largest event ever in New York City. If you have not yet registered, please contact David Havlek and we'd love to see you there at Cloudforce New York on November 30th. Also on December 14th and 15th, we're taking the Cloudforce roadshow to Tokyo, Japan, where we will continue to share our vision for the social enterprise, with an additional 10,000 registered attendees and events with Neil Young and will.i.am, we're looking forward to see you at Cloudforce Tokyo on December 14 and 15. 
With that, I'll turn this over to Graham to discuss the financial details of the third quarter."
122917,142590249,193800,"Salesforce.com, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2011",2011-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q3 was another great quarter. We executed well to deliver strong revenue growth, outstanding cash flow and earnings above guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $584 million, an increase of just over 36% year-over-year. Top line revenue was s",1890,"Thanks, Marc. Q3 was another great quarter. We executed well to deliver strong revenue growth, outstanding cash flow and earnings above guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $584 million, an increase of just over 36% year-over-year. Top line revenue was strong for 3 primary reasons: First, as Marc indicated, Q3 was another throng new business quarter and exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter; second, attrition on a dollar basis declined for the ninth consecutive quarter and remains in the midteens percentage range; and third, we continue to benefit from the weaker dollar, which in Q3, provided tailwind of approximately $9 million. Constant currency revenue growth was 34%. 
In terms of our third quarter year-over-year revenue growth by geography, revenue in the Americas grew 36% to $397 million. In Europe, Q3 revenue was $104 million, that's up 36% in dollars and 29% in constact currency, and in Asia, Q3 revenue rose roughly 39% in dollars and 31% in constant currency to $83 million. Our Japan business continued on its recovery and posted strong new business growth in the third quarter. 
Turning now to revenue mix. Q3 revenue was roughly 94% subscription support and 6% professional services. I mentioned on our last call at our Dreamforce analyst session that we could see our business mix show a slight shift toward professional services over the next 3 quarters as we invest in additional consulting skills to accelerate shift of the social enterprise. The acquisition of Model Metrics supports this acceleration by bringing on a team of highly skilled, mobile and social cloud designers to work on social enterprise projects. 
Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 82%, essentially unchanged from Q2 and from the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP subscription and support gross margins were flat sequentially at 86% but down a couple of points from last year. The small decline was primarily the result of data center capacity expansion. 
Non-GAAP professional services gross margins finished at 13%. While margins in this business continue to fluctuate quarter-over-quarter, the adoption of EITF 08-01 has led to an overall improvement this year. 
Moving on to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP operating expenses represented 71% of revenue in Q3, up 4 percentage points from last year. The increase was the result of 2 principal factors: First, over the past 12 months, we've acquired several businesses, notably Heroku, Radian6, and most recently, which have added nearly 500 people to our company. We're continuing to invest aggressively in those businesses. 
And second, over the same period, we added approximately 1,700 people through organic hiring, with 550 of them being added in Q3 alone. As a result of organic hiring and acquisitions, we added 600 people in Q3 to bring total Q3 ending headcount to nearly 7,000, an increase of 46% over last year. Our organic hiring continues to focus on adding sales and engineering capacity, which we believe is critical to future growth. We expect Q4 to be another record quarter for organic hiring as we look to continue our strong momentum into fiscal 2013. 
Within specific expense categories, sales and marketing continues to be our largest operating expense at roughly 47% of revenue. This is up about 3 points from last year. As you know, increasing sales capacity is one of our most important goals so I'd like to take a moment to review this financial impact in our operating model. 
While our salesperson typically takes 2 to 3 quarters to start closing new business, on average, it takes 6 to 9 quarters before a sales person and his or her supporting team reaches breakeven on a P&L basis. This lag between investment and profitability occurs for 2 main reasons: First, ratable revenue recognition means revenue from new business ramp slowly; and second, while we capitalize and then amortize commission expense for the salesperson against the related contract term, all of the sales engineering and management costs, including their commissions and bonuses, are recognized as period expenses. As long as the trend for overall sales productivity is flat or increasing, we're going to continue to hire aggressively. 
Marketing expenses in Q3 also rose significantly as we continue to evangelize our cloud computing and social enterprise messages. In the third quarter, we hosted Dreamforce at a net cost of roughly $0.05 per share, and in addition, we hosted large Cloudforce events in both London and Munich. 
Our sales and marketing remained our largest expense line item. R&D was our fastest growing expense category in Q3, increasing 47% from a year ago. With a broader product portfolio and our goal to dominate enterprise cloud computing, ongoing investment in R&D is critical. As a result, R&D now represents 11% of revenue compared with 10% a year ago. 
G&A was our slowest growing expense category. As a percent of revenue, G&A expense was flat year-over-year at 13%. 
As a result of higher operating expenses, our non-GAAP operating margin was 11%, up slightly from Q2 but down 4 points from last year. Due to the lower interest rate environment and an increase in the number of higher yielding investments that have come to maturity over the past few quarters, other income and expense, or OIE, was $4 million in the third quarter, that's down from roughly $9 million in Q3 last year. Similarly looking to FY '13, we expect OIE to be lower than in FY '12. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.34 compared with $0.32 in Q3 last year. EPS was higher than we guided for 2 main reasons: First, our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 29%, lower than our guided rate of 33%. This was the result of favorable adjustments driven by stock option exercises and additional tax benefits related to recent acquisitions. The lower tax rate contributed about $0.02 to Q3 non-GAAP EPS. 
And second, the lower average share price in the quarter drove a small or dilutive effect from our convertible note this quarter. This load or average share count contributed about $0.01 to non-GAAP EPS. We currently expect our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to roughly 33%. 
Looking to FY 13, we currently estimate that our effective tax rate will increase to approximately 40%. This high tax rate is driven by 2 main factors: First, we will no longer benefit from a one-time $40 million foreign tax reduction in the U.S. for Canadian taxes. This Canadian tax payment is a one-time event which will rose as a result of the Radian6 transaction. The actual tax payment of $40 million in Canada is scheduled for Q1 next year. And I just want to point out clearly, that will have an impact on our first quarter operating cash flow. 
And second, the federal R&D tax credit will expire at the end of calendar 2011. We do not anticipate the legislation being reviewed, or we cannot, I should say, anticipate the legislation being renewed in our forecast effective tax rate. Obviously, we hope Congress will eventually extend these important tax incentives. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $129 million during the quarter, up 74% from last year. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was up approximately 20% over the first 9 months last year. We had a strong collections quarter, and our Q3 DSO was 49 days, down from 55 days a year ago. 
For the full year, we expect operating cash flow in the midteens percentage range. This implies slower growth in Q4 than Q3 primarily as a result of the significant hiring ramp that we're seeing in the second half. 
For CapEx, we finished the quarter at roughly $35 million. As we discussed on the last call, capital spending was driven by 3 factors. First, roughly half of all CapEx this year is a result of leasehold improvements, with year-over-year employee growth of 46%, we expect to continue significant spending in this area. 
Second, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in data center capacity as we build out new infrastructure with a wholesale data center model, CapEx relating to power cages and ranking. And then last, capitalized software for service delivery and internal IT projects makes up the balance. This can vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing and scale of deployments. We expect CapEx in Q4 to be similar to the Q2 levels. 
Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow minus CapEx, was approximately $94 million in Q3. That's up 77% from last year. For the 9 month year-to-date, we've generated $244 million in free cash flow. 
Moving on to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at just under $1.3 billion. Cash has remained relatively flat year-over-year due to acquisitions over the previous 12 months, which represent just over $600 million in cash outflows. Deferred revenue was $918 million at quarter end, that up 32% from last year. Adjusting for an approximate $5 million FX tailwind, constant currency growth for deferred revenue was 31%. This compares with constant currency growth rates of 33% in both Q1 and Q2. 
I'd like to remind people the quarter end deferred revenue was a function of invoicing and is influenced by several factors, including invoice timing, invoice duration, new business linearity within the quarter, annual seasonality and the compounding effects of renewals. And as we discussed at the Dreamforce analyst session, some of our recent acquisitions such as Heroku and Radian6 bill monthly and don't contribute significantly to the deferred revenue balance at all. Although for all the reasons I just described, deferred revenue is a tough number to predict. We expect Q4 revenue to grow approximately 30%. 
Turning to our outlook. We feel good about our compelling social enterprise vision, we have great market position and our strong pipeline entering Q4. There are 2 things to note about this guidance I'm going to give you: First, we're on track to transition Radian6 revenue recognition from a cash basis to an invoice basis in the fourth quarter. This will add around $5 million of extra revenue in the fourth quarter as we go through that transition. 
And we discussed this back in May actually when we announced the transfer of the acquisition. And then second, we are seeing that the acquisition of Model Metrics will close in December in our guidance. 
After taking these factors into account, we now project Q4 revenues to be in the range of $620 million to $624 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.39 to $0.40. For full year 2012, we estimate revenue in the range of $2.255 billion to $2.259 billion, representing growth of approximately 36%. 
Looking forward to fiscal of 2013, we currently anticipate revenue to be in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.92 billion. Again, this assumes we close the acquisition of Model Metrics in Q4. The midpoint of this guidance range implies just over about 28.5% revenue growth for FY '13. We'll provide you with further details about FY '13 operating model on our fourth quarter call in February. 
Before we turn the call over to the operator for questions, I also want to encourage all of you to join us in New York on November 30th for what is shaping up to be an amazing Cloudforce event.

And then the last thing I'd remind you, Kash, is that some of these newer business is like Radian6 and Heroku, they're not really contributing to deferred revenue balance. They contribute to the revenue number but they don't contribute to the deferred revenue number in any significant way. So we did highlight that at our analyst session at Dreamforce. There's something to, as a potential shift in how that billings calculation that you do may work. So we feel we couldn't be happier with where our business is and where we're going in Q4 next year so that's sort of our commentary."

But at the end of the day, our best predictor of where our revenue is going is our guidance. And when we get down to the deferred revenue, it's not a metric that we manage internally. It's really only a metric that we report at the end of the quarter. And in terms of our sales and our numbers for the quarter, our bookings for the quarter, we've stayed away from those quarterly numbers. And we can look at something like our customer accounts, which for this quarter, were above where we expect them to be and were actually a record number than we've ever had in the history of the company."

If we 0 back down to this deferred number, it's going to continue to fluctuate, and it's not a great indicator of the current performance of the company.

And if you go back to Dreamforce 2008, you'll remember I was on stage with Cheryl Sandberg and doing demonstrations of Facebook tightly integrated with Salesforce.com. And that valid to 2009 which is when we really started to announce Chatter. 2010 where we had rolled out Chatter as kind of the foundation of the social enterprise. And now in 2011, of course, we called basically Dreamforce welcome to the social enterprise, and we are working with literally thousands of our customers around the world that are defining what social enterprise means to them. When we look at social enterprise, we see what is the customer social profile? What does it look like from a cooperation platform? How are they building and deploying the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, custom applications, social applications which is kind of what we see with Heroku, social monitoring like with Radian6? And then we start to build product social network. This week, I was in Las Vegas on Monday with our customer Toyota rolling out to all of their dealers and distributors, our vision for Toyota Friend and demonstrating Toyota Friend to them on the iPad. And it was an amazing experience but when we look at the customers that were closing in this quarter and the pipelines that we have, we have a lot of social enterprise transformations underway because it has become the primary way that we're selling. I  would say that we've evolved from being a Sales Force Automation company and then adding the platform where I would call it SFA platform or even a CRM platform, then we really introduced the Service Cloud where we became a true CRM platform, the sales, service. Of course, we've added the Radian6, we see the emergence of the marketing cloud. With Heroku, with these social marketing applications, with Radian6 and really what thousands of websites that we run all for our customers all over the world. And then you can really start to see that when you combine all of that with Chatter and other core technologies that we've deployed, we really see the social enterprise as our primary value proposition to the customers. And I would suggest if you talk to our customers or talk to recent customers that we've signed, a lot of these is that we're able to close deals because we were substantially ahead of the competition that not only being able to define, articulate but also build and deploy for a customer social enterprise applications, and it's been -- it was a fantastic dream for us. I expect the same at Cloudforce at New York and Tokyo, and I expect that our pipelines will continue to be full of social enterprise capabilities. And specifically to your point in speed. I believe that our industry is going faster than ever before. And that we're going to see this uptake as already evidenced by the deal flow, it's happening faster than ever before because customers need new solutions that are trying to reduce define themselves and the opportunity is right now. It's not 2 or 3 years from now. This is about being aware of what's going in the market today and again, how to deliver that."

Number two, it's part of our platform, it's not a really a separate piece of code, it's a deeply integrated part of the platform, and the core parts of that operating like, for example, knowledge management or the ability to do case management, that's an application that we deliver to customers, it's also part of our platform that we deliver to developers, it's also deeply integrated into our Sales Cloud and into our marketing cloud, and that's really one of the strengths of salesforce is that we haven't acquired hodgepodge, all these other little companies in every little thing like Oracle has. We've been delivering really from the ground up, and where -- when we have a technology vacuum like we did a few years ago, in knowledge management, we acquired a company called InStranet but that was an on-premise technology company that then we rewrote deeply into our platform, into the multitenet architecture and the shared system, making it available through our API. And the great evidence of that is the win this quarter with Electronic Arts. As you know, Electronic Arts and Battlefield 3 is probably the biggest highest volume customer service release of the quarter for any vendor. And it was a replacement of competitive technology. And I think that when you look at that, it's evidence that we have what it takes to win those transactions, to go head-to-head against Oracle and to beat them consistently. And that's why they continue to draw straws, buy different companies, but nothing is going to be able to go up against a deeply integrated platform like we have that can do application development as well as the end user application capability across the board.

And all of that, we really look at the evolution of we've been calling, I call the marketing cloud internally because when I look at the social marketing cloud, what I see is really the opportunity for customers to use products like Radian6 for social monitoring, Heroku for building interactive applications. In Facebook, a great example of that we've been talking about this Facebook.com/Disneyland where you can see the deeply integrated interactive application. Or even you're going to start to see us deploy new -- I don't want to get ahead of where we're going for Cloudforce New York, where you're going to see us do a lot of announcements in this area, but the ability to take Force.com, the ability to take the Service Cloud, the ability to take the Sales Cloud and the marketing cloud and deploy highly customized applications back out to customers. When we talked and looked at competitive offerings from Oracle, from SAP from the companies that they're buying every other week, they just can't do that. You just don't see that level of integration, the level of scale, the level of throughput. I guess great staff that we didn't use in our script that we probably could have is we've delivered more than 300 million pages to Zynga's customer service application since we deployed it in April. That's amazing. And you just don't see other companies doing that level of scale in throughput and reliability. And then when we look at a company like Zynga, we see them deploy in other aspects of our technology as well to become a true social enterprise.

I think that maybe it wasn't the last call but the call before when I was asked to comment on, did I think we were going into a recessionary environment or that we were going into a recession? And I know at that time, a lot of forecasters felt that we were, and I've felt that we were not. And I still feel that way, I don't feel like we're going into a recession. And I'll tell you that, one of the I think, bifurcations for salesforce is that the way that businesses are buying maybe a little bit different than the way consumers are buying. We're primarily a B2B company, as you know. We're not to that consumer, and so I don't think that we have really experienced the same level of fluctuations and market demand that maybe B2C companies have. And as a B2B company, we've seen -- I think as you see part of these numbers which are pretty unbelievable, extraordinary performance in the United States, first and foremost. And those numbers have surprised us. It's why revenue guidance has essentially been raised every single quarter this year, and why we are, I think, ahead of everyone coming into next year is primarily the U.S. Number. Now number two, let's not forget Japan, which has not had a great couple of quarters economically since the disaster but our business in Japan has actually been quite good. Of course, we had an initial dropoff as kind of everybody wasn't sure what was going on in country but as things stabilized, we saw an acceleration of demand for cloud-based solutions. Of course, we offered our product for free to anybody affected by the disaster. We've also picked up additional work with the government and with other related companies. And I hope and that many of you will come to Tokyo because I've think that it is salesforce's second-biggest market in the world, and we just added a second session of my keynote there. I think that you're going to find that to be a very robust buying environment, an opportunity for Salesforce.com on a going forward basis. When we went to Europe, I think that for sure, you could see it that people in Europe have not been sure what's going on with them because the banking crisis. But at the end of the day, businesses are buying and you can see with our delivery of essentially what I would call strong double-digit, mid-double-digit growth year-over-year, as well as the signing of strong deals in the quarter across the continent. And I even mentioned one of the deals that happened in Eastern Europe with Kasperky. I view the opportunity in Europe as continuing to be a very good opportunity. It has to get characterized against the United States which is off the hook. When you look at the enterprise software market overall, and Gartner just released all of their numbers for the top, I don't know, 30 or 40 or 50 countries in the world, I actually have them here, you really have to look to the U.S., Japan, the U.K., France, Germany, Canada and Australia, which has been a very strong grower for us as well as really the top 7 domineering countries for enterprise software where we focused our resources. We've obviously experimented in other regions, including India and other pieces. But at the end of the day, it's those 7 countries that have been really awesome for us. And we have really a strong -- we remain really strong in the 3 most important countries in enterprise software, which remain the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. So I would consider -- I would continue to say when you look at the beginning of this calendar year, people are very worried about the U.S. I'm sure we all had memories and forget that. But the U.S. has been a great, great grower for salesforce and really for others this year. Japan, you could not have expected what had happened, and obviously, they have monetary issues that they have to work through in terms of their currency. And Europe obviously, I think psychologically has affected a lot by the banking crisis but I see companies growing there. I see them adding. And where we saw and the reason that we felt good that we were not in a recessionary environment and we would call that out is when we see existing customers cutting, that's or -- consider existing customers even not adding is really the dominant number that we look at. We go is our add-on business flat? When we don't see customers adding, that's when we know we're in a recessionary environment because they're not growing their sales and customer-facing organizations which is where everybody wants to invest in today's market. From our perspective, existing customers are adding on and we're signing new customers. That's exciting from us. And what we have tried to do in the last 6 months is redefine what is the customer front office. I don't think other competitors have done that. We've given that a name with a social enterprise, and we've redefined the front office in many cases of all company when you look at Chatter, when you look at the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the platform and that continues to be why salesforce is absolutely one of the very fastest-growing enterprise software companies in the world and why we continue to see that next year."

And you even said that off balance sheet grew faster deferred revenue than on balance sheet. But even 2 years ago, when deferred revenue declined sequentially in the October quarter, accounts receivable actually increased, and that's another indicator of business signings, at least, towards the end of the quarter. But this year, that actually declined too. So I mean, why shouldn't we be a little -- and listen, you're still playing really good numbers, like really good growth numbers.

You use that word recognizing revenue upfront. We don't recognize any revenue upfront. So the newer business was like Heroku and Radian6 bill monthly, and so therefore, if they're billing for a very short time period based on usage typically, my point is simply that those businesses don't affect deferred revenue, not that we recognize revenue upfront, we just simply recognize it each month when it's billed so I just want to be clear on that. I think clearly, we had a great collections quarter. If you look at our DSOs going from 55 days down to 49 days, that clearly has something to do with the AR balance being what it is. We wanted to make sure that we delivered a strong operating cash flow for the quarter and that's what we did. And like I said, Marc said earlier, we don't manage deferred revenue. That's why we continue to highlight as often as we can that there are these fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. And we have, on a constant currency basis, we're talking about a trend that's gone 33, 33, 31. So that's and clearly we're looking at a strong fourth quarter from our perspective and a strong year next year. That's sort of -- that's how we join the dots."

Those are not things that we are in there trying to dial up with customers. What we're trying to dial up with customers is getting them on board, closing their deals, getting their contract length correct, getting them implemented, making them successful and looking at the long-term monetary value of these customers over time. And as we broke through more than 100,000 core customers in the last quarter, what we really saw was we continue to see very, very strong revenue growth, and we are doing a good job of predicting how our business is performing, and we're going to be able to continue to do that. But we have to be a little bit cautious regards to this concept of quarter end deferred is still absolutely is a function of invoicing, and it's also influenced by other factors that Graham has mentioned, including things like invoice timing, invoice duration, new business linearity within the quarter annual seasonality, these acquisitions, compounding effects of renewals. And those are things that we as a -- certainly, I could speak in terms of the sales organization, we're focused on beating the competition and signing deals. And in terms of those specific metrics, that's not where our eyes are, and so you can see variations in deferred revenue over time, which is why at Dreamforce, Graham called that out in the Analyst Day and he basically said to be aware of those types of fluctuations in the future."

But frankly, it's at a level of sort of noise that it feels kind of weird on a $900 million-plus number to be saying, ""Oh, this quarter, we gained x million from a little movement in this proportion. And next quarter, we've lost a little because of that proportion changing.""

And as the social enterprise's gotten more and more momentum this year, what we've seen is a gap in our ability to rapidly deploy to our customers certain key aspects regarding the strategic services around the social enterprise. And that gap obviously has been picked up by some of our partners like Accenture, like Deloitte, like CapGemini. But one of the partners that we saw do an outstanding job in a very strategic area, which is mobile applications and in social networks is Model Metrics. We specifically saw that when we signed Toyota, when we saw the ability was how do we rapidly start to build and deploy an application for them. And many of our partners were not able to deliver on the mobility piece we saw Model be able to jump in. We've seen that with other customers and we said strategically, this is a core part of the services we want to be in. As you know, a very small percentage of salesforce's total revenue is services. It's not part of our strategy, it's not what we talk about on the call. In fact, we really didn't talk about professional services or consulting at all in this call. We're all about the delivery of more and more customers and more. And when we want to scale an organization, we don't want the scale ProServe, we want to scale our distribution organization. That's our strategy. That said in this one area, strategic services, we want more competency and we made a strategic decision to do something that we have not had the need to do before which is to pick up a relatively small professional services organization that's an expert in social, mobile and cloud, Mobile Metrics based in Chicago and that's the deal that we announced and I think that makes us a much stronger organization in being able to close and accelerate these social enterprise transactions."

We've seen transactions closed in this quarter that get paid out for us in quarters to come. I'm not going to go into that detail. But it's been very exciting for us to see customers make these very big commitments to us over time. And the social enterprise has provided a very, very high level of differentiation. I think when customers go through a demonstration of our technology, as I'm sure you have done and you will see again in New York and Tokyo, it's highly differentiated against the competition and customers can start where they are. Social enterprise is not something that anybody buys, it's not a product, it's not on our price list. Of course, we have a social enterprise license agreement where they can buy an ELA, where they can take all of our products down. But the reality is most customers come in with a specific business need that we're looking to fulfill and then give them a vision in their mind where they can go beyond that, and that remains our core strategy. When I work with customers and I help them to define what is their social enterprise for the future, I think a lot of about where is their employee social network today? Where is their customer social network today? Where is there product social network? And how can we elevate their consciousness about the ability to deploy more of that? And I think one of the most exciting things in the release of our technology that we just put out is that now inside Chatter is salesforce is a customer group so you can create a group not only of employees but you can now create a group and you can bring in employee customers, and that could provide an exponential effect on Chatter. So every Chatter user can go out and create a group and then bring outside customers into that group to collaborate and create a portal and share information within that group. We've just never seen technology like that. Salesforce's technology has primarily been myopic. It's been within the enterprise. Maybe, we have a portal for your customers. Now we're including the customer into that. That's an exciting next step in enterprise software. I think it's an accelerator for customers on the social enterprise. And we're considering to see strong deal flow, and we have our sales cycles to be highly normalized in terms of their close rates."

I am absolutely delighted to share these amazing third quarter results, and I'll begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the quarter. First, revenue of $584 million rose by amazingly 36%. Our annual revenue run rate",1356,"Hey, David. I am absolutely delighted to share these amazing third quarter results, and I'll begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the quarter. 
First, revenue of $584 million rose by amazingly 36%. Our annual revenue run rate is now more than $2.3 billion, and it makes us the first enterprise cloud company to reach this milestone. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 was absolutely above our guided range, and we delivered that while hosting a world-class Dreamforce here in San Francisco. But now, it is the largest enterprise software event in the world of more than 46,000 registered attendees. 
Deferred revenues increased by 32% that finished the quarter at $918 million, and third quarter operating cash flow rose by 74% year-over-year to $129 million in the quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents on our balance sheet. 
Now in fiscal year 2012, we became the first enterprise cloud company to surpass a $2 billion annual revenue run rate. And today, I'm delighted to announce that we expect to retake $3 billion annual revenue run rate during our next fiscal year. That is just spectacular growth. Our financial success in the third quarter was powered by a tremendous response from customers to our new social enterprise strategy. We're now engaged with customers at a higher and more strategic level than ever before, and we've seen more large deals this quarter as a result of that strategy than we have seen in other quarters this year. 
At Dreamforce, we showed how some of the world's best companies such as Burberry, Toyota, Verizon are all transforming into social enterprises. In fact, I'm delighted to share with you one of our largest transactions in the quarter was Verizon, who signed up for 80,000 subscribers of Chatter, 7,000 subscribers of the Sales Cloud and Data.com. Now Verizon's vision for the social enterprise is to build an employee social network connecting retail stores and office-based employees, fueling a new level of global collaboration. And by mobilizing their workforce on iPads, Verizon plans to delight customers in an entirely new way. Today, we're seeing customers buy a broader selection of our services as evidenced by growth of all of our product lines. 
For the Sales Cloud, we signed Maersk, one of the world's largest shipping companies in the world based in Europe. And they swapped out Oracle and selected Salesforce to their entire global sales team. We also won deals against Oracle with Bayer, Eli Lilly, Telstra, Fuji Xerox, Japan Post, Unisys, PTC Parametric and Diebold Securities, all strong wins against Oracle. But in Q3, we also won against Microsoft, closing major deals with Pfizer, AXA, CenturyLink, American Teleconferencing Services, Gates Corp., Banca Civica, Orion, Vbimps [ph] M&G and Tripwire. Other newer add-on transactions for the Sales Cloud from the third quarter included Adobe, Avaya, Sompo and Kaspersky Labs. 
As exciting as our Sales Cloud momentum is, perhaps nowhere is the social enterprise message as critical as it is in customer service. In fact, 5 of our top 10 transactions in the quarter included the Service Cloud. A great example is Electronic Arts, who wanted to create a next-generation customer service center before the release of their highly-anticipated video game, Battlefield 3. Electronic Arts was able to deploy an employee social network with 1,200 agents in just 6 weeks, allowing them to manage dozen of portals serving up over 20 million site page views and handling 150,000 cases in the first week alone, a really great win for Salesforce.com against Oracle. 
Other new or add-on service cloud transactions from the third quarter include Australia Post, Frontier Communications, GE, Unum, Western Digital, Investec Asset Management and KBDI. Chatter, which is at the heart of our social enterprise strategy, continue to drive our success in the third quarter. Another great example is Avaya, who plans to deploy more than 17,000 subscribers of Chatter and the Sales Cloud. Avaya will be rolling out an employee social network to improve collaboration and boost productivity. They also plan to replace their legacy content management systems with a next-generation social portal built on our application development and deployment platform, Force.com. And GE signed up for 20,000 subscribers of Chatter. In just 3 weeks, GE created a private customer social network called GE Edge, where their customers can collaborate with peers and get access to experts in research. 
Other Chatter wins in the quarter included Toyota with 10,000 subscribers of Chatter and PECO with 5,000 subscribers of Chatter. And while Chatter helps companies collaborate internally on private social networks, Radian6 is helping companies to listen and engage with customers on public social networks, redefining what it means to do social monitoring. We're thrilled with the success that Radian6 has seen with major customers around the world. Wins from the quarter included Condé Nast, Delta Airlines, LinkedIn, Nestlé, New York Times and Warner Brothers. 
Force.com achieved some truly impressive milestones in the quarter, delivering triple-digit growth year-over-year. Today, nearly 450,000 developers have built and deployed than 260,000 cloud apps on Force.com, and usage of the platform continues to increase. Force.com delivered 40 billion transactions, up 10% quarter-over-quarter and 62% from a year ago. Phenomenal. That's more than 600 million transactions on Force.com every business day. 
One of the great Force.com wins for the quarter is with USAA. They are standardizing on Force.com to power a range of employee-facing social apps such as property management, claim tracking, recruiting and more.  Other new or add-on Force.com transactions from the quarter include Amgen, Japan Post, Toyota, City of New York and Yahoo!. In addition, new ISPs like Concur, Infor, Kenandy and Workday join our developer community to deliver next-generation apps on Force.com. And the AppExchange crossed a new milestone with more than 1 million apps installed by our customers worldwide, another amazing milestone that was crossed during the quarter. 
Over the last year, we extended our net platform strategy beyond Force.com with Database.com and Heroku and Data.com, giving developers solutions to replace date legacy tools. This quarter, Database.com became generally available, and Heroku added support for 5 additional languages, including Java. 
Heroku also became the first and to date the only cloud platform built right in the Facebook's development center. Right from within Facebook, you can start building Heroku applications in Java, in Python, in Ruby, in Closure or the language of your choice. Within 24 hours of the announcement at Facebook's F8 Conference, Facebook developers had built more than 30,000 new apps on Heroku. Phenomenal. 
Recently, we announced some exciting acquisitions and new products. In the third quarter, you saw us acquire Assistly, a pioneer in the world of customer service and help desk applications for small businesses. We also launched the public beta of Do.com, a social project management system for small businesses. And early this week, we announced our intent to acquire Model Metrics, which is expected to close during the fiscal quarter. Model Metrics is a strategic services company that is helping to empower our global partner ecosystem with their outstanding mobile and social capabilities. You've seen so many of our top customers go to Model Metrics to build custom mobile and social application. We're delighted to welcome them to the Salesforce.com family. 
I want to remind all of you that on November 30, we're hosting Cloudforce New York City at the Javits Convention Center. We expect more than 10,000 people to register to attend this event, making it the largest cloud computing event held on the East Coast and our largest event ever in New York City. If you have not yet registered, please contact David Havlek, and we'd love to see you there at Cloudforce New York on November 30. Also on December 14 and 15, we're taking the Cloudforce roadshow to Tokyo, Japan, where we will continue to share our vision for the social enterprise, with an additional 10,000 registered attendees and events with Neil Young and will.i.am, We're looking forward to see you at Cloudforce Tokyo on December 14 and 15. 
With that, I'll turn this over to Graham to discuss the financial details of the third quarter."
122917,142590249,193892,"Salesforce.com, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2011",2011-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q3 was another great quarter. We executed well to deliver strong revenue growth, outstanding cash flow and earnings above guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $584 million, an increase of just over 36% year-over-year. Top line revenue was s",1891,"Thanks, Marc. Q3 was another great quarter. We executed well to deliver strong revenue growth, outstanding cash flow and earnings above guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $584 million, an increase of just over 36% year-over-year. Top line revenue was strong for 3 primary reasons: First, as Marc indicated, Q3 was another strong new business quarter and exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter; second, attrition on a dollar basis declined for the ninth consecutive quarter and remains in the mid-teens percentage range; and third, we continue to benefit from a weaker dollar, which in Q3, provided tailwind of approximately $9 million. Constant currency revenue growth was 34%. 
In terms of our third quarter year-over-year revenue growth by geography, revenue in the Americas grew 36% to $397 million. In Europe, Q3 revenue was $104 million, that's up 36% in dollars and 29% in constant currency, and in Asia, Q3 revenue rose roughly 39% in dollars and 31% in constant currency to $83 million. Our Japan business continued on its recovery and posted strong new business growth in the third quarter. 
Turning now to revenue mix. Q3 revenue was roughly 94% subscription and support and 6% professional services. I mentioned on our last call and at our Dreamforce analyst session that we could see our business mix show a slight shift toward professional services over the next 3 quarters as we invest in additional consulting skills to accelerate shift of the social enterprise. The acquisition of Model Metrics supports this acceleration by bringing on a team of high skilled, mobile and social cloud designers to work on social enterprise projects. 
Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 82%, essentially unchanged from Q2 and from the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP subscription and support gross margins were flat sequentially at 86% but down a couple of points from last year. The small decline was primarily the result of data center capacity expansion. 
Non-GAAP professional services gross margins finished at 13%. While margins in this business continue to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, the adoption of EITF 08-01 has led to an overall improvement this year. 
Moving on to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP operating expenses represented 71% of revenue in Q3, up 4 percentage points from last year. The increase was the result of 2 principal factors: First, over the past 12 months, we've acquired several businesses, notably Heroku, Radian6, and most recently, Assistly, which have added nearly 500 people to our company. We're continuing to invest aggressively in those businesses. 
And second, over the same period, we added approximately 1,700 people through organic hiring, with 550 of them being added in Q3 alone. As a result of organic hiring and acquisitions, we added 600 people in Q3 to bring total Q3 ending headcount to nearly 7,000, an increase of 46% over last year. Our organic efforts continue to focus on adding sales and engineering capacity, which we believe is critical to future growth. We expect Q4 to be another record quarter for organic hiring as we look to continue our strong momentum into fiscal 2013. 
Within specific expense categories, sales and marketing continues to be our largest operating expense at roughly 47% of revenue. This is up about 3 points from last year. As you know, increasing sales capacity is one of our most important goals, so I'd like to take a moment to review its financial impact on our operating model. 
While a salesperson typically takes 2 to 3 quarters to start closing new business, on average, it takes 6 to 9 quarters before a salesperson and his or her supporting team reaches breakeven on a P&L basis. This lag between investment and profitability occurs for 2 main reasons: First, ratable revenue recognition means revenue from new business ramp slowly; and second, while we capitalize and then amortize commission expense for the salesperson against the related contract term, all of the sales engineering and management costs, including their commissions and bonuses, are recognized as period expenses. As long as the trend for overall sales productivity is flat or increasing, we're going to continue to hire aggressively. 
Marketing expenses in Q3 also rose significantly as we continue to evangelize our cloud computing and social enterprise messages. In the third quarter, we hosted Dreamforce at a net cost of roughly $0.05 per share. And in addition, we hosted large Cloudforce events in both London and Munich. 
Our sales and marketing remain our largest expense line item. R&D was our fastest-growing expense category in Q3, increasing 47% from a year ago. With a broadening product portfolio and our goal to dominate enterprise cloud computing, ongoing investment in R&D is critical. As a result, R&D now represents 11% of revenue compared with 10% a year ago. 
G&A was our slowest growing expense category. As a percent of revenue, G&A expense was flat year-over-year at 13%. As a result of higher operating expenses, our non-GAAP operating margin was 11%, up slightly from Q2 but down 4 points from last year. Due to the lower interest rate environment and an increase in the number of higher-yielding investments that have come to maturity over the past few quarters, other income and expense, or OIE, was $4 million in the third quarter, that's down from roughly $9 million in Q3 last year. Similarly, looking to FY '13, we expect OIE to be lower than in FY '12. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.34 compared with $0.32 in Q3 last year. EPS was higher than we guided for 2 main reasons: First, our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 29%, lower than our guided rate of 33%. This was the result of favorable adjustments driven by stock option exercises and additional tax benefits related to recent acquisitions. The lower tax rate contributed about $0.02 to Q3 non-GAAP EPS. And second, the lower average share price in the quarter drove a smaller dilutive effect from our convertible note this quarter. This load or average share count contributed about $0.01 to non-GAAP EPS. We currently expect our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to roughly 32%. 
Looking to FY 13, we currently estimate that our effective tax rate will increase to approximately 40%. This high tax rate is driven by 2 main factors: First, we will no longer benefit from a onetime $40 million foreign tax deduction in the U.S. for Canadian taxes. This Canadian tax payment is a onetime event which will rose as a result of the Radian6 transaction. The actual tax payment of $40 million in Canada is scheduled for Q1 next year. And I just want to point out clearly, that will have an impact on our first quarter operating cash flow. And second, the federal R&D tax credit will expire at the end of calendar 2011. We do not anticipate the legislation being reviewed or we cannot, I should say, anticipate being -- the legislation being renewed in our forecast effective tax rate. Obviously, we hope the Congress will eventually extend these important tax incentives. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $129 million during the quarter, up 74% from last year. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was up approximately 20% over the first 9 months last year. We had a strong collections quarter, and our Q3 DSO was 49 days, down from 55 days a year ago. For the full year, we expect operating cash flow in the mid-teens percentage range. This implies slower growth in Q4 than Q3, primarily as a result of the significant hiring ramp that we're seeing in the second half. 
For CapEx, we finished the quarter at roughly $35 million. As we discussed on the last call, capital spending was driven by 3 factors: First, roughly half of all CapEx this year is a result of leasehold improvements. With year-over-year employee growth of 46%, we expect to continue significant spending in this area. Second, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in data center capacity. As we build out new infrastructure with a wholesale data center model, we incur CapEx relating to power cages and ranking. And then last, capitalized software for service delivery and internal IT projects makes up the balance. This can vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing and scale of deployments. We expect CapEx in Q4 to be similar to the Q2 levels. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow minus CapEx, was approximately $94 million in Q3. That's up 77% from last year. For the 9 months year-to-date, we've generated $244 million in free cash flow. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at just under $1.3 billion. Cash has remained relatively flat year-over-year due to acquisitions over the previous 12 months, which represent just over $600 million in cash outflows. Deferred revenue was $918 million at quarter end, that's up 32% from last year. Adjusting for an approximate $5 million FX tailwind, constant currency growth for deferred revenue was 31%. This compares with constant currency growth rates of 33% in both Q1 and Q2. 
I'd like to remind people the quarter end deferred revenue was a function of invoicing and is influenced by several factors, including invoice timing, invoice duration, new business linearity within the quarter, annual seasonality and the compounding effects of renewals. And as we discussed at the Dreamforce analyst session, some of our recent acquisitions such as Heroku and Radian6 bill monthly and don't contribute significantly to the deferred revenue balance at all. Although for all the reasons I just described, deferred revenue is a tough number to predict. We expect Q4 revenue to grow at approximately 30%.
Turning to our outlook. We feel good about our compelling social enterprise vision, have great market position and a strong pipeline entering Q4. There are 2 things to note about this guidance I'm going to give you: First, we're on track to transition Radian6 revenue recognition from a cash basis to an invoice basis in the fourth quarter. This will add around $5 million of extra revenue in the fourth quarter as we go through that transition. And we discussed this back in May, actually when we announced the acquisition. And then second, we are seeing that the acquisition of Model Metrics will close in December in our guidance.
After taking these factors into account, we now project Q4 revenues to be in the range of $620 million to $624 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.39 to $0.40. For full year 2012, we estimate revenue in the range of $2.255 billion to $2.259 billion, representing growth of approximately 36%. 
Looking forward to fiscal 2013, we currently anticipate revenue to be in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.92 billion. Again, this assumes we close the acquisition of Model Metrics in Q4. The midpoint of this guidance range implies just over -- about 28.5% revenue growth for FY '13. We'll provide you with further details about FY '13 operating model on our fourth quarter call in February. 
Before we turn the call over to the operator for questions, I also want to encourage all of you to join us in New York on November 30 for what is shaping up to be an amazing Cloudforce event.

I think with -- first of all, just to put this in perspective, I think we've raised our guidance for Q4. We've obviously initiated, I think, pretty exciting guidance for next year. If you look at the trend of constant currency deferred revenue growth, Q1 is 33%; Q2, 33%; Q3 was 31%. That's why we have avoided, I think, talking about your calculation of billings. I think your number is a lot more volatile. We tend to -- I think we -- the deferred revenue is a number that goes on our balance sheet. And we feel clearly that it's subject to this volatility for all those reasons that I listed around, invoice duration and so on. And then the last thing I'd remind you, Kash, is that some of these newer business like Radian6 and Heroku, they're not really contributing to deferred revenue balance. They contribute to the revenue number, but they don't contribute to the deferred revenue number in any significant way. So we did highlight that at our analyst session at Dreamforce. There's something to, as a potential shift in how that billings calculation that you do may work. So we feel we couldn't be happier with where our business is and where we're going in Q4 next year, so that's sort of our commentary."

But at the end of the day, our best predictor of where our revenue is going is our guidance. And when we get down to the deferred revenue, it's not a metric that we manage internally. It's really only a metric that we report at the end of the quarter.

And if you go back to Dreamforce 2008, you'll remember I was on stage with Sheryl Sandberg and doing demonstrations of Facebook tightly integrated with Salesforce.com. And that folded to 2009 which is when we really started to announce Chatter, 2010 where we had rolled out Chatter as kind of the foundation of the social enterprise. And now in 2011, of course, we called basically Dreamforce welcome to the social enterprise, and we are working with literally thousands of our customers around the world that are defining what social enterprise means to them. When we look at social enterprise, we see what is the customer social profile, what does it look like from a cooperation platform, how are they building and deploying the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, custom applications, social applications which is kind of what we see with Heroku, social monitoring like with Radian6. And then we start to build product social network. This week, I was in Las Vegas on Monday with our customer Toyota rolling out to all of their dealers and distributors our vision for Toyota Friend and demonstrating Toyota Friend to them on the iPad, and it was an amazing experience. But when we look at the customers that were closing in this quarter and the pipelines that we have, we have a lot of social enterprise transformations at our way because it has become the primary way that we're selling. I would say that we've evolved from being a Sales Force Automation company and then adding the platform and to be in a -- what I would call an SFA platform or even a CRM platform. Then we really introduced the Service Cloud when we became a true CRM platform, the sales, service. Of course, we've added in Radian6. We see emergence of the marketing cloud with Heroku, with these social marketing applications, with Radian6 and really with the thousands of websites that we run all -- for our customers all over the world. And then you can really start to see that when you combine all of that with Chatter and other core technologies that we've deployed, we really see the social enterprise as our primary value proposition to the customers. And I would suggest if you talk to our customers or talk to recent customers that we've signed, a lot of the reasons that we're able to close deals was because we are substantially ahead of the competition and not only being able to find, articulate but also build and deploy for a customer social enterprise applications, and it's been -- it was a fantastic dream for us. I expect the same at Cloudforce at New York and Tokyo. And I expect that our pipelines will continue to be full of social enterprise capabilities. And specifically to your point in speed. I believe that our industry is going faster than ever before. And that we're going to see this uptake as already evidenced by the deal flow, and happening faster than ever before because customers need new solutions that are trying to redefine themselves and the opportunity is right now. It's not 2 or 3 years from now. This is about being aware of what's going in the market today and how to deliver that."

It's part of the -- as Laurel has indicated, part of the social enterprise, number one. Number two, it's part of our platform. It's not a really a separate piece of code. It's a deeply integrated part of the platform. And the core parts of that are operating like, for example, knowledge management or the ability to do case management. That's an application that we deliver to customers. It's also part of our platform that we deliver to developers. It's also deeply integrated into our Sales Cloud and into our marketing cloud. And that's really one of the strengths of Salesforce is that we haven't acquired hodgepodge, all these other little companies in every little thing like Oracle has. We've been delivering really from the ground up, and where we -- when we have a technology vacuum like we did a few years ago, in knowledge management, we acquired a company called InStranet, but that was an on-premise technology company that then we rewrote deeply into our platform, into the multi-tenet architecture and the shared system, make it available through our API. And the great evidence of that is the win this quarter with Electronic Arts. As you know, Electronic Arts and Battlefield 3 is probably the biggest highest volume customer service release of the quarter for any vendor. And it was a replacement of competitive technology. And I think that when you look at that, it's evidenced that we have what it takes to win those transactions, to go head-to-head against Oracle and to beat them consistently. And that's why they continue to draw straws, buy different companies, but nothing is going to be able to go up against a deeply integrated platform like we have that can do application development, as well as the end-user application capability across the board.

And how is that related back to my sales and service capability? And even the traditional www address. And all of that, we really look at the evolution of we've been calling the marketing cloud. I called the social marketing cloud internally because when I look at the social marketing cloud, what I see is really the opportunity for customers to use products like Radian6 for social monitoring, Heroku for building interactive applications and Facebook, a great example to what we've been talking about this Facebook.com/Disneyland where you can see the deeply integrated interactive application. Or even -- you're going to start to see us deploy new -- I don't want to get ahead of where we're going for Cloudforce New York, where you're going to see us do a lot of announcements in this area, but the ability to take Force.com, the ability to take the Service Cloud, the ability to take the Sales Cloud and the marketing cloud and deploy highly customized applications back out to customers. When we talked and looked at competitive offerings from Oracle, from SAP from the companies that they're buying every other week, they just can't do that. You just don't see that level of integration, the level of scale, the level of throughput. I guess a great stat that we didn't use in our script that we probably could have is we've delivered more than 300 million pages to Zynga's customer service application since we deployed it in April. That's amazing. And you just don't see other companies doing that level of scale in throughput and reliability. And then when we look at a company like Zynga, we see them deploy in other aspects of our technology as well to become a true social enterprise.

But there's nothing else that's going to be an unusual adjustment to revenue, either positive or negative, that I'm aware of right now."

I think that maybe it wasn't the last call but the call before when I was asked to comment on, did I think we were going into a recessionary environment or that we're going into recession? And I know at that time, a lot of forecasters felt that we were, and I felt that we were not. And I still feel that way. I don't feel like we're going into a recession. And I'll tell you that one of the, I think, bifurcations for Salesforce is that the way that businesses are buying maybe a little bit different than the way consumers are buying. We're primarily a B2B company. As you know, we're not to that consumer, and so I don't think that we have really experienced the same level of fluctuations and market demand that maybe B2C companies have. And as a B2B company, we've seen -- I think as you see part of these numbers which are pretty unbelievable, extraordinary performance in the United States, first and foremost. And those numbers have surprised us. It's why revenue guidance has essentially been raised every single quarter this year, and why we are, I think, ahead of everyone coming into next year is primarily the U.S. Now number two, let's not forget Japan, which has not had a great couple of quarters economically since the disaster, but our business in Japan has actually been quite good. Of course, we had an initial dropoff as kind of everybody wasn't sure what was going on in country but as things stabilized, we saw an acceleration of demand for cloud-based solutions. Of course, we offered our product for free to anybody affected by the disaster. We've also picked up additional work with the government and with other related companies. And I hope and that many of you will come to Tokyo because I think that it is Salesforce's second-biggest market in the world, and we just added a second session of my keynote there. I think that you're going to find that to be a very robust buying environment, an opportunity for Salesforce.com on a going-forward basis. When we went to Europe, I think that for sure, you could see it that people in Europe have not been sure what's going on with them because the banking crisis. But at the end of the day, businesses are buying and you can see with our delivery of essentially what I would call strong double-digit, mid-double-digit growth year-over-year, as well as the signing of strong deals in the quarter across the continent. And I even mentioned one of the deals that happened in Eastern Europe with Kaspersky. I view the opportunity in Europe as continuing to be a very good opportunity. It has to get characterized against the United States which is off the hook. When you look at the enterprise software market overall, and Gartner just released all of their numbers for the top, I don't know, 30 or 40 or 50 countries in the world, I actually have them here, you really have to look to the U.S., Japan, the U.K., France, Germany, Canada and Australia, which has been a very strong grower for us as well as really the top 7 domineering countries for enterprise software where we focused our resources. We've obviously experimented in other regions, including India and other places. But at the end of the day, it's those 7 countries that have been really awesome for us. And we have really a strong -- we remain really strong in the 3 most important countries in enterprise software, which remain the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. So I would consider -- I would continue to say when you look at the beginning of this calendar year, people are very worried about the U.S. I'm sure we all had short memories and forget that. But the U.S. has been a great, great grower for Salesforce and really for others this year. Japan, you could not have expected what had happened. And obviously, they have monetary issues that they have to work through in terms of their currency. And Europe obviously, I think psychologically is affected a lot by the banking crisis. But I see companies growing there. I see them adding. And where we saw -- and the reason that we felt good that we were not in a recessionary environment and we would call that out is when we see existing customers cutting, that's or -- existing customers even not adding is really the dominant number that we look at. We go is our add-on business flat? When we don't see customers adding, that's when we know we're in a recessionary environment because they're not growing their sales and customer-facing organizations, which is where everybody wants to invest in today's market. From our perspective, existing customers are adding on, and we're signing new customers. That's exciting from us. And what we have tried to do in the last 6 months is redefine what is the customer front office. I don't think other competitors have done that. We've given that a name with the social enterprise, and we've redefined the front office in many cases as the whole company when you look at Chatter, when you look at the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the platform. And that continues to be why Salesforce is absolutely one of the very fastest-growing enterprise software companies in the world and why we continue to see that next year."

And you've also spoken about today about and reminded us at about the recent acquisitions and other revenues being recognized upfront right now. And you even said that off balance sheet grew faster deferred revenue than on balance sheet. But even 2 years ago, when deferred revenue declined sequentially in the October quarter, accounts receivable actually increased, and that's another indicator of business signings, at least, towards the end of the quarter. But this year, that actually declined too. So I mean, why shouldn't we be a little -- and listen, you're still playing really good numbers, like really good growth numbers. But why shouldn't we be a little bit concerned that perhaps, we're seeing a little bit of slowing business momentum and perhaps, it's even a macro thing and I know Marc said we're not in a recession.

You use that word recognizing revenue upfront. We don't recognize any revenue upfront. So the newer business was like Heroku and Radian6, bill monthly. And so therefore, if they're billing for a very short time period based on usage typically, my point is simply that those businesses don't affect deferred revenue. Not that we recognize revenue upfront, we just simply recognize it each month when it's billed. So I just want to be clear on that. I think clearly, we had a great collections quarter. If you look at our DSOs going from 55 days down to 49 days, that clearly has something to do with the AR balance being what it is. We wanted to make sure that we delivered a strong operating cash flow for the quarter and that's what we did. And like I say, we -- and Marc said earlier, we don't manage deferred revenue. That's why we've continued to highlight as often as we can that there are these fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. And we have -- on a constant currency basis, we're talking about a trend that's gone 33%, 33%, 31%. So that's -- and clearly, we're looking at a strong fourth quarter from our perspective and a strong year next year. That's sort of -- that's how we join the dots."

Those are not things that we are in there trying to dial up with customers. What we're trying to dial up with customers is getting them on board, closing their deals, getting the contract length correct, getting them implemented, making them successful and looking at the long-term monetary value of these customers over time. And as we broke through more than 100,000 core customers in the last quarter, what we really saw was we continue to see very, very strong revenue growth, and we are doing a good job of predicting how our business is performing, and we're going to be able to continue to do that. But we have to be a little bit cautious regards to -- this concept of quarter end deferred is still absolutely -- it's a function of invoicing, and it's also influenced by other factors that Graham has mentioned, including things like invoice timing, invoice duration, new business linearity within the quarter, annual seasonality, these acquisitions, compounding effects of renewals. And those are things that we as a -- certainly, I could speak in terms of the sales organization. We're focused on beating the competition and signing deals. And in terms of those specific metrics, that's not where our eyes are. And so you can see variations in deferred revenue over time, which is why at Dreamforce, Graham called that out in the Analyst Day, and he basically said to be aware of those types of fluctuations in the future."

But it frankly is at a level of sort of noise that it feels kind of weird on a $900 million-plus number to be saying, ""Oh, this quarter, we got -- we gained x million from a little movement in this proportion. And next quarter, we've lost a little because of that proportion changing."" And so we've tended to just try and sensitize people to the fact that there are these fluctuations and just try and communicate that we're not out there trying to influence them.

And as the social enterprise has gotten more and more momentum this year, what we've seen is a gap in our ability to rapidly deploy to our customers certain key aspects regarding the strategic services around the social enterprise. And that gap obviously has been picked up by some of our partners like Accenture, like Deloitte, like CapGemini. But one of the partners that we saw do an outstanding job in a very strategic area, which is mobile applications and in social networks is Model Metrics. We specifically saw that when we signed Toyota. When we saw the ability was how do we rapidly start to build and deploy an application for them. And many of our partners were not able to deliver on the mobility piece we saw Model be able to jump in. We've seen that with other customers. And we said strategically, this is a core part of the services we want to be in. As you know, a very small percentage of Salesforce's total revenue is services. It's not part of our strategy. It's not what we talk about on the call. In fact, we really didn't talk about professional services or consulting at all in this call. We're all about the delivery of more and more customers and more licenses. And when we want to scale an organization, we don't want the scale ProServe. We want to scale our distribution organization. That's our strategy. That said, in this one area, strategic services, we wanted more competency. And we made a strategic decision to do something that we have not had the need to do before, which is to pick up a relatively small professional services organization that's an expert in social, mobile and cloud, Mobile Metrics based in Chicago. And that's the deal that we announced, and I think it makes us a much stronger organization in being able to close and accelerate these social enterprise transactions."

But it's been very exciting for us to see customers make these very big commitments to us over time. And the social enterprise has provided a very, very high level of differentiation. I think when customers go through a demonstration of our technology, as I'm sure you have done and you will see again in New York and Tokyo, it's highly differentiated against the competition, and customers can start where they are. Social enterprise is not something that anybody buys. It's not a product. It's not on our price list. Of course, we have a social enterprise license agreement where they can buy an ELA, where they can take all of our products down. But the reality is most customers come in with a specific business need that we're looking to fulfill and then give them a vision in their mind of where they can go beyond that, and that remains our core strategy. When I work with customers and I help them to define what is their social enterprise for the future, I think a lot about where is their employee social network today? Where is their customer social network today? Where is there product social network? And how can we elevate their consciousness about the ability to deploy more of that? And I think one of the most exciting things in the release of our technology that we just put out is that now inside Chatter is Salesforce is a customer group. So you can create a group not only of employees but you can now create a group and you can bring in employee customers. And that could provide an exponential effect on Chatter. So every Chatter user can go out and create a group and then bring outside customers into that group to collaborate and create a portal and share information within that group. We've just never seen technology like that. Salesforce's technology has primarily been myopic. It's been within the enterprise. Maybe we had a portal for your customers, now we're including the customer into that. That's an exciting next step in enterprise software. I think it's an accelerator for customers on the social enterprise. And we're continuing to see strong deal flow, and we're hoping to see all our sales cycles to be highly normalized in terms of their close rates."

I am absolutely delighted to share these amazing third quarter results, and I'll begin by briefly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the quarter. 
First, revenue of $584 million rose by amazingly 36%. Our annual revenue run rate is now more than $2.3 billion, and it makes us the first enterprise cloud company to reach this milestone. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 was absolutely above our guided range, and we delivered that while hosting a world-class Dreamforce here in San Francisco. But now, it is the largest enterprise software event in the world of more than 46,000 registered attendees. 
Deferred revenues increased by 32% that finished the quarter at $918 million, and third quarter operating cash flow rose by 74% year-over-year to $129 million in the quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents on our balance sheet. 
Now in fiscal year 2012, we became the first enterprise cloud company to surpass a $2 billion annual revenue run rate. And today, I'm delighted to announce that we expect to reach a $3 billion annual revenue run rate during our next fiscal year. That is just spectacular growth. Our financial success in the third quarter was powered by a tremendous response from customers to our new social enterprise strategy. We're now engaged with customers at a higher and more strategic level than ever before, and we've seen more large deals this quarter as a result of that strategy than we have seen in other quarters this year. 
At Dreamforce, we showed how some of the world's best companies such as Burberry, Toyota, Verizon are all transforming into social enterprises. In fact, I'm delighted to share with you one of our largest transactions in the quarter was Verizon, who signed up for 80,000 subscribers of Chatter, 7,000 subscribers of the Sales Cloud and Data.com. Now Verizon's vision for the social enterprise is to build an employee social network connecting retail stores and office-based employees, fueling a new level of global collaboration. And by mobilizing their workforce on iPads, Verizon plans to delight customers in an entirely new way. Today, we're seeing customers buy a broader selection of our services as evidenced by growth of all of our product lines. 
For the Sales Cloud, we signed Maersk, one of the world's largest shipping companies in the world based in Europe. And they swapped out Oracle and selected Salesforce to their entire global sales team. We also won deals against Oracle with Bayer, Eli Lilly, Telstra, Fuji Xerox, Japan Post, Unisys, PTC Parametric and Diebold Securities, all strong wins against Oracle. But in Q3, we also won against Microsoft, closing major deals with Pfizer, AXA, CenturyLink, American Teleconferencing Services, Gates Corp., Banca Civica, Orion, Vbimps [ph] M&G and Tripwire. Other newer add-on transactions for the Sales Cloud from the third quarter included Adobe, Avaya, Sompo and Kaspersky Labs. 
As exciting as our Sales Cloud momentum is, perhaps nowhere is the social enterprise message as critical as it is in customer service. In fact, 5 of our top 10 transactions in the quarter included the Service Cloud. A great example is Electronic Arts, who wanted to create a next-generation customer service center before the release of their highly-anticipated video game, Battlefield 3. Electronic Arts was able to deploy an employee social network with 1,200 agents in just 6 weeks, allowing them to manage dozens of portals serving up over 20 million site page views and handling 150,000 cases in the first week alone, a really great win for Salesforce.com against Oracle. 
Other new or add-on service cloud transactions from the third quarter include Australia Post, Frontier Communications, GE, Unum, Western Digital, Investec Asset Management and KBDI. Chatter, which is at the heart of our social enterprise strategy, continued to drive our success in the third quarter. Another great example is Avaya, who plans to deploy more than 17,000 subscribers of Chatter and the Sales Cloud. Avaya will be rolling out an employee social network to improve collaboration and boost productivity. They also plan to replace their legacy content management systems with a next-generation social portal built on our application development and deployment platform, Force.com. And GE signed up for 20,000 subscribers of Chatter. In just 3 weeks, GE created a private customer social network called GE Edge, where their customers can collaborate with peers and get access to experts in research. 
Other Chatter wins in the quarter included Toyota with 10,000 subscribers of Chatter and PECO with 5,000 subscribers of Chatter. And while Chatter helps companies collaborate internally on private social networks, Radian6 is helping companies to listen and engage with customers on public social networks, redefining what it means to do social monitoring. We're thrilled with the success that Radian6 has seen with major customers around the world. Wins from the quarter included Condé Nast, Delta Airlines, LinkedIn, Nestlé, New York Times and Warner Brothers. 
Force.com achieved some truly impressive milestones in the quarter, delivering triple-digit growth year-over-year. Today, nearly 450,000 developers have built and deployed more than 260,000 cloud apps on Force.com, and usage of the platform continues to increase. Force.com delivered 40 billion transactions, up 10% quarter-over-quarter and 62% from a year ago. Phenomenal. That's more than 600 million transactions on Force.com every business day. 
One of the great Force.com wins for the quarter is with USAA. They are standardizing on Force.com to power a range of employee-facing social apps such as property management, claim tracking, recruiting and more.  Other new or add-on Force.com transactions from the quarter include Amgen, Japan Post, Toyota, City of New York and Yahoo!. In addition, new ISVs like Concur, Infor, Kenandy and Workday join our developer community to deliver next-generation apps on Force.com. And the AppExchange crossed a new milestone with more than 1 million apps installed by our customers worldwide, another amazing milestone that was crossed during the quarter. 
Over the last year, we extended our net platform strategy beyond Force.com with Database.com and Heroku and Data.com, giving developers solutions to replace date legacy tools. This quarter, Database.com became generally available, and Heroku added support for 5 additional languages, including Java. 
Heroku also became the first, and to date, the only cloud platform built right in the Facebook's development center. Right from within Facebook, you can start building Heroku applications in Java, in Python, in Ruby, in Closure or the language of your choice. Within 24 hours of the announcement at Facebook's F8 Conference, Facebook developers had built more than 30,000 new apps on Heroku. Phenomenal. 
Recently, we announced some exciting acquisitions and new products. In the third quarter, you saw us acquire Assistly, a pioneer in the world of customer service and help desk applications for small businesses. We also launched the public beta of Do.com, a social project management system for small businesses. And early this week, we announced our intent to acquire Model Metrics, which is expected to close during the fiscal quarter. Model Metrics is a strategic services company that is helping to empower our global partner ecosystem with their outstanding mobile and social capabilities. You've seen so many of our top customers go to Model Metrics to build custom mobile and social application. We're delighted to welcome them to the Salesforce.com family. 
I want to remind all of you that on November 30, we're hosting Cloudforce New York City at the Javits Convention Center. We expect more than 10,000 people to register to attend this event, making it the largest cloud computing event held on the East Coast and our largest event ever in New York City. If you have not yet registered, please contact David Havlek, and we'd love to see you there at Cloudforce New York on November 30. Also on December 14 and 15, we're taking the Cloudforce roadshow to Tokyo, Japan, where we will continue to share our vision for the social enterprise, with an additional 10,000 registered attendees and events with Neil Young and will.i.am. We're looking forward to see you at Cloudforce Tokyo on December 14 and 15. 
With that, I'll turn this over to Graham to discuss the financial details of the third quarter."
122917,142590249,193936,"Salesforce.com, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2011",2011-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q3 was another great quarter. We executed well to deliver strong revenue growth, outstanding cash flow and earnings above guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $584 million, an increase of just over 36% year-over-year. Top line revenue was s",1891,"Thanks, Marc. Q3 was another great quarter. We executed well to deliver strong revenue growth, outstanding cash flow and earnings above guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $584 million, an increase of just over 36% year-over-year. Top line revenue was strong for 3 primary reasons: First, as Marc indicated, Q3 was another strong new business quarter and exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter; second, attrition on a dollar basis declined for the ninth consecutive quarter and remains in the mid-teens percentage range; and third, we continue to benefit from a weaker dollar, which in Q3, provided tailwind of approximately $9 million. Constant currency revenue growth was 34%. 
In terms of our third quarter year-over-year revenue growth by geography, revenue in the Americas grew 36% to $397 million. In Europe, Q3 revenue was $104 million, that's up 36% in dollars and 29% in constant currency, and in Asia, Q3 revenue rose roughly 39% in dollars and 31% in constant currency to $83 million. Our Japan business continued on its recovery and posted strong new business growth in the third quarter. 
Turning now to revenue mix. Q3 revenue was roughly 94% subscription and support and 6% professional services. I mentioned on our last call and at our Dreamforce analyst session that we could see our business mix show a slight shift toward professional services over the next few quarters as we invest in additional consulting skills to accelerate shift to the social enterprise. The acquisition of Model Metrics supports this acceleration by bringing on a team of high skilled, mobile and social cloud designers to work on social enterprise projects. 
Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 82%, essentially unchanged from Q2 and from the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP subscription and support gross margins were flat sequentially at 86% but down a couple of points from last year. The small decline was primarily the result of data center capacity expansion. 
Non-GAAP professional services gross margins finished at 13%. While margins in this business continue to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, the adoption of EITF 08-01 has led to an overall improvement this year. 
Moving on to operating expenses. Total non-GAAP operating expenses represented 71% of revenue in Q3, up 4 percentage points from last year. The increase was the result of 2 principal factors: First, over the past 12 months, we've acquired several businesses, notably Heroku, Radian6, and most recently, Assistly, which have added nearly 500 people to our company. We're continuing to invest aggressively in those businesses. 
And second, over the same period, we added approximately 1,700 people through organic hiring, with 550 of them being added in Q3 alone. As a result of organic hiring and acquisitions, we added 600 people in Q3 to bring total Q3 ending headcount to nearly 7,000, an increase of 46% over last year. Our organic hiring efforts continue to focus on adding sales and engineering capacity, which we believe is critical to future growth. We expect Q4 to be another record quarter for organic hiring as we look to continue our strong momentum into fiscal 2013. 
Within specific expense categories, sales and marketing continues to be our largest operating expense at roughly 47% of revenue. This is up about 3 points from last year. As you know, increasing sales capacity is one of our most important goals, so I'd like to take a moment to review its financial impact on our operating model. 
While a salesperson typically takes 2 to 3 quarters to start closing new business, on average, it takes 6 to 9 quarters before a salesperson and his or her supporting team reaches breakeven on a P&L basis. This lag between investment and profitability occurs for 2 main reasons: First, ratable revenue recognition means revenue from new business ramp slowly; and second, while we capitalize and then amortize commission expense for the salesperson against the related contract term, all of the sales engineering and management costs, including their commissions and bonuses, are recognized as period expenses. As long as the trend for overall sales productivity is flat or increasing, we're going to continue to hire aggressively. 
Marketing expenses in Q3 also rose significantly as we continue to evangelize our cloud computing and social enterprise messages. In the third quarter, we hosted Dreamforce at a net cost of roughly $0.05 per share. And in addition, we hosted large Cloudforce events in both London and Munich. 
Our sales and marketing remain our largest expense line item. R&D was our fastest-growing expense category in Q3, increasing 47% from a year ago. With a broadening product portfolio and our goal to dominate enterprise cloud computing, ongoing investment in R&D is critical. As a result, R&D now represents 11% of revenue compared with 10% a year ago. 
G&A was our slowest growing expense category. As a percent of revenue, G&A expense was flat year-over-year at 13%. As a result of higher operating expenses, our non-GAAP operating margin was 11%, up slightly from Q2 but down 4 points from last year. Due to the lower interest rate environment and an increase in the number of higher-yielding investments that have come to maturity over the past few quarters, other income and expense, or OIE, was $4 million in the third quarter, that's down from roughly $9 million in Q3 last year. Similarly, looking to FY '13, we expect OIE to be lower than in FY '12. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.34 compared with $0.32 in Q3 last year. EPS was higher than we guided for 2 main reasons: First, our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 29%, lower than our guided rate of 33%. This was the result of favorable adjustments driven by stock option exercises and additional tax benefits related to recent acquisitions. The lower tax rate contributed about $0.02 to Q3 non-GAAP EPS. And second, the lower average share price in the quarter drove a smaller dilutive effect from our convertible note this quarter. This load or average share count contributed about $0.01 to non-GAAP EPS. We currently expect our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to roughly 32%. 
Looking to FY 13, we currently estimate that our effective tax rate will increase to approximately 40%. This high tax rate is driven by 2 main factors: First, we will no longer benefit from a onetime $40 million foreign tax deduction in the U.S. for Canadian taxes. This Canadian tax payment is a onetime event which arose as a result of the Radian6 transaction. The actual tax payment of $40 million in Canada is scheduled for Q1 next year. And I just want to point out clearly, that will have an impact on our first quarter operating cash flow. And second, the federal R&D tax credit will expire at the end of calendar 2011. We do not anticipate the legislation being renewed or we cannot, I should say, anticipate being -- the legislation being renewed in our forecast effective tax rate. Obviously, we hope the Congress will eventually extend these important tax incentives. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $129 million during the quarter, up 74% from last year. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was up approximately 20% over the first 9 months last year. We had a strong collections quarter, and our Q3 DSO was 49 days, down from 55 days a year ago. For the full year, we expect operating cash flow in the mid-teens percentage range. This implies slower growth in Q4 than Q3, primarily as a result of the significant hiring ramp that we're seeing in the second half. 
For CapEx, we finished the quarter at roughly $35 million. As we discussed on the last call, capital spending was driven by 3 factors: First, roughly half of all CapEx this year is a result of leasehold improvements. With year-over-year employee growth of 46%, we expect to continue significant spending in this area. Second, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in data center capacity. As we build out new infrastructure with a wholesale data center model, we incur CapEx relating to power cages and ranking. And then last, capitalized software for service delivery and internal IT projects makes up the balance. This can vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing and scale of deployments. We expect CapEx in Q4 to be similar to the Q2 levels. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow minus CapEx, was approximately $94 million in Q3. That's up 77% from last year. For the 9 months year-to-date, we've generated $244 million in free cash flow. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities ended the quarter at just under $1.3 billion. Cash has remained relatively flat year-over-year due to acquisitions over the previous 12 months, which represent just over $600 million in cash outflows. Deferred revenue was $918 million at quarter end, that's up 32% from last year. Adjusting for an approximate $5 million FX tailwind, constant currency growth for deferred revenue was 31%. This compares with constant currency growth rates of 33% in both Q1 and Q2. 
I'd like to remind people the quarter end deferred revenue was a function of invoicing and is influenced by several factors, including invoice timing, invoice duration, new business linearity within the quarter, annual seasonality and the compounding effects of renewals. And as we discussed at the Dreamforce analyst session, some of our recent acquisitions such as Heroku and Radian6 bill monthly and don't contribute significantly to the deferred revenue balance at all. Although for all the reasons I just described, deferred revenue is a tough number to predict. We expect Q4 revenue to grow at approximately 30%.
Turning to our outlook. We feel good about our compelling social enterprise vision, have great market position and a strong pipeline entering Q4. There are 2 things to note about this guidance I'm going to give you: First, we're on track to transition Radian6 revenue recognition from a cash basis to an invoice basis in the fourth quarter. This will add around $5 million of extra revenue in the fourth quarter as we go through that transition. And we discussed this back in May, actually when we announced the acquisition. And then second, we are assuming that the acquisition of Model Metrics will close in December in our guidance.
After taking these factors into account, we now project Q4 revenues to be in the range of $620 million to $624 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.39 to $0.40. For full year 2012, we estimate revenue in the range of $2.255 billion to $2.259 billion, representing growth of approximately 36%. 
Looking forward to fiscal 2013, we currently anticipate revenue to be in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.92 billion. Again, this assumes we close the acquisition of Model Metrics in Q4. The midpoint of this guidance range implies just over -- about 28.5% revenue growth for FY '13. We'll provide you with further details about FY '13 operating model on our fourth quarter call in February. 
Before we turn the call over to the operator for questions, I also want to encourage all of you to join us in New York on November 30 for what is shaping up to be an amazing Cloudforce event.

I think with -- first of all, just to put this in perspective, I think we've raised our guidance for Q4. We've obviously initiated, I think, pretty exciting guidance for next year. If you look at the trend of constant currency deferred revenue growth, Q1 is 33%; Q2, 33%; Q3 was 31%. That's why we have avoided, I think, talking about your calculation of billings. I think your number is a lot more volatile. We tend to -- I think we -- the deferred revenue is a number that goes on our balance sheet. And we feel clearly that it's subject to this volatility for all those reasons that I listed around invoice duration and so on. And then the last thing I'd remind you, Kash, is that some of these newer business like Radian6 and Heroku, they're not really contributing to deferred revenue balance. They contribute to the revenue number, but they don't contribute to the deferred revenue number in any significant way. So we did highlight that at our analyst session at Dreamforce. There's something to -- as a potential shift in how that billings calculation that you do may work. So we feel we couldn't be happier with where our business is and where we're going in Q4 next year, so that's sort of our commentary."

But at the end of the day, our best predictor of where our revenue is going is our guidance. And when we get down to the deferred revenue, it's not a metric that we manage internally. It's really only a metric that we report at the end of the quarter.

And if you go back to Dreamforce 2008, you'll remember I was on stage with Sheryl Sandberg and doing demonstrations of Facebook tightly integrated with Salesforce.com. And that folded to 2009 which is when we really started to announce Chatter, 2010 where we had rolled out Chatter as kind of the foundation of the social enterprise. And now in 2011, of course, we called basically Dreamforce welcome to the social enterprise, and we are working with literally thousands of our customers around the world that are defining what social enterprise means to them. When we look at social enterprise, we see what is the customer social profile, what does it look like from a collaboration platform, how are they building and deploying the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, custom applications, social applications -- which is kind of what we see with Heroku, social monitoring like with Radian6. And then we start to build product social networks. This week, I was in Las Vegas on Monday with our customer Toyota rolling out to all of their dealers and distributors our vision for Toyota Friend and demonstrating Toyota Friend to them on the iPad, and it was an amazing experience. But when we look at the customers that we're closing in this quarter and the pipelines that we have, we have a lot of social enterprise transformations underway because it has become the primary way that we're selling. I would say that we've evolved from being a Sales Force Automation company and then adding the platform in to be in a -- what I would call an SFA platform or even a CRM platform. Then we really introduced the Service Cloud when we became a true CRM platform, the sales, service. Of course, we've added in Radian6. We see the emergence of the marketing cloud with Heroku, with these social marketing applications, with Radian6 and really with the thousands of websites that we run all -- for our customers all over the world. And then you can really start to see that when you combine all of that with Chatter and other core technologies that we've deployed, we really see the social enterprise as our primary value proposition to the customers. And I would suggest if you talk to our customers or talk to recent customers that we've signed, a lot of the reasons that we're able to close deals was because we are substantially ahead of the competition and not only being able to define, articulate but also build and deploy for a customer social enterprise applications, and it's been -- it was a fantastic dream for us. I expect the same at Cloudforce at New York and Tokyo. And I expect that our pipelines will continue to be full of social enterprise capabilities. And specifically to your point on speed. I believe that our industry is going faster than ever before. And that we're going to see this uptake, as already evidenced by the deal flow, and happening faster than ever before because customers need new solutions that are trying to redefine themselves and the opportunity is right now. It's not 2 or 3 years from now. This is about being aware of what's going in the market today and how to deliver that."

And when you look at some of these large transactions that we closed in the quarter, like Verizon, Electronic Arts or GE, Maersk USA, some of the big premiere transactions, I think that what you see is that they really all signed with us because we're able to deliver to them the social platform, and that other customer other companies aren't ready to deliver that to them today."

It's a deeply integrated part of the platform. And the core parts of that offering like, for example, knowledge management or the ability to do case management. That's an application that we deliver to customers. It's also part of our platform that we deliver to developers. It's also deeply integrated into our Sales Cloud and into our marketing cloud. And that's really one of the strengths of Salesforce is that we haven't acquired hodgepodge, all these other little companies in every little thing like Oracle has. We've been delivering really from the ground up, and where we -- when we have a technology vacuum like we did a few years ago, in knowledge management, we acquired a company called InStranet, but that was an on-premise technology company that then we rewrote deeply into our platform, into the multi-tenet architecture and the shared system, make it available through our API. And the great evidence of that is the win this quarter with Electronic Arts. As you know, Electronic Arts and Battlefield 3 is probably the biggest highest volume customer service release of the quarter for any vendor. And it was a replacement of competitive technology. And I think that when you look at that, it's evidenced that we have what it takes to win those transactions, to go head-to-head against Oracle and to beat them consistently. And that's why they continue to draw straws, buy different companies, but nothing is going to be able to go up against a deeply integrated platform like we have that can do application development, as well as the end-user application capability across the board.

And how is that related back to my sales and service capability? And even the traditional www address. And all of that, we really look at the evolution of we've been calling the marketing cloud. I called the social marketing cloud internally because when I look at the social marketing cloud, what I see is really the opportunity for customers to use products like Radian6 for social monitoring, Heroku for building interactive applications. On Facebook, a great example to what we've been talking about is Facebook.com/Disneyland where you can see the deeply integrated interactive application. Or even -- you're going to start to see us deploy new -- I don't want to get ahead of where we're going for Cloudforce New York, where you're going to see us do a lot of announcements in this area, but the ability to take Force.com, the ability to take the Service Cloud, the ability to take the Sales Cloud and the marketing cloud and deploy highly customized applications back out to customers. When we talked and look at competitive offerings from Oracle, from SAP from the companies that they're buying every other week, they just can't do that. You just don't see that level of integration, the level of scale, the level of throughput. I guess a great stat that we didn't use in our script that we probably could have is we've delivered more than 300 million pages to Zynga's customer service application since we deployed it in April. That's amazing. And you just don't see other companies doing that level of scale in throughput and reliability. And then when we look at a company like Zynga, we see them deploy in other aspects of our technology as well to become a true social enterprise. All of that comes back to the marketing cloud, the Service Cloud, the Sales Cloud as an integrated strategy for delivering the customer social enterprise."

It's important for us to grow distribution capacity, to invest in it because without an army, you're not going to win a war in enterprise software, and a lot of this is hand-to-hand battle.

And I know at that time, a lot of forecasters felt that we were, and I felt that we were not. And I still feel that way. I don't feel like we're going into a recession. And I'll tell you that one of the, I think, bifurcations for Salesforce is that the way that businesses are buying maybe a little bit different than the way consumers are buying. We're primarily a B2B company. As you know, we're not selling to that consumer, and so I don't think that we have really experienced the same level of fluctuations in market demand that maybe B2C companies have. And as a B2B company, we've seen -- I think as you see by these numbers which are pretty unbelievable, extraordinary performance in the United States, first and foremost. And those numbers have surprised us. It's why revenue guidance has essentially been raised every single quarter this year, and why we are, I think, ahead of everyone coming into next year is primarily the U.S. Now number two, let's not forget Japan, which has not had a great couple of quarters economically since the disaster, but our business in Japan has actually been quite good. Of course, we had an initial dropoff as kind of everybody wasn't sure what was going on in country but as things stabilized, we saw an acceleration of demand for cloud-based solutions. Of course, we offered our product for free to anybody affected by the disaster. We've also picked up additional work with the government and with other related companies. And I hope and that many of you will come to Tokyo because I think that it is Salesforce's second-biggest market in the world, and we just added a second session of my keynote there. I think that you're going to find that to be a very robust buying environment, an opportunity for Salesforce.com on a going-forward basis. When we went to Europe, I think that for sure, you could see it that people in Europe have not been sure what's going on with them because the banking crisis. But at the end of the day, businesses are buying and you can see with our delivery of essentially what I would call strong double-digit, mid-double-digit growth year-over-year, as well as the signing of strong deals in the quarter across the continent. And I even mentioned one of the deals that happened in Eastern Europe with Kaspersky. I view the opportunity in Europe as continuing to be a very good opportunity. It has to get characterized against the United States which is off the hook. When you look at the enterprise software market overall, and Gartner just released all of their numbers for the top, I don't know, 30 or 40 or 50 countries in the world, I actually have them here, you really have to look to the U.S., Japan, the U.K., France, Germany, Canada and Australia, which has been a very strong grower for us as well, as really the top 7 domineering countries for enterprise software where we focused our resources. We've obviously experimented in other regions, including India and other places. But at the end of the day, it's those 7 countries that have been really awesome for us. And we have really a strong -- we remain really strong in the 3 most important countries in enterprise software, which remain the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. So I would consider -- I would continue to say when you look at the beginning of this calendar year, people are very worried about the U.S. I'm sure we all had short memories and forget that. But the U.S. has been a great, great grower for Salesforce and really for others this year. Japan, you could not have expected what had happened. And obviously, they have monetary issues that they have to work through in terms of their currency. And Europe obviously, I think psychologically is affected a lot by the banking crisis. But I see companies growing there. I see them adding. And where we saw -- and the reason that we felt good that we were not in a recessionary environment and we would call that out is when we see existing customers cutting, that's or -- existing customers even not adding is really the dominant number that we look at. We go is our add-on business flat? When we don't see customers adding, that's when we know we're in a recessionary environment because they're not growing their sales and customer-facing organizations, which is where everybody wants to invest in today's market. From our perspective, existing customers are adding on, and we're signing new customers. That's exciting from us. And what we have tried to do in the last 6 months is redefine what is the customer front office. I don't think other competitors have done that. We've given that a name with the social enterprise, and we've redefined the front office in many cases as the whole company when you look at Chatter, when you look at the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the platform. And that continues to be why Salesforce is absolutely one of the very fastest-growing enterprise software companies in the world and why we continue to see that next year."

In the past, you've talked to us about how deferred revenue can bounce around, some of it makes sense. And you've also spoken about today about and reminded us at about the recent acquisitions and how the revenues being recognized upfront right now. And you even said that off balance sheet grew faster deferred revenue than on balance sheet. But even 2 years ago, when deferred revenue declined sequentially in the October quarter, accounts receivable actually increased, and that's another indicator of business signings, at least, towards the end of the quarter. But this year, that actually declined too. So I mean, why shouldn't we be a little -- and listen, you're still putting up really good numbers, like really good growth numbers. But why shouldn't we be a little bit concerned that perhaps, we're seeing a little bit of slowing business momentum and perhaps, it's even a macro thing and I know Marc said we're not in a recession. We're not going to go into one. You don't think we are, but there are signs in these results that make us -- make it look that way a little bit."

You use that word recognizing revenue upfront. We don't recognize any revenue upfront. So the newer business was like Heroku and Radian6, bill monthly. And so therefore, if they're billing for a very short time period based on usage typically, my point is simply that those businesses don't affect deferred revenue. Not that we recognize revenue upfront, we just simply recognize it each month when it's billed. So I just want to be clear on that. I think clearly, we had a great collections quarter. If you look at our DSOs going from 55 days down to 49 days, that clearly has something to do with the AR balance being what it is. We wanted to make sure that we delivered a strong operating cash flow for the quarter and that's what we did. And like I say, we -- and Marc said earlier, we don't manage deferred revenue. That's why we've continued to highlight as often as we can that there are these fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. And we have -- on a constant currency basis, we're talking about a trend that's gone 33%, 33%, 31%. So that's -- and clearly, we're looking at a strong fourth quarter from our perspective and a strong year next year. That's sort of -- that's how we join the dots."

Those are not things that we are in there trying to dial up with customers. What we're trying to dial up with customers is getting them on board, closing their deals, getting the contract length correct, getting them implemented, making them successful and looking at the long-term monetary value of these customers over time. And as we broke through more than 100,000 core customers in the last quarter, what we really saw was we continue to see very, very strong revenue growth, and we are doing a good job of predicting how our business is performing, and we're going to be able to continue to do that. But we have to be a little bit cautious regards to -- this concept of quarter end deferred is still absolutely -- it's a function of invoicing, and it's also influenced by other factors that Graham has mentioned, including things like invoice timing, invoice duration, new business linearity within the quarter, annual seasonality, these acquisitions, compounding effects of renewals. And those are things that we as a -- certainly, I could speak in terms of the sales organization. We're focused on beating the competition and signing deals. And in terms of those specific metrics, that's not where our eyes are. And so you can see variations in deferred revenue over time, which is why at Dreamforce, Graham called that out in the Analyst Day, and he basically said to be aware of those types of fluctuations in the future."

Clearly, we've talked in the past about roughly 2/3 of our invoicing being on an annual basis and roughly 1/4 of our invoicing being quarterly and the rest being semi-annual and monthly. And I again, on previous calls, said that those proportions which do affect deferred revenue move around from quarter-to-quarter. But it frankly is at a level of sort of noise that it feels kind of weird on a $900 million-plus number to be saying, ""Oh, this quarter, we got -- we gained x million from a little movement in this proportion. And next quarter, we've lost a little because of that proportion changing."" And so we've tended to just try and sensitize people to the fact that there are these fluctuations and just try and communicate that we're not out there trying to influence them. And we roll with them each quarter rather than trying to get people to wound up in the minutia of that balance sheet number."

Cloud computing, their need to move off of these traditional enterprise, software and hardware systems that they've had for a couple of decades. And when you look at the big wins this quarter, you see that with Maersk, with Electronic Arts, with Verizon and others, they're all like, ""Let's get into the cloud."" And that's what's exciting to us. And as a proof point to that, you saw at Dreamforce the energy and the excitement, the scale. You're going to see that again in New York.

And as the social enterprise has gotten more and more momentum this year, what we've seen is a gap in our ability to rapidly deploy to our customers certain key aspects regarding the strategic services around the social enterprise. And that gap obviously has been picked up by some of our partners like Accenture, like Deloitte, like CapGemini. But one of the partners that we saw do an outstanding job in a very strategic area, which is mobile applications and in social networks is Model Metrics. We specifically saw that when we signed Toyota. When we saw the ability was how do we rapidly start to build and deploy an application for them. And many of our partners were not able to deliver on the mobility piece we saw Model be able to jump in. We've seen that with other customers. And we said strategically, this is a core part of the services we want to be in. As you know, a very small percentage of Salesforce's total revenue is services. It's not part of our strategy. It's not what we talk about on the call. In fact, we really didn't talk about professional services or consulting at all on this call. We're all about the delivery of more and more customers and more licenses. And when we want to scale an organization, we don't want to scale ProServe. We want to scale our distribution organization. That's our strategy. That said, in this one area, strategic services, we wanted more competency. And we made a strategic decision to do something that we have not had the need to do before, which is to pick up a relatively small professional services organization that's an expert in social, mobile and cloud, Model Metrics based in Chicago. And that's the deal that we announced, and I think it makes us a much stronger organization in being able to close and accelerate these social enterprise transactions."

We've seen transactions closed in this quarter that get paid out for us in quarters to come. I'm not going to go into that detail. But it's been very exciting for us to see customers make these very big commitments to us over time. And the social enterprise has provided a very, very high level of differentiation. I think when customers go through a demonstration of our technology, as I'm sure you have done and you will see again in New York and Tokyo, it's highly differentiated against the competition, and customers can start where they are. Social enterprise is not something that anybody buys. It's not a product. It's not on our price list. Of course, we have a social enterprise license agreement where they can buy an ELA, where they can take all of our products down. But the reality is most customers come in with a specific business need that we're looking to fulfill and then give them a vision in their mind of where they can go beyond that, and that remains our core strategy. When I work with customers and I help them to define what is their social enterprise for the future, I think a lot about where is their employee social network today? Where is their customer social network today? Where is there product social network? And how can we elevate their consciousness about the ability to deploy more of that? And I think one of the most exciting things in the release of our technology that we just put out is that now inside Chatter is Salesforce's customer group. So you can create a group not only of employees, but you can now create a group and you can bring in employee customers. And that could provide an exponential effect on Chatter. So every Chatter user can go out and create a group and then bring outside customers into that group to collaborate and create a portal and share information within that group. We've just never seen technology like that. Salesforce's technology has primarily been myopic. It's been within the enterprise. Maybe we had a portal for your customers, now we're including the customer into that. That's an exciting next step in enterprise software. I think it's an accelerator for customers on the social enterprise. And we're continuing to see strong deal flow, and we're hoping to see all our sales cycles to be highly normalized in terms of their close rates."
