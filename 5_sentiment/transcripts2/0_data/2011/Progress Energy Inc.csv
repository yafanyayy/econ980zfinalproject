Our quarter and our 2010 full year results were quite good, so let's dive right in. 
As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide highlights for the quarter and full year financial results. And looking at the filing scheduled for our recently announced merger with Duke Energy, an update on our Crystal River unit three outage and comments on our key focus areas for 2011. Then Mark Mulhern will provide more detail on the numbers behind our financial results.
Let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the fourth quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $133 million, compared to $142 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per-share basis, we're down $0.05 from the fourth quarter 2009, principally due to higher O&M and tax expenses. 
For the full year 2010, ongoing earnings were $889 million, compared to $846 million for the same period a year ago. On a per-share basis, we're up $0.03 due to favorable weather during the year, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. Our ongoing earnings of $3.06 exceeded the high end of our 2010 guidance range.
The economy in our service area continued to demonstrate modest recovery and obviously the weather was a significant contributor to the year's results. Record-cold weather in Florida followed by extreme heat last summer in all three states had a positive impact of $0.44 per share on a year-over-year basis. 
Today, we're providing our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. Now really whether it was a significant contributor last year. On a weather-normalized basis for our 2011 estimates, the higher use of the customer removal amortization in Florida and lower O&M expenses in the Carolinas will offset the weather gains of last year. Mark will discuss the 2011 earnings drivers a little bit later.
As shown on Slide 5, we've been able to share earnings growth over a very difficult economic times or region and nation. This consistency is the product of the financial and operational discipline we're focused on everyday. As you know, on January 10, we announced the strategic merger with Duke Energy. Information about this merger can be found on the Progress and Duke websites, as well as through the many filings we've made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will incorporate a scorecard to help you track where we are in a multistep-approval process required for the merger. Slide 6 shows an example of the scorecard, and this should make it easy for you to see our progress at any point as we move forward with filings and approvals. 
Now if you turn to Slide 7. It provides an update on the outage in our Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. As most of you know, concrete delamination or cracking occurred in that section of the containment building in late 2009 when we created an opening to replace the steam generators. Last fall, we completed the final concrete placements to repair the containment building. 
Following concrete curing, we began a systematic process of re-tensioning the steel tendons that's encircling the building. We've now completed more than half of that retention. We expect to complete re-tensioning in March and return the unit to service after post-repair testing and start-up activities in April. 
Nuclear safety remains our top priority, and our plans and actions will continue to reflect this commitment. A number of factors affecting return to service date, including regulatory reviews by NRC and other agencies, emergent work, final engineering designs, testing, weather and other development. 
Slide 7 summarizes the cost of the outage through end of year 2010 for both the repair and the replacement power. Through December, the total for repair costs was about $150 million, and for replacement power, about $288 million. Partially offsetting these expenditures are about $181 million in proceeds from NEIL, the mutual insurance company created by the nuclear utilities. In addition, we have booked receivables for another $101 million expected to be received from NEIL.
Now we are currently recovering a portion of the replacement of power costs not covered by insurance. The Florida PSC will hold a separate proceeding later this year to evaluate the engineering decisions and repair costs associated with returning the unit to service. 
As I've noted before on these calls, we've been very transparent with the NRC, state regulators, the industry and other stakeholders throughout this process, and we'll continue to keep these groups informed. Our primary focus is on returning this important asset to safe, reliable operation for many years to come.
Next, please turn to Slide 8, which highlights four key focus areas for our company in 2011. These areas are in addition to our daily efforts to excel in the fundamentals, which include safety, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. We're keeping our sights on our core responsibilities, even as we move forward with merger-approval activities. 
The first focus areas to build on the initiatives we began last year to improve the performance of our nuclear fleet. We are implementing a comprehensive plan to return our fleets to a consistently high level of performance in safety, reliability and value year after year. 
The second focus is to accelerate our efforts on what we call continuous business excellence. This is a company-wide initiative we started a couple of years ago to take a closer look at how we do our work so we can improve efficiency and service, while achieving sustainable cost savings.
The third area is to continue executing our balanced solutions. We're optimizing a diverse portfolio of investments and initiatives that help us prepare for future customer needs and meet emerging regulatory requirements. This balanced approach includes everything from fleet modernization in the Smart Grid to energy efficiency programs in alternative energy projects. 
The final focus area for 2011 involves getting ready for the Duke-Progress merger. We're getting organized the planning integration of the two companies and secure timely merger approvals. We're intent on positioning the combined company for success. With that, I'll ask Mark Mulhern, our CFO, to provide more details on our financials."
258891,117980493,104604,"Progress Energy Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2011",2011-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'm going to cover the topics on Slide 9, so let's begin. Slide 10 shows our fourth quarter and full year ongoing earnings. For the fourth quarter 2010, we reported $0.45 versus $0.50 last year, but the Carolinas was u",1413,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'm going to cover the topics on Slide 9, so let's begin. 
Slide 10 shows our fourth quarter and full year ongoing earnings. For the fourth quarter 2010, we reported $0.45 versus $0.50 last year, but the Carolinas was up $0.04, Florida was down $0.11 and Corporate and Other was $0.02 favorable. 
In Florida, the fourth quarter decline was driven primarily by the pension deferral in 2009 that was expensed in 2010 and also by a decline in AFUDC earnings and OPEB charge. For the full year, we reported $3.06 versus $3.03 last year. Carolinas was up $0.20 over 2009, Florida was down $0.06 and the Corporate and Other was $0.11 unfavorable.
So I'll shift to Slide 11, which is our waterfall chart, illustrates the positive and negative drivers for the fourth quarter. Key variants here were rather, clauses and other margins, which were offset by higher O&M and income tax items. Due to favorable weather in Florida, we did not amortize any additional cost or removal obligation in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 12 shows the waterfall chart for the full year 2010. Weather, a $0.44, was the key positive driver, and under our Florida regulatory settlement, we were allowed to amortize up to $150 million of the cost removal obligation in 2010. We only utilized $60 million or $0.11, and the unused $90 million carries over into 2011.
As you can see, several items offset the unusually favorable weather: O&M, interest expense, share dilution and other income tax items. I will address the quarter and the full year unfavorable O&M variances in just a few moments.
On Slide 13, we provided detail on the 2010 retail sales by customer class, so that numbers on the bottom of the slide show that our weather-adjusted sales growth exceeded forecasted both utilities. Carolinas had an increase of 2% versus our forecast of 0.6%, primarily due to a stronger industrial recovery in 2010 that we had forecasted. Meanwhile, Florida had a decline of 1.8% versus a negative 2.2% forecast due to the continued weak economy, which we believe has begun to finally turn around.
Now if you turn to Slide 14, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low-usage accounts, Florida continues to show a steady uptick in customer growth. In fact, Florida had a net addition of 4,000 customers for the full year 2010, which was the first time we've seen positive customer growth in Florida since 2007. Carolinas added 10,000 new customers.
On Slide 15, we provided some transparency around the O&M variance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2010. For the full year, the majority of the increase to earn $0.19 was driven by three schedule of nuclear refueling and maintenance outages in 2010 compared to two in 2009, and other factors included extended outages and more emergent work, primarily on our Robinson Nuclear Plant. In addition, we had $0.09 of nonrecurring prior year benefits due to a pension deferral in Florida and a change in vacation benefits policy. So it's important to note that, excluding the above two items, the balance of our O&M costs increased approximately 1% over 2009.
Slide 16 gives you some more detail behind our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance by utility. Carolinas slightly decline due to normal weather and then partially offset by lower O&M. Lowered on the other hand is able to more than offset normal weather with higher cost of removal amortization and higher rate base. Corporate and Other is favorable primarily due to lower interest expense. 
So Slide 17 is a waterfall illustrating our 2011 ongoing EPS drivers. Largest drivers, the 2010 weather-normalization adjustment of $0.54. We expect to offset this with $0.36 of additional cost to removal amortization in Florida and $0.25 of improved O&M costs. 
The improved O&M costs are primarily driven by fewer nuclear outages in 2011. So three planned refueling outages and the unplanned outages at Robinson drove 2010's higher O&M spending. There's only one planned refueling outage in 2011. The other primary drivers are favorable clauses and other margin and growth in usage, offset by a little higher D&A and lower wholesale revenues primarily in Florida. 
So I just like to take a moment to highlight the retail sales growth in usage assumptions in our 2011 guidance. We project retail sales growth in 2011 versus 2010 in the Carolinas of 0.8%, and in Florida, a positive 0.7%. While that's a lower growth rate in the Carolinas from 2010, it reflects a more normal run rate trend. And in Florida, we project a return to positive sales growth, reflecting an improvement in the Florida economy. 
I'd also like to just make a comment about our wholesale revenues, and these are actually shown on Slide 18.  As I mentioned a moment ago, Florida wholesale revenues are expected to decline in 2011 due to contract explorations. However, this trend should reverse into to 2012 due to amended contracts. 
Carolinas' wholesale revenues are fairly steady in 2011 but will begin increasing materially in 2012 and '13 due to wholesale contract extensions and expansions with city of Fayetteville and the NCEMC. You can find additional detail supporting the guidance in the appendix to this presentation.
So as you go to Slide 19, it shows our rate base of growth over the next three years for both utilities. In previous years, this chart showed higher growth rates in Florida compared to the Carolinas. This thread is now reversed because we have completed the major environmental upgrade of Florida's Crystal River units 4 and 5 and embarked on the construction of three combined cycle plants in North Carolina. So this rate base growth supports our ongoing EPS growth targets.
Slide 20 shows more granularity on the major construction projects in Progress. The items relate primarily to our coal to gas repowering strategy in the Carolinas. We expect our Richmond county combined cycle plant to be in service in June of this year. We've broken ground on our lead combined cycle plant in September of 2010 and expect to begin construction on our Sutton combined cycle plant in the second half of this year. And we continue to make progress on Smart Grid in both the Carolinas and Florida.
Slide 21 is our customary detail on capital expenditures and again reflects the shift in CapEx from Florida in 2008 and '09 to more investment in the Carolinas in 2010 through '12. 
Slide 22 shows the projected cash flows for 2011 versus the actual 2010 numbers. The biggest variance here is related to use of $235 million of cost removal in 2011 versus the 60 we actually booked in 2010 and the higher 2011 pension contribution of $350 million versus $129 million contribution in 2010. 
The positive weather impact in 2010 is not expected to recur, but we should see an incremental cash benefit of approximately $200 million from bonus depreciation. And just as a reminder, our prior forecast had included the use of synthetic fuel tax credits to offset our cash tax liability to the ANP rate. We believe that bonus depreciation will reduce taxable income, such that we do not project using any synthetic fuel tax credits in 2011. Therefore, we should bring approximately $800 million of synthetic fuel tax credit carryforwards to the merged company.
In Slide 23 our financing plan, you'll note that we are already have completed our holding company issuance to address a March 1 maturity. The remainder of the financing activity will occur at the utilities, with Progress Energy Carolinas having higher amounts due to its construction costs related to the coal to gas repowering. And as we've noted previously, there will not be any material equity issuances, except for some minor shares from employee benefit plans.
So before I turn it back to Bill for Q&A, let me recap by pointing out that we delivered on ongoing earnings above our 2010 guidance; we preserved flexibility for 2011 and 2012 with our cost of removal amortization strategy in Florida; our total shareholder return for 2010 was 12.6%; our 2011 guidance of $3 to $3.20 is reasonable and achievable; and our cash flow profile and financing plans fully support our dividend. So we're very excited about the prospects of the merger but remained focused on delivering the results for 2011 as we work through the regulatory approvals and the integration plan. So with that, I'll turn it back to Bill for your questions."

The balance here is public health and safety, economy, economic growth and consumer pressure, right. Those are the things that we're trying to balance, and the state regulators are the one that have to bear the brunt of dealing with cost increases to customers. So I'd say the reaction to this is, they would like to see a way, where we can achieve our public health and safety goals in the least cost manner with more flexibility in the schedule and the standards. It was very obvious in the room that they're concerned about having to deal with these cost increases, especially at this time in the economy. So I think that's where they are."

I direct your attention to our website, where we had included a set of slides, which accompany our speakers' prepared remarks this morning. These slides can be found at progress-energy.com/webcast.
Today, we will be making forward-looking statements as well as reviewing historical information. There are numerous factors that may cause future or actual results to differ materially from these statements, and we outlined these in our earnings release, Form 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings as well as the risk factor discussion also found in our Form 10-K and 10-Q. For your information, we plan to file our Form 10-K at the end of the month.
This morning following opening comments from Bill and Mark, we will open the phone lines to address your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Johnson."

Our quarter and our 2010 full year results were quite good, so let's dive right in. 
As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide highlights for the quarter and full year financial results. And look at the filing schedule for our recently announced merger with Duke Energy, an update on our Crystal River unit three outage and comments on our key focus areas for 2011. Then Mark Mulhern will provide more detail on the numbers behind our financial results.
Let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the fourth quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $133 million, compared to $142 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per-share basis, we're down $0.05 from the fourth quarter 2009, principally due to higher O&M and tax expenses. 
For the full year 2010, ongoing earnings were $889 million, compared to $846 million for the same period a year ago. On a per-share basis, we're up $0.03 due to favorable weather during the year, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. Our ongoing earnings of $3.06 exceeded the high end of our 2010 guidance range.
The economy in our service area has continued to demonstrate modest recovery and obviously the weather was a significant contributor to the year's results. Record-cold weather in Florida followed by extreme heat last summer in all three states had a positive impact of $0.44 per share on a year-over-year basis. 
Today, we're providing our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. Now clearly, weather was a significant contributor last year. On a weather-normalized basis for our 2011 estimates, the higher use of the cost of removal amortization in Florida and lower O&M expenses in the Carolinas will offset the weather gains of last year. Mark will discuss the 2011 earnings drivers a little bit later.
As shown on Slide 5, we've been able to show earnings growth over a very difficult economic times for our region and nation. This consistency is the product of the financial and operational discipline we focus on everyday. As you know, on January 10, we announced the strategic merger with Duke Energy. Information about this merger can be found on the Progress and Duke websites, as well as through the many filings we've made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will incorporate a scorecard to help you track where we are in the multistep-approval process required for the merger. Slide 6 shows an example of the scorecard, and this should make it easy for you to see our progress at any point as we move forward with filings and approvals. 
Now if you turn to Slide 7. It provides an update on the outage in our Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. As most of you know, concrete delamination or cracking occurred in a section at the containment building in late 2009 when we created an opening to replace the steam generators. Last fall, we completed the final concrete placements to repair the containment building. 
Following concrete curing, we began a systematic process of re-tensioning the steel tendons that encircle the building. We've now completed more than half of that re-tensioning. We expect to complete re-tensioning in March and return the unit to service after post-repair testing and start-up activities in April. 
Nuclear safety remains our top priority, and our plans and actions will continue to reflect this commitment. A number of factors affecting return to service date, including regulatory reviews by the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] and other agencies, emergent work, final engineering designs, testing, weather and other development. 
Slide 7 summarizes the cost of the outage to end of year 2010 for both the repair and the replacement power. Through December, the total for repair costs was about $150 million, and for replacement power, about $288 million. Partially offsetting these expenditures are about $181 million in proceeds from NEIL, the mutual insurance company created by the nuclear utilities. In addition, we have booked receivables for another $101 million expected to be received from NEIL. Now we are currently recovering a portion of the replacement of power costs not covered by insurance. The Florida PSC will hold a separate proceeding later this year to evaluate the engineering decisions and repair costs associated with returning the unit to service. 
As I've noted before on these calls, we've been very transparent with the NRC, state regulators, the industry and other stakeholders throughout this process, and we'll continue to keep these groups informed. Our primary focus is on returning this important asset to safe, reliable operation for many years to come.
Next, please turn to Slide 8, which highlights four key focus areas for our company in 2011. These areas are addition to our daily efforts to excel in the fundamentals, which include safety, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. We're keeping our sights on our core responsibilities, even as we move forward with merger-approval activities. 
The first focus area is to build on the initiatives we began last year to improve the performance of our nuclear fleet. We are implementing a comprehensive plan to return our fleet to a consistently high level of performance in safety, reliability and value year after year. 
The second focus is to accelerate our efforts in what we call Continuous Business Excellence. This is a company-wide initiative we started a couple of years ago to take a closer look at how we do our work so we can improve efficiency and service, while achieving sustainable cost savings.
The third area is to continue executing our balanced solutions management. We are optimizing a diverse portfolio of investments and initiatives that help us prepare for future customer needs and meet emerging regulatory requirements. This balanced approach includes everything from fleet modernization in the Smart Grid to energy efficiency programs and alternative energy projects. 
The final focus area for 2011 involves getting ready for the Duke-Progress merger. We're getting organized the planned integration of the two companies and secure a timely merger approvals. We're intent on positioning the combined company for success. With that, I'll ask Mark Mulhern, our CFO, to provide more details on our financials."
258891,117980493,104692,"Progress Energy Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2011",2011-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'm going to cover the topics on Slide 9, so let's begin. Slide 10 shows our fourth quarter and full year ongoing earnings. For the fourth quarter 2010, we reported $0.45 versus $0.50 last year, for the Carolinas was u",1421,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'm going to cover the topics on Slide 9, so let's begin. 
Slide 10 shows our fourth quarter and full year ongoing earnings. For the fourth quarter 2010, we reported $0.45 versus $0.50 last year, for the Carolinas was up $0.04, Florida was down $0.11 and Corporate and Other was $0.02 favorable. 
In Florida, the fourth quarter decline was driven primarily by the pension deferral in 2009 that was expensed in 2010, and also by a decline in AFUDC earnings and OPEB charge. For the full year, we reported $3.06 versus $3.03 last year. Carolinas was up $0.20 over 2009, Florida was down $0.06 and the Corporate and Other was $0.11 unfavorable.
So I'll shift to Slide 11, which is our waterfall chart, it illustrates the positive and negative drivers for the fourth quarter. Key variances here were weather, clauses and other margin, which were offset by higher O&M and income tax items. Due to favorable weather in Florida, we did not amortize any additional cost or removal obligation in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 12 shows the waterfall chart for the full year 2010. Weather, a $0.44, was the key positive driver. And under our Florida regulatory settlement, we were allowed to amortize up to $150 million on the cost of removal obligation in 2010. We only utilized $60 million or $0.11, and the unused $90 million carries over into 2011.
As you can see, several items offset the unusually favorable weather: O&M, interest expense, share dilution and other income tax items. I will address the quarter and the full year unfavorable O&M variances in just a few moments.
On Slide 13, we provided detail on the 2010 retail sales by customer class, so that numbers on the bottom of the slide show that our weather-adjusted sales growth exceeded forecast at both utilities. Carolinas had an increase of 2% versus our forecast of 0.6%, primarily due to a stronger industrial recovery in 2010 that we have forecasted. Meanwhile, Florida had a decline of 1.8% versus a negative 2.2% forecast due to the continued weak economy, which we believe has begun to finally turn around.
Now if you turn to Slide 14, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low-usage accounts, Florida continues to show a steady uptick in customer growth. In fact, Florida had a net addition of 4,000 customers for the full year 2010, which was the first time we've seen positive customer growth in Florida since 2007. Carolinas added 10,000 new customers.
On Slide 15, we've provided some transparency around the O&M variance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2010. For the full year, the majority of the increase are $0.19 was driven by three scheduled nuclear refueling and maintenance outages in 2010 compared to two in 2009, and other factors included extended outages and more emergent work, primarily on our Robinson Nuclear Plant. In addition, we had $0.09 of nonrecurring prior-year benefits due to a pension deferral in Florida and a change in vacation benefits policy. So it's important to note that, excluding the above two items, the balance of our O&M costs increased approximately 1% over 2009.
Slide 16 gives you some more detail behind our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance by utility. Carolinas slightly declined due to normal weather and then partially offset by lower O&M. Florida on the other hand is able to more than offset normal weather with higher cost of removal amortization and a higher rate base. Corporate and Other is favorable primarily due to lower interest expense. 
So Slide 17 is a waterfall illustrating our 2011 ongoing EPS drivers. Largest drivers, the 2010 weather-normalization adjustment of $0.54. We expect to offset this with $0.36 of additional cost of removal amortization in Florida and $0.25 of improved O&M costs. 
The improved O&M costs are primarily driven by fewer nuclear outages in 2011. So three planned refueling outages and the unplanned outages at Robinson drove 2010's higher O&M spending. There's only one planned refueling outage in 2011. The other primary drivers are favorable clauses and other margin and growth in usage, offset by a little higher D&A and lower wholesale revenues primarily in Florida. 
So I just like to take a moment to highlight the retail sales growth and usage assumptions in our 2011 guidance. We project retail sales growth in 2011 versus 2010 in the Carolinas up 0.8%, and in Florida, a positive 0.7%. While that's a lower growth rate in the Carolinas from 2010, it reflects a more normal run rate trend. And in Florida, we project a return to positive sales growth, reflecting an improvement in the Florida economy. 
I'd also like to just make a comment about our wholesale revenues, and these are actually shown on Slide 18.  As I mentioned a moment ago, Florida wholesale revenues are expected to decline in 2011 due to contract expirations. However, this trend should reverse in 2012 due to amended contracts. 
Carolinas wholesale revenues are fairly steady in 2011 but will begin increasing materially in 2012 and '13 due to wholesale contract extensions and expansions with city of Fayetteville and the NCEMC. You can find additional details supporting the guidance in the appendix to this presentation.
So then as you go to Slide 19, it shows our rate base growth for the next three years for both utilities. In previous years, this chart showed higher growth rates in Florida compared to the Carolinas. This thread is now reversed because we have completed the major environmental upgrade of Florida's Crystal River units 4 and 5 and embarked on the construction of three combined cycle plants in North Carolina. So this rate base growth supports our ongoing EPS growth targets.
Slide 20 shows more granularity on the major construction projects in Progress. The items relate primarily to our coal to gas repowering strategy in the Carolinas. We expect our Richmond County combined cycle plant to be in service in June of this year. We have broken ground on our Lee combined cycle plant. We broke ground in September of 2010 and expect to begin construction on our Sutton combined cycle plant in the second half of this year. And we continue to make progress on Smart Grid in both the Carolinas and Florida.
Slide 21 is our customary detail on capital expenditures and again reflects the shift in CapEx from Florida in 2008 and '09 to more investment in the Carolinas in 2010 through '12. 
Slide 22 shows the projected cash flows for 2011 versus the actual 2010 numbers. The biggest variances here relate to the use of $235 million of cost of removal in 2011 versus the $60 million we actually booked in 2010, and the higher 2011 pension contribution of $350 million versus the $129 million contribution in 2010. 
The positive weather impact in 2010 is not expected to recur, but we should see an incremental cash benefit of approximately $200 million from bonus depreciation. And just as a reminder, our prior forecast had included the use of synthetic fuel tax credits to offset our cash tax liability to the AMT [alternative minimum tax] rate. We believe that bonus depreciation will reduce taxable income, such that we do not project using any synthetic fuel tax credits in 2011. Therefore, we should bring approximately $800 million of synthetic fuel tax credit carryforwards to the merged company.
In Slide 23 our financing plan, you'll note that we already have completed our holding company issuance to address a March 1 maturity. The remainder of the financing activity will occur at the utilities, with Progress Energy Carolinas having higher amounts due to its construction costs related to the coal to gas repowering. And as we've noted previously, there will not be any material equity issuances, except for some minor shares for employee benefit plans.
So before I turn it back to Bill for Q&A, let me recap by pointing out that we delivered on ongoing earnings above our 2010 guidance; we preserved flexibility for 2011 and 2012 with our cost of removal amortization strategy in Florida; our total shareholder return for 2010 was 12.6%; our 2011 guidance of $3 to $3.20 is reasonable and achievable; and our cash flow profile and financing plans fully support our dividend. So we're very excited about the prospects of the merger but remained focused on delivering results for 2011 as we work through the regulatory approvals and the integration plan. So with that, I'll turn it back to Bill for your questions."

I think we're feeling like the economy is improving slowly in both territories. I mean, you should actually see it on the customer growth slides. The Florida's number's turned around. We think Carolinas has kind of flattened out here. And our industrial customer base in Carolinas we had good growth in 2010, expect that to maybe to be a little less in 2011. But by and large, cautiously optimistic about, again, a slow return to some level of growth in norma usage. We haven't been able to put our fingers much on the impact of efficiency programs, we obviously have a number of them, and especially in the Carolinas and some in Florida as well. Now we don't seen a measurable impact, and again we had unusually strong weather in both summer and winter at both utilities. So it's a little hard to see through those weather-adjusted numbers, whether that's having any impact."

It seems the EPA's Gina McCarthy, who I think you're in a panel with, seems to be leaving, for a lack of a better phrase in an ideological bubble, urging quick action on the part of the PUCs to spend, spend, spend as a prudent course of action. My question is this, do you believe the EPA has any conception of what the impact all these new rules are going to have on utility customer bills?

One of the reasons we did that was to help inform the EPA, at their request actually, of what these things actually cost. Things like scrubbers, and so I think they're actually trying hard to figure out what the impact is, and we'll have a much better understanding of that as a result of the work industry and the EPA have done together. So I think they understand that there's a cost issue here, and that cost issue takes me to your second point, which is what is your reaction to regulators. The balance here is public health and safety, economy, economic growth and consumer pressure right? Those are the things you're trying to balance. And the state regulators are the ones that have to bear the brunt of dealing with cost increases to customers. So I'd say the reaction to this is, they would like to see a way, where we can achieve our public health and safety goals in the least cost manner with more flexibility in the schedule and the standards. It was very obvious in the room at NARUC that they're concerned about having to deal with these cost increases, especially at this time in the economy. So I think that's where they are."

There is a little bit of art to this process, maybe more art than science. So our view is, let's be a little conservative about our projections just because there's some uncertainties. My own opinion here is that going forward, there will be maybe some decline in usage. We're pushing a number of efficiency programs and other things, and that may lead to a -- but I think it would be a small decline in usage, and will be offset as the economy recovers by growth.

Our quarter and our 2010 full year results were quite good, so let's dive right in. 
As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide highlights for the quarter and full-year financial results. And look at the filing schedule for our recently announced merger with Duke Energy, an update on our Crystal River Unit 3 outage and comments on our key focus areas for 2011. Then Mark Mulhern will provide more detail on the numbers behind our financial results.
Let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the fourth quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $133 million, compared to $142 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per-share basis, we're down $0.05 from the fourth quarter 2009, principally due to higher O&M and tax expenses. 
For the full year 2010, ongoing earnings were $889 million, compared to $846 million for the same period a year ago. On a per-share basis, we're up $0.03 due to favorable weather during the year, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. Our ongoing earnings of $3.06 exceeded the high end of our 2010 guidance range.
The economy in our service area has continued to demonstrate modest recovery and obviously the weather was a significant contributor to the year's results. Record cold weather in Florida followed by extreme heat last summer in all three states had a positive impact of $0.44 per share on a year-over-year basis. 
Today, we're providing our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. Now clearly, weather was a significant contributor last year. On a weather-normalized basis for our 2011 estimates, the higher use of the cost of removal amortization in Florida and lower O&M expenses in the Carolinas will offset the weather gains of last year. Mark will discuss the 2011 earnings drivers a little bit later.
As shown on Slide 5, we've been able to show earnings growth over a very difficult economic time for our region and nation. This consistency is the product of the financial and operational discipline we focus on every day. As you know, on January 10, we announced the strategic merger with Duke Energy. Information about this merger can be found on the Progress and Duke websites, as well as through the many filings we've made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will incorporate a scorecard to help you track where we are in the multistep-approval process required for the merger. Slide 6 shows an example of the scorecard, and this should make it easy for you to see our progress at any point as we move forward with filings and approvals. 
Now if you turn to Slide 7. It provides an update on the outage in our Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. As most of you know, concrete delamination or cracking occurred in a section at the containment building in late 2009 when we created an opening to replace the steam generators. Last fall, we completed the final concrete placements to repair the containment building. 
Following concrete curing, we began a systematic process of re-tensioning the steel tendons that encircle the building. We've now completed more than half of that re-tensioning. We expect to complete re-tensioning in March and return the unit to service after post-repair testing and start-up activities in April. 
Nuclear safety remains our top priority, and our plans and actions will continue to reflect this commitment. A number of factors affecting return to service date, including regulatory reviews by the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] and other agencies, emergent work, final engineering designs, testing, weather and other development. 
Slide 7 summarizes the cost of the outage to end-of-year 2010 for both the repair and the replacement power. Through December, the total for repair costs was about $150 million, and for replacement power, about $288 million. Partially offsetting these expenditures are about $181 million in proceeds from NEIL, the mutual insurance company created by the nuclear utilities. In addition, we have booked receivables for another $101 million expected to be received from NEIL. Now we are currently recovering a portion of the replacement of power costs not covered by insurance. The Florida PSC will hold a separate proceeding later this year to evaluate the engineering decisions and repair costs associated with returning the unit to service. 
As I've noted before on these calls, we've been very transparent with the NRC, state regulators, the industry and other stakeholders throughout this process, and we'll continue to keep these groups informed. Our primary focus is on returning this important asset to safe, reliable operation for many years to come.
Next, please turn to Slide 8, which highlights four key focus areas for our company in 2011. These areas are addition to our daily efforts to excel in the fundamentals, which include safety, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. We're keeping our sights on our core responsibilities, even as we move forward with merger-approval activities. 
The first focus area is to build on the initiatives we began last year to improve the performance of our nuclear fleet. We are implementing a comprehensive plan to return our fleet to a consistently high level of performance in safety, reliability and value year after year. 
The second focus is to accelerate our efforts in what we call Continuous Business Excellence. This is a company-wide initiative we started a couple of years ago to take a closer look at how we do our work so we can improve efficiency and service, while achieving sustainable cost savings.
The third area is to continue executing our balanced solutions strategy. We are optimizing a diverse portfolio of investments and initiatives that help us prepare for future customer needs and meet emerging regulatory requirements. This balanced approach includes everything from fleet modernization in the Smart Grid to energy efficiency programs and alternative energy projects. 
The final focus area for 2011 involves getting ready for the Duke-Progress merger. We're getting organized the planned integration of the two companies and secure a timely merger approvals. We're intent on positioning the combined company for success. With that, I'll ask Mark Mulhern, our CFO, to provide more details on our financials."
258891,117980493,104738,"Progress Energy Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2011",2011-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. And good morning. I'm going to cover the topics on Slide 9, so let's begin. Slide 10 shows our fourth quarter and full-year ongoing earnings. For the fourth quarter 2010, we reported $0.45 versus $0.50 last year, for the Carolinas was u",1410,"Thank you, Bill. And good morning. I'm going to cover the topics on Slide 9, so let's begin. 
Slide 10 shows our fourth quarter and full-year ongoing earnings. For the fourth quarter 2010, we reported $0.45 versus $0.50 last year, for the Carolinas was up $0.04, Florida was down $0.11 and Corporate and Other was $0.02 favorable. 
In Florida, the fourth quarter decline was driven primarily by the pension deferral in 2009 that was expensed in 2010, and also by a decline in AFUDC earnings and OPEB charge. For the full year, we reported $3.06 versus $3.03 last year. Carolinas was up $0.20 over 2009, Florida was down $0.06 and the Corporate and Other was $0.11 unfavorable.
So I'll shift to Slide 11, which is our waterfall chart, it illustrates the positive and negative drivers for the fourth quarter. Key variances here were weather, clauses and other margin, which were offset by higher O&M and income tax items. Due to favorable weather in Florida, we did not amortize any additional cost or removal obligation in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 12 shows the waterfall chart for the full year 2010. Weather, a $0.44, was the key positive driver. And under our Florida regulatory settlement, we were allowed to amortize up to $150 million of the cost of removal obligation in 2010. We only utilized $60 million or $0.11, and the unused $90 million carries over into 2011.
As you can see, several items offset the unusually favorable weather: O&M, interest expense, share dilution and other income tax items. I will address the quarter and the full-year unfavorable O&M variances in just a few moments.
On Slide 13, we provided detail on the 2010 retail sales by customer class, so that numbers on the bottom of the slide show that our weather-adjusted sales growth exceeded forecast at both utilities. Carolinas had an increase of 2% versus our forecast of 0.6%, primarily due to a stronger industrial recovery in 2010 that we have forecasted. Meanwhile, Florida had a decline of 1.8% versus a negative 2.2% forecast due to the continued weak economy, which we believe has begun to finally turn around.
Now if you turn to Slide 14, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low-usage accounts, Florida continues to show a steady uptick in customer growth. In fact, Florida had a net addition of 4,000 customers for the full year 2010, which was the first time we've seen positive customer growth in Florida since 2007. Carolinas added 10,000 new customers.
On Slide 15, we've provided some transparency around the O&M variance for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2010. For the full year, the majority of the increase are $0.19 was driven by three scheduled nuclear refueling and maintenance outages in 2010 compared to two in 2009, and other factors included extended outages and more emergent work, primarily on our Robinson Nuclear Plant. In addition, we had $0.09 of nonrecurring prior-year benefits due to a pension deferral in Florida and a change in vacation benefits policy. So it's important to note that, excluding the above two items, the balance of our O&M costs increased approximately 1% over 2009.
Slide 16 gives you some more detail behind our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance by utility. Carolinas slightly declined due to normal weather and then partially offset by lower O&M. Florida on the other hand is able to more than offset normal weather with higher cost of removal amortization and a higher rate base. Corporate and Other is favorable primarily due to lower interest expense. 
So Slide 17 is a waterfall illustrating our 2011 ongoing EPS drivers. Largest drivers, the 2010 weather-normalization adjustment of $0.54. We expect to offset this with $0.36 of additional cost of removal amortization in Florida and $0.25 of improved O&M costs. 
The improved O&M costs are primarily driven by fewer nuclear outages in 2011. So three planned refueling outages and the unplanned outages at Robinson drove 2010's higher O&M spending. There's only one planned refueling outage in 2011. The other primary drivers are favorable clauses and other margin and growth in usage, offset by a little higher D&A and lower wholesale revenues primarily in Florida. 
So I just like to take a moment to highlight the retail sales growth and usage assumptions in our 2011 guidance. We project retail sales growth in 2011 versus 2010 in the Carolinas up 0.8%, and in Florida, a positive 0.7%. While that's a lower growth rate in the Carolinas from 2010, it reflects a more normal run rate trend. And in Florida, we project a return to positive sales growth, reflecting an improvement in the Florida economy. 
I'd also like to just make a comment about our wholesale revenues, and these are actually shown on Slide 18.  As I mentioned a moment ago, Florida wholesale revenues are expected to decline in 2011 due to contract expirations. However, this trend should reverse in 2012 due to amended contracts. 
Carolinas wholesale revenues are fairly steady in 2011 but will begin increasing materially in 2012 and '13 due to wholesale contract extensions and expansions with city of Fayetteville and the NCEMC. You can find additional details supporting the guidance in the appendix to this presentation.
So then as you go to Slide 19, it shows our rate base growth for the next three years for both utilities. In previous years, this chart showed higher growth rates in Florida compared to the Carolinas. This thread is now reversed because we have completed the major environmental upgrade of Florida's Crystal River units 4 and 5 and embarked on the construction of three combined cycle plants in North Carolina. So this rate base growth supports our ongoing EPS growth targets.
Slide 20 shows more granularity on the major construction projects in progress. The items relate primarily to our coal-to-gas repowering strategy in the Carolinas. We expect our Richmond County combined-cycle plant to be in service in June of this year. We have broken ground on our Lee combined-cycle plant. We broke ground in September of 2010 and expect to begin construction on our Sutton combined-cycle plant in the second half of this year. And we continue to make progress on Smart Grid in both the Carolinas and Florida.
Slide 21 is our customary detail on capital expenditures and again reflects the shift in CapEx from Florida in 2008 and '09 to more investment in the Carolinas in 2010 through '12. 
Slide 22 shows the projected cash flows for 2011 versus the actual 2010 numbers. The biggest variances here relate to the use of $235 million of cost of removal in 2011 versus the $60 million we actually booked in 2010, and the higher 2011 pension contribution of $350 million versus the $129 million contribution in 2010. 
The positive weather impact in 2010 is not expected to recur, but we should see an incremental cash benefit of approximately $200 million from bonus depreciation. And just as a reminder, our prior forecast had included the use of synthetic fuel tax credits to offset our cash tax liability to the AMT [alternative minimum tax] rate. We believe that bonus depreciation will reduce taxable income, such that we do not project using any synthetic fuel tax credits in 2011. Therefore, we should bring approximately $800 million of synthetic fuel tax credit carryforwards to the merged company.
In Slide 23 our financing plan, you'll note that we already have completed our holding company issuance to address a March 1 maturity. The remainder of the financing activity will occur at the utilities, with Progress Energy Carolinas having higher amounts due to its construction costs related to the coal-to-gas repowering. And as we've noted previously, there will not be any material equity issuances, except for some minor shares for employee benefit plans.
So before I turn it back to Bill for Q&A, let me recap by pointing out that: We delivered on ongoing earnings above our 2010 guidance; we preserved flexibility for 2011 and 2012 with our cost of removal amortization strategy in Florida; our total shareholder return for 2010 was 12.6%; our 2011 guidance of $3 to $3.20 is reasonable and achievable; and our cash-flow profile and financing plans fully support our dividend. So we're very excited about the prospects of the merger but remain focused on delivering results for 2011 as we work through the regulatory approvals and the integration plan. So with that, I'll turn it back to Bill for your questions."

But by and large, cautiously optimistic about, again, a slow return to some level of growth in normal usage. We haven't been able to put our fingers much on the impact of efficiency programs, we obviously have a number of them, and especially in the Carolinas and some in Florida as well. Now -- we haven’t seen a measurable impact, and again we had unusually strong weather in both summer and winter at both utilities.

I will say in this instance, they have had a very good dialogue with the industry about this. I mentioned in my comments a study that ICF did for EEI. One of the reasons we did that was to help inform the EPA, at their request actually, of what these things actually cost. Things like scrubbers, and so I think they're actually trying hard to figure out what the impact is, and we'll have a much better understanding of that as a result of the work industry and the EPA have done together. So I think they understand that there's a cost issue here, and that cost issue takes me to your second point, which is what is your reaction to regulators. The balance here is public health and safety, economy, economic growth and consumer pressure right? Those are the things you're trying to balance. And the state regulators are the ones that have to bear the brunt of dealing with cost increases to customers. So I'd say the reaction to this is, they would like to see a way, where we can achieve our public health and safety goals in the least cost manner with more flexibility in the schedule and the standards. It was very obvious in the room at NARUC that they're concerned about having to deal with these cost increases, especially at this time in the economy. So I think that's where they are."

I'm glad you've joined the call this morning and we appreciate your interest in Progress Energy. At Slide 3 indicates I'll provide highlights at first quarter financial results and update on filings associated with our proposed merger with Duke Energy and update on our nuclear fleet especially our Crystal River unit and some information on the impact of two rules recently proposed by the EPA. The last month to provide the last numbers behind our financial results. So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. First quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $202 million, compared $213 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per share basis, we downed six sense from the first quarter in 2010, principally due to more normal weather condition this year compared to last. As you recall, last year's first quarter had $0.18 of favorable weather. We had a strong quarter this year when you consider the return of normal weather. The economy in our service areas continue to show some modest recovery particularly in the industrial sector, as Mark will address in more detail in a moment, growth in usage by class were mixed. As has been noted in several other recent calls

Related filings. A shown on the scorecard of Slide 5, we have now filed that all the state and federal agencies except the FCC. So we're making good progress in the regulatory filings. The North Carolina Utilities Commission recently set a schedule for review by testimony and additional supporting materials are due to be filed on may 20th with evidence here hearings beginning September 20. We made our initial Hart-Scott-Rodino filings with the Department of Justice in late March, and a 30 day review period has expired. No additional request for information we're received so our obligations under that have been satisfied. So we'll update the scorecard, as well as we move through the merger process. It's on our website and also on Dukes. 
Let me turn your attention to Slide 6 now. Given all that's going on both here in Japan, I want to spend a few minutes on our nuclear fleet which is shown on this slide. As a reminder, we have five reactors at four sites across our system. The Brunswick site is a two unit plant located near Wilmington North Carolina. Several weeks ago, unit to return to service after successfully completing refueling outage that included significant improvement additions and repairs, this the only refueling at its scheduled for nuclear fleet this year. Unit one is currently on 361 day run since its last refueling outage, so almost a full year of nonstop operation. The Harris unit near Raleigh continues a strong operating performance following its refueling outage last fall. Which included replacing an electric generator and completing significant work on the cooling tower and fire protection modifications. The generator replacement including tower work are part of the power upgrades. A five-year project that eventually would have 60 to 70 additional megawatts from that plan. These projects along with others are designed to ensure hatters to operate as a safe and reliable source of energy for decades to come. The Robinson Nuclear Plant unit in South Carolina had an eight typical year in 2010. It had several forced outages including one that involved a fire in the plant's electrical system which required an extensive repair. As a result of last year's event, the NRC identified Robinson as a plan acquiring additional oversight. We have made significant changes in the Robinson plans leadership team. We are implementing a comprehensive improvement plan. This plant has performed well since last return it to service in mid-November and prior to last year's event, this plan had an extremely good performance record over many years. We are fully committed to the safe reliable operation of this plant and to returning it to it's historic levels of performance. Now, let's turn our attention to Crystal River three nuclear unit in Florida. Where as you know, we discovered a second delamination in the containment building in March. Work on the containment building was suspended mid-March after monitoring equipment identified additional delamination that occurred after the concrete repair work was completed and during the late stages of retention in the building. The unit will remain out of service while the conduct a thorough engineering analysis and review of the delamination and evaluate repair options. We are well along this evaluation process and should be completed over the next several weeks. And we will be able to provide more detail at that time. 
Slide 7 presents the cost data for this outage through March 31. The potential repair options will be partially based on the engineering analysis could range from repair of the impacted areas to replacement of the substantial portion of the concrete walls of the building. Repair options of all the original licensing basis could require NRC approval. Once the repair options are known, there are many additional factors that have to be considered, including among other things, customer benefits, public regulatory and political support, adequate financial cost recovery mechanisms, the scope of insurance coverage for replacement power and repair costs, and NRC renewal of the operating license. Crystal River 3 is current operating license expires in December 2016. And we applied for a 20 year renewal of that license in 2008. Our current intention is to return this nuclear into service because an important part of providing power to our customers from a diverse portfolio of base low generation. However, cannot estimate a return to service state our cost of repair this time. We can also see some details on insurance coverage of this unit on the bottom pass of Slide 7. We maintain insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through nuclear electronic insurance Ltd. or NEIL. Following the 12 week deductible period, the new program provides reimbursement for replacement power costs for 52 weeks at $4.5 million per week. Through April 9, 2011. An additional 71 weeks of coverage is provided at $3.6 million per week. So the new program provides replacement power coverage up to $490 million program. We also maintain insurance coverage through NEIL's accidental property damage program which provides coverage up to $2.25 billion with a $10 million deductible per claim. We're continuing to work with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement power costs. In regulatory space, we will file an engineering status update with a Florida Public Service Commission by May 19 and, of course, we are also keeping a close contact with the NRC and other interested parties. So that's where we are with Crystal River 3 and our nuclear fleet as a whole. These units are important assets for both our customers and our shareholders. Being a nuclear owner and operator carry significant responsibilities and we take these very seriously. We are veering rigorous about daily operations as well as continues improvements as we learn from what happens to the industry including in Japan. And we are being disciplined in working our action plans to ensure the long-term success with our nuclear program. Now, at Slide 8, I want to provide some insight into potential implications of two drop rules the EPA recently proposed. We airo toxic grew also known as the activity and natural, and the cooling water intake rule. Many of you are following these issues and their impact on the industry. We have not included cost estimates because these rules are not final, and will be the source of many comments during the review period. The proposed rules can change as a result of comments, as demonstrated by the recent industrial boiler Mac. And our fleet across indications of changes to the proposed rules could be substantial. We are evaluating our options and we'll provide CapEx estimates and implementation timing after we have a clear sense of the final rules and about compliance plans I do think a fair comment on these proposed rules is that for much of the industry, they will be expensive and difficult to comply with and a timeframe proposed and they could have an impact on reliability if the rules were not carefully analyze. Slide 8 shows a breakdown the relevant parts of our generation fleet and how many megawatts might be affected by these two proposed rules. The left half of the slide shows our coal and oil-fired generation capacity and how many megawatts might be affected by the toxic rule which EPA proposed in March. As you can see from the chart, 27% of this fleet today does not have scrubbers or SCRs, or is not currently scheduled for return. And we expect that even some of the well-controlled units will be affected by this rule. Between our two utilities, we've already invested more than $2 billion on environmental retrofits and are most efficient coal plants. As a result, we have achieved significant reductions in emissions. We also have announced closings of older less efficient plants and have a fleet modernization program underway to build efficient combined cycle plants fueled by natural gas. These actions will result in even greater reductions in emissions. If this will still have a significant impact on our customers but there comes in the forms of additional controls, additional retirements and replacements are other solutions. We believe the EPA fully utilize its discretion and authority to design flexibility into the final mac that standard. It's important to put this rule into the context of the unprecedented wave of federal regulations, the utility industry now faces. Utilities need to be able to make the most efficient compliance position to minimize the cumulative effect on customers while protecting the environment. The right half of Slide 8 shows a breakdown of this thin portion of our generation fleet and how many megawatts might be affected by the cooling water intake rule proposed in April. We're encouraged that the proposed rule provide some flexibility in addressing the treatment of aquatic organism. When they past rule of plans cooling system. They need to be greater flexibility, however, regarding the impingement requirements organism such up against outer part of the intake structure. This proposed rule will require a great deal of testing and data collection and interaction with state agencies before the final impact of the rule will become clear. As you can see from this Slide, not a quite a third of these generation assets have closed cycle cooling. So again this rule has a potential to have a significant impact. Both of these proposed rules, we support continued environmental improvement and cost effective actions to safeguard the environment. And now let me turn you to Slide 9, which is a summary of our key capital projects at the utilities. We continue to manage our new generation of Smart Grid projects in a very disciplined way to make constant schedule targets. I am pleased to report that our Richmond County combined cycle gas plant is undergoing final testing and will be added to our generation fleet in the Carolinas in June. Now I'd like to ask Mark, to provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter."

You have really stinks and is going to go over the numbers. The topics without cover outlined on Slide 10. Shifting to Slide 11, which shows our first quarter ongoing earnings in the first quarter 2011 we reported $0.69 versus $0.75 last year. Carolinas were down $0.05, was down $0.02 at the corporate another category is $0.01 favorable. As Bill noted earlier, the big driver in the earnings of the impact of weather-related energy sales this quarter compared to 2010. Last year's first quarter had $0.18 of favorable weather across both utilities. On balance, this year's first quarter was a normal in terms of whether compared to 2010 which was much colder. Slide 12 is our waterfall chart which outlines the positive and negative drivers for the first quarter. The largest positive on that page is the amortization of the cost of removal obligation at PES which offsets the $0.17 weather variance. The other noteworthy item in the quarter is in the clauses and another margin category where we accrued an additional $15 million of estimated liability or joint owners at CR3 due to the extension of the outage resulting from the second year ammunition. Two items usually shown on the waterfall chart related to growth and usage of: M.. This quarter, neither item contribute to that earnings variance. We have to send some positive earnings from the growth and usage in the Carolinas, but that was offset by Florida. And the OFM compares was flat as compared to last year's first quarter. Slide 13 shows our actual retail sales and the weather adjusted comparisons to 2010. Again unusually strong weather in 2010 made the analysis challenging but overall retail sales of both utilities are slightly below our full-year forecast. The bright spot here was the industrial customer sales were up 1.8% Progress Energy Carolinas. 
Now turn it over to Slide 14 which is our standard slide on customer growth and low usage accounts. Florida continues to show a steady uptick in customer growth, Florida had a net addition of 8,000 customers year-over-year and the Carolinas has added 7,000 customers year-over-year. Although Florida continues to show positive upward trends for the last four quarters, the Carolinas are still lagging historical trends and customer growth. Slide 15 includes some key items for you to be mindful of for earnings and cash flow for the rest of the year. We have $369 million of cost to the removal obligation remaining at PEF to be euthanized over the next several quarters. The one scheduled nuclear outage for 2011 has been completed at Brunswick. And recent storms in the Southeast will result in a charge to earnings in the $0.01 to $0.02 range in the second quarter. Finally, we are excluding merger and integration costs from ongoing earnings per share and those were approximately $14 million in the first quarter and those are primary transaction costs. So before I turn it back to Bill for Q&A, let me recap by pointing out that we delivered first quarter EPS above planned despite the further comparisons. The rate settlement agreement at PEF through 2012 continues to provide us flexibility and we've affirmed the 2011 ongoing EPS guidance for the full year of $3 to $3.20 per share and we are making solid progress on the regulatory approvals and merger integration planning. So we are excited about the prospects to merger but remain focused on delivering results for 2011. So Bill, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A."

As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide highlights of first quarter financial results, an update on filings associated with our proposed merger with Duke Energy, an update on our nuclear fleet, especially our Crystal River unit, and some information on the impact of 2 rules recently proposed by the EPA. Then I'll Mark to provide some more detail on the numbers behind our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the first quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $202 million compared to $213 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per share basis, we're down $0.06 for the first quarter in 2010, principally due to more normal weather conditions this year compared to last. As you'll recall, last year's first quarter had $0.18 of favorable weather. So we had a strong quarter this year when you consider the return of normal weather. The economy in our service areas continued to show some modest recovery, particularly in the industrial sector. As Mark will address in more detail in a moment, growth in usage by class were mixed, as has been noted in several other recent calls.
So today, we're affirming our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share, which we announced earlier this year. Weather was a significant contributor last year, especially in Florida. We were able to offset the loss of weather-related sales this year with additional use of cost of removal amortization in Florida. And Mark will discuss the quarter earnings drivers in a few minutes.
Let me turn to a few comments on our pending merger with Duke Energy. Over the past several weeks, Duke Energy and Progress Energy have made a number of merger-related filings. As shown on the scorecard of Slide 5, we have now filed with all the state and federal agencies except the FCC. So we're making good progress in the regulatory filings. 
The North Carolina Utilities Commission recently set a schedule for review. Our testimony and additional supporting materials are due to be filed May 20 with evidentiary hearings beginning September 20. 
We made our initial Hart-Scott-Rodino filing with the Department of Justice in late March, and a 30-day review period has expired. No additional request for information were received, so our obligations under the Act have been satisfied. And we'll update the scorecard as we move through the merger approval process. It's on our website and also on Duke's. 
Let me turn your attention to Slide 6 now. Given all that's going on both here and in Japan, I want to spend a few minutes on our nuclear fleet, which is shown on this slide. 
As a reminder, we have 5 reactors at 4 sites across our system. The Brunswick site is a 2-unit plant located near Wilmington, North Carolina. Several weeks ago, Unit 2 returned to service after successfully completing a refueling outage that included significant equipment additions and repairs. This the only refueling outage scheduled for our nuclear fleet this year. Unit 1 is currently on a 361-day run since its last refueling outage, so almost a full year of nonstop operation. 
The Harris unit near Raleigh continues its strong operating performance following its refueling outage last fall, which included replacing an electric generator and completing significant work on the cooling tower and fire protection modifications. The generator replacement, including tower work, are part of the power upgrade, a 5-year project that eventually will add 60 to 70 additional megawatts from that plant. These projects, along with others, are designed to ensure Harris will operate as a safe and reliable source of energy for decades to come. 
The Robinson Nuclear unit in South Carolina had an  atypical year in 2010. It had several forced outages, including one that involved a fire in the plant's electrical system, which required an extensive repair. As a result of last year's event, the NRC identified Robinson as a plant requiring additional oversight. 
We have made significant changes in the Robinson plant's leadership team and are implementing a comprehensive improvement plan. This plant has performed well since last returning to service in mid-November. And prior to last year's events, this plant had an extremely good performance record over many years. We are fully committed to the safe, reliable operation of this plant and to returning it to its historic levels of performance. 
Now let's turn our attention to Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida, where, as you know, we discovered a second delamination in the containment building in March. Work on the containment building was suspended in mid-March after monitoring equipment identified additional delamination that occurred after the concrete repair work was completed and during the late stages of retensioning the building. The unit will remain out of service while we conduct a thorough engineering analysis and review of the new delamination and evaluate repair options. We are well along in this evaluation process and should complete it over the next several weeks, and we'll be able to provide more detail at that time. 
Slide 7 presents the cost data for this outage through March 31. The potential repair options, which will be based on the engineering analysis, could range from repair of the impacted areas to replacement of a substantial portion of the concrete walls of the building. Repair options at all of the original licensing bases could require NRC approval. Once the repair options are known, there are many additional factors that will have to be considered, including, among other things, customer benefits, public regulatory and political support, adequate financial cost recovery mechanisms, the scope of insurance coverage for replacement power repair costs, and NRC renewal of the operating license. 
Crystal River 3's current operating license expires in December 2016, and we applied for a 20-year renewal of that license in 2008. Our current intention is to return this nuclear unit to service because it's an important part of providing power to our customers from a diverse portfolio of baseload generation. However, we cannot estimate a return to service state or cost to repair at this time. 
You can also see some details on insurance coverage of this unit on the bottom half of Slide 7. We maintain an insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. or NEIL. Following a 12-week deductible period, the NEIL program provides reimbursement for replacement power costs for 52 weeks at $4.5 million per week through April 9, 2011. An additional 71 weeks of coverage is provided at $3.6 million per week. So the NEIL program provides replacement power coverage up to $490 million per event. 
We also maintain insurance coverage through NEIL's accidental property damage program, which provides coverage up to $2.25 billion with a $10 million deductible per claim. We're continuing to work with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement power costs. 
In regulatory space, we will file an engineering status update with the Florida Public Service Commission by May 19. And, of course, we're also keeping in close contact with the NRC and other interested parties. 
So that's where we are with Crystal River 3 and our nuclear fleet as a whole. These units are important assets for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Being a nuclear owner and operator can carry significant responsibilities, and we take these very seriously. We are being rigorous about daily operations as well as continuous improvement as we learn from what happens throughout the industry, including in Japan. And we are being disciplined in working our action plans to ensure long-term success with our nuclear program. 
Now with Slide 8, I want to provide some insight into potential implications of 2 draft rules the EPA recently proposed: the Air Toxic (sic) [Toxics] rule, also known as the Utility MACT rule; and the Cooling Water Intake rule. I know many of you are following these issues and their impacts on the industry. 
We have not included cost estimates because these rules are not final. It will be the source of many comments during the review period. The proposed rules can change as a result of comments, as demonstrated by the recent industrial boiler MACT. And in our fleet, the cost implications of changes to the proposed rules could be substantial. We are evaluating our options, and we'll provide CapEx estimates and implementation timing after we have a clear sense of the final rules and of our compliance plans. 
I do think a fair comment on these proposed rules is that for much of the industry, they will be expensive and difficult to comply with in the time frame proposed. And it could have an impact on reliability if the rules are not carefully finalized. 
Slide 8 shows a breakdown of the relevant parts of our generation fleet and how many megawatts might be affected by these 2 proposed rules. The left half of the slide shows our coal- and oil-fired generation capacity, and how many megawatts might be affected by the Air Toxics rule, which the EPA proposed in March. 
As you can see from the chart, 27% of this fleet today does not have scrubbers or SCRs or is not currently scheduled for retirement. And we expect that even some of the well-controlled units will be affected by this rule. 
Between our 2 utilities, we've already invested more than $2 billion in environmental retrofits at our most efficient coal plants and, as a result, have achieved significant reductions in emissions. We also have announced closings of older, less efficient plants and have a fleet modernization program underway to build efficient combined cycle plants fueled by natural gas. These actions will result in even greater reductions in emissions. But this rule will still have a significant impact on our customers, whether it comes in the forms of additional controls, additional retirements and replacements or other solutions. We believe the EPA should fully utilize its discretion and authority to design flexibility into the final MACT standard. 
It's important to put this rule in the context of the unprecedented wave of federal regulations the utility industry now faces. Utilities need to be able to make the most efficient compliance decision to minimize the cumulative effect on customers while protecting the environment. 
The right half of Slide 8 shows a breakdown of the steam portion of our generation fleet, and how many megawatts might be affected by the Cooling Water Intake rule proposed in April. We're encouraged that the proposed rule provides some flexibility in addressing the entrainment of aquatic organisms when they pass through a plant's cooling system. There needs to be greater flexibility, however, regarding the impingement requirements when organisms are trapped against the outer part of a cooling water intake structure. 
This proposed rule will require a great deal of testing and data collection and interaction with state agencies before the final impact of the rule will become clear. As you can see from the slide, not a quite 1/3 of these generation assets have closed-cycle cooling. So again, this rule has a potential to have a significant impact. For both of these proposed rules, we support continued environmental improvement and cost-effective action to safeguard the environment. 
And now let me turn you to Slide 9, which is a summary of our key capital projects at the utilities. We continue to manage our new generation and Smart Grid projects in a very disciplined way to meet constant schedule targets. I'm pleased to report that our Richmonde County combined cycle gas plant is undergoing final testing and will be added to our generation fleet in the Carolinas in June. Now I'd like to ask Mark to provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter."
258891,129486182,122767,"Progress Energy Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. Those are on the heavy lifting, so I'm just going to go over the numbers, the topics that I'll cover outlined on Slide 10. And shifting to Slide 11, which shows our first quarter ongoing earnings. For the first quarter",593,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. Those are on the heavy lifting, so I'm just going to go over the numbers, the topics that I'll cover outlined on Slide 10. 
And shifting to Slide 11, which shows our first quarter ongoing earnings. For the first quarter 2011, we reported $0.69 versus $0.75 last year. The Carolinas were down $0.05, Florida was down $0.02 and the corporate and others category was $0.01 favorable. 
As Bill noted earlier, the big driver in the earnings variance was the impact of lower weather-related energy sales this quarter compared to 2010. Last year's first quarter had $0.18 of favorable weather across both utilities. On balance, this year's first quarter was normal in terms of weather compared to 2010, which was much colder. 
Slide 12 is our waterfall chart, which outlines the positive and negative drivers for the first quarter. The largest positive on the page is the amortization of the cost for removal obligation at PEF, which offsets the $0.17 negative weather variance. The other noteworthy item in the quarter is in the clauses and other margin category where we accrued an additional $15 million of estimated liability to joint owners at CR3 due to the extension of the outage resulting from the second delamination. 
Two items usually shown on the waterfall chart related to growth in usage in O&M. This quarter, neither item contribute to the earnings variance. We had $0.02 of positive earnings from growth in usage in the Carolinas, but that was offset by Florida. And the O&M comparison was flat as compared to last year's first quarter. 
Slide 13 shows our actual retail sales and the weather-adjusted comparisons to 2010. Again, unusually strong weather in 2010 makes the analysis challenging, but overall, retail sales at both utilities are slightly below our full year forecasts. The bright spot here was the industrial class where sales were up 1.8% at Progress Energy Carolinas. 
Now I'll turn you to Slide 14, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low-usage accounts. Florida continues to show a steady uptick in customer growth. Florida had a net of 8,000 customers year-over-year, and the Carolinas added 7,000 customers year-over-year. Although Florida continues to show positive upward trends for the last 4 quarters, the Carolinas are still lagging historical trends in customer growth. 
Slide 15 includes some key items for you to be mindful of for earnings and cash flow for the rest of the year. We have $369 million of cost of removal obligation remaining at PEF to be utilized over the next 7 quarters. The one scheduled nuclear outage for 2011 has been completed at Brunswick. And recent storms in the Southeast will result in a charge to earnings in the $0.01 to $0.02 range in the second quarter. And finally, we are excluding merger and integration costs from ongoing earnings per share, and those were approximately $14 million in the first quarter, and those are primarily transaction costs. 
So before I turn it back to Bill for Q&A, let me recap by pointing out that we delivered first quarter EPS above plan despite tough weather comparisons. The rate settlement agreement at PEF through 2012 continues to provide us flexibility, and we've affirmed the 2011 ongoing EPS guidance for the full year of $3 to $3.20 per share and we're making solid progress on the regulatory approvals and merger integration planning. So we're excited about the prospects the merger brings but remain focused on delivering results for 2011. So Bill, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A."

We're glad you've joined the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Progress Energy. As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide highlights of first quarter financial results, an update on filings associated with our proposed merger with Duke Energy, an update on our nuclear fleet, especially our Crystal River unit, and some information on the impact of 2 rules recently proposed by the EPA. Then I'll ask Mark to provide some more detail on the numbers behind our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the first quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $202 million compared to $213 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per share basis, we're down $0.06 for the first quarter in 2010, principally due to more normal weather conditions this year compared to last. As you'll recall, last year's first quarter had $0.18 of favorable weather. So we had a strong quarter this year when you consider the return of normal weather. The economy in our service areas continued to show some modest recovery, particularly in the industrial sector. As Mark will address in more detail in a moment, growth in usage by class were mixed, as has been noted in several other recent calls.
So today, we're affirming our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share, which we announced earlier this year. Weather was a significant contributor last year, especially in Florida. We were able to offset the loss of weather-related sales this year with additional use of cost of removal amortization in Florida. And Mark will discuss the quarter earnings drivers in a few minutes.
Let me turn to a few comments on our pending merger with Duke Energy. Over the past several weeks, Duke Energy and Progress Energy have made a number of merger-related filings. As shown on the scorecard of Slide 5, we have now filed with all the state and federal agencies except the FCC. So we're making good progress in the regulatory filings. 
The North Carolina Utilities Commission recently set its schedule for review. Our testimony and additional supporting materials are due to be filed May 20 with evidentiary hearings beginning September 20. 
We made our initial Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing with the Department of Justice in late March, and a 30-day review period has expired. No additional request for information were received, so our obligations under the Act have been satisfied. And we'll update this scorecard as we move through the merger approval process. It's on our website and also on Duke's. 
Let me turn your attention to Slide 6 now. Given all that's going on both here and in Japan, I want to spend a few minutes on our nuclear fleet, which is shown on this slide. 
As a reminder, we have 5 reactors at 4 sites across our system. The Brunswick site is a 2-unit plant located near Wilmington, North Carolina. Several weeks ago, Unit 2 returned to service after successfully completing a refueling outage that included significant equipment additions and repairs. This the only refueling outage scheduled for our nuclear fleet this year. Unit 1 is currently on a 361-day run since its last refueling outage, so almost a full year of nonstop operation. 
The Harris unit near Raleigh continues its strong operating performance following its refueling outage last fall, which included replacing an electric generator and completing significant work on the cooling tower and fire protection modifications. The generator replacement, including tower work, are part of the power upgrade, a 5-year project that eventually will add 60 to 70 additional megawatts from that plant. These projects, along with others, are designed to ensure Harris will operate as a safe and reliable source of energy for decades to come. 
The Robinson Nuclear unit in South Carolina had an  atypical year in 2010. It had several forced outages, including one that involved a fire in the plant's electrical system, which required an extensive repair. As a result of last year's event, the NRC identified Robinson as a plant requiring additional oversight. 
We have made significant changes in the Robinson plant's leadership team and are implementing a comprehensive improvement plan. This plant has performed well since last returning to service in mid-November. And prior to last year's events, this plant had an extremely good performance record over many years. We are fully committed to the safe, reliable operation of this plant and to returning it to its historic levels of performance. 
Now let's turn our attention to Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida, where, as you know, we discovered a second delamination in the containment building in March. Work on the containment building was suspended in mid-March after monitoring equipment identified additional delamination that occurred after the concrete repair work was completed and during the late stages of retensioning the building. The unit will remain out of service while we conduct a thorough engineering analysis and review of the new delamination and evaluate repair options. We are well along in this evaluation process and should complete it over the next several weeks, and we'll be able to provide more detail at that time. 
Slide 7 presents the cost data for this outage through March 31. The potential repair options, which will be based on the engineering analysis, could range from repair of the impacted areas to replacement of a substantial portion of the concrete walls of the building. Repair options at all of the original licensing bases could require NRC approval. Once the repair options are known, there are many additional factors that will have to be considered, including, among other things, customer benefits, public regulatory and political support, adequate financial cost recovery mechanisms, the scope of insurance coverage for replacement power repair costs, and NRC renewal of the operating license. 
Crystal River 3's current operating license expires in December 2016, and we applied for a 20-year renewal of that license in 2008. Our current intention is to return this nuclear unit to service because it's an important part of providing power to our customers from a diverse portfolio of baseload generation. However, we cannot estimate a return to service state or cost to repair at this time. 
You can also see some details on insurance coverage of this unit on the bottom half of Slide 7. We maintain an insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. or NEIL. Following a 12-week deductible period, the NEIL program provides reimbursement for replacement power costs for 52 weeks at $4.5 million per week through April 9, 2011. An additional 71 weeks of coverage is provided at $3.6 million per week. So the NEIL program provides replacement power coverage up to $490 million per event. 
We also maintain insurance coverage through NEIL's accidental property damage program, which provides coverage up to $2.25 billion with a $10 million deductible per claim. We're continuing to work with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement power costs. 
In regulatory space, we will file an engineering status update with the Florida Public Service Commission by May 19. And, of course, we're also keeping in close contact with the NRC and other interested parties. 
So that's where we are with Crystal River 3 and our nuclear fleet as a whole. These units are important assets for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Being a nuclear owner and operator can carry significant responsibilities, and we take these very seriously. We are being rigorous about daily operations as well as continuous improvement as we learn from what happens throughout the industry, including in Japan. And we are being disciplined in working our action plans to ensure long-term success with our nuclear program. 
Now with Slide 8, I want to provide some insight into potential implications of 2 draft rules the EPA recently proposed: the Air Toxic (sic) [Toxics] rule, also known as the Utility MACT rule; and the Cooling Water Intake rule. I know many of you are following these issues and their impacts on the industry. 
We have not included cost estimates because these rules are not final. It will be the source of many comments during the review period. The proposed rules can change as a result of comments, as demonstrated by the recent industrial boiler MACT. And in our fleet, the cost implications of changes to the proposed rules could be substantial. We are evaluating our options, and we'll provide CapEx estimates and implementation timing after we have a clear sense of the final rules and of our compliance plans. 
I do think a fair comment on these proposed rules is that for much of the industry, they will be expensive and difficult to comply with in the time frame proposed. And it could have an impact on reliability if the rules are not carefully finalized. 
Slide 8 shows a breakdown of the relevant parts of our generation fleet and how many megawatts might be affected by these 2 proposed rules. The left half of the slide shows our coal- and oil-fired generation capacity, and how many megawatts might be affected by the Air Toxics rule, which the EPA proposed in March. 
As you can see from the chart, 27% of this fleet today does not have scrubbers or SCRs or is not currently scheduled for retirement. And we expect that even some of the well-controlled units will be affected by this rule. 
Between our 2 utilities, we've already invested more than $2 billion in environmental retrofits at our most efficient coal plants and, as a result, have achieved significant reductions in emissions. We also have announced closings of older, less efficient plants and have a fleet modernization program underway to build efficient combined cycle plants fueled by natural gas. These actions will result in even greater reductions in emissions. But this rule will still have a significant impact on our customers, whether it comes in the forms of additional controls, additional retirements and replacements or other solutions. We believe the EPA should fully utilize its discretion and authority to design flexibility into the final MACT standard. 
It's important to put this rule in the context of the unprecedented wave of federal regulations the utility industry now faces. Utilities need to be able to make the most efficient compliance decision to minimize the cumulative effect on customers while protecting the environment. 
The right half of Slide 8 shows a breakdown of the steam portion of our generation fleet, and how many megawatts might be affected by the Cooling Water Intake rule proposed in April. We're encouraged that the proposed rule provides some flexibility in addressing the entrainment of aquatic organisms when they pass through a plant's cooling system. There needs to be greater flexibility, however, regarding the impingement requirements when organisms are trapped against the outer part of a cooling water intake structure. 
This proposed rule will require a great deal of testing and data collection and interaction with state agencies before the final impact of the rule will become clear. As you can see from the slide, not a quite 1/3 of these generation assets have closed-cycle cooling. So again, this rule has a potential to have a significant impact. For both of these proposed rules, we support continued environmental improvement and cost-effective action to safeguard the environment. 
And now let me turn you to Slide 9, which is a summary of our key capital projects at the utilities. We continue to manage our new generation and Smart Grid projects in a very disciplined way to meet constant schedule targets. I'm pleased to report that our Richmonde County combined cycle gas plant is undergoing final testing and will be added to our generation fleet in the Carolinas in June. Now I'd like to ask Mark to provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter."

Those are on the heavy lifting, so I'm just going to go over the numbers, the topics that I'll cover outlined on Slide 10. And shifting to Slide 11, which shows our first quarter ongoing earnings. For the first quarter",593,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. Those are on the heavy lifting, so I'm just going to go over the numbers, the topics that I'll cover outlined on Slide 10. 
And shifting to Slide 11, which shows our first quarter ongoing earnings. For the first quarter 2011, we reported $0.69 versus $0.75 last year. The Carolinas were down $0.05, Florida was down $0.02 and the corporate and others category was $0.01 favorable. 
As Bill noted earlier, the big driver in the earnings variance was the impact of lower weather-related energy sales this quarter compared to 2010. Last year's first quarter had $0.18 of favorable weather across both utilities. On balance, this year's first quarter was normal in terms of weather compared to 2010, which was much colder. 
Slide 12 is our waterfall chart, which outlines the positive and negative drivers for the first quarter. The largest positive on the page is the amortization of the cost for removal obligation at PEF, which offsets the $0.17 negative weather variance. The other noteworthy item in the quarter is in the clauses and other margin category where we accrued an additional $15 million of estimated liability to joint owners at CR3 due to the extension of the outage resulting from the second delamination. 
Two items usually shown on the waterfall chart related to growth in usage in O&M. This quarter, neither item contribute to the earnings variance. We had $0.02 of positive earnings from growth in usage in the Carolinas, but that was offset by Florida. And the O&M comparison was flat as compared to last year's first quarter. 
Slide 13 shows our actual retail sales and the weather-adjusted comparisons to 2010. Again, unusually strong weather in 2010 makes the analysis challenging, but overall, retail sales at both utilities are slightly below our full year forecasts. The bright spot here was the industrial class where sales were up 1.8% at Progress Energy Carolinas. 
Now I'll turn you to Slide 14, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low-usage accounts. Florida continues to show a steady uptick in customer growth. Florida had a net of 8,000 customers year-over-year, and the Carolinas added 7,000 customers year-over-year. Although Florida continues to show positive upward trends for the last 4 quarters, the Carolinas are still lagging historical trends in customer growth. 
Slide 15 includes some key items for you to be mindful of for earnings and cash flow for the rest of the year. We have $369 million of cost of removal obligation remaining at PEF to be utilized over the next 7 quarters. The one scheduled nuclear outage for 2011 has been completed at Brunswick. And recent storms in the Southeast will result in a charge to earnings in the $0.01 to $0.02 range in the second quarter. And finally, we are excluding merger and integration costs from ongoing earnings per share, and those were approximately $14 million in the first quarter, and those were primarily transaction costs. 
So before I turn it back to Bill for Q&A, let me recap by pointing out that we delivered first quarter EPS above plan despite tough weather comparisons. The rate settlement agreement at PEF through 2012 continues to provide us flexibility, and we've affirmed the 2011 ongoing EPS guidance for the full year of $3 to $3.20 per share and we're making solid progress on the regulatory approvals and merger integration planning. So we're excited about the prospects the merger brings but remain focused on delivering results for 2011. So Bill, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A."

This morning, following opening comments from Bill and Mark, we will open the phone lines to address your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Johnson."

We're glad you've joined the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Progress Energy. As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide highlights of first quarter financial results, an update on filings associated with our proposed merger with Duke Energy, an update on our nuclear fleet, especially our Crystal River unit, and some information on the impact of 2 rules recently proposed by the EPA. Then I'll ask Mark to provide some more detail on the numbers behind our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the first quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $202 million compared to $213 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per share basis, we're down $0.06 for the first quarter in 2010, principally due to more normal weather conditions this year compared to last. As you'll recall, last year's first quarter had $0.18 of favorable weather. So we had a strong quarter this year when you consider the return of normal weather. The economy in our service areas continued to show some modest recovery, particularly in the industrial sector. As Mark will address in more detail in a moment, growth in usage by class were mixed, as has been noted in several other recent calls.
So today, we're affirming our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share, which we announced earlier this year. Weather was a significant contributor last year, especially in Florida. We were able to offset the loss of weather-related sales this year with additional use of cost of removal amortization in Florida. And Mark will discuss the quarter earnings drivers in a few minutes.
Let me turn to a few comments on our pending merger with Duke Energy. Over the past several weeks, Duke Energy and Progress Energy have made a number of merger-related filings. As shown on the scorecard of Slide 5, we have now filed with all the state and federal agencies except the FCC. So we're making good progress in the regulatory filings. 
The North Carolina Utilities Commission recently set its schedule for review. Our testimony and additional supporting materials are due to be filed May 20 with evidentiary hearings beginning September 20. 
We made our initial Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing with the Department of Justice in late March, and a 30-day review period has expired. No additional request for information were received, so our obligations under the Act have been satisfied. And we'll update this scorecard as we move through the merger approval process. It's on our website and also on Duke's. 
Let me turn your attention to Slide 6 now. Given all that's going on both here and in Japan, I want to spend a few minutes on our nuclear fleet, which is shown on this slide. 
As a reminder, we have 5 reactors at 4 sites across our system. The Brunswick site is a 2-unit plant located near Wilmington, North Carolina. Several weeks ago, Unit 2 returned to service after successfully completing a refueling outage that included significant equipment additions and repairs. This the only refueling outage scheduled for our nuclear fleet this year. Unit 1 is currently on a 361-day run since its last refueling outage, so almost a full year of nonstop operation. 
The Harris unit near Raleigh continues its strong operating performance following its refueling outage last fall, which included replacing an electric generator and completing significant work on the cooling tower and fire protection modifications. The generator replacement, including tower work, are part of the power upgrade, a 5-year project that eventually will add 60 to 70 additional megawatts from that plant. These projects, along with others, are designed to ensure Harris will operate as a safe and reliable source of energy for decades to come. 
The Robinson Nuclear unit in South Carolina had an  atypical year in 2010. It had several forced outages, including one that involved a fire in the plant's electrical system, which required an extensive repair. As a result of last year's event, the NRC identified Robinson as a plant requiring additional oversight. 
We have made significant changes in the Robinson plant's leadership team and are implementing a comprehensive improvement plan. This plant has performed well since last returning to service in mid-November. And prior to last year's events, this plant had an extremely good performance record over many years. We are fully committed to the safe, reliable operation of this plant and to returning it to its historic levels of performance. 
Now let's turn our attention to Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida, where, as you know, we discovered a second delamination in the containment building in March. Work on the containment building was suspended in mid-March after monitoring equipment identified additional delamination that occurred after the concrete repair work was completed and during the late stages of retensioning the building. The unit will remain out of service while we conduct a thorough engineering analysis and review of the new delamination and evaluate repair options. We are well along in this evaluation process and should complete it over the next several weeks, and we'll be able to provide more detail at that time. 
Slide 7 presents the cost data for this outage through March 31. The potential repair options, which will be based on the engineering analysis, could range from repair of the impacted areas to replacement of a substantial portion of the concrete walls of the building. Repair options at all of the original licensing bases could require NRC approval. Once the repair options are known, there are many additional factors that will have to be considered, including, among other things, customer benefits, public regulatory and political support, adequate financial cost recovery mechanisms, the scope of insurance coverage for replacement power repair costs, and NRC renewal of the operating license. 
Crystal River 3's current operating license expires in December 2016, and we applied for a 20-year renewal of that license in 2008. Our current intention is to return this nuclear unit to service because it's an important part of providing power to our customers from a diverse portfolio of baseload generation. However, we cannot estimate a return to service state or cost to repair at this time. 
You can also see some details on insurance coverage of this unit on the bottom half of Slide 7. We maintain an insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. or NEIL. Following a 12-week deductible period, the NEIL program provides reimbursement for replacement power costs for 52 weeks at $4.5 million per week through April 9, 2011. An additional 71 weeks of coverage is provided at $3.6 million per week. So the NEIL program provides replacement power coverage up to $490 million per event. 
We also maintain insurance coverage through NEIL's accidental property damage program, which provides coverage up to $2.25 billion with a $10 million deductible per claim. We're continuing to work with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement power costs. 
In regulatory space, we will file an engineering status update with the Florida Public Service Commission by May 19. And, of course, we're also keeping in close contact with the NRC and other interested parties. 
So that's where we are with Crystal River 3 and our nuclear fleet as a whole. These units are important assets for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Being a nuclear owner and operator can carry significant responsibilities, and we take these very seriously. We are being rigorous about daily operations as well as continuous improvement as we learn from what happens throughout the industry, including in Japan. And we are being disciplined in working our action plans to ensure long-term success with our nuclear program. 
Now with Slide 8, I want to provide some insight into potential implications of 2 draft rules the EPA recently proposed: the Air Toxic (sic) [Toxics] rule, also known as the Utility MACT rule; and the Cooling Water Intake rule. I know many of you are following these issues and their impacts on the industry. 
We have not included cost estimates because these rules are not final. It will be the source of many comments during the review period. The proposed rules can change as a result of comments, as demonstrated by the recent industrial boiler MACT. And in our fleet, the cost implications of changes to the proposed rules could be substantial. We are evaluating our options, and we'll provide CapEx estimates and implementation timing after we have a clear sense of the final rules and of our compliance plans. 
I do think a fair comment on these proposed rules is that for much of the industry, they will be expensive and difficult to comply with in the time frame proposed. And it could have an impact on reliability if the rules are not carefully finalized. 
Slide 8 shows a breakdown of the relevant parts of our generation fleet and how many megawatts might be affected by these 2 proposed rules. The left half of the slide shows our coal- and oil-fired generation capacity, and how many megawatts might be affected by the Air Toxics rule, which the EPA proposed in March. 
As you can see from the chart, 27% of this fleet today does not have scrubbers or SCRs or is not currently scheduled for retirement. And we expect that even some of the well-controlled units will be affected by this rule. 
Between our 2 utilities, we've already invested more than $2 billion in environmental retrofits at our most efficient coal plants and, as a result, have achieved significant reductions in emissions. We also have announced closings of older, less efficient plants and have a fleet modernization program underway to build efficient combined cycle plants fueled by natural gas. These actions will result in even greater reductions in emissions. But this rule will still have a significant impact on our customers, whether it comes in the forms of additional controls, additional retirements and replacements or other solutions. We believe the EPA should fully utilize its discretion and authority to design flexibility into the final MACT standard. 
It's important to put this rule in the context of the unprecedented wave of federal regulations the utility industry now faces. Utilities need to be able to make the most efficient compliance decision to minimize the cumulative effect on customers while protecting the environment. 
The right half of Slide 8 shows a breakdown of the steam portion of our generation fleet, and how many megawatts might be affected by the Cooling Water Intake rule proposed in April. We're encouraged that the proposed rule provides some flexibility in addressing the entrainment of aquatic organisms when they pass through a plant's cooling system. There needs to be greater flexibility, however, regarding the impingement requirements when organisms are trapped against the outer part of a cooling water intake structure. 
This proposed rule will require a great deal of testing and data collection and interaction with state agencies before the final impact of the rule will become clear. As you can see from the slide, not a quite 1/3 of these generation assets have closed-cycle cooling. So again, this rule has a potential to have a significant impact. For both of these proposed rules, we support continued environmental improvement and cost-effective action to safeguard the environment. 
And now let me turn you to Slide 9, which is a summary of our key capital projects at the utilities. We continue to manage our new generation and Smart Grid projects in a very disciplined way to meet constant schedule targets. I'm pleased to report that our Richmonde County combined cycle gas plant is undergoing final testing and will be added to our generation fleet in the Carolinas in June. Now I'd like to ask Mark to provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter."
258891,129486182,123107,"Progress Energy Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. Those are on the heavy lifting, so I'm just going to go over the numbers, the topics that I'll cover outlined on Slide 10. And shifting to Slide 11, which shows our first quarter ongoing earnings. For the first quarter",593,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. Those are on the heavy lifting, so I'm just going to go over the numbers, the topics that I'll cover outlined on Slide 10. 
And shifting to Slide 11, which shows our first quarter ongoing earnings. For the first quarter 2011, we reported $0.69 versus $0.75 last year. The Carolinas were down $0.05, Florida was down $0.02 and the corporate and others category was $0.01 favorable. 
As Bill noted earlier, the big driver in the earnings variance was the impact of lower weather-related energy sales this quarter compared to 2010. Last year's first quarter had $0.18 of favorable weather across both utilities. On balance, this year's first quarter was normal in terms of weather compared to 2010, which was much colder. 
Slide 12 is our waterfall chart, which outlines the positive and negative drivers for the first quarter. The largest positive on the page is the amortization of the cost for removal obligation at PEF, which offsets the $0.17 negative weather variance. The other noteworthy item in the quarter is in the clauses and other margin category where we accrued an additional $15 million of estimated liability to joint owners at CR3 due to the extension of the outage resulting from the second delamination. 
Two items usually shown on the waterfall chart related to growth in usage in O&M. This quarter, neither item contribute to the earnings variance. We had $0.02 of positive earnings from growth in usage in the Carolinas, but that was offset by Florida. And the O&M comparison was flat as compared to last year's first quarter. 
Slide 13 shows our actual retail sales and the weather-adjusted comparisons to 2010. Again, unusually strong weather in 2010 makes the analysis challenging, but overall, retail sales at both utilities are slightly below our full year forecasts. The bright spot here was the industrial class where sales were up 1.8% at Progress Energy Carolinas. 
Now I'll turn you to Slide 14, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low-usage accounts. Florida continues to show a steady uptick in customer growth. Florida had a net of 8,000 customers year-over-year, and the Carolinas added 7,000 customers year-over-year. Although Florida continues to show positive upward trends for the last 4 quarters, the Carolinas are still lagging historical trends in customer growth. 
Slide 15 includes some key items for you to be mindful of for earnings and cash flow for the rest of the year. We have $369 million of cost of removal obligation remaining at PEF to be utilized over the next 7 quarters. The one scheduled nuclear outage for 2011 has been completed at Brunswick. And recent storms in the Southeast will result in a charge to earnings in the $0.01 to $0.02 range in the second quarter. And finally, we are excluding merger and integration costs from ongoing earnings per share, and those were approximately $14 million in the first quarter, and those were primarily transaction costs. 
So before I turn it back to Bill for Q&A, let me recap by pointing out that we delivered first quarter EPS above plan despite tough weather comparisons. The rate settlement agreement at PEF through 2012 continues to provide us flexibility, and we've affirmed the 2011 ongoing EPS guidance for the full year of $3 to $3.20 per share and we're making solid progress on the regulatory approvals and merger integration planning. So we're excited about the prospects the merger brings but remain focused on delivering results for 2011. So Bill, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A."

I know it's a crowded earnings calendar for you today so we'll dial right in. Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide highlights of the second quarter and year-to-date financial results along with an update on our proposed merger with Duke Energy. I'll also update you on our nuclear fleet and comment on the NRC's near-term task force recommendations, as well as the EPA rules in our major capital projects. Then Mark Mulhern will provide more detail on our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the second quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $211 million, compared to $181 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per-share basis, we're up $0.08 from the second quarter 2010. Primary drivers of the gain were lower depreciation and amortization expense in Florida and increased costs in other margins. And these were partially offset by unfavorable retail growth in usage in the Carolinas and lower wholesale revenues in Florida. 
Based on our performance for the first half of the year and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. On a merger front, we continued to make good progress towards closing the merger transaction with Duke Energy by the end of the year. Earlier this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission conditionally approved the merger. As you can see on Slide 5, we have now filed with all of the required state and federal agencies and are moving to the approval steps with each agency. We filed our testimony in North Carolina on May 20, and are now responding to data requests from the intervening parties. The hearing in Raleigh starts on September 20. 
In South Carolina, the discovery process has begun and we're responding to data request. The final date for parties to file for intervention is August 8, and we'll be filing our testimony in South Carolina in the near future. The commission there has not yet set a hearing today. Meanwhile, we'll hold a special merger vote meeting of our shareholders on August 23. Likewise, the Duke Energy will hold a similar meeting with shareholders on the same day. 
Now if you turn to Slide 6, which provide information about our nuclear unit in the Carolinas. Through July, these reactors had a 95.2% capacity factor and that includes one planned refueling outage. The Robinson plant continues to demonstrate solid performance following the atypical performance of last year. The plant is down line for more than 258 consecutive days since returning to service. This last quarter, the NRC completed 2 in-depth special inspections at Robinson. And the feedback was positive and reflected the marked improvement in the plant's performance. The plant is still executing on its improvement plan and we will continue our management focus to ensure it reaches and sustains the desired operating performance I know they are capable of achieving. 
On this slide, we have provided a listing of several major construction projects at the plants. I highlight these projects to show efforts completed are under way to improve the plants. As you know, the NRC's near-term task force recently reported on its assessment of U.S. nuclear operations following the Fukushima accident. The headline is that the nuclear plants in this country are safe but we should incorporate the lessons learned from the March event at Fukushima. The NRC has not to determine a specific response and what the timing will be for new requirement. The progress energy we've conducted detailed inspections and reviews at each of our nuclear facilities to ensure we can effectively respond to extreme challenges of all sorts. And in some cases we've already strengthened our processes to incorporate these lessons learned. We recognize to maintain the highest levels of safety and security, we must continually adapt and improve our practices. Along with the other nuclear operators, we will continue to support industry initiatives that evolve as we learn more about Fukushima. We believe a systematic analysis of root causes needs to be completed and thoroughly reviewed before the enactment of new rules and regulations. 
Now, let's turn to repair outage in our Crystal River nuclear unit in Florida. As we discussed on our last quarter's call, we suspended repair work on the containment building in mid-March after identifying additional concrete delamination. We conducted a thorough engineering analysis and review the structure and evaluated a wide range of repair options. On June 27, we presented our findings to the Florida Public Service Commission, including our recommendation to repair the structure and return the plant to service. This specific repair options selected would entail systematically removing and replacing concrete in the containment structure walls. The preliminary cost of this estimates for this repair is between $900 million and $1.3 billion and it would enable us to return the unit to service in 2014. Based on what we know today, we continue to believe this approach is better for our Florida customers than retiring and replacing the plant. As I said in June, we are approaching this situation in a very disciplined way and continue to assess cost and feasibility at every step. We and several intervening parties met with the Florida Commission's pre-hearing officer on July 14. We discussed the procedural timeline for reviewing the preventative of actions associated with initial steam generator replacement in the fall of 2009 and with the containment building repair work. Since then, we have met with interveners and then attempt to reach agreement on a procedural timeline. And other status meeting with the prehearing officer is scheduled for August 8, and we intend to submit a scheduled proposal before that hearing. 
Slide 7 presents the cost of data for this outage through June 30. We're still conducting engineering analysis and developing the documents for the engineering and repair work. Also, a major effort is underway to prepare the plant's infrastructure for the repair work, as well as to ensure the major equipment systems are properly maintained throughout the outage period. You can see some details on insurance coverage on the bottom half of Slide 7. We maintain insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through Neil. Following the 12-week deductible period, the Neil program provides reimbursement for replacement power costs for 52 weeks at $4.5 million per week through April 2009 this year. An additional 71 weeks of coverage is provided at $3.6 million per week. So the Neil program provides replacement power coverage up to $490 million per event. We also maintained insurance coverage through Neil's accidental property damage program, which provides coverage of up to $2.25 billion with a $10 million deductible per claim. We are continuing to work with Neil for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement power costs. 
Now if you turn to Slide 8. An EPA is air pollution rule known as Casper. This final rule replaces the Clean Air Interstate Rule and it affects 27 states. The first compliance period under this rule begins in 2012. Now, Casper has a lot of complexity to it and we're still evaluating it. What is clear is that this final version has some significant differences from the proposed rule and overall, it is decidedly more stringent. For example, state budgeted allowance allocations were modified and in most cases were lower than in the proposed rule. Florida's ozone season allocation is about 50% less than in the proposed rule and in North Carolina SO2 allocations in 2014 are about 30% lower. The reason for this is in part is that the EPA changed the unit level allocation to a fuel neutral methodology based on heat input. And so coal-fired units were allocated significantly fewer allowances and gas-fired units more allowances. In addition, the state insurance limits are the caps begin 2 years earlier. In some states having additional reduction of allocation in 2014. 
So what does all this mean for Progress Energy? As I've said, we're still assessing the impact but will likely affect our resource plans and how we operate this system. Fortunately the impact will be mitigated somewhat because when we began our fleet modernization several years ago. In North Carolina we spent $1.2 billion on approximately 3,500 megawatts of coal-fired capacity to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions with a significant mercury co benefit. In addition, we've announced the retirement of our 11 uncontrolled North Carolina coal units for about 1,500 megawatts and we'll be replacing this coal capacity with new clean and efficient natural gas-fired capacity. Even with these steps, and with the fleet modernization, the more stringent standards might require us to own the dispatcher Carolina's fleet for the purchase emission allowances were feasible in order to comply with Casper. 
Meanwhile, in Florida we spent $1.2 billion on approximately 1,400 megawatts at Crystal River fortified to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions, again, with the significant mercury co-benefit. Despite this successful project, we have approximately 2,000 megawatts of uncontrolled coal and oil-fired capacity in Florida. It remains a risk of compliance under the NOx ozone season program. So at this point, we know that the air pollution rule will mean incremental cost for compliance through emission allowances, higher natural gas-fired plants, and potential environmental controls or replacement capacity especially in Florida. 
Slide 9, which we've shown you before, illustrates how the EPA's proposed utility natural and water intake rule will affect our fleet. The macro is expected to be finalized this November. And actually, the common period on that rule ends today. Again, our fleet modernization efforts have put us in a comparatively better position to comply with these requirements, but these rules with increase cost to our customers. I think it's fair to say that the combined effect of the EPA's recent and pending rules will be significant for our company and industry and there are more requirements in the pipeline. 
Turning now to our major capital projects on Slide 10. We're making excellent progress in modernizing our power system. On May 20, we down on our new combined cycle natural gas plant at the Sutton site. This unit is scheduled to be online in December 2013. Our newest plant, the Richmond County combined cycle began service nearly June. We continue to manage our system modernization projects in a disciplined way to meet constant schedule targets. So now I'd like to ask Mark Mulhern to provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter. Mark?"

I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 11. So if we start with Slide 12 which shows our second quarter ongoing earnings. For the second quarter 2011, we reported $0.71 versus $0.63 last year. Progress Energy Carolinas",1219,"Thank you, Bill and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 11. So if we start with Slide 12 which shows our second quarter ongoing earnings. For the second quarter 2011, we reported $0.71 versus $0.63 last year. Progress Energy Carolinas was down $0.02, Florida was up $0.07 and the corporate and other category was $0.03 favorable. The main drivers for the quarter were in clauses and other margins, amortization of the cost removal obligation in Florida, and slight positives in O&M and interest expense. 
On balance, this year's second quarter was above normal in terms of weather, but compared to 2010 weather accounted for $0.02 of negativity. 
Going to Slide 13 is our waterfall chart which outlines the positive and negative drivers for the second quarter. See there, our largest positive on the page is the $0.09 benefit associated with the amortization of the cost removal obligation at PEF. The $0.06 positive variance and clauses in other margin is comprised of $0.03 of PEC from expanding demand-side management programs and $0.03 in margins at PEF, partially related to lower joint owner replacement power costs related to the CO3 outage. So for the quarter, we had a positive impact of $0.02 from lower O&M and $0.02 pick up from lower interest costs. 
On the negative side, they were a number of $0.02 items that reduced earnings. The growth in usage item was comprised of $0.01 positive in Florida but a negative $0.03 in the Carolinas. Now I'll address this in just a few moments. During our update call on Crystal River 3 on June 28, we indicated that we would be reserving $45 million pretax for the indemnification cost for future years joint-owner replacement power costs. Because this charge relates to 2012 and 2013, we have excluded it from ongoing earnings as a one-time charge and it amounts to a $0.09 charge to GAAP earnings in the quarter. 
Now, I'll turn to the first half of the year variances that are summarized on Slide 14 which is our year-to-date waterfall chart. Just a couple of brief points here. Year-to-date we have utilized a total of $134 million in cost removal amortization in Florida. That leaves a balance of $338 million that we can realize over the next 18 months. Then you see the reversal, a very strong weather we had it 2010 which accounts for a negative $0.19 item, and the clauses and other margin, AFUDC equity and O&M were the other positives for the first half of the year and we're offset by slight negative variances in wholesale growth, wholesaling growth and usage and dilution from shares issued in 2010. 
Slide 15, shows our weather-adjusted retail sales. And this slide is different from the way we traditionally shown it and different from the presentation on Page S4 of the earnings release. We elected to show it this way with the unbilled adjustment allocated to the customer classes because our unbilled variances Progress Energy Carolinas is larger than normal. Extreme weather and the way the billing cycle on the calendar impacted the unbilled amounts at the quarter end. So there are 3 key points on this slide. The first point relates to the very significant impacts of weather on retail sales in both utilities for the periods being compared. You'll recall that 2010 was a very strong weather year at both utilities. And as you could see, weather is 3% of the total 4% variance at PEC and 5.6% of the total 6.1% variance in total retail sales at PEF. 
The second point is a recognition that our growth in usage numbers are trailing our forecast at the halfway point of the year. So we are behind our planned by 1.8% at PEC and 1.2% at PEF. Lower-than-expected customer growth has been the larger variance with that usage being closer to our expectations. The third and final point is, it is still early in the year with our largest revenue and earnings quarter in front of us. Therefore I would not jump to conclusions based on this data. We expect these numbers to improve in the second half of 2011 and have seen some early signs of that improvement in July with an increase of approximately 2,000 new customer accounts at PEC, but still expect the full year to be weaker than our forecast with the return to normal sales growth still further down the road. 
Our industrial customers show strong recovery in 2010 and in early 2011. So strong gains were seen in the metal and paper industries and coupled with the strong rebound in the textile industries. Starting in the second quarter of this year, our customers began reporting increasing inventories and excess capacity. And some has instituted shorter operating hours. Our experience is consistent with some of the recent economic data reflecting a slowing economy and not the steady recovery we had all hoped for. 
So now let's turn to Slide 16, which is our standard slide on the customer growth and low usage accounts. Florida continues to show a positive trend in customer growth. Florida had a net addition of 8,000 customers year-over-year and the Carolinas added 6,000 customers year-over-year. Over the last 3 quarters, though, Florida appears to have leveled up its growth trajectory and the Carolinas are still lagging historical trends in customer growth. We are still not seeing any strength in the region in terms of new customer growth. 
So on Slide 17, just highlight a number of points that you should consider regarding our results for the full year of 2011. By the trailing 12-month basis, our ongoing earnings of $3.09, well within our 2011 guidance range. Second half weather in 2010 was $0.26 favorable, so weather it will make for a tougher comparison for the second half of 2011. We have, however, gotten off to a good start with about a $0.05 positive pick up and weather for the month of July and August is predicted to be very warm as well. The positive weather variances will help us preserve costs or removal flexibility for 2012, the final year of our settlement agreement in Florida. 
I know when I am last year, we had 109 nuclear outage days with lengthy downtime at Robinson and the plant refueling and maintenance outage at Harris. We don't have any planned outages in the second half of this year, and this should result in lower O&M cost when compared to last year. And finally, we will continue to utilize the cost to removal amortization that we have in Florida. So all in all, we expect to deliver ongoing results in our guidance range of $3.20. But before I turn it back over to Bill for questions, let me just note that the substantial integration, planning and regulatory work related to the merger with Duke has not impacted our focus on execution and delivering results. Our nuclear performance has shown significant improvement, the regulatory flexibility in Florida continues to help offset significant weather variances and we are carefully and deliberately addressing our challenges at Crystal River 3. Consistency in performance is what you have come to expect but it is especially noteworthy in light of the significant merger activities. So now, I'll turn it back over to Bill for questions and answers."

I know it's a crowded earnings calendar for you today so we'll dive right in. Slide 3 indicates -- I'll provide highlights of the second quarter and year-to-date financial results along with an update on our proposed merger with Duke Energy. I'll also update you on our nuclear fleet and comment on the NRC's Near-term Task Force recommendations, as well as the EPA rules on our major capital projects. Then Mark Mulhern will provide more detail on our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the second quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $211 million, compared to $181 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per-share basis, we're up $0.08 from the second quarter 2010. Primary drivers of the gain were lower depreciation and amortization expense in Florida and increased costs in other margins. And these were partially offset by unfavorable retail growth in usage in the Carolinas and lower wholesale revenues in Florida. 
Based on our performance for the first half of the year and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2011 ongoing earning guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. On the merger front, we continue making good progress towards closing the merger transaction with Duke Energy by the end of the year. Earlier this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission conditionally approved the merger. As you can see on Slide 5, we have now filed with all of the required state and federal agencies and are moving to the approval steps with each agency. We filed our testimony in North Carolina on May 20, and are now responding to data request from the intervening parties. The hearing in Raleigh starts on September 20. 
In South Carolina, the discovery process has begun and we're responding to data request. The final date for parties to file for intervention is August 8, and we'll be filing our testimony in South Carolina in the near future. The commission there has not yet set a hearing date. Meanwhile, we'll hold a special merger vote meeting of our shareholders on August 23. Likewise, Duke Energy will hold a similar meeting with its shareholders on the same day. 
Now if you turn to Slide 6, which provides information about our nuclear units in the Carolinas. Through July, these reactors had a 95.2% capacity factor and that includes 1 plant refueling outage. The Robinson plant continues to demonstrate solid performance following the atypical performance of last year. The plant has been online for more than 258 consecutive days since returning to service. This last quarter, the NRC completed 2 in-depth special inspections at Robinson. And the feedback was positive and reflected the marked improvement in the plant's performance. The plant is still executing on its improvement plan and we will continue our management focus to ensure it reaches and sustains the desired operating performance I know they are capable of achieving. 
On this slide, we have provided a listing of several major construction projects at the plants. I highlight these projects to show efforts completed are under way to improve the plants. Now as you know, the NRC's Near-term Task Force recently reported on its assessment of U.S. nuclear operations following the Fukushima accident. The headline is that the nuclear plants in this country are safe, but we should incorporate the lessons learned from the March event at Fukushima. The NRC has not yet determined its specific response and what the timing will be for any new requirements. At progress energy, we've conducted detailed inspections and reviews at each of our nuclear facilities to ensure we can effectively respond to extreme challenges of all sorts. And in some cases we've already strengthened our processes to incorporate these lessons learned. We recognize that maintain the highest levels of safety and security, we must continually adapt and improve our practices. Along with the other nuclear operators, we will continue to support industry initiatives that evolve as we learn more about Fukushima. We believe a systematic analysis of root causes needs to be completed and thoroughly reviewed before the enactment of new rules and regulations. 
Now, let's turn to the repair outage in our Crystal River nuclear unit in Florida. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we suspended repair work on the containment building in mid-March after identifying additional concrete delamination. We conducted a thorough engineering analysis and review of the structure, and evaluated a wide range of repair options. On June 27, we presented our findings to the Florida Public Service Commission, including our recommendation to repair the structure and return the plant to service. This specific repair options selected would entail systematically removing and replacing concrete in the containment structure walls. The preliminary cost estimates for this repair is between $900 million and $1.3 billion and it would enable us to return the unit to service in 2014. Based on what we know today, we continue to believe this approach is better for our Florida customers than retiring and replacing their plant. But as I said in June, we're approaching this situation in a very disciplined way, and continue to assess cost and feasibility at every step. We, and several intervening parties, met with the Florida Commission's pre-hearing officer on July 14. We discussed the procedural timeline for reviewing the prudence of actions associated with the initial steam generator replacement in the fall of 2009 and with the containment building repair work. Since then, we have met with the intervenors in an attempt to reach agreement on a procedural timeline. Another status meeting with the prehearing officer is scheduled for August 8, and we intend to submit a scheduled proposal before that hearing. 
Slide 7 presents the cost data for this outage through June 30. We're still conducting engineering analysis and developing bid documents for the engineering and repair work. Also, a major effort is underway to prepare the plant's infrastructure for the repair work, as well as to ensure the major equipment systems are properly maintained throughout the outage period. You can see some details on insurance coverage on the bottom half of Slide 7. We maintain insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through NEIL. Following a 12-week deductible period, the NEIL program provides reimbursement for replacement power cost for 52 weeks at $4.5 million per week through April 9 of this year. An additional 71 weeks of coverage is provided at $3.6 million per week. So the NEIL program provides replacement power coverage up to $490 million per event. We also maintain insurance coverage through NEIL's accidental property damage program, which provides coverage of up to $2.25 billion, with a $10 million deductible per claim. We are continuing to work with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair cost and associated replacement power cost. 
Now if you turn to Slide 8, an EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule known as CSAPR. This final rule replaces the Clean Air Interstate Rule and it affects 27 states. The first compliance period under this rule begins in 2012. Now, CSAPR has a lot of complexity to it, and we're still evaluating it. What is clear is that this final version has some significant differences from the proposed rule and overall, it is decidedly more stringent. For example, state-budgeted allowance allocations were modified, and in most cases are lower than in the proposed rule. Florida's NOx ozone season allocation is about 50% less than in the proposed rule, and in North Carolina SO2 allocations in 2014 are about 30% lower. The reason for this in part, is that the EPA changed the unit level allocation to a fuel neutral methodology based on heat input. And so coal-fired units were allocated significantly fewer allowances, and gas-fired units more allowances. In addition, the state insurance limits or the caps begin 2 years earlier. In some states having additional reduction of NOx allocation in 2014. 
So what does all these mean for Progress Energy? As I've said, we're still assessing the impact, but will likely affect our resource plans and how we operate this system. Fortunately the impact will be mitigated somewhat, because when we began our fleet modernization several years ago. In North Carolina, we've spent $1.2 billion on approximately 3,500 megawatts of coal-fired capacity to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions with a significant Mercury Co-benefit. In addition, we've announced the retirement of our 11 uncontrolled North Carolina coal units for about 1,500 megawatts and we'll be replacing this coal capacity with new clean and efficient natural gas-fired capacity. But even with these steps, and with the fleet modernization, the more stringent standards might require us to all of  the dispatch of Carolina's fleet or the purchase emission allowances were feasible in order to comply with CSAPR. 
Meanwhile, in Florida we spent $1.2 billion on approximately 1,400 megawatts at Crystal River 4 and 5 to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions, again, with the significant Mercury Co-Benefit. Despite this successful project, we have approximately 2,000 megawatts of uncontrolled coal and oil-fired capacity in Florida. It remains at risk of compliance under the NOx ozone season program. So at this point, we know that the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule will mean incremental cost for compliance through emission allowances, higher our natural gas-fired plants, and potential environmental controls or replacement capacity, especially in Florida. 
Slide 9, which we've shown you before, illustrates how the EPA's proposed utility MAT rule and water intake rule will affect our fleet. The MAT rule is expected to be finalized this November, and actually, the comment period on that rule ends today. Again, our fleet modernization efforts have put us in a comparatively better position to comply with these requirements, but these rules will increase cost to our customers. I think it's fair to say that the combined effects of EPA's recent and pending rules will be significant for our company and industry, and there are more requirements in the pipeline. 
Turning now to our major capital projects on Slide 10. We're making excellent progress in modernizing our power system. On May 20, we brogue on our new combined-cycle natural gas plant at the Sutton site. This unit is scheduled to be online in December 2013. Our newest plant, the Richmond County combined-cycle began service in early June. We continue to manage our system modernization projects in a disciplined way to meet constant scheduled targets. So now I'd like to ask Mark Mulhern to provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter. Mark?"
258891,136995957,152378,"Progress Energy Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 11. So if we start with Slide 12 which shows our second quarter ongoing earnings, for the second quarter 2011, we reported $0.71 versus $0.63 last year. Progress Energy Carolinas",1222,"Thank you, Bill and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 11. So if we start with Slide 12 which shows our second quarter ongoing earnings, for the second quarter 2011, we reported $0.71 versus $0.63 last year. Progress Energy Carolinas was down $0.02, Florida was up $0.07 and the Corporate and other category was $0.03 favorable. The main drivers for the quarter were in clauses and other margins, amortization of the cost for removal obligation in Florida, and slight positives in O&M and interest expense. 
On balance, this year's second quarter was above normal in terms of weather, but compared to 2010 weather, accounted for $0.02 of negativity. 
Going to Slide 13 is our waterfall chart which outlines the positive and negative drivers for the second quarter. You see there, the largest positive on the page is the $0.09-benefit associated with the amortization of the cost for removal obligation at PEF. The $0.06 positive variance and clauses in other margin is comprised of $0.03 of PEC from expanding demand-side management programs and $0.03 in margins at PEF, partially related to lower joint-owner replacement power costs related to the CR3 outage. So for the quarter, we had a positive impact of $0.02 from lower O&M and $0.02 pick up from lower interest costs. 
On the negative side, there were a number of $0.02-items that reduced earnings. The growth in usage item was comprised of $0.01 positive in Florida, but a negative $0.03 in the Carolinas, and I will address this in just a few moments. During our update call on the Crystal River 3 on June 28, we indicated that we would be reserving $45 million pretax for the indemnification cost for future year's joint-owner replacement power costs. Because this charge relates to 2012 and 2013, we have excluded it from ongoing earnings as a one-time charge, and it amounts to a $0.09-charge to GAAP earnings in the quarter. 
Now, I'll turn to the first half of the year variances that are summarized on Slide 14, which is our year-to-date waterfall chart. Just a couple of brief points here. Year-to-date, we have utilized a total of $134 million in cost for removal amortization in Florida. That leaves a balance of $338 million that we can utilize over the next 18 months. Then as you see the reversal of very strong weather we had it 2010 which accounts for a negative $0.19 item, and then the clauses and other margin, AFUDC equity and O&M were the other positives for the first half of the year, and were offset by slight negative variances in wholesaling growth and usage, and dilution from shares issued in 2010. 
Slide 15, shows our weather-adjusted retail sales. And this slide is different from the way we traditionally shown it and different from the presentation on Page S4 of the earnings release. And we elected to show it this way with the unbilled adjustment allocated to the customer classes, because our unbilled variance at Progress Energy Carolinas is larger than normal. Extreme weather and the way the billing cycles fall on the calendar impacted the unbilled amounts at the quarter end, so there are 3 key points on this slide. The first point relates to the very significant impacts of weather on retail sales in both utilities for the periods being compared. You will recall that 2010 was a very strong weather-year at both utilities. And as you can see, weather is 3% of the total 4% variance at PEC and 5.6% of the total 6.1% variance in total retail sales at PEF. 
The second point is a recognition that our growth in usage numbers are trailing our forecast at the halfway point of the year, so we are behind our plan by 1.8% at PEC and 1.2% at PEF. Lower-than-expected customer growth has been the larger variance, with usage being closer to our expectations. The third and final point is, it is still early in the year, with our largest revenue and earnings quarter in front of us. Therefore, I would not jump to conclusions based on this data. We expect these numbers to improve in the second half of 2011 and we have seen some early signs of that improvement in July with an increase of approximately 2,000 new customer accounts at PEC, but still expect the full year to be weaker than our forecast with the return to normal sales growth still further down the road. 
Our industrial customers show the strong recovery in 2010 and in early 2011. So strong gains were seen in the metal and paper industries, and coupled with the strong rebound in the textile industries. Starting in the second quarter of this year, our customers began reporting increasing inventories and excess capacity, and some have instituted shorter operating hours. Our experience is consistent with some of the recent economic data reflecting a slowing economy, and not the steady recovery we had all hoped for. 
So now let's turn to Slide 16, which is our standard slide on the customer growth and low-usage accounts. Florida continues to show a positive trend in customer growth. Florida had a net addition of 8,000 customers year-over-year and the Carolinas added 6,000 customers year-over-year. Over the last 3 quarters though, Florida appears to have leveled up its growth trajectory and the Carolinas are still lagging historical trends in customer growth. We are still not seeing any strength in the region in terms of new customer growth. 
So on Slide 17, just highlight of number of points that you should consider regarding our results for the full year of the 2011. On a trailing 12-month basis, our ongoing earnings are $3.09, well within our 2011 guidance range. Second half weather in 2010 was $0.26 favorable, so weather will make for a tough comparison for the second half of 2011. We have, however, gotten off to a good start with about a $0.05 positive pick up in weather for the month of July, and August is predicted to be very warm as well. The positive weather variances will help us preserve costs for removal flexibility for 2012, the final year of our settlement agreement in Florida. 
On O&M last year, we had 109 nuclear outage days with lengthy downtime at Robinson and the plant refueling and maintenance outage at Harris. We do not have any plant outages in the second half of this year, and this should result in lower O&M cost when compared to last year. And finally, we will continue to utilize the cost for removal amortization that we have in Florida. So all in all, we expect to deliver ongoing results in our guidance range of $3.20, but before I turn it back over to Bill for questions, let me just note that the substantial integration, planning and regulatory work related to the merger with Duke has not impacted our focus on execution and delivering results. Our nuclear performance has shown significant improvement, the regulatory flexibility in Florida continues to help offset significant weather variances, and we are carefully and deliberately addressing our challenges at Crystal River 3. Consistency in performance is what you have come to expect, but it is especially noteworthy in light of the significant merger activities. So now, I'll turn it back over to Bill for questions and answers."

But in general, I don't think it's a big impact in the wholesale markets. For us, you're exactly right, we do have some oil in Florida. We reduced that substantially when we converted Bartow toward natural gas. You have several options here. The oil plants really haven't been heavily implicated by the EPA regulations until you got to the CSAPR rule. I think that's drawing a beat on the oil plants. So you can try to control them. We do have dual-fuel capability at Anclote, so we can convert to natural gas and get off oil there. Or you can build replacement capacity. So the dual-fuel capability at Anclote will be a big help to us, I think, and help resolve some of the CSAPR problems.

I know it's a crowded earnings calendar for you today so we'll dive right in. Slide 3 indicates -- I'll provide highlights of the second quarter and year-to-date financial results along with an update on our proposed merger with Duke Energy. I'll also update you on our nuclear fleet and comment on the NRC's Near-term Task Force recommendations, as well as the EPA rules in our major capital projects. Then Mark Mulhern will provide more detail on our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the second quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $211 million, compared to $181 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per-share basis, we're up $0.08 from the second quarter 2010. Primary drivers of the gain were lower depreciation and amortization expense in Florida and increased clauses in other margins. And these were partially offset by unfavorable retail growth in usage in the Carolinas and lower wholesale revenues in Florida. 
Based on our performance for the first half of the year and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2011 ongoing earning guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. On the merger front, we continue making good progress towards closing the merger transaction with Duke Energy by the end of the year. Earlier this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission conditionally approved the merger. As you can see on Slide 5, we have now filed with all of the required state and federal agencies and are moving through the approval steps with each agency. We filed our testimony in North Carolina on May 20, and are now responding to data requests from the intervening parties. The hearing in Raleigh starts on September 20. 
In South Carolina, the discovery process has begun and we are responding to data request. The final date for parties to file for intervention is August 8, and we'll be filing our testimony in South Carolina in the near future. The commission there has not yet set a hearing date. Meanwhile, we'll hold a special merger vote meeting of our shareholders on August 23. Likewise, Duke Energy will hold a similar meeting with its shareholders on the same day. 
Now if you'll turn to Slide 6, which provides information about our nuclear units in the Carolinas. Through July, these reactors had a 95.2% capacity factor and that includes 1 plant refueling outage. The Robinson plant continues to demonstrate solid performance following the atypical performance of last year. The plant has been online for more than 258 consecutive days since returning to service. This last quarter, the NRC completed 2 in-depth special inspections at Robinson. And the feedback was positive and reflected the marked improvement in the plant's performance. The plant is still executing on its improvement plan and we will continue our management focus to ensure it reaches and sustains the desired operating performance I know they are capable of achieving. 
On this slide, we have provided a listing of several major construction projects at the plants. I highlight these projects to show efforts completed or under way to improve the plants. Now as you know, the NRC's Near-term Task Force recently reported on its assessment of U.S. nuclear operations following the Fukushima accident. The headline is that the nuclear plants in this country are safe, but we should incorporate the lessons learned from the March event at Fukushima. The NRC has not yet determined its specific response and what the timing will be for any new requirements. At Progress Energy, we've conducted detailed inspections and reviews at each of our nuclear facilities to ensure we can effectively respond to extreme challenges of all sorts. And in some cases we've already strengthened our processes to incorporate these lessons learned. We recognize that to maintain the highest levels of safety and security, we must continually adapt and improve our practices. Along with the other nuclear operators, we will continue to support industry initiatives that evolve as we learn more about Fukushima. We believe a systematic analysis of root causes needs to be completed and thoroughly reviewed before the enactment of new rules and regulations. 
Now, let's turn to the repair outage at our Crystal River nuclear unit in Florida. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we suspended repair work on the containment building in mid-March after identifying additional concrete delamination. We conducted a thorough engineering analysis and review of the structure, and evaluated a wide range of repair options. On June 27, we presented our findings to the Florida Public Service Commission, including our recommendation to repair the structure and return the plant to service. This specific repair option selected would entail systematically removing and replacing concrete in the containment structure walls. The preliminary cost estimates for this repair is between $900 million and $1.3 billion and it would enable us to return the unit to service in 2014. Based on what we know today, we continue to believe this approach is better for our Florida customers than retiring and replacing the plant. But as I said in June, we're approaching this situation in a very disciplined way, and continue to assess cost and feasibility at every step. We and several intervening parties met with the Florida Commission's pre-hearing officer on July 14. We discussed the procedural timeline for reviewing the prudence of actions associated with the initial steam generator replacement in the fall of 2009 and with the containment building repair work. Since then, we have met with the intervenors in an attempt to reach agreement on a procedural timeline. Another status meeting with the prehearing officer is scheduled for August 8, and we intend to submit a scheduled proposal before that hearing. 
Slide 7 presents the cost data for this outage through June 30. We're still conducting engineering analysis and developing bid documents for the engineering and repair work. Also, a major effort is under way to prepare the plant's infrastructure for the repair work, as well as to ensure the major equipment systems are properly maintained throughout the outage period. You can see some details on insurance coverage on the bottom half of Slide 7. We maintain insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through NEIL. Following a 12-week deductible period, the NEIL program provided reimbursement for replacement power cost for 52 weeks at $4.5 million per week through April 9 of this year. An additional 71 weeks of coverage is provided at $3.6 million per week. So the NEIL program provides replacement power coverage up to $490 million per event. We also maintain insurance coverage through NEIL's accidental property damage program, which provides coverage of up to $2.25 billion, with a $10 million deductible per claim. We are continuing to work with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement power costs. 
Now if you turn to Slide 8, and the EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule known as CSAPR. This final rule replaces the Clean Air Interstate Rule and it affects 27 states. The first compliance period under this rule begins in 2012. Now, CSAPR has a lot of complexity to it, and we're still evaluating it. What is clear is that this final version has some significant differences from the proposed rule and overall, it is decidedly more stringent. For example, state-budgeted allowance allocations were modified, and in most cases are lower than in the proposed rule. Florida's NOx ozone season allocation is about 50% less than in the proposed rule, and in North Carolina SO2 allocations in 2014 are about 30% lower. The reason for this in part, is that the EPA changed the unit level allocation to a fuel neutral methodology based on heat input. And so coal-fired units were allocated significantly fewer allowances, and gas-fired units more allowances. In addition, the state assurance limits or the caps begin 2 years earlier. And some states having additional reduction of NOx allocations in 2014. 
So what does all these mean for Progress Energy? As I've said, we're still assessing the impact, but it will likely affect our resource plans and how we operate this system. Fortunately the impact will be mitigated somewhat, because we began our fleet modernization several years ago. In North Carolina, we've spent $1.2 billion on approximately 3,500 megawatts of coal-fired capacity to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions with a significant Mercury Co-benefit. In addition, we've announced the retirement of our 11 uncontrolled North Carolina coal units for about 1,500 megawatts and we'll be replacing this coal capacity with new clean and efficient natural gas-fired capacity. But even with these steps, and with the fleet modernization, the more stringent standards might require us to alter  the dispatch of Carolina's fleet or to purchase emission allowances were feasible in order to comply with CSAPR. 
Meanwhile, in Florida we spent $1.2 billion on approximately 1,400 megawatts at Crystal River 4 and 5 to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions, again, with the significant Mercury Co-Benefit. Despite this successful project, we have approximately 2,000 megawatts of uncontrolled coal and oil-fired capacity in Florida. It remains at risk of compliance under the NOx ozone season program. So at this point, we know that the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule will mean incremental costs for compliance through emission allowances, higher O&M at our natural gas-fired plants, and potential environmental controls or replacement capacity, especially in Florida. 
Slide 9, which we've shown you before, illustrates how the EPA's proposed utility MACT rule and water intake rule will affect our fleet. The MACT rule is expected to be finalized in November, and actually, the comment period on that rule ends today. Again, our fleet modernization efforts have put us in a comparatively better position to comply with these requirements, but these rules will increase cost to our customers. I think it's fair to say that the combined effects of EPA's recent and pending rules will be significant for our company and industry, and there are more requirements in the pipeline. 
Turning now to our major capital projects on Slide 10. We're making excellent progress in modernizing our power system. On May 20, we broke ground on our new combined-cycle natural gas plant at the Sutton site. This unit is scheduled to be online in December 2013. Our newest plant, the Richmond County combined-cycle began service in early June. We continue to manage our system modernization projects in a disciplined way to meet constant scheduled targets. So now I'd like to ask Mark Mulhern to provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter. Mark?"
258891,136995957,152437,"Progress Energy Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 11. So if we start with Slide 12 which shows our second quarter ongoing earnings, for the second quarter 2011, we reported $0.71 versus $0.63 last year. Progress Energy Carolinas",1226,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 11. So if we start with Slide 12 which shows our second quarter ongoing earnings, for the second quarter 2011, we reported $0.71 versus $0.63 last year. Progress Energy Carolinas was down $0.02, Florida was up $0.07 and the Corporate and Other category was $0.03 favorable. The main drivers for the quarter were in clauses and other margins, amortization of the cost for removal obligation in Florida, and slight positives in O&M and interest expense. 
On balance, this year's second quarter was above normal in terms of weather, but compared to 2010 weather, accounted for $0.02 of negativity. 
Going to Slide 13 is our waterfall chart which outlines the positive and negative drivers for the second quarter. You see there, the largest positive on the page is the $0.09-benefit associated with the amortization of the cost for removal obligation at PEF. The $0.06 positive variance and clauses in other margin is comprised of $0.03 of PEC from expanding demand-side management programs and $0.03 in margins at PEF, partially related to lower joint-owner replacement power costs related to the CR3 outage. So for the quarter, we had a positive impact of $0.02 from lower O&M and $0.02 pick up from lower interest costs. 
On the negative side, there were a number of $0.02-items that reduced earnings. The growth in usage item was comprised of $0.01 positive in Florida, but a negative $0.03 in the Carolinas, and I will address this in just a few moments. During our update call on the Crystal River 3 on June 28, we indicated that we would be reserving $45 million pretax for the indemnification costs for future years' joint-owner replacement power costs. Because this charge relates to 2012 and 2013, we have excluded it from ongoing earnings as a one-time charge, and it amounts to a $0.09-charge to GAAP earnings in the quarter. 
Now, I'll turn to the first half of the year variances that are summarized on Slide 14, which is our year-to-date waterfall chart. Just a couple of brief points here. Year-to-date we have utilized a total of $134 million in cost for removal amortization in Florida. That leaves a balance of $338 million that we can utilize over the next 18 months. Then as you see the reversal of very strong weather we had it 2010, which accounts for a negative $0.19 item, and then the clauses and other margin, AFUDC equity and O&M were the other positives for the first half of the year, and were offset by slight negative variances in wholesale and growth and usage, and dilution from shares issued in 2010. 
Slide 15, shows our weather-adjusted retail sales. And this slide is different from the way we have  traditionally shown it and different from the presentation on Page S4 of the earnings release. And we elected to show it this way with the unbilled adjustment allocated to the customer classes, because our unbilled variance at Progress Energy Carolinas is larger than normal. Extreme weather and the way the billing cycles fall on the calendar impacted the unbilled amounts at the quarter end, so there are 3 key points on this slide. The first point relates to the very significant impacts of weather on retail sales in both utilities for the periods being compared. You will recall that 2010 was a very strong weather year at both utilities. And as you can see, weather is 3% of the total 4% variance at PEC and 5.6% of the total 6.1% variance in total retail sales at PEF. 
The second point is a recognition that our growth in usage numbers are trailing our forecast at the halfway point of the year, so we are behind our plan by 1.8% at PEC and 1.2% at PEF. Lower-than-expected customer growth has been the larger variance, with usage being closer to our expectations. The third and final point is, it is still early in the year, with our largest revenue and earnings quarter in front of us. Therefore, I would not jump to conclusions based on this data. We expect these numbers to improve in the second half of 2011 and we have seen some early signs of that improvement in July with an increase of approximately 2,000 new customer accounts at PEC, but still expect the full year to be weaker than our forecast with the return to normal sales growth still further down the road. 
Our industrial customers showed a strong recovery in 2010 and in early 2011. So strong gains were seen in the metal and paper industries, and coupled with the strong rebound in the textile industries. Starting in the second quarter of this year, our customers began reporting increasing inventories and excess capacity, and some have instituted shorter operating hours. Our experience is consistent with some of the recent economic data reflecting a slowing economy, and not the steady recovery we had all hoped for. 
So now let's turn to Slide 16, which is our standard slide on the customer growth and low-usage accounts. Florida continues to show a positive trend in customer growth. Florida had a net addition of 8,000 customers year-over-year and the Carolinas added 6,000 customers year-over-year. Over the last 3 quarters though, Florida appears to have leveled off its growth trajectory and the Carolinas are still lagging historical trends in customer growth. We are still not seeing any strength in the region in terms of new customer growth. 
So on Slide 17, just to highlight of number of points that you should consider regarding our results for the full year of the 2011. On a trailing 12-month basis, our ongoing earnings are $3.09, well within our 2011 guidance range. Second half weather in 2010 was $0.26 favorable, so weather will make for a tough comparison for the second half of 2011. We have, however, gotten off to a good start with about a $0.05 positive pick up in weather for the month of July, and August is predicted to be very warm as well. The positive weather variances will help us preserve costs for removal flexibility for 2012, the final year of our settlement agreement in Florida. 
On O&M last year, we had 109 nuclear outage days with lengthy downtime at Robinson and the plant refueling and maintenance outage at Harris. We do not have any plant outages in the second half of this year, and this should result in lower O&M costs when compared to last year. And finally, we will continue to utilize the cost for removal amortization that we have in Florida. So all in all, we expect to deliver ongoing results in our guidance range of $3.20, though before I turn it back over to Bill for questions, let me just note that the substantial integration, planning and regulatory work related to the merger with Duke has not impacted our focus on execution and delivering results. Our nuclear performance has shown significant improvement, the regulatory flexibility in Florida continues to help offset significant weather variances, and we are carefully and deliberately addressing our challenges at Crystal River 3. Consistency in performance is what you have come to expect, but it is especially noteworthy in light of the significant merger activities. So now I'll turn it back over to Bill for questions and answers."

I mean you mentioned it briefly here earlier, and then Dan has a question that kind of got on there. I recognize the ink's not dry yet on the new rules and the impacts, but a lot of your oil fleets, specifically Progress, doesn't run often, but some plants like Henkel, for example in Florida is an important plant. I have 2 questions if I could on this. What approach do you believe you'll be taking towards your remaining oil fleet. And second question, how do you believe EPA regulations overall will impact oil-fired generation? How much of an impact do you believe that it's going to have on the power markets overall?"

There's not that much oil-fired generation in the country. It's a very small percentage, I think. So I wouldn't expect it would have a big impact on power prices, unless you're uniquely situated in a certain market where it's crucial that you run. But in general, I don't think it's a big impact in the wholesale markets. For us, you're exactly right, we do have some oil in Florida. We reduced that substantially when we converted Bartow toward natural gas. You have several options here. The oil plants really haven't been heavily implicated by the EPA regulations until you got to the CSAPR rule. I think that's drawing a beat on the oil plants. So you can try to control them. We do have dual-fuel capability at Anclote, so we can convert to natural gas and get off oil there. Or you can build replacement capacity. So the dual-fuel capability at Anclote will be a big help to us, I think, and help us solve some of the CSAPR problems. It's a little too early exactly to know what the option we will take is, but those are the general options."

I know it's another busy day on the earnings calendar so we appreciate your participation this morning. I've managed to acquire a cold just in time for this call so I'll apologize in advance for any sniffing, sneezing or coughing that you might hear. 
So Slide 3 indicates I'll provide highlights of the quarter and year-to-date financial results, along with updates on our proposed merger with Duke Energy, the Crystal River 3 containment building repair and a couple of other items of interest. 
Then Mark will provide more details on our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the third quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $344 million, compared to $361 million for the same quarter a year ago. 
On a per share basis, we're down $0.07 from the third quarter in 2010. As Mark will review later, the results require a little explanation here. 
This quarter's ongoing earnings including negative $0.08 for the impact of storm costs and replacement power disallowance in the Carolinas. Net of positive litigation award related to spent nuclear fuel. This favorable litigation was our successful claim against the U.S. Department of Energy for failure to abide by a contract for federal disposition of nuclear suspend fuel. 
As a result, during the third quarter, we recorded a $92 million award as an offset for past spent fuel storage cost, including $27 million in O&M expense. 
So when you consider these various onetime items, both positive and negative, we're in line with last year's results for the third quarter and slightly ahead of last year's results on a year-to-date basis.
Based on our performance for the first 3 quarters and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. 
Now let's turn to where we stand on the regulatory approvals of the Duke-Progress merger. There have been several developments in recent months and you can see the updated merger scorecard on Slide 5. Both companies have made all the required filings. We're still targeting a closing by the end of this year and both companies are working hard to have the necessary infrastructure in place. 
The actual closing date, of course, will ultimately be determined by the timing of regulatory approvals, including by the FERC and the state commissions in North and South Carolina. 
I'll comment on a couple of noteworthy events in the approval process.  Both companies held shareholder meetings on August 23 to vote on the merger. And the shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger, more than 90% for each company. We're very pleased with the strong response. It's a sign that Duke and Progress shareholders recognize the value of this strategic combination. 
In late September, we appeared before the North Carolina Utilities Commission and reviewed the advantages of this combination for customers. The commission is expected to rule later this year. 
Then on September 30, the FERC conditionally approved our merger application, expressing what they perceive to be adverse affects on wholesale competition in the Carolinas. In its order, the FERC described a number of different ways we can address their market power concerns. And final approval is subject to FERC's acceptance of our mitigation plan.
On October 17, our 2 companies filed a plan to address FERC's concerns. We proposed a virtual divestiture whereby Progress Energy and Duke Energy will offer up to a specified amount of power in the wholesale markets during the summer and winter peak periods. Progress Energy Carolinas will offer up to 500 megawatts during each summer hour and Duke Energy Carolinas will offer 300 megawatts during each summer hour and 225 megawatts during each winter hour. The FERC set a 30-day comment period on our mitigation plan and that clock will run out in mid-November. Then FERC will rule on our mitigation plan some time after that. 
In South Carolina, we originally scheduled to appear before the state's Public Service Commission last week for a review of our joint dispatch agreement, which is the focus of South Carolina's review. But in light of the FERC ruling, the South Carolina Commission will now begin hearings the week of December 12. 
Last week, in Kentucky, we received the commission's final approval of the merger. As you might recall given conditional approval earlier. 
Meanwhile, we continue to make significant progress in our plans for integrating the Duke and Progress organizations and staffing the new combined company. We announced the full executive leadership team in September and our business units are now beginning to announce the next level of managers. Next week, we will open up the Voluntary Severance Program for employees in certain targeted areas.
I'm also pleased with how well the senior leaders of the new company are working together. This senior leadership team was named at the time of the merger announcement in January and we've been meeting regularly to discuss and decide the many issues associated with the merger of this size. Again, much work needs to be done here, but the integration process has gone extremely well. We're looking forward to the value we will create for customers, shareholders and employees as a new combined company.
Now let's turn to containment building repair effort at our crystal River nuclear plant in Florida. As you might recall, we suspended repair work on the containment building in mid-March after identifying additional concrete delamination in the building. We conducted a thorough engineering analysis and review the structure and evaluated a wide range of repair options. 
On June 27, we presented our findings to the Florida Public Service Commission, including our preliminary recommendation to repair the structure and return the plant to service. 
In July, we filed a complimentary cost estimate for this repair between $900 million and $1.3 billion with a project of projected return to service in 2014. 
We continue to believe repairing the plant is better for our Florida customers than retiring and replacing it. But as I said in June, we are approaching this situation in a very disciplined structured way and continue to assess cost and feasibility at every step.
In August, the Florida Public Service Commission established a plan to review the prudence and cost related to the outage, including replacement power cost. The commission divided the docket into 3 phases. The first phase will focus on the events and decisions leading up to the delamination of in October 2, 2009. A hearing is scheduled for June 2012 and we filed initial supporting testimony last month.  The second phase will review the decision whether to repair rather than decommission the unit. And the third phase will include a review of the decisions and events subsequent to the October 2009 event and leading up to the March 2011 delamination and ultimate repair of the containment building.
Slide 6 presents cost data for the repair and replacement power cost through September 30. We are still continuing to refine our engineering analyses and developing bid repair documents, as well as continuing to prepare the plant's infrastructure for the repair work. 
You can see some details on insurance coverage on the bottom half of Slide 6. As you know, we maintain insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through NEIL. We've had ongoing discussions within NEIL, NEIL representatives as they systematically review this claim. NEIL is retained outside engineering consultants and we're  working closely with them as they perform their due diligence. 
This is a complex matter and it's in our best interest to work cooperatively with NEIL to provide them with all the information they need to make their coverage decisions.
Now I want to spend a few moments discussing several issues listed on Slide 7. This quarter, we resolved the lawsuit with a large holder of the contingent value obligations that were associated with 4 of our synthetic coal fuel plants. 
As part of that settlement, we agreed to purchase the holder's CVOs for $0.75 per unit. We also announced earlier this week that we're going to tender for the balance of the outstanding CVOs at the same $0.75 per unit. 
This action triggered a pretax mark-to-market accounting adjustment of $63 million, which we recorded in the third quarter. As it's been our practice, CVO mark-to-market adjustments are not included on ongoing earnings. 
You might recall that we issued $98.6 million of these securities in connection with our merger with Florida Progress in 2000 and it makes sense to redeem them in advance of the merger with Duke. 
Also during the third quarter, we encountered the fury of hurricane Irene. This was a significant event for us in late August and we appreciate the long hours our employees, contractors and other utilities put in to restore power. We incurred O&M damages of $24 million or $0.05 per share associated with the repairs. As a side note, we spent about 200 Progress and contract personnel to help with service restoration after the weekend's snowstorms to the north of us.
Now before Mark goes over the financials, I want to mention a couple of recent milestones in our fleet modernization program, which involves retiring older coal-fired plants and building advanced new gas-fired units.
On October 1, we retired the 170-megawatt Weatherspoon coal-fired plant near Lumberton, North Carolina. The 3 coal units in that site entered service between 1949 and 1952. 
And on September 22, we had a ceremony renaming our Richmond County Energy Complex near Rockingham, North Carolina. This facility has 1,900 megawatts of capacity fueled by natural gas. And it's the second-largest station in our Carolinas fleet. The site's latest unit began service in June. 
This Richmond County facility is now called the Sherwood H. Smith Jr. Energy Complex. So those of you who are around the time during the 1980s and 1990s, we remember the outstanding leadership Sherwood provided this company including serving for 17 years as CEO. 
Now Mark will provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter."

I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 8. Slide 9, shows our third quarter ongoing earnings, and for the third quarter 2011, we reported $1.16 per share versus $1.23 last year. The Progress Energy Carolinas was down",1173,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 8. Slide 9, shows our third quarter ongoing earnings, and for the third quarter 2011, we reported $1.16 per share versus $1.23 last year. 
The Progress Energy Carolinas was down $0.11. Progress Energy Florida was up $0.08 and then the Corporate and Other was $0.04 unfavorable. 
The main drivers for the quarter were less favorable weather than 2010, disallowances on replacement power costs in the Carolinas, partially offset by lower O&M, lower amortization expenses in Florida and lower interest costs.
Slide 10 shows our waterfall chart for the third quarter. And we've identified the major drivers in the key variances. On the positive side, we had the impact of higher costs or removal amortization in Florida, improved O&M performance, which includes the negative impact of storm costs with an offsetting positive for the spent nuclear fuel litigation awarded that Bill described. 
Lower interest expense in 2010 reflecting the lower rate environment and the impact of resolving the 2004 at 2005 income tax audits. And on the negative side, weather compared to a very strong 2010 accounted for $0.06 of negativity and we had $0.08 of replacement power disallowance at Progress Energy Carolinas. 
This side relates to the challenging nuclear performance we've experienced in 2010. You will recall, we had a number of unplanned outages in our Carolinas nuclear fleet last year. We have taken significant remediation steps to improve performance here and the early signs of progress have shown up in the 2011 operating statistics for our nuclear fleet. So this kind of regulatory compromise happens infrequently within a regulated sharing the impact of operating challenges between the company and customers who's appropriate in this situation.
So overall the variance from 2010 can be primarily attributed to the replacement power disallowance and when that is considered, our earnings are effectively in line with the third quarter of 2010. 
So now I'll turn to Slide 11, which our year-to-date waterfall chart and again several brief points on the larger items here. Year-to-date, we have utilized a total of $205 million in cost of removal amortization in Florida versus $60 million utilized to 3 quarters in 2010. 
The very strong weather we had in 2010 accounts for the negative $0.25 item in the year-over-year comparison. The wholesale variance on a year-to-date basis is $0.09, which is as you recall we had anticipated coming into 2011 due primarily to several wholesale contracts at PEF that were expiring. 
So to close my comments on the waterfall charts, I'd repeat the point from the third quarter discussion, and that if you consider the $0.08 of replacement power disallowance with $2.56 year-to-date earnings, we're slightly ahead of 2010's results through 9 months.
Slide 12 shows our weather adjusted retail sales. And there are 3 key points on this slide. The first one relates to the very significant impact of whether on retail sales of both utilities. So as we said 2010 was a strong weather here both utilities and as you can weather is 2.6% of the total 3% negative variance at PEC and essentially the full variance in total retail sales at PEF. 
Second point is recognition that our growth and usage numbers are still trailing our forecast through 9 months of the year. So we're behind our plan by 1.3% at Progress Energy Carolinas and 0.6% behind at PEF. So lower-than-expected customer growth has been the larger variance with the usage being closer to our expectations. 
And the third and final point is we did see positive movement growth and usage in both jurisdictions in the quarter. So we expect the full year to be a little weaker than our forecast with a return to more normal sales growth still further down the road.
As I mentioned last quarter, our industrial customers showed a strong recovery in 2010 and carry over into early 2011, but starting in the second quarter of this year, our customers began reporting increasing inventories and excess capacity and to shorter operating hours. This thought has carried into the third quarter as well. 
On a positive note, we are encouraged by a series of recent economic development announcements in our service territories. 
Most notably, with the announcement that Continental Tire would build a large facility Sumter, South Carolina that will ultimately employee over 1,500 workers. 
So our service territories continue to be attractive places for relocation and expansion and this should be a positive for our long-term growth.
Now I'll turn to Slide 13, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low usage accounts. Both the Carolinas and Florida continue to show positive customer growth compared to a year ago. Both appeared to have leveled out over the last several quarters, with Florida showing in net addition of 8,000 customers year-over-year and the Carolinas adding 6,000 customers year-over-year. 
So next I'll turn to the major capital projects on Slide 14, which just gives you a brief update on the major capital projects we have underway, primarily our 2 new combined cycle plants that are scheduled for completion in 2013, along with our Smart Grid program. 
As Bill noted in his comments, the retirement of older coal units to be replaced by the new combined cycles continue to be executed effectively and is going very well. 
In Slide 15, I just wanted to highlight a number of points that you should consider regarding our results for the full year of 2011. On a trailing 12-month basis, our ongoing earnings are $3.1 with that include the $0.08 negative item for replacement power disallowance. 
In 2010, our fourth quarter earnings were $0.45.
The cost of removal amortization at PEF as I said we've amortized $205 million through 9 months, there is $294 million remaining to be amortized under our settlement over the next 15 months. So this gives us flexibility going into the fourth quarter and into 2012. 
On the O&M front, we have completed our planned nuclear refueling outages for 2011 and in 2010, we had 85 outage days in Q4, which hopefully should not recur providing us an opportunity for more favorable O&M comparisons to 2010. 
So when we consider the flexibility these items provide us, and some of the unusual items I have noted through the third quarter, we felt it was appropriate to maintain our guidance range in the $3 to $3.20 range. 
So before I turn it back over to Bill for questions, let me note that the substantial integration planning and regulatory work related to the merger with Duke has not impacted our focus on execution and delivering results. Our nuclear performance has shown significant improvement. The regulatory flexibility in Florida continues to help offset weather variances and we are carefully and deliberately addressing our challenges at Crystal River 3. So consistency in performance is what you have come to expect, but it's especially noteworthy in light of the significant merger activities. 
So now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for Q&A."

And we really have had 2 pretty usual weather here, so 2010 was a very significant anomaly of weather. In 2011, we have again a deviation from normal weather. And some of that has skewed the numbers a little bit. I think in a residential, what you see on kind of a weather normalized basis for the year-to-date numbers on that chart on 12 is 0.7% or so change from the prior year and Carolinas down and Florida is actually a little bit up. So hard to really put your finger on efficiency and how much impact it's had on the numbers. But we absolutely believe the economy, the state of play in terms of that has had some impact on usage and on how especially in the residential area, how much we've deviated from forecast. You see our commercial and/or industrial numbers kind of flat or may be slightly down in commercial year-over-year. But longer term, our belief continues to be that we will see growth return to our territories in some significant ways, especially in the Carolinas and Florida, we believe both of them have longer-term dynamics that will be helpful and should grow maybe not to the levels we had experience in the boom periods, but again pretty good growth. We're seeing a little bit of progress in housing, in both locations in the Carolinas and the Florida, but not to the robust way that it had been at onetime obviously. So I think we're just going to slug through a little bit. I don't see anything dramatic that you can put your finger on it that would explain some of these things."

So Slide 3 indicates I'll provide highlights of the quarter and year-to-date financial results, along with updates on our proposed merger with Duke Energy, the Crystal River 3 containment building repair and a couple of other items of interest. 
Then Mark will provide more details on our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the third quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $344 million, compared to $361 million for the same quarter a year ago. 
On a per share basis, we're down $0.07 from the third quarter in 2010. As Mark will review later, the results require a little explanation here. 
This quarter's ongoing earnings including negative $0.08 for the impact of storm costs and replacement power disallowance in the Carolinas. Net of positive litigation award related to spent nuclear fuel. This favorable litigation was our successful claim against the U.S. Department of Energy for failure to abide by a contract for federal disposition of nuclear suspend fuel. 
As a result, during the third quarter, we recorded a $92 million award as an offset for past spent fuel storage cost, including $27 million in O&M expense. 
So when you consider these various onetime items, both positive and negative, we're in line with last year's results for the third quarter and slightly ahead of last year's results on a year-to-date basis.
Based on our performance for the first 3 quarters and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. 
Now let's turn to where we stand on the regulatory approvals of the Duke-Progress merger. There have been several developments in recent months and you can see the updated merger scorecard on Slide 5. Both companies have made all the required filings. We're still targeting a closing by the end of this year and both companies are working hard to have the necessary infrastructure in place. 
The actual closing date, of course, will ultimately be determined by the timing of regulatory approvals, including by the FERC and the state commissions in North and South Carolina. 
I'll comment on a couple of noteworthy events in the approval process.  Both companies held shareholder meetings on August 23 to vote on the merger. And the shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger, more than 90% for each company. We're very pleased with the strong response. It's a sign that Duke and Progress shareholders recognize the value of this strategic combination. 
In late September, we appeared before the North Carolina Utilities Commission and reviewed the advantages of this combination for customers. The commission is expected to rule later this year. 
Then on September 30, the FERC conditionally approved our merger application, expressing what they perceive to be adverse affects on wholesale competition in the Carolinas. In its order, the FERC described a number of different ways we can address their market power concerns. And final approval is subject to FERC's acceptance of our mitigation plan.
On October 17, our 2 companies filed a plan to address FERC's concerns. We proposed a virtual divestiture whereby Progress Energy and Duke Energy will offer up to a specified amount of power in the wholesale markets during the summer and winter peak periods. Progress Energy Carolinas will offer up to 500 megawatts during each summer hour and Duke Energy Carolinas will offer 300 megawatts during each summer hour and 225 megawatts during each winter hour. The FERC set a 30-day comment period on our mitigation plan and that clock will run out in mid-November. Then FERC will rule on our mitigation plan some time after that. 
In South Carolina, we originally scheduled to appear before the state's Public Service Commission last week for a review of our joint dispatch agreement, which is the focus of South Carolina's review. But in light of the FERC ruling, the South Carolina Commission will now begin hearings the week of December 12. 
Last week, in Kentucky, we received the commission's final approval of the merger. As you might recall given conditional approval earlier. 
Meanwhile, we continue to make significant progress in our plans for integrating the Duke and Progress organizations and staffing the new combined company. We announced the full executive leadership team in September and our business units are now beginning to announce the next level of managers. Next week, we will open up the Voluntary Severance Program for employees in certain targeted areas.
I'm also pleased with how well the senior leaders of the new company are working together. This senior leadership team was named at the time of the merger announcement in January and we've been meeting regularly to discuss and decide the many issues associated with the merger of this size. Again, much work needs to be done here, but the integration process has gone extremely well. We're looking forward to the value we will create for customers, shareholders and employees as a new combined company.
Now let's turn to containment building repair effort at our crystal River nuclear plant in Florida. As you might recall, we suspended repair work on the containment building in mid-March after identifying additional concrete delamination in the building. We conducted a thorough engineering analysis and review the structure and evaluated a wide range of repair options. 
On June 27, we presented our findings to the Florida Public Service Commission, including our preliminary recommendation to repair the structure and return the plant to service. 
In July, we filed a complimentary cost estimate for this repair between $900 million and $1.3 billion with a project of projected return to service in 2014. 
We continue to believe repairing the plant is better for our Florida customers than retiring and replacing it. But as I said in June, we are approaching this situation in a very disciplined structured way and continue to assess cost and feasibility at every step.
In August, the Florida Public Service Commission established a plan to review the prudence and cost related to the outage, including replacement power cost. The commission divided the docket into 3 phases. The first phase will focus on the events and decisions leading up to the delamination of in October 2, 2009. A hearing is scheduled for June 2012 and we filed initial supporting testimony last month.  The second phase will review the decision whether to repair rather than decommission the unit. And the third phase will include a review of the decisions and events subsequent to the October 2009 event and leading up to the March 2011 delamination and ultimate repair of the containment building.
Slide 6 presents cost data for the repair and replacement power cost through September 30. We are still continuing to refine our engineering analyses and developing bid repair documents, as well as continuing to prepare the plant's infrastructure for the repair work. 
You can see some details on insurance coverage on the bottom half of Slide 6. As you know, we maintain insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through NEIL. We've had ongoing discussions within NEIL, NEIL representatives as they systematically review this claim. NEIL is retained outside engineering consultants and we're  working closely with them as they perform their due diligence. 
This is a complex matter and it's in our best interest to work cooperatively with NEIL to provide them with all the information they need to make their coverage decisions.
Now I want to spend a few moments discussing several issues listed on Slide 7. This quarter, we resolved the lawsuit with a large holder of the contingent value obligations that were associated with 4 of our synthetic coal fuel plants. 
As part of that settlement, we agreed to purchase the holder's CVOs for $0.75 per unit. We also announced earlier this week that we're going to tender for the balance of the outstanding CVOs at the same $0.75 per unit. 
This action triggered a pretax mark-to-market accounting adjustment of $63 million, which we recorded in the third quarter. As it's been our practice, CVO mark-to-market adjustments are not included on ongoing earnings. 
You might recall that we issued $98.6 million of these securities in connection with our merger with Florida Progress in 2000 and it makes sense to redeem them in advance of the merger with Duke. 
Also during the third quarter, we encountered the fury of hurricane Irene. This was a significant event for us in late August and we appreciate the long hours our employees, contractors and other utilities put in to restore power. We incurred O&M damages of $24 million or $0.05 per share associated with the repairs. As a side note, we spent about 200 Progress and contract personnel to help with service restoration after the weekend's snowstorms to the north of us.
Now before Mark goes over the financials, I want to mention a couple of recent milestones in our fleet modernization program, which involves retiring older coal-fired plants and building advanced new gas-fired units.
On October 1, we retired the 170-megawatt Weatherspoon coal-fired plant near Lumberton, North Carolina. The 3 coal units in that site entered service between 1949 and 1952. 
And on September 22, we had a ceremony renaming our Richmond County Energy Complex near Rockingham, North Carolina. This facility has 1,900 megawatts of capacity fueled by natural gas. And it's the second-largest station in our Carolinas fleet. The site's latest unit began service in June. 
This Richmond County facility is now called the Sherwood H. Smith Jr. Energy Complex. So those of you who are around the time during the 1980s and 1990s, we remember the outstanding leadership Sherwood provided this company including serving for 17 years as CEO. 
Now Mark will provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter."

I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 8. Slide 9, shows our third quarter ongoing earnings, and for the third quarter 2011, we reported $1.16 per share versus $1.23 last year. The Progress Energy Carolinas was down",1173,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 8. Slide 9, shows our third quarter ongoing earnings, and for the third quarter 2011, we reported $1.16 per share versus $1.23 last year. 
The Progress Energy Carolinas was down $0.11. Progress Energy Florida was up $0.08 and then the Corporate and Other was $0.04 unfavorable. 
The main drivers for the quarter were less favorable weather than 2010, disallowances on replacement power costs in the Carolinas, partially offset by lower O&M, lower amortization expenses in Florida and lower interest costs.
Slide 10 shows our waterfall chart for the third quarter. And we've identified the major drivers in the key variances. On the positive side, we had the impact of higher costs or removal amortization in Florida, improved O&M performance, which includes the negative impact of storm costs with an offsetting positive for the spent nuclear fuel litigation awarded that Bill described. 
Lower interest expense in 2010 reflecting the lower rate environment and the impact of resolving the 2004 at 2005 income tax audits. And on the negative side, weather compared to a very strong 2010 accounted for $0.06 of negativity and we had $0.08 of replacement power disallowance at Progress Energy Carolinas. 
This side relates to the challenging nuclear performance we've experienced in 2010. You will recall, we had a number of unplanned outages in our Carolinas nuclear fleet last year. We have taken significant remediation steps to improve performance here and the early signs of progress have shown up in the 2011 operating statistics for our nuclear fleet. So this kind of regulatory compromise happens infrequently within a regulated sharing the impact of operating challenges between the company and customers who's appropriate in this situation.
So overall the variance from 2010 can be primarily attributed to the replacement power disallowance and when that is considered, our earnings are effectively in line with the third quarter of 2010. 
So now I'll turn to Slide 11, which our year-to-date waterfall chart and again several brief points on the larger items here. Year-to-date, we have utilized a total of $205 million in cost of removal amortization in Florida versus $60 million utilized to 3 quarters in 2010. 
The very strong weather we had in 2010 accounts for the negative $0.25 item in the year-over-year comparison. The wholesale variance on a year-to-date basis is $0.09, which is as you recall we had anticipated coming into 2011 due primarily to several wholesale contracts at PEF that were expiring. 
So to close my comments on the waterfall charts, I'd repeat the point from the third quarter discussion, and that if you consider the $0.08 of replacement power disallowance with $2.56 year-to-date earnings, we're slightly ahead of 2010's results through 9 months.
Slide 12 shows our weather adjusted retail sales. And there are 3 key points on this slide. The first one relates to the very significant impact of whether on retail sales of both utilities. So as we said 2010 was a strong weather here both utilities and as you can weather is 2.6% of the total 3% negative variance at PEC and essentially the full variance in total retail sales at PEF. 
Second point is recognition that our growth and usage numbers are still trailing our forecast through 9 months of the year. So we're behind our plan by 1.3% at Progress Energy Carolinas and 0.6% behind at PEF. So lower-than-expected customer growth has been the larger variance with the usage being closer to our expectations. 
And the third and final point is we did see positive movement growth and usage in both jurisdictions in the quarter. So we expect the full year to be a little weaker than our forecast with a return to more normal sales growth still further down the road.
As I mentioned last quarter, our industrial customers showed a strong recovery in 2010 and carry over into early 2011, but starting in the second quarter of this year, our customers began reporting increasing inventories and excess capacity and to shorter operating hours. This thought has carried into the third quarter as well. 
On a positive note, we are encouraged by a series of recent economic development announcements in our service territories. 
Most notably, with the announcement that Continental Tire would build a large facility Sumter, South Carolina that will ultimately employee over 1,500 workers. 
So our service territories continue to be attractive places for relocation and expansion and this should be a positive for our long-term growth.
Now I'll turn to Slide 13, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low usage accounts. Both the Carolinas and Florida continue to show positive customer growth compared to a year ago. Both appeared to have leveled out over the last several quarters, with Florida showing in net addition of 8,000 customers year-over-year and the Carolinas adding 6,000 customers year-over-year. 
So next I'll turn to the major capital projects on Slide 14, which just gives you a brief update on the major capital projects we have underway, primarily our 2 new combined cycle plants that are scheduled for completion in 2013, along with our Smart Grid program. 
As Bill noted in his comments, the retirement of older coal units to be replaced by the new combined cycles continue to be executed effectively and is going very well. 
In Slide 15, I just wanted to highlight a number of points that you should consider regarding our results for the full year of 2011. On a trailing 12-month basis, our ongoing earnings are $3.1 with that include the $0.08 negative item for replacement power disallowance. 
In 2010, our fourth quarter earnings were $0.45.
The cost of removal amortization at PEF as I said we've amortized $205 million through 9 months, there is $294 million remaining to be amortized under our settlement over the next 15 months. So this gives us flexibility going into the fourth quarter and into 2012. 
On the O&M front, we have completed our planned nuclear refueling outages for 2011 and in 2010, we had 85 outage days in Q4, which hopefully should not recur providing us an opportunity for more favorable O&M comparisons to 2010. 
So when we consider the flexibility these items provide us, and some of the unusual items I have noted through the third quarter, we felt it was appropriate to maintain our guidance range in the $3 to $3.20 range. 
So before I turn it back over to Bill for questions, let me note that the substantial integration planning and regulatory work related to the merger with Duke has not impacted our focus on execution and delivering results. Our nuclear performance has shown significant improvement. The regulatory flexibility in Florida continues to help offset weather variances and we are carefully and deliberately addressing our challenges at Crystal River 3. So consistency in performance is what you have come to expect, but it's especially noteworthy in light of the significant merger activities. 
So now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for Q&A."

So hard to really put your finger on efficiency and how much impact it's had on the numbers.

You see our commercial and/or industrial numbers kind of flat or may be slightly down in commercial year-over-year. But longer term, our belief continues to be that we will see growth return to our territories in some significant ways, especially in the Carolinas and Florida, we believe both of them have longer-term dynamics that will be helpful and should grow maybe not to the levels we had experience in the boom periods, but again pretty good growth.

So Slide 3 indicates -- I'll provide highlights of the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, along with updates on our proposed merger with Duke Energy, the Crystal River 3 containment building repair and a couple of other items of interest. Then Mark will provide more details on our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the third quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $344 million, compared to $361 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per share basis, we're down $0.07 from the third quarter in 2010. As Mark will review later, the results require a little explanation here. 
This quarter's ongoing earnings including a negative $0.08 for the impact of storm costs and replacement power disallowances in the Carolinas. Net of a positive litigation award related to spent nuclear fuel. This favorable litigation was our successful claim against the U.S. Department of Energy for failure to abide by a contract for federal disposition of nuclear spent fuel. As a result, during the third quarter, we recorded a $92 million award as an offset for past spent fuel storage costs, including $27 million in O&M expense. 
So when you consider these various one-time items, both positive and negative, we're in line with last year's results for the third quarter and slightly ahead of last year's results on a year-to-date basis. Based on our performance for the first 3 quarters and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. 
Now let's turn to where we stand on the regulatory approvals of the Duke-Progress merger. There have been several developments in recent months, and you can see the updated merger scorecard on Slide 5. Both companies have made all the required filings. We're still targeting a closing by the end of this year, and both companies are working hard to have the necessary infrastructure in place. The actual closing date, of course, will ultimately be determined by the timing of regulatory approvals, including by the FERC and the state commissions in North and South Carolina. 
I'll comment on a couple of noteworthy events in the approval process.  Both companies held shareholder meetings on August 23 to vote on the merger. And the shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger, more than 90% for each company. We're very pleased with this strong response. It's a sign that Duke and Progress shareholders recognize the value of this strategic combination. 
In late September, we appeared before the North Carolina Utilities Commission and reviewed the advantages of this combination for customers. The commission is expected to rule later this year. 
Then on September 30, the FERC conditionally approved our merger application, expressing what they perceive to be adverse affects on wholesale competition in the Carolinas. In its order, the FERC described a number of different ways we could address their market power concerns. And final approval is subject to FERC's acceptance of our mitigation plan.
On October 17, our 2 companies filed a plan to address FERC's concerns. We proposed a virtual divestiture, whereby Progress Energy and Duke Energy will offer up to a specified amount of power in the wholesale markets during the summer and winter peak periods. Progress Energy Carolinas will offer up to 500 megawatts during each summer hour, and Duke Energy Carolinas will offer 300 megawatts during each summer hour and 225 megawatts during each winter hour. The FERC set a 30-day comment period on our mitigation plan, and that clock will run out in mid-November, then FERC will rule on our mitigation plan some time after that. 
In South Carolina, we were originally scheduled to appear before the state's Public Service Commission last week for a review of our joint dispatch agreement, which is the focus of South Carolina's review. But in light of the FERC ruling, the South Carolina commission will now begin hearings the week of December 12.  Last week, in Kentucky, we received the commission's final approval of the merger. As you might recall, they had given conditional approval earlier.  
Meanwhile, we continue to make significant progress in our plans for integrating the Duke and Progress organizations and staffing the new combined company. We announced the full executive leadership team in September, and our business units are now beginning to announce the next level of managers. Next week, we will open up the voluntary severance program for employees in certain targeted areas.
I'm also pleased with how well the senior leaders of the new company are working together. This senior leadership team was named at the time of the merger announcement in January, and we've been meeting regularly to discuss and decide the many issues associated with a merger of this size. Again, much work needs to be done here, but the integration process has gone extremely well. We're looking forward to the value we will create for customers, shareholders and employees as a new combined company.
Now let's turn to the containment building repair effort at our Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. As you might recall, we suspended repair work on the containment building in mid-March after identifying additional concrete delamination in the building. We conducted a thorough engineering analysis and reviewed the structure and evaluated a wide range of repair options. 
On June 27, we presented our findings to the Florida Public Service Commission, including our preliminary recommendation to repair the structure and return the plant to service. In July, we filed a preliminary cost estimate for this repair between $900 million and $1.3 billion, with a projected return to service in 2014.
We continue to believe repairing the plant is better for our Florida customers than retiring and replacing it. But as I said in June, we are approaching this situation in a very disciplined structured way and continue to assess cost and feasibility at every step.
In August, the Florida Public Service Commission established a plan to review the prudence and costs related to the outage, including replacement power cost. The commission divided the docket into 3 phases. The first phase will focus on the events and decisions leading up to the delamination event on October 2, 2009. A hearing is scheduled for June 2012, and we filed initial supporting testimony last month.  
The second phase will review the decision whether to repair rather than decommission the unit, and the third phase will include a review of the decisions and events subsequent to the October 2009 event and leading up to the March 2011 delamination and ultimate repair of the containment building.
Slide 6 presents cost data for the repair and replacement power cost through September 30. We are still continuing to refine our engineering analysis and developing bid repair documents, as well as continuing to prepare the plant's infrastructure for the repair work. 
You can see some details on insurance coverage on the bottom half of Slide 6. As you know, we maintain insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through NEIL. 
We've had ongoing discussions within NEIL, NEIL representatives, as they systematically review this claim. NEIL has retained outside engineering consultants, and we are working closely with them as they perform their due diligence.  This is a complex matter, and it's in our best interest to work cooperatively with NEIL to provide them with all the information they need to make their coverage decisions.
Now I want to spend a few moments discussing several issues listed on Slide 7. This quarter, we resolved the lawsuit with a large holder of the contingent value obligations that were associated with 4 of our synthetic coal fuel plants. 
As part of that settlement, we agreed to purchase the holder's CVOs for $0.75 per unit. We also announced earlier this week that we're going to tender for the balance of the outstanding CVOs at the same $0.75 per unit. This action triggered a pretax mark-to-market accounting adjustment of $63 million, which we recorded in the third quarter. As it's been our practice, CVO mark-to-market adjustments are not included in  ongoing earnings. 
You might recall that we issued $98.6 million of these securities in connection with our merger with Florida Progress in 2000, and it makes sense to redeem them in advance of the merger with Duke. 
Also during the third quarter, we encountered the fury of Hurricane Irene. This was a significant event for us in late August, and we appreciate the long hours our employees, contractors and other utilities put in to restore power. We incurred O&M damages of $24 million or $0.05 per share associated with the repairs. As a side note, we've sent about 200 Progress and contract personnel to help with service restoration after the weekend's snowstorms to the north of us.
Now before Mark goes over to the financials, I want to mention a couple of recent milestones in our fleet modernization program, which involves retiring older coal-fired plants and building advanced new gas-fired units. On October 1, we retired the 170-megawatt Weatherspoon coal-fired plant near Lumberton, North Carolina. The 3 coal units at that site entered service between 1949 and 1952. 
And on September 22, we had a ceremony renaming our Richmond County energy complex near Rockingham, North Carolina. This facility has 1,900 megawatts of capacity fueled by natural gas. And it's the second-largest station in our Carolinas fleet. The site's latest unit began service in June. 
This Richmond County facility is now called the Sherwood H. Smith Jr. Energy Complex. So those of you who are around the industry any time during the 1980s or 1990s will remember the outstanding leadership Sherwood provided this company, including serving for 17 years as CEO. 
Now Mark will provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter."
258891,141276477,184407,"Progress Energy Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 8. Slide 9, shows our third quarter ongoing earnings, and for the third quarter 2011, we reported $1.16 per share versus $1.23 last year. The Progress Energy Carolinas was down",1183,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 8. Slide 9, shows our third quarter ongoing earnings, and for the third quarter 2011, we reported $1.16 per share versus $1.23 last year. 
The Progress Energy Carolinas was down $0.11. Progress Energy Florida was up $0.08 and then the Corporate and Other was $0.04 unfavorable. 
The main drivers for the quarter were less favorable weather than 2010, disallowances on replacement power costs in the Carolinas, partially offset by lower O&M, lower amortization expenses in Florida and lower interest costs.
Slide 10 shows our waterfall chart for the third quarter, and we've identified the major drivers in the key variances. On the positive side, we had the impact of higher costs or removal amortization in Florida, improved O&M performance, which includes the negative impact of storm costs, with an offsetting positive for the spent nuclear fuel litigation award that Bill described, lower interest expense in 2010 reflecting the lower rate environment and the impact of resolving the 2004 and 2005 income tax audits. And on the negative side, weather compared to a very strong 2010 accounted for $0.06 of negativity, and then we had $0.08 of replacement power disallowances at Progress Energy Carolinas. 
This item relates to the challenging nuclear performance we had experienced in 2010. You will recall, we had a number of unplanned outages in our Carolinas nuclear fleet last year. We have taken significant remediation steps to improve performance here, and the early signs of progress have shown up in the 2011 operating statistics for our nuclear fleet. So this kind of regulatory compromise happens infrequently but in a regulated utility, sharing the impact of operating challenges between the company and customers was appropriate in this situation.
So overall the variance from 2010 can be primarily attributed to the replacement power disallowance. And when that is considered, our earnings are effectively in line with the third quarter of 2010. 
So now I'll turn to Slide 11, which our year-to-date waterfall chart, and again, several brief points on the larger items here. Year-to-date, we have utilized a total of $205 million in cost of removal amortization in Florida versus $60 million utilized through 3 quarters in 2010. 
The very strong weather we had in 2010 accounts for the negative $0.25 item in the year-over-year comparison. The wholesale variance on a year-to-date basis is $0.09, which is, as you'll recall, we had anticipated coming into 2011 due primarily to several wholesale contracts at PEF that were expiring.
So to close my comments on the waterfall charts, I'd repeat the point from the third quarter discussion, and that if you consider the $0.08 of replacement power disallowance with the  $2.56 year-to-date earnings, we're slightly ahead of 2010's results through 9 months.
Slide 12 shows our weather-adjusted retail sales. And there are 3 key points on this slide. The first one relates to the very significant impacts of whether on retail sales at both utilities. So as we said, 2010 was a strong weather, here at both utilities. And as you can see, weather is 2.6% of the total 3% negative variance at PEC and essentially the full variance in total retail sales at PEF. 
Second point is recognition that our growth and usage numbers are still trailing our forecast through 9 months of the year. So we're behind our plan by 1.3% at Progress Energy Carolinas and 0.6% behind at PEF. So lower-than-expected customer growth has been the larger variance, with the usage being closer to our expectations. 
And the third and final point is we did see positive movement in growth and usage in both jurisdictions in the quarter. So we expect the full year to be a little weaker than our forecast with a return to more normal sales growth still further down the road.
As I mentioned last quarter, our industrial customers showed a strong recovery in 2010 and carry over into early 2011. But starting in the second quarter of this year, our customers began reporting increasing inventories and excess capacity and some  have instituted shorter operating hours. This softness carried into the third quarter as well. 
On a positive note, we are encouraged by a series of recent economic development announcements in our service territories. Most notably, with the announcement that Continental Tire would build a large facility Sumter, South Carolina that will ultimately employee over 1,500 workers. So our service territories continue to be attractive places for relocation and expansion, and this should be a positive for our long-term growth.
Now I'll turn to Slide 13, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low usage accounts. Both the Carolinas and Florida continue to show positive customer growth compared to a year ago. Both appeared to have leveled out over the last several quarters, with Florida showing in net addition of 8,000 customers year-over-year and the Carolinas adding 6,000 customers year-over-year. 
So next, I'll turn to the major capital projects on Slide 14, which just gives you a brief update on the major capital projects we have underway, primarily our 2 new combined cycle plants that are scheduled for completion in 2013, along with our Smart Grid program. As Bill noted in his comments, the retirement of older coal units to be replaced by these new combined cycles continues to be executed effectively and is going very well. 
In Slide 15, I just wanted to highlight a number of points that you should consider regarding our results for the full year of 2011. On a trailing 12-month basis, our ongoing earnings are $3.01, but that includes the $0.08 negative item for replacement power disallowance. 
In 2010, our fourth quarter earnings were $0.45.
For the cost of removal amortization at PEF, as I said, we've amortized $205 million through 9 months. There is $294 million remaining to be amortized under our settlement over the next 15 months. So this gives us flexibility going into the fourth quarter and into 2012. 
On the O&M front, we have completed our planned nuclear refueling outages for 2011, and in 2010, we had 85 outage days in Q4, which hopefully should not recur providing us an opportunity for more favorable O&M comparisons to 2010. So when we consider the flexibility these items provide us, and some of the unusual items I have noted for the third quarter, we felt it was appropriate to maintain our guidance range in the $3 to $3.20 range. 
So before I turn it back over to Bill for questions, let me note that the substantial integration planning and regulatory work related to the merger with Duke has not impacted our focus on execution and delivering results. 
Our nuclear performance has shown significant improvement. The regulatory flexibility in Florida continues to help offset weather variances, and we are carefully and deliberately addressing our challenges at Crystal River 3. So consistency in performance is what you have come to expect, but it is especially noteworthy in light of these significant merger activities. 
So now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for Q&A."

If you look at our Slide 12 in the material that we've put out, we have had some lagging to our forecast in both locations. And we really have had 2 pretty unusual weather years, so 2010 was a very significant anomaly of weather. In 2011, we've had, again, a deviation from normal weather. And so some of that has skewed the numbers a little bit. I think in a residential, what you see kind of on a weather-normalized basis for the year-to-date numbers on that chart on 12 is 0.7% or so change from the prior year, in Carolinas, down and Florida, actually a little bit up. It's hard to really put your finger on efficiency and how much impact it's had on the numbers. But we absolutely believe the economy, the state of play in terms of that has had some impact on usage and on how -- especially in the residential area, how much we've deviated from forecast. You see our commercial and our industrial numbers kind of flat or may be slightly down in commercial year-over-year. But longer term, our belief continues to be that we will see growth return to our territories in some significant ways, especially in the Carolinas and Florida. We believe both of them have longer-term dynamics that will be helpful and should grow maybe not to the levels we had experienced in the boom periods, but again pretty good growth. We're seeing a little bit of progress in housing in both locations, in the Carolinas and in Florida, but not to the robust way that it had been at one time obviously. So I think we're just going to slug through a little bit. I don't see anything dramatic that you can put your finger on that would explain some of these things."

I've managed to acquire a cold just in time for this call, so I'll apologize in advance for any sniffing, sneezing or coughing that you might hear. 
So as Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide highlights of the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, along with updates on our proposed merger with Duke Energy, the Crystal River 3 containment building repair and a couple of other items of interest. Then Mark will provide more details on our financial results. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. For the third quarter, we reported ongoing earnings of $344 million compared to $361 million for the same quarter a year ago. On a per share basis, we're down $0.07 from the third quarter in 2010. As Mark will review later, the results require a little explanation here. 
This quarter's ongoing earnings include a negative $0.08 for the impact of storm costs and replacement power disallowances in the Carolinas. Net of a positive litigation award related to spent nuclear fuel. This favorable litigation was our successful claim against the U.S. Department of Energy for failure to abide by a contract for federal disposition of nuclear spent fuel. As a result, during the third quarter we recorded a $92 million award as an offset for past spent fuel storage costs, including $27 million in O&M expense. 
So when you consider these various one-time items, both positive and negative, we're in line with last year's results for the third quarter and slightly ahead of last year's results on a year-to-date basis. Based on our performance for the first 3 quarters and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2011 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. 
Now let's turn to where we stand on the regulatory approvals of the Duke-Progress merger. There have been several developments in recent months, and you can see the updated merger scorecard on Slide 5. Both companies have made all the required filings. We're still targeting a closing by the end of this year, and both companies are working hard to have the necessary infrastructure in place. The actual closing date, of course, will ultimately be determined by the timing of regulatory approvals, including by the FERC and the state commissions in North and South Carolina. 
I'll comment on a couple of noteworthy events in the approval process.  Both companies held shareholder meetings on August 23 to vote on the merger. And the shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger, more than 90% for each company. We're very pleased with this strong response. It's a sign that Duke and Progress shareholders recognize the value of this strategic combination. 
In late September, we appeared before the North Carolina Utilities Commission and reviewed the advantages of this combination for customers. The commission is expected to rule later this year. 
Then on September 30 the FERC conditionally approved our merger application, expressing what they perceive to be adverse affects on wholesale competition in the Carolinas. In its order, the FERC described a number of different ways we could address their market power concerns, and final approval is subject to FERC's acceptance of our mitigation plan.
On October 17, our 2 companies filed a plan to address FERC's concerns. We proposed a virtual divestiture whereby Progress Energy and Duke Energy will offer up to a specified amount of power in the wholesale markets during the summer and winter peak periods. Progress Energy Carolinas will offer up to 500 megawatts during each summer hour, and Duke Energy Carolinas will offer up to 300 megawatts during each summer hour and 225 megawatts during each winter hour. The FERC set a 30-day comment period on our mitigation plan and that clock will run out in mid-November, then FERC will rule on our mitigation plan sometime after that. 
In South Carolina, we were originally scheduled to appear before the state's Public Service Commission last week for a review of our joint dispatch agreement, which is the focus of South Carolina's review. But in light of the FERC ruling, the South Carolina commission will now begin hearings the week of December 12.  Last week in Kentucky, we received the commission's final approval of the merger. As you might recall, they had given conditional approval earlier.  
Meanwhile, we continue to make significant progress in our plans for integrating the Duke and Progress organizations and staffing the new combined company. We announced the full executive leadership team in September, and our business units are now beginning to announce the next level of managers. Next week we will open up the voluntary severance program for employees in certain targeted areas.
I'm also pleased with how well the senior leaders of the new company are working together. This senior leadership team was named at the time of the merger announcement in January, and we've been meeting regularly to discuss and decide the many issues associated with a merger of this size. Again, much work needs to be done here, but the integration process has gone extremely well. We're looking forward to the value we will create for customers, shareholders and employees as a new combined company.
Now let's turn to the containment building repair effort at our Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. As you might recall, we suspended repair work on the containment building in mid-March after identifying additional concrete delamination in the building. We conducted a thorough engineering analysis and reviewed the structure and evaluated a wide range of repair options. 
On June 27, we presented our findings to the Florida Public Service Commission, including our preliminary recommendation to repair the structure and return the plant to service. In July, we filed a preliminary cost estimate for this repair between $900 million and $1.3 billion, with a projected return to service in 2014.
We continue to believe repairing the plant is better for our Florida customers than retiring and replacing it. But as I said in June, we are approaching this situation in a very disciplined structured way and continue to assess cost and feasibility at every step.
In August, the Florida Public Service Commission established a plan to review the prudence and costs related to the outage, including replacement power cost. The commission divided the docket into 3 phases. The first phase will focus on the events and decisions leading up to the delamination event on October 2, 2009. A hearing is scheduled for June 2012, and we filed initial supporting testimony last month.  
The second phase will review the decision whether to repair rather than decommission the unit, and the third phase will include a review of the decisions and events subsequent to the October 2009 event and leading up to the March 2011 delamination and ultimate repair of the containment building.
Slide 6 presents cost data for the repair and replacement power cost through September 30. We are still continuing to refine our engineering analysis and developing bid repair documents, as well as continuing to prepare the plant's infrastructure for the repair work. 
You can see some details on insurance coverage on the bottom half of Slide 6. As you know, we maintain insurance coverage against incremental cost of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages through NEIL. 
We've had ongoing discussions within NEIL, NEIL representatives as they systematically review this claim. NEIL has retained outside engineering consultants, and we are working closely with them as they perform their due diligence.  This is a complex matter, and it's in our best interest to work cooperatively with NEIL to provide them with all the information they need to make their coverage decisions.
Now I want to spend a few moments discussing several issues listed on Slide 7. This quarter, we resolved the lawsuit with a large holder of the contingent value obligations that were associated with 4 of our synthetic coal fuel plants. 
As part of that settlement, we agreed to purchase the holder's CVOs for $0.75 per unit. We also announced earlier this week that we're going to tender for the balance of the outstanding CVOs at the same $0.75 per unit. This action triggered a pretax mark-to-market accounting adjustment of $63 million which we recorded in the third quarter. As it's been our practice, CVO mark-to-market adjustments are not included in ongoing earnings. 
You might recall that we issued $98.6 million of these securities in connection with our merger with Florida Progress in 2000, and it makes sense to redeem them in advance of the merger with Duke. 
Also during the third quarter, we encountered the fury of Hurricane Irene. This was a significant event for us in late August, and we appreciate the long hours our employees, contractors and other utilities put in to restore power. We incurred O&M damages of $24 million or $0.05 per share associated with the repairs. As a side note, we've sent about 200 Progress and contract personnel to help with service restoration after the weekend's snowstorms to the north of us.
Now before Mark goes over to the financials, I want to mention a couple of recent milestones in our fleet modernization program which involves retiring older coal-fired plants and building advanced new gas-fired units. On October 1, we retired the 170-megawatt Weatherspoon coal-fired plant near Lumberton, North Carolina. The 3 coal units at that site entered service between 1949 and 1952. 
And on September 22, we had a ceremony renaming our Richmond County energy complex near Rockingham, North Carolina. This facility has 1,900 megawatts of capacity fueled by natural gas. And it's the second-largest station in our Carolinas fleet. The site's latest unit began service in June. 
This Richmond County facility is now called the Sherwood H. Smith Jr. Energy Complex. So those of you who are around the industry any time during the 1980s or 1990s will remember the outstanding leadership Sherwood provided this company, including serving for 17 years as CEO. 
Now Mark will provide a little more detail on the numbers for the quarter."

I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 8. Slide 9 shows our third quarter ongoing earnings and for the third quarter 2011, we reported $1.16 per share versus $1.23 last year. The Progress Energy Carolinas was down $",1182,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I will cover the topics outlined on Slide 8. Slide 9 shows our third quarter ongoing earnings and for the third quarter 2011, we reported $1.16 per share versus $1.23 last year. 
The Progress Energy Carolinas was down $0.11, Progress Energy Florida was up $0.08 and then the Corporate and Other was $0.04 unfavorable. 
The main drivers for the quarter were less favorable weather than 2010, disallowances on replacement power costs in the Carolinas, partially offset by lower O&M, lower amortization expenses in Florida and lower interest costs.
Slide 10 shows our waterfall chart for the third quarter, and we've identified the major drivers in the key variances. On the positive side, we had the impact of higher costs or removal amortization in Florida, improved O&M performance, which includes the negative impact of storm costs with an offsetting positive for the spent nuclear fuel litigation award that Bill described, lower interest expense in 2010 reflecting the lower rate environment and the impact of resolving the 2004 and 2005 income tax audits. And on the negative side, weather compared to a very strong 2010 accounted for $0.06 of negativity and then we had $0.08 of replacement power disallowances at Progress Energy Carolinas. 
This item relates to the challenging nuclear performance we experienced in 2010. You will recall we had a number of unplanned outages in our Carolinas nuclear fleet last year. We have taken significant remediation steps to improve performance here, and the early signs of progress have shown up in the 2011 operating statistics for our nuclear fleet. So this kind of regulatory compromise happens infrequently but in a regulated utility, sharing the impact of operating challenges between the company and customers was appropriate in this situation.
So overall the variance from 2010 can be primarily attributed to the replacement power disallowance. And when that is considered, our earnings are effectively in line with the third quarter of 2010. 
So now I'll turn to Slide 11 which is our year-to-date waterfall chart and again, several brief points on the larger items here. Year-to-date, we have utilized a total of $205 million in cost of removal amortization in Florida versus $60 million utilized through 3 quarters in 2010. 
The very strong weather we had in 2010 accounts for the negative $0.25 item in the year-over-year comparison. The wholesale variance on a year-to-date basis is $0.09 which as you'll recall, we had anticipated coming into 2011 due primarily to several wholesale contracts at PEF that were expiring.
So to close my comments on the waterfall charts, I'd repeat the point from the third quarter discussion in that if you consider the $0.08 of replacement power disallowance with the $2.56 year-to-date earnings, we're slightly ahead of 2010's results through 9 months.
Slide 12 shows our weather-adjusted retail sales, and there are 3 key points on this slide. The first one relates to the very significant impacts of whether on retail sales at both utilities. So as we said, 2010 was a strong weather year at both utilities and as you can see, weather is 2.6% of the total 3% negative variance at PEC and essentially the full variance in total retail sales at PEF. 
Second point is recognition that our growth and usage numbers are still trailing our forecast through 9 months of the year. So we're behind our plan by 1.3% at Progress Energy Carolinas and 0.6% behind at PEF. So lower-than-expected customer growth has been the larger variance, with the usage being closer to our expectations. 
And the third and final point is we did see positive movement in growth and usage in both jurisdictions in the quarter. So we expect the full year to be a little weaker than our forecast with a return to more normal sales growth still further down the road.
As I mentioned last quarter, our industrial customers showed a strong recovery in 2010 and carry over into early 2011. But starting in the second quarter of this year, our customers began reporting increasing inventories and excess capacity and some have instituted shorter operating hours. This softness carried into the third quarter as well. 
On a positive note, we are encouraged by a series of recent economic development announcements in our service territories. Most notably with the announcement that Continental Tire would build a large facility Sumter, South Carolina that will ultimately employee over 1,500 workers. So our service territories continue to be attractive places for relocation and expansion, and this should be a positive for our long-term growth.
Now I'll turn to Slide 13, which is our standard slide on customer growth and low usage accounts. Both the Carolinas and Florida continue to show positive customer growth compared to a year ago. Both appear to have leveled out over the last several quarters, with Florida showing in net addition of 8,000 customers year-over-year and the Carolinas adding 6,000 customers year-over-year. 
So next I'll turn to the major capital projects on Slide 14, which just gives you a brief update on the major capital projects we have underway, primarily our 2 new combined cycle plants that are scheduled for completion in 2013 along with our Smart Grid program. As Bill noted in his comments, the retirement of older coal units to be replaced by these new combined cycles continues to be executed effectively and is going very well. 
In Slide 15, I just wanted to highlight a number of points that you should consider regarding our results for the full year of 2011. On a trailing 12-month basis, our ongoing earnings are $3.01, but that includes the $0.08 negative item for replacement power disallowance. 
In 2010, our fourth quarter earnings were $0.45. For the cost of removal amortization at PEF, as I said we've amortized $205 million through 9 months. There is $294 million remaining to be amortized under our settlement over the next 15 months. So this gives us flexibility going into the fourth quarter and into 2012. 
On the O&M front, we have completed our planned nuclear refueling outages for 2011, and in 2010 we had 85 outage days in Q4, which hopefully should not recur providing us an opportunity for more favorable O&M comparisons to 2010. So when we consider the flexibility these items provide us, and some of the unusual items I have noted for the third quarter, we felt it was appropriate to maintain our guidance range in the $3 to $3.20 range. 
So before I turn it back over to Bill for questions, let me note that the substantial integration planning and regulatory work related to the merger with Duke has not impacted our focus on execution and delivering results. 
Our nuclear performance has shown significant improvement. The regulatory flexibility in Florida continues to help offset weather variances, and we are carefully and deliberately addressing our challenges at Crystal River 3. So consistency in performance is what you have come to expect, but it is especially noteworthy in light of these significant merger activities. 
So now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for Q&A."

If you look at our Slide 12 in the material that we've put out, we have had some lagging to our forecast in both locations. And we really have had 2 pretty unusual weather years, so 2010 was a very significant anomaly in weather. In 2011 we've had, again, a deviation from normal weather. And so some of that has skewed the numbers a little bit. I think in a residential, what you see kind of on a weather-normalized basis for the year-to-date numbers on that chart on 12 is 0.7% or so change from the prior year, in Carolinas down and Florida actually a little bit up. It's hard to really put your finger on efficiency and how much impact it's had on the numbers. But we absolutely believe the economy, the state of play in terms of that has had some impact on usage and on how -- especially in the residential area, how much we've deviated from forecast. You see our commercial and our industrial numbers kind of flat or may be slightly down in commercial year-over-year. But longer term, our belief continues to be that we will see growth return to our territories in some significant way, especially in the Carolinas and Florida. We believe both of them have longer-term dynamics that will be helpful and should grow maybe not to the levels we had experienced in the boom periods, but again pretty good growth. We're seeing a little bit of progress in housing in both locations, in the Carolinas and in Florida, but not to the robust way that it had been at one time obviously. So I think we're just going to slug through a little bit. I don't see anything dramatic that you can put your finger on that would explain some of these things."
