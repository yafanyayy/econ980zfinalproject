Revenues were $393.5 million, up 25.5% from $313.5 million in the fourth quarter of '09. Domestic revenues were $292.6 million. Domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenues were $250 million and the returns and recall revenues were $42.6 million. The international revenues were $100.9 million, including an unfavorable exchange impact of $1 million. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up approximately 8%, consisting of Small Quantity, up 9% and Large Quantity, up 6%. International internal growth, adjusted for exchange, was up approximately 8%. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed $32.5 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $182.5 million or 46.4% of revenues and SG&A expense was $75.7 million or 19.2% of revenues. Net interest expense was $10.7 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $50 million or $0.50 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.69 adjusted for after-tax transaction expenses related also to other adjustments. At the end of the quarter, our revolver borrowings were approximately $175 million and is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $491 million. As we mentioned before, in October 15, 2010, we received the $400 million private placement and those proceeds were used to prepay part of the term debt that we have and reduce the revolver. We purchased 709,867 shares of common stock in the open market in the quarter at an amount of $50.7 million. Capital spending was $12.4 million and DSO at the end of the quarter was 51 days. The cash provided from operations was $325.7 million for the year, which includes $23 million of cash received from the fourth quarter from our customers to be used for recalled product reimbursement.

At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 485,400 accounts, of which over 472,000 were small and the remainder were large.

With our Large Quantity customers, we have multiple service offerings, which add to the value of each account and today, less than 20% of our LQ customers are using our multiple services, leaving more than 80% of our LQ customer base available for growth. Likewise, with our Small Quantity customers, we offer multiple services that increase the value of an account and today, approximately a third of our SQ customers utilize multiple services, leaving 2/3 of our customer base available for growth. In closing, we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance leading to a record year in 2010 and we especially want to recognize our recall team for successfully managing the large spike in volumes we experienced on a few major recalls.

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. During the fourth quarter, we completed 17 acquisitions, six domestic and 11 international. The incremental revenue impact in the fourth quarter of 2010 from these acquisitions was $8.8 million. The annualized revenue of these acquisitions is approximately $65 million. Now, keep in mind, our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and transactional expenses related to acquisitions. Now, I'll provide you the outlook for 2011. We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.76 to $2.80 per share, which we're comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2011 will be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.58 billion, depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have an adjusted estimate for free cash flow between $278 million and $283 million and as reported free cash flow of $255 million to $260 million after taking into account the $23 million cash outflow for the recall product reimbursement. CapEx is anticipated between $45 million and $55 million. In closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2011 and beyond.

Good strong organic growth blended for both international and domestic. But as I said in my prepared comments, what we're really looking at is an expanding portfolio of services, and for example, we mentioned Rx Waste, which domestically is a $200 million plus opportunity for us. That has really just begun to barely touch our customer base. And as I mentioned in my comments, it's somewhere between 20% or only a third of our customers depending LQ, SQ have even adopted more than one of our service offerings. So I think that's going to be a large part of the growth drivers. And then we'll continue to do our acquisitions because as Frank, said we're an acquisitive company. So the combination of the two should really fuel the growth going forward."

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed 17 acquisitions, six domestic and 11 international. The incremental revenue impact in the fourth quarter of 2010 from these acquisitions was $8.8 million. The annualized revenue of these acquisitions is approximately $65 million. Now keep in mind, our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and transactional expenses related to acquisitions. 
Now to provide you the outlook for 2011. We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.76 to $2.80 per share which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2011 will be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.58 billion, depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have an adjusted estimate for free cash flow between $278 million and $283 million, and as reported free cash flow of $255 million to $260 million after taking into account the $23 million cash outflow for the recall product reimbursement. CapEx is anticipated between $45 million and $55 million.

The quantity of recalls again and the awareness campaign continues to work in that we do more recalls and also in more industries. And that's continuously also with the acquisition that we did that expands the capabilities. So we are allocating resources there and foresee that, that comes. But at the same time, in giving guidance, we really don't know what the amount of recalls are going to be in a year.

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. During the fourth quarter, we completed 17 acquisitions, six domestic, and 11 international.

Now keep in mind, our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and transactional expenses related acquisitions. Now I’d like to provide you the outlook for 2011. We believe the analyst EPS estimates will be in the range $2.76 to $2.80 per share, which we were comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2011 will be in the range of $1.55 to $1.58 billion depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. 
We believe analysts will have an adjusted estimate for free cash flow between $278 million and $283 million and as reported free cash flow of $255 million to $260 million after taking into account the $23 million cash outflow for the recalled product reimbursement. CapEx is anticipated between $45 million and $55 million.

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed 17 acquisitions, six domestic and 11 international. The incremental revenue impact in the fourth quarter of 2010 from these acquisitions was $8.8 million. The annualized revenue of these acquisitions is approximately $65 million. Now keep in mind, our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and transactional expenses related to acquisitions. 
Now to provide you the outlook for 2011. We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.76 to $2.80 per share which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2011 will be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.58 billion, depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have an adjusted estimate for free cash flow between $278 million and $283 million, and as reported free cash flow of $255 million to $260 million after taking into account the $23 million cash outflow for the recall product reimbursement. CapEx is anticipated between $45 million and $55 million.

Can you help us understand as to the reason why you may not get above corporate margin post-synergy for that deal?"

During the first quarter this year, we completed 9 acquisitions: 3 domestic and 6 international. The incremental revenue impact in the first quarter of 2011 was $1.8 million. On April 18, we announced the completion of HWS acquisition, and the annualized revenues of all of these acquisitions is approximately $57 million. Now keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, acquisition-related expenses and integration expenses. And please note, we have not yet finalized the integration expense estimate for HWS. 
We believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.79 to $2.82, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts' revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion, depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $284 million and $288 million, and as reported free cash flow of $261 million to $265 million.

During the first quarter this year, we completed 9 acquisitions: 3 domestic and 6 international. The incremental revenue impact in the first quarter of 2011 was $1.8 million. On April 18, we announced the completion of HWS acquisition, and the annualized revenues of all of these acquisitions is approximately $57 million. Now keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, acquisition-related expenses and integration expenses. And please note, we have not yet finalized the integration expense estimate for HWS. 
We believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.79 to $2.82, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts' revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion, depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $284 million and $288 million, and as reported free cash flow of $261 million to $265 million.

Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up 8%, consisting of Small Quantity of 9%, and Large Quantity customers of 6%. International internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 4%. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed $34.9 million to the growth in the quarter, and gross profit was $186.7 million or 45.5% of revenues. SG&A expense was $78 million, or 19% of revenues, and net interest expense was $12.9 million. And just a comment, in May, we repaid the remaining balance of the $76.9 million of our 2009 3-year term loan, and accelerated non-cash unamortized term loan fees of $1.2 million.
Net income attributable to Stericycle is $55.5 million, or $0.63 per share on an as reported basis, and $0.69 adjusted for acquisition expenses and the term loan fees. Now the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $387 million, and the unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $297 million.

Revenues from acquisitions now previously announced were $1.2 million in the quarter, and annualized were approximately $9.8 million. Now keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition-related expenses. We believe analysts, EPS estimates after adjusting for the Healthcare Waste Solutions integration expenses will be in the range of $2.78 per share to $2.80 per share, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange.

Revenues were $410.4 million, up 18% from $347.7 million in the Q2 of '10. Domestic revenues were $300.7 million. Domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenue were $273.8 million. Returns and recall revenues were $26.9 million in the quarter. International revenues were $109.7 million, including a favorable exchange impact of $7.4 million.
Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up 8%, consisting of Small Quantity, up 9%; and Large Quantity customers, up 6%. International internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 4%. Acquisitions less than 12-month old contributed $34.9 million to the growth in the quarter, and gross profit was $186.7 million or 45.5% of revenues. SG&A expense was $78 million or 19% of revenues, and net interest expense was $12.9 million. And just a comment, in May, we repaid the remaining balance of the $76.9 million of our 2009 3-year term loan and accelerated the noncash unamortized term loan fees of $1.2 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle is $55.5 million or $0.63 per share on an as reported basis and $0.69 adjusted for acquisition expenses and the term loan fees. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $387 million, and the unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $297 million. We purchased 50,675 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $4.3 million in the quarter. Cumulatively, we've purchased approximately 14.7 million shares and still of authorization to purchase an additional 5.8 million shares. The CapEx in the quarter was $12 million, and our DSO was 53 days. The cash provided from operations year-to-date was $119.7 million.

At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 508,000 accounts of which over 493,600 were Small and the remainder were Large. We continue to see strong worldwide growth driven by new accounts acquisition, the adoption of our expanding portfolio of service offerings. Today, only 20% of our LQ and 30% of our SQ customers are using more than one of our multiple services. And the remaining pool of customers provides a long runway for future growth. We remain very excited about this opportunity because adoption of multiple services has the potential to more than double or triple the revenues per customer.
We want to thank each number of our worldwide team for their solid performance and their continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. I'll turn it over to Mark."

I'd now like to provide insight in our current outlook for 2011, and please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. During the second quarter, we completed 11 acquisitions; 7 domestic and 4 international, and this includes the Healthcare Waste Solutions or HWS acquisition, which we discussed in our last call. Revenues from acquisitions now previously announced were $1.2 million in the quarter and annualized were approximately $9.8 million. Now keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition-related expenses. 
We believe analyst EPS estimates after adjusting for the Healthcare Waste Solutions integration expenses will be in the range of $2.78 per share to $2.80 per share, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. I believe analysts Would have estimates for free cash flow between $284 million and $288 million and an as reported free cash flow of $261 million to $265 million. CapEx is anticipated between $45 million and $55 million.
In closing, very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2011 and beyond. We thank you for your time. And operator, we'll now go to the Q&A session."

Revenues were $410.4 million, up 18% from $347.7 million in the Q2 of '10. Domestic revenues were $300.7 million. Domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenue were $273.8 million. Returns and recall revenues were $26.9 million in the quarter. International revenues were $109.7 million, including a favorable exchange impact of $7.4 million.
Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up 8%, consisting of Small Quantity, up 9%; and Large Quantity customers, up 6%. International internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 4%. Acquisitions less than 12-month old contributed $34.9 million to the growth in the quarter, and gross profit was $186.7 million or 45.5% of revenues. SG&A expense was $78 million or 19% of revenues, and net interest expense was $12.9 million. And just a comment, in May, we repaid the remaining balance of the $76.9 million of our 2009 3-year term loan and accelerated the noncash unamortized term loan fees of $1.2 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle is $55.5 million or $0.63 per share on an as reported basis and $0.69 adjusted for acquisition expenses and the term loan fees. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $387 million, and the unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $297 million. We purchased 50,675 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $4.3 million in the quarter. Cumulatively, we've purchased approximately 14.7 million shares and still have authorization to purchase an additional 5.8 million shares. The CapEx in the quarter was $12 million, and our DSO was 53 days. The cash provided from operations year-to-date was $119.7 million.

I'd now like to provide insight in our current outlook for 2011, and please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. During the second quarter, we completed 11 acquisitions; 7 domestic and 4 international, and this includes the Healthcare Waste Solutions or HWS acquisition, which we discussed in our last call. Revenues from acquisitions not previously announced were $1.2 million in the quarter and annualized were approximately $9.8 million. Now keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition-related expenses. 
We believe analyst EPS estimates after adjusting for the Healthcare Waste Solutions integration expenses will be in the range of $2.78 per share to $2.80 per share, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. Believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $284 million and $288 million and an as reported free cash flow of $261 million to $265 million.

Returns and recall revenues were $26.9 million in the quarter. International revenues were $109.7 million, including a favorable exchange impact of $7.4 million.
Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up 8%, consisting of Small Quantity, up 9%; and Large Quantity customers, up 6%. International internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 4%. Acquisitions less than 12-month old contributed $34.9 million to the growth in the quarter, and gross profit was $186.7 million or 45.5% of revenues. SG&A expense was $78 million or 19% of revenues, and net interest expense was $12.9 million. And just a comment, in May, we repaid the remaining balance of the $76.9 million of our 2009 3-year term loan and accelerated the noncash unamortized term loan fees of $1.2 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle is $55.5 million or $0.63 per share on an as reported basis and $0.69 adjusted for acquisition expenses and the term loan fees. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $387 million, and the unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $297 million. We purchased 50,675 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $4.3 million in the quarter. Cumulatively, we've purchased approximately 14.7 million shares and still have authorization to purchase an additional 5.8 million shares.

Revenues from acquisitions not previously announced were $1.2 million in the quarter and annualized were approximately $9.8 million. Now keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition-related expenses. 
We believe analyst EPS estimates after adjusting for the Healthcare Waste Solutions integration expenses will be in the range of $2.78 per share to $2.80 per share, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. Believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $284 million and $288 million and an as reported free cash flow of $261 million to $265 million.

The results for the third quarter are as follows: Revenues were $420.9 million, up 16% from $363 million in Q3 of '10. Domestic revenues were $303.9 million.

The results for the third quarter are as follows: Revenues were $420.9 million, up 16% from $363 million in Q3 of '10. Domestic revenues were $303.9 million. Domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenues were $278.7 million. International revenues were $117.1 million including a favorable exchange impact of $4.1 million. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management was up 7%, consisting of SQ up % and LQ up 6%. International internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 5%. 
The returns in recall revenues were $25.1 million versus $31.9 million the prior-year quarter. Acquisitions, less than 12 month old, contributed $43.9 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $190.1 million or 45.2% of revenues. Acquisition mix unfavorably impacted gross margin percent by the 50 basis points, offsetting a sequential 20 basis point improvement. 
SG&A expense was $79.1 million or 18.8% of revenues. Net interest expense was $11.8 million. And then late September, we closed on the renewal of their senior revolving facility for $1 billion at a spread of 137.5 basis points over LIBOR, versus 75 basis points over LIBOR on a prior facility. 
Net income attributable to Stericycle was $59.2 million or $0.68 per share on an as reported basis, and $0.71 adjusted for acquisition expenses and other non-recurring expenses. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $528 million. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $313 million. In the quarter, we repurchased over 962,000 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $76.9 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 4.9 million shares. 
Our CapEx was $13.3 million in the quarter. Our DSO was 58 days. However, excluding the third quarter acquisitions, it was 53 days. With the full impact of these acquisitions in Q4, the DSO is anticipated to be in a range of 51 days to 61 days. Q3 year-to-date, the cash provided from operations was $215.2 million.

At the end of the quarter we had approximately 517,000 accounts of which over 501,600 were Small and other major were Large. We continue to see strong worldwide growth driven by the expanding portfolio services that complement our core regulated waste and service. For our SQ customers, the growth drivers are Steri-Safe and clinical service compliance programs, and for our LQ customers the growth drivers are Sharps Management and Pharma Waste Services. 
Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to fuel our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 17 transactions. 16 of these acquisitions enhanced our existing platforms and the 17th was our first acquisition in Spain. We also continued to invest in new service offerings such as patient communications and additional recall services. 
As we head into 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ at 8% to 10%, LQ at 5% to 8%, and international at 5 to 8%. We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. 
We want to take time to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. And I'll turn it over to Mark."

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. As Rich mentioned during the third quarter we completed 17 acquisitions; 6 domestic and 11 international. Revenues from these acquisitions were approximately $11 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $103 million. But keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition expenses. 
For 2011 we believe analysts EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.81 to $2.82, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $285 million and $290 million, and then an as reported cash flow of $262 million to $267 million. And capital expenditure is anticipated between $50 million and $55 million this year. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary outlook for 2012. We believe the analyst EPS estimates would be in the range of $3.19 to $3.25, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $320 million and $325 million, with CapEx anticipated between $60 million and $65 million. 
In closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities this year and beyond. We thank you for taking the time to listen to our prepared statements and we'll now open it up to Q&A."

The results for the third quarter are as follows: Revenues were $420.9 million, up 16% from $363 million in Q3 of '10. Domestic revenues were $303.9 million. Domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenues were $278.7 million. International revenues were $117.1 million including a favorable exchange impact of $4.1 million. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management was up 7%, consisting of SQ up 8% and LQ up 6%. International internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 5%.
 
The returns in recall revenues were $25.1 million versus $31.9 million the prior-year quarter. Acquisitions less than 12 month old contributed $43.9 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $190.1 million or 45.2% of revenues. Acquisition mix unfavorably impacted gross margin percent by 50 basis points, offsetting a sequential 20 basis-point improvement. 
SG&A expense was $79.1 million or 18.8% of revenues. Net interest expense was $11.8 million. And then late September, we closed on the renewal of the senior revolver facility for $1 billion at a spread of 137.5 basis points over LIBOR, versus 75 basis points over LIBOR on our prior facility. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $59.2 million or $0.68 per share on an as-reported basis, and $71 million adjusted for acquisition expenses and other non-recurring expenses. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $528 million. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $313 million. In the quarter, we repurchased over 962,000 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $76.9 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 4.9 million shares.
Our CapEx was $13.3 million in the quarter. Our DSO was 58 days. However, excluding the third quarter acquisitions, it was 53 days. With the full impact of these acquisitions in Q4, the DSO is anticipated to be in a range of 51 days to 61 days. Q3 year-to-date, the cash provided from operations was $215.2 million.

At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 517,000 accounts of which over 501,600 were Small and other major were Large. We continue to see strong worldwide growth driven by the expanding portfolio services that complement our core regulated waste service. For our SQ customers, the growth drivers are Steri-Safe and clinical service compliance programs. And for our LQ customers the growth drivers are Sharps Management and Pharma Waste services. 
Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to fuel our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 17 transactions. 16 of these acquisitions enhanced our existing platforms and the 17th was our first acquisition in Spain. We also continued to invest in new service offerings such as patient communications and additional recall services. 
As we head into 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ at 8% to 10%, LQ at 5% to 8%, and international at 5 to 8%. We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues.

Keep in mind, our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition expenses.
For 2011 we believe analysts EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.81 to $2.82, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $285 million and $290 million, and then as reported cash flow of $262 million to $267 million. And capital expenditures, as anticipated, between $50 million and $55 million this year.
 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary outlook for 2012. We believe the analyst EPS estimates would be in the range of $3.19 to $3.25, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. And we believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $320 million and $325 million, with CapEx anticipated between $60 million and $65 million.

This is an intriguing space to us because it leverages off the existing infrastructure that we already have in the recall space and the return space. And it also, frankly, services both SQ and LQ and could be market opportunity of upwards to $1 billion over time, depending on how we execute it. But right now we're just testing it, we're figuring out the synergies. But the reason I included them in my remarks is I just wanted to point out that our strong free cash flow let's us not only do tuck-in acquisitions or buy new platforms like Spain, but we can also invest in new services that kind of build off of our platforms."

The results for the third quarter are as follows: Revenues were $420.9 million, up 16% from $363 million in Q3 of '10. Domestic revenues were $303.9 million. Domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenues were $278.7 million. International revenues were $117.1 million including a favorable exchange impact of $4.1 million. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management was up 7%, consisting of SQ up 8% and LQ up 6%. International internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 5%.
 
The returns and recall revenues were $25.1 million versus $31.9 million the prior-year quarter. Acquisitions less than 12 month old contributed $43.9 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $190.1 million or 45.2% of revenues. Acquisition mix unfavorably impacted gross margin percent by 50 basis points, offsetting a sequential 20 basis-point improvement. 
SG&A expense was $79.1 million or 18.8% of revenues. Net interest expense was $11.8 million. And in late September, we closed on the renewal of the senior revolver facility for $1 billion at a spread of 137.5 basis points over LIBOR, versus 75 basis points over LIBOR on our prior facility. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $59.2 million or $0.68 per share on an as-reported basis, and $71 million adjusted for acquisition expenses and other non-recurring expenses. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $528 million. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $313 million. In the quarter, we repurchased over 962,000 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $76.9 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 4.9 million shares.
Our CapEx was $13.3 million in the quarter. Our DSO was 58 days. However, excluding the third quarter acquisitions, it was 53 days. With the full impact of these acquisitions in Q4, the DSO is anticipated to be in a range of 51 days to 61 days. Q3 year-to-date, the cash provided from operations was $215.2 million.

For our SQ customers, the growth drivers are Steri-Safe and clinical service compliance programs. And for our LQ customers the growth drivers are Sharps Management and Pharma Waste services. 
Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to fuel our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 17 transactions. 16 of these acquisitions enhanced our existing platforms and the 17th was our first acquisition in Spain. We also continue to invest in new service offerings such as patient communications and additional recall services. 
As we head into 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ at 8% to 10%, LQ at 5% to 8%, and international at 5 to 8%. We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. 
We want to take time to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. And I'll turn it over to Mark."

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. 
As Rich mentioned during the third quarter we completed 17 acquisitions: 6 domestic and 11 international. Revenues from these acquisitions were approximately $11 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $103 million. Keep in mind, our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition expenses.
For 2011 we believe analysts EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.81 to $2.82, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $285 million and $290 million, and then as reported cash flow of $262 million to $267 million. And capital expenditures, as anticipated, between $50 million and $55 million this year.
 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary outlook for 2012. We believe the analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.19 to $3.25, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. And we believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $320 million and $325 million, with CapEx anticipated between $60 million and $65 million.
In closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities this year and beyond. We thank you for taking the time to listen to our prepared statements and we'll now open it up to Q&A."

In terms of patient communications, as we mentioned, we've done platform acquisition, we've put a couple of other acquisitions to that. This is an intriguing space to us because it leverages off the existing infrastructure that we already have in the recall space and the return space.

But right now we're just testing it, we're figuring out the synergies.

As we are ready talked from a gross margin point of view, it kind of starts at about 448-ish, and then 10 to 20 sequential quarterly increase. SG&A, I talked already for the mid-kind of 18s [ph], and that includes stock option amortization. And DSO, I think I made a mistake in the script, I said 51, but it stood kind of 61. It's kind of 58 to 61 with the inclusion of the acquisitions we just did."

You said that the acquisitions will hit gross margins by another 50 basis points sequentially. Would that be offset 10 to 20 basis points so the net decline in gross margin would be more like 30? Or are you saying, including the organic improvement, we should expect an overall gross margin pressure of about 50 bps?"

And 1 important part for next year too, Scott, maybe still relating to your part is exchange rates have changed over the last 3 to 4 weeks. And so, many of you obviously that have had models out now since the last call that were done late kind of July when exchange rate were more favorable. The difference between then and now is probably the equivalent of about $23 million, roughly, of revenues that you need to think about. Now that goes all the way through the income statement on international, but it is something to take into account when you do your forecasting and think about exchange rates."
