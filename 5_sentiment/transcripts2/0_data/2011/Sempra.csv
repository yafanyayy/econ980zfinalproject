And again, thank you, all, for joining us. 
On today's call, I'd like to accomplish several things, first, start with a review of our fourth quarter and year-end financial results and then talk about our dividend increase in how this aligns with our increasingly predictable earnings. And then finally, I'll give you on operational update on our utilities and our Infrastructure businesses. 
To the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $280 million or $1.15 per share compared with $288 million or $1.16 per share in the same period last year. If you exclude the results of commodities, assets have now been sold, earnings per share for the fourth quarter rose 34% or $1.18 per share from $0.88 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. And for the full year 2010, we recorded earnings of $739 million or $2.98 per share compared with 2009 earnings of $1.12 billion or $4.52 per share.
When you exclude the results of Sempra Commodities from both years, earnings per share for the full year rose 14% to $3.61 per share in 2010 from $3.16 per share in 2009.
Our core businesses performed well in 2010, and our earnings from those businesses have exceeded our guidance for the year. 
With regard to the dividend, I'd like to mention that Tuesday morning after our board meeting approved such, we announced a 23% increase on our quarterly dividend, which brings the annualized dividend to $1.92 per share. 
Exiting the commodities trading business marks a new chapter for Sempra. We have note our strategic focus, reducing both our risk profile and earnings volatility while leveraging our core strengths. This has allowed us to significantly increase our dividend and be able to grow the dividend while still reinvesting capital for future growth.
Now let me hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the detailed financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas and Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter were $105 million. That's up from $67 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $16 million higher margin a $16 million benefit from the partial recovery",665,"Thanks, Don.. At San Diego Gas and Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter were $105 million. That's up from $67 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $16 million higher margin a $16 million benefit from the partial recovery of increased wildfire insurance premiums and a $9 million from the favorable resolution of prior year's tax matters. 
Full year 2010 earnings increased to $369 million from $344 million last year. The increase of $25 million was due primarily to higher margins, partially offset by higher litigation reserves. 
Now moving to Southern California Gas. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings were $74 million compared with $75 million in the fourth quarter of '09. For the full year 2010, earnings for this business were $286 million, up from $273 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to improved operating margins.
Now let's go to Slide 5. Our Generation business recorded earnings of $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $45 million in the same quarter 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 included lower earnings from operations and a $6 million loss on the sale of our 50% interest in the Elk Hills Power plant, offset by higher renewable energy tax credits, primarily from the Copper Mountain Solar project. 
For the full year 2010, Generation recorded earnings of $103 million compared with earnings of $169 million in 2009. Results for 2010 reflect an $87 million charge related to the settlement of energy crisis litigation, $31 million of lower earnings from operations, primarily due to increased scheduled maintenance in 2010, offset by $48 million higher renewable energy credits, primarily from the Copper Mountain Solar project. 
Now let's move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $37 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $6 million of higher earnings from operations, offset by a $5 million write-down of our investment in Argentina, which was net of related tax benefits. 
For a full year 2010, Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $159 million compared with earnings of $101 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to a $64 million write-off of our Liberty Gas Storage assets in 2009 and a $13 million favorable resolution of prior year tax matters, also in 2009.
Now please turn to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. That compares with earnings of $35 million in the prior year's period. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were higher due to payments from customers for contracted cargoes that were not delivered. 
For the full year of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $68 million. That's up from earnings of $16 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to a full operation in 2010. You will recall that our Cameron LNG facility became operational, and our supply contract with 10 new partners for the Energía Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009. 
Now let's move to the next slide. As Don stated, our board authorized a 23% increase in the dividend. This takes the dividend to $1.92 per share on an annualized basis, up from our current annualized dividend of $1.56 per share. 
Going forward, we plan to target a 45% to 50% payout ratio. 
Now for an update on our share repurchases. The $500 million accelerated share repurchase program that began in 2010 will conclude by the end of this quarter. You will recall that at our analyst conference last year, we assumed $750 million of share repurchases, and we still may do that if it looks prudent to do so. 
However, given the South American acquisition and other opportunities, it will likely be later this year before we make a decision on future buybacks. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with Slide 9."
120622,127283290,106020,"Sempra Energy, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on some key activities with our businesses, and I'll start with our California utilities. In December, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Company filed their general rate case applications. Like our",915,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on some key activities with our businesses, and I'll start with our California utilities. 
In December, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Company filed their general rate case applications. Like our last rate case, we are seeking to set rates for a four-year cycle take the general rate case is will establish the revenue requirements for 2012, and we've requested attrition mechanisms to adjust the margins for the years 2013 through 2015. 
The requested increase for 2012 by each utility is approximately 6% over present rates, and the attrition mechanisms would result in expected annual increases of 3% per year for the following three years. And also, the rate case plans call for new rates to be effective January 1, 2012.
To update you on some of the major utility capital projects. At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction is progressing as planned on the Sunrise Powerlink projects, and we remain on track to complete this project in the second half of next year. 
Turning to our Smart Meter programs. At SDG&E, we have now installed approximately two million meters ever on schedule to complete all installations by the end of this year. 
And at Southern California Gas company, installations of meters are scheduled to begin late next year.
Let's go to the next slide. At Sempra Generation, the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain Solar project in Nevada was completed in December, and the power generated by the plant is sold under a 20-year contract to Pacific Gas & Electric. 
The next solar project that we plan to start building was Mesquite Solar. This project is located near our Mesquite natural fire powered plant outside of Phoenix, but we have an plant ultimately developed up to 700 megawatts of solar capacity. We have an agreement to sell the power produced by the first 150-megawatt phase of the project to PG&E under a 20-year contract. And that contract is now pending approval from the CPUC.
As you may have seen, we have now selected a technology supplier and the EPC contractor for the project and expect to start construction later this year. Completion of all 150 megawatts is anticipated to be done in 2013. 
Construction continues on the Cedar Creek II wind project, which is a 50-50 partnership with BP Wind Energy. This 250-megawatt project located in Northern Colorado remains on schedule for completion mid this year. The power produced by the facility will be sold under a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement with a public service company of Colorado.
And finally, at the end of last year, we sold our 50% interest in the 550-megawatt Elk Hills combined cycle plant to our former partner. We received proceeds of $175 million or $636 per kilowatt, which was a good price for a merchant asset. 
Let's now go to the next slide. Last month, we announced the acquisition stakes in two electric distribution companies in South America with we co-own with AEI. These were in Chilquinta Energía in Chile and Luz del Sur in Peru. 
As many of you may remember, Sempra initially invested in the companies 12 years ago. And you may recall that we previously talked about having a preference for controlled rather than co-ownership of these companies. Some of the attributes that we like about these investments are their strong operating performance, the sound regulatory environments and the stability and growth of the Chilean improving economies.
With four-year rate case cycles, mechanisms to adjust revenues between rate cases and the past revenue commodity cost to customers, the regulatory construct in the Chile and Peru has many of the same positive attributes as of utility regulation in California. returns on equity in the mid-teens are higher and have grown earnings at a double-digit pace annually. This $875 million acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings per share by $0.15 this year and $0.22 in 2012. Closing of the transactions is expected next quarter and the regulatory approvals and the resolution of certain tax matters. 
Now let's go to the next slide. Let me just summarize where we ended up. I'm very pleased with the results of our core businesses for both the quarter and the year. Excluding Sempra Commodities, earnings per share for the year increased 14% in 2010 to $3.61 per share. We had several key accomplishments, which include the successful exit from RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. The start of construction of the Sunrise Powerlink transmission project is SDG&E. The completion of Sempra Generation's Copper Mountain Solar project, which currently is the largest solar portable plant in service in the U.S. And finally, the announcement of our accretive acquisition of electric utilities in Chile and Peru.
As I've said in my opening remarks, our company has reached an important milestone. We've met all of our key financial strategic objectives, which include one, reducing our risk profile with the exit of Commodities; two, redeploying cash with a higher dividend payout and the buyback of our stock; and third, a greater focus on utility and contracted energy infrastructure investments.
We'll provide an update of our key initiatives in this area and discuss how our strategy alliance with policy and market trends at our upcoming conference in New York on March 23. And as always, we'll provide more detail on our earnings outlook and capital programs at that time. 
But with that, let me stop and open up the call and take any questions that you may have."

But to be honest, I focus less on the actual capital structure that the debt-to-equity ratio than I do the cash flow coverage ratios. And that's really what we manage year more because that's the rating agencies tend to look more for us. And it's probably a better indication of our financial strength. And for the capital structure sort of falls out of that. But I think you're right.

And again, thank you, all, for joining us.  On today's call, I'd like to accomplish several things, first, start with the review of our fourth quarter and year-end financial results, and then talk about our dividend increase and how this aligns with our increasingly predictable earnings. And then finally, I'll give you an operational update on our Utilities and our Infrastructure businesses. 
To the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $280 million or $1.15 per share compared with $288 million or $1.16 per share in the same period last year. If you exclude the results of commodities, who's assets have now been sold, earnings per share for the fourth quarter rose 34% or $1.18 per share from $0.88 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. And for the full year of 2010, we recorded earnings of $739 million or $2.98 per share compared with 2009 earnings of $1.12 billion or $4.52 per share.  When you exclude the results of Sempra Commodities from both years, earnings per share for the full year rose 14% to $3.61 per share in 2010 from $3.16 per share in 2009.  
Our core businesses performed well in 2010, and our earnings from those businesses have exceeded our guidance for the year.  With regard to the dividend, I'd like to mention that Tuesday morning, after our board meeting had approved such, we announced a 23% increase on our quarterly dividend, which brings the annualized dividend to $1.92 per share. 
Exiting the Commodities Trading business marks a new chapter for Sempra. We have narrowed our strategic focus, reducing both our risk profile and earnings volatility, while leveraging our core streams. This has allowed us to significantly increase our dividend, and be able to grow the dividend while still reinvesting capital for future growth.
Now let me hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."
120622,127283290,106337,"Sempra Energy, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Don.

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter were $105 million. That's up from $67 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $16 million higher margin, a $16 million benefit from the partial recovery of increased wildfire insurance premiums and a $9 million from the favorable resolution of prior year's tax matters.  Full year 2010 earnings increased to $369 million from $344 million last year. The increase of $25 million was due primarily to higher margins, partially offset by higher litigation reserves. 
Now moving to Southern California Gas. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings were $74 million compared with $75 million in the fourth quarter of '09. For the full year 2010, earnings for this business were $286 million, up from $273 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to improved operating margins.
Now let's go to Slide 5. Our Generation business recorded earnings of $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $45 million in the same quarter 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 included lower earnings from operations, and a $6 million loss on the sale of our 50% interest in the Elk Hills Power Plant, offset by higher renewable energy tax credits, primarily from the Copper Mountain Solar project.  For the full year 2010, Generation recorded earnings of $103 million compared with earnings of $169 million in 2009. Results for 2010 reflect an $87 million charge related to the settlement of energy crisis litigation, $31 million of lower earnings from operations, primarily due to increased scheduled maintenance in 2010, offset by $48 million higher renewable energy credits, primarily from the Copper Mountain Solar project. 
Now let's move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $37 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $6 million of higher earnings from operations, offset by a $5 million write-down of our investment in Argentina, which was net of related tax benefits.  For the full year 2010, Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $159 million compared with earnings of $101 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to a $64 million write-off of our Liberty Gas Storage assets in 2009 and a $13 million favorable resolution of prior year tax matters, also in 2009.
Now please turn to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. That compares with earnings of $35 million in the prior year's period. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were higher due to payments from customers for contracted cargoes that were not delivered.  For the full year of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $68 million. That's up from earnings of $16 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to a full year of operation in 2010. You will recall that our Cameron LNG facility became operational, and our supply contract with the 10 new partners for the Energía Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009. 
Now let's move to the next slide. As Don stated, our board authorized a 23% increase in the dividend. This takes the dividend to $1.92 per share on an annualized basis, up from our current annualized dividend of $1.56 per share.  Going forward, we plan to target a 45% to 50% payout ratio. 
Now for an update on our share repurchases. The $500 million accelerated share repurchase program that began in 2010 will conclude by the end of this quarter. You will recall that at our analyst conference last year, we assumed $750 million of share repurchases, and we still may do that if it looks prudent to do so.  However, given the South American acquisition and other opportunities, it will likely be later this year before we make a decision on future buybacks.  And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with Slide 9."
120622,127283290,106337,"Sempra Energy, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on some key activities with our businesses, and I'll start with our California utilities.  In December, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Company filed their General Rate Case applications. Like our l",921,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on some key activities with our businesses, and I'll start with our California utilities.  In December, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Company filed their General Rate Case applications. Like our last rate case, we are seeking to set rates for a four-year cycle. The general rate cases will establish the revenue requirements for 2012, and we've requested attrition mechanisms to adjust the margins for the years 2013 through 2015.  The requested increase for 2012 of each utility is approximately 6% over present rates, and the attrition mechanisms would result in expected annual increases of 3% per year for the following three years. And also, the rate case plans call for new rates to be effective January 1, 2012. 
To update you on some of the major utility capital projects at San Diego Gas & Electric, construction is progressing as planned on the Sunrise Powerlink projects, and we remain on track to complete this project in the second half of next year. 
Turning to our Smart Meter programs. At SDG&E, we have now installed approximately two million meters, and we're on schedule to complete all installations by the end of this year.  And at Southern California Gas company, installations of meters are scheduled to begin late next year.
Let's go to the next slide. At Sempra Generation, the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain Solar project in Nevada was completed in December, and the power generated by the plant is sold under a 20-year contract to Pacific Gas & Electric.  The next solar project that we plan to start building is Mesquite Solar. This project was located near our Mesquite natural gas-fired plant outside of Phoenix, but we have enough plant to ultimately develop up to 700 megawatts of solar capacity. We have an agreement to sell the power produced by the first 150-megawatt phase of the project to PG&E under a 20-year contract, and that contract is now pending approval from the CPUC.
As you may have seen, we have now selected a technology supplier and the EPC contractor for the project, and expect to start construction later this year. Completion of all 150 megawatts is anticipated to be done in 2013.  Construction continues on the Cedar Creek II Wind project, which is a 50-50 partnership with BP Wind Energy. This 250-megawatt project located in Northern Colorado remains on schedule for completion mid this year. The power produced by the facility will be sold under a 25-year power-purchase Agreement with a public service company in Colorado.  And finally, at the end of last year, we sold our 50% interest in the 550-megawatt Elk Hills combined cycle plant to our former partner. We received proceeds of $175 million or $636 per kilowatt, which was a good price for a merchant asset. 
Let's now go to the next slide. Last month, we announced the acquisition stakes in two electric distribution companies in South America, which we co-own with AEI. These were in Chilquinta Energía in Chile and Luz del Sur in Peru.  As many of you may remember, Sempra initially invested in the companies 12 years ago. And you may recall that we previously talked about having a preference for controlled rather than co-ownership of these companies. Some of the attributes that we like about these investments are their strong operating performance, the sound regulatory environments and the stability and growth of the Chilean improving economies.  The four-year rate case cycles, mechanisms to adjust revenues between rate cases and the pass-through of commodity cost to customers, the regulatory construct in both Chile and Peru has many of the same positive attributes as the utility regulation in California. 
Chilquinta and Luz del Sur have achieved returns on equity in the mid-teens or higher, and have grown earnings at a double-digit pace annually. This $875 million acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings per share by $0.15 this year and $0.22 in 2012. Closing of the transactions is expected next quarter, and the regulatory approvals and the resolution of certain tax matters. 
Now let's go to the next slide. Let me just summarize where we ended up. I'm very pleased with the results of our core businesses for both the quarter and the year. Excluding Sempra Commodities, earnings per share for the year increased 14% in 2010 to $3.61 per share. We had several key accomplishments, which include the successful exit from RBS-Sempra Commodities joint venture: the start of construction on the Sunrise Powerlink Transmission Project at SDG&E, the completion of Sempra Generation's Copper Mountain Solar project, which currently is the largest solar portable safe plant in service in the U.S. And finally, the announcement of our accretive acquisition of electric utilities in Chile and Peru.
As I've said in my opening remarks, our company has reached an important milestone. We've met all of our key financial and strategic objectives, which include: one, reducing our risk profile with the exit of Commodities; two, redeploying cash with a higher dividend payout and the buyback of our stock; and third, a greater focus on utility and contracted energy infrastructure investments.  We'll provide an update of our key initiatives in this area and discuss how our strategy alliance with policy and market trends at our upcoming conference in New York on March 23. And as always, we'll provide more detail on our earnings outlook and capital programs at that time. 
But with that, let me stop, and open up the call and take any questions that you may have."

And again, thank you, all, for joining us.  On today's call, I'd like to accomplish several things. First, start with the review of our fourth quarter and year-end financial results, and then talk about our dividend increase and how this aligns with our increasingly predictable earnings. And then finally, I'll give you an operational update on our Utilities and our Infrastructure businesses. 
To the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $280 million or $1.15 per share compared with $288 million or $1.16 per share in the same period last year. If you exclude the results of commodities, who's assets have now been sold, earnings per share for the fourth quarter rose 34% or $1.18 per share from $0.88 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. And for the full year of 2010, we recorded earnings of $739 million or $2.98 per share compared with 2009 earnings of $1.12 billion or $4.52 per share.  When you exclude the results of Sempra Commodities from both years, earnings per share for the full year rose 14% to $3.61 per share in 2010 from $3.16 per share in 2009.  
Our core businesses performed well in 2010, and our earnings from those businesses exceeded our guidance for the year.  With regard to the dividend, I'd like to mention that Tuesday morning, after our board meeting had approved such, we announced a 23% increase on our quarterly dividend, which brings the annualized dividend to $1.92 per share. 
Exiting the Commodities Trading business marks a new chapter for Sempra. We have narrowed our strategic focus, reducing both our risk profile and earnings volatility, while leveraging our core streams. This has allowed us to significantly increase our dividend, and be able to grow the dividend while still reinvesting capital for future growth.
Now let me hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."
120622,127283290,106358,"Sempra Energy, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2011",2011-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Don. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter were $105 million. That's up from $67 million in the year-ago quarter.

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter were $105 million. That's up from $67 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $16 million higher margin, a $16 million benefit from the partial recovery of increased wildfire insurance premiums and a $9 million from the favorable resolution of prior year's tax matters.  Full year 2010 earnings increased to $369 million from $344 million last year. The increase of $25 million was due primarily to higher margins, partially offset by higher litigation reserves. 
Now moving to Southern California Gas. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings were $74 million compared to $75 million in the fourth quarter of '09. For the full year 2010, earnings for this business were $286 million, up from $273 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to improved operating margins.
Now let's go to Slide 5. Our Generation business recorded earnings of $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $45 million in the same quarter 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 included lower earnings from operations, and a $6 million loss on the sale of our 50% interest in the Elk Hills Power Plant, offset by higher renewable energy tax credits, primarily from the Copper Mountain Solar project. For the full year 2010, Generation recorded earnings of $103 million compared with earnings of $169 million in 2009. Results for 2010 reflect an $87 million charge related to the settlement of energy crisis litigations, $31 million of lower earnings from operations, primarily due to increased scheduled maintenance in 2010, offset by $48 million higher renewable energy credits, primarily from the Copper Mountain Solar project. 
Now let's move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $37 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $6 million of higher earnings from operations, offset by a $5 million write-down of our investment in Argentina, which was net of related tax benefits. For the full year 2010, Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $159 million compared with earnings of $101 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to a $64 million write-off of our Liberty Gas Storage assets in 2009 and a $13 million favorable resolution of prior year tax matters, also in 2009.
Now please turn to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. That compares with earnings of $35 million in the prior year's period. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were higher due to payments from customers for contracted cargoes that were not delivered.  For the full year of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $68 million. That's up from earnings of $16 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to a full year of operation in 2010. You will recall that our Cameron LNG facility became operational, and our supply contract with the 10 new [ph] partners for the Energía Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009. 
Now let's move to the next slide. As Don stated, our board authorized a 23% increase in the dividend. This takes the dividend to $1.92 per share on an annualized basis, up from our current annualized dividend of $1.56 per share.  Going forward, we plan to target a 45% to 50% payout ratio. 
Now for an update on our share repurchases. The $500 million accelerated share repurchase program that began in 2010 will conclude by the end of this quarter. You will recall that at our analyst conference last year, we assumed $750 million of share repurchases, and we still may do that if it looks prudent to do so.  However, given the South American acquisition and other opportunities, it will likely be later this year before we make a decision on future buybacks.  And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with Slide 9."

Now let me update you on some key activities with our businesses, and I'll start with our California utilities.

Now let me update you on some key activities with our businesses, and I'll start with our California utilities. In December, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Company filed their General Rate Case applications. Like our last rate case, we are seeking to set rates for a four-year cycle. The general rate cases will establish the revenue requirements for 2012, and we've requested attrition mechanisms to adjust the margins for the years 2013 through 2015. The requested increase for 2012 of each utility is approximately 6% over present rates, and the attrition mechanisms would result in expected annual increases of 3% per year for the following three years. And also, the rate case plans call for new rates to be effective January 1, 2012. 
To update you on some of the major utility capital projects at San Diego Gas & Electric, our construction is progressing as planned on the Sunrise Powerlink projects, and we remain on track to complete this project in the second half of next year. 
Turning to our Smart Meter programs. At SDG&E, we have now installed approximately two million meters, and we're on schedule to complete all installations by the end of this year. And at Southern California Gas company, installations of meters are scheduled to begin late next year.
Let's go to the next slide. At Sempra Generation, the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain Solar project in Nevada was completed in December, and the power generated by the plant is sold under a 20-year contract to Pacific Gas & Electric. The next solar project that we plan to start building is Mesquite Solar. This project is located near our Mesquite natural gas-fired plant outside of Phoenix, but we have enough plant to ultimately develop up to 700 megawatts of solar capacity. We have an agreement to sell the power produced by the first 150-megawatt phase of the project to PG&E under a 20-year contract, and that contract is now pending approval from the CPUC.
As you may have seen, we have now selected a technology supplier and the EPC contractor for the project, and expect to start construction later this year. Completion of all 150 megawatts is anticipated to be done in 2013.  Construction continues on the Cedar Creek II Wind project, which is a 50-50 partnership with BP Wind Energy. This 250-megawatt project located in Northern Colorado remains on schedule for completion mid this year. The power produced by the facility will be sold under a 25-year power-purchase Agreement with a public service company in Colorado. And finally, at the end of last year, we sold our 50% interest in the 550-megawatt Elk Hills combined cycle plant to our former partner. We received proceeds of $175 million or $636 per kilowatt, which was a good price for a merchant asset. 
Let's now go to the next slide. Last month, we announced the acquisition stakes in two electric distribution companies in South America, which we co-own with AEI. These were in Chilquinta Energía in Chile and Luz del Sur in Peru.  As many of you may remember, Sempra initially invested in the companies 12 years ago. And you may recall that we previously talked about having a preference for control rather than co-ownership of these companies. Some of the attributes that we like about these investments are their strong operating performance, the sound regulatory environments and the stability and growth of the Chilean improving economies. The four-year rate case cycles, mechanisms to adjust revenues between rate cases and the pass-through of commodity cost to customers, the regulatory construct in both Chile and Peru has many of the same positive attributes as the utility regulation in California. 
Chilquinta and Luz del Sur have achieved returns on equity in the mid-teens or higher, and have grown earnings at a double-digit pace annually. This $875 million acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings per share by $0.15 this year and $0.22 in 2012. Closing of the transactions is expected next quarter, and the regulatory approvals and the resolution of certain tax matters. 
Now let's go to the next slide. Let me just summarize where we ended up. I'm very pleased with the results of our core businesses for both the quarter and the year. Excluding Sempra Commodities, earnings per share for the year increased 14% in 2010 to $3.61 per share. We had several key accomplishments, which include the successful exit from RBS-Sempra Commodities joint venture; the start of construction on the Sunrise Powerlink Transmission Project at SDG&E; the completion of Sempra Generation's Copper Mountain Solar project, which currently is the largest solar portable safe plant in service in the U.S.; and finally, the announcement of our accretive acquisition of electric utilities in Chile and Peru.
As I've said in my opening remarks, our company has reached an important milestone. We've met all of our key financial and strategic objectives, which include: one, reducing our risk profile with the exit of Commodities; two, redeploying cash with a higher dividend payout and the buyback of our stock; and third, a greater focus on utility and contracted energy infrastructure investments.  We'll provide an update of our key initiatives in this area and discuss how our strategy aligns with policy and market trends at our upcoming conference in New York on March 23. And as always, we'll provide more detail on our earnings outlook and capital programs at that time. 
But with that, let me stop, and open up the call and take any questions that you may have."

On today's call, we'll start by reviewing our first quarter financial results, and I'll then give you an operational update on our businesses. Early this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $258 million or $1.07 per share compared with $106 million or $0.42 per share in the same period last year. 
The first quarter of last year included a $96 million or $0.48 per share charge related to the settlement of energy crisis litigation. Excluding the impact of this charge in last year's first quarter, our quarterly earnings per share increased by 34%. All of our businesses are performing well, and each of our business units reported an increase in earnings in the first quarter over the year-ago period. 
There are two things I'd like to highlight before Mark goes into the details of the financial results. As we discussed at the March analysts conference, we exit from the Commodities Trading business, we have refocused our strategy on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. This quarter's strong results across all of our business segments demonstrates our execution on that strategy going forward.
And second, a key element of our renewable business strategy is the contracting of our portfolio of projects at Sempra Generation. We recently received regulatory approval for the first 150 megawatts phase of the 700 megawatt Mesquite Solar project and signed contracts for two wind projects totaling about 175 megawatts. Now I'd like to hand it over to Mark so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the first quarter of 2011 were $89 million compared with earnings of $83 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $7 million of higher authorized margins, offset by $5 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums this year. 
And in last year's first quarter, we had a $3 million charge related to the passage of the healthcare bill. At Southern California Gas, first quarter 2011 earnings was $68 million, that's up from $65 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Last year's results included a $7 million regulatory award and a $13 million tax charge related to passage of the healthcare bill. Now let's go to Slide 5. Our Generation business recorded earnings of $44 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $51 million in the same quarter in 2010. The increase for the quarter is due to lower operating and maintenance costs, less scheduled plant maintenance and an $84 million charge related to a litigation settlement last year. 
Now please move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $54 million in the first quarter of 2011, up from earnings of $38 million in the same quarter of 2010. The quarter benefited from $8 million of higher earnings from pipeline assets in Mexico, which were acquired in the second quarter of 2010. And from $6 million of higher operating results from Chile and Peru. I'd also like to mention that in the next quarter, we expect to report a one-time gain related to our increased ownership stake in Chile and Peru due to a step up of our prior investment to fair value. The size of the gain is not yet been determined and it was not included in our earnings guidance that we previously provided for this year.
So now please go to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $33 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $32 million in the prior year's period. Both quarters included $11 million of earnings from customer payments related to contracted cargoes that were not delivered. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don who'll begin with Slide 8."
120622,131288521,124682,"Sempra Energy, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 09, 2011",2011-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, Governor Brown signed into law California's Renewable Portfolio Standard legislation, which calls for a 33% renewables mix by 2020 for all retail providers of elect",1154,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, Governor Brown signed into law California's Renewable Portfolio Standard legislation, which calls for a 33% renewables mix by 2020 for all retail providers of electricity in the state. 
You may recall that SDG&E had previously made a voluntary commitment to reach 33% renewable. Since the beginning of this year, SDG&E has signed contracts for about 700 megawatts of renewable energy and it's well on its way to reaching a 33% threshold. 
Now moving to Sunrise Powerlink. Construction on the project is well underway, we're now installing powers and have more than 100 towers in various stages of construction. The project is proceeding according to plan, and we expect to complete this line in the second half of next year. 
And finally, at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we filed our applications for both utilities 2012 general rate cases last December. The CPUC rate case plan calls for a decision and approximately March of next year with rates retroactive for January 1 of next year. 
Now let's go to Slide 9. Earlier this year, the CPUC opened a proceedings to assess new safety and reliability regulations for natural gas pipelines following the tragedy in San Bruno. We fully support the commission's efforts and are actively participating in this process. 
Last month, SoCalGas and SDG&E responded to the commission's request for records supporting the maximum alloweable operating pressures of their pipelines. This extensive review renewed our confidence that the maximum pressures on our systems have been appropriately set and that we operate our system safely. 
Our utilities operate about 4,000 miles of transmission pipelines and the records review covered about 1600 miles of those pipelines in populated areas. Federal regulation issued in 1970 require specific documentation of pressure testing for transmission pipelines built after the regulation went into place. 
Approximately 500 miles of the pipelines were installed after 1970 and our records and operating procedures give us a very high degree of confidence that all of these pipeline have been pressure tested and is operating safely.
Of the remaining 1,100 miles installed before 1970, we have records indicating that nearly 700 miles of this pipeline was pressure tested. The remaining 400 miles of pipeline had operating pressures determined by using alternate procedures under state and federal regulations. Of these, 170 miles have been smart -- meaning sophisticated devices were inserted into the pipeline and inspected to make sure they are safe. 
We also have extensive construction and operating records that support the maximum operating pressure on all of these pipeline. We have also voluntarily taken a number of precautions to provide an added margin of safety, including further reducing operating pressures in certain pipeline segments, conducting tests to validate pipeline strength, assessing possible replacement of certain segments, and conducting bimonthly patrols and surveys.
I want to stress that safety is our top priority. We have a strong pipeline integrity program in place and our financial plan includes a significant amount of spending and investment in this area. The cost we have incurred this year, to gather records has been less than $2 million and we don't expect our utility earnings plans to be impacted by these efforts.
We don't know what the commission will ultimately decide regarding new pipeline regulations but should new requirements result in incremental cost, we would expect to recover those costs. Now let's move to the next slide.
At our analyst conference in March, we discussed plans to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity at Sempra Generation over the next five years. Just in the first four months of this year alone, we've made significant progress towards that goal. Last month, we received CPUC approval for a 20 year contract to sell PG&E the output of the first 150-megawatt phase of our Mesquite Solar project. Construction will be begin next month and we expect to complete the first phase of the project in early 2013. When fully developed, the Mesquite Solar complex has the potential to generate up to 700 megawatts of solar energy.
Sempra Generation wind development projects also reached important milestones with the signing of long-term power sales contracts. Energía Sierra Juárez is a wind project located about 70 miles east of San Diego and just south of the US-Mexico border. 
The first phase to be developed is a 156-megawatt project given our land position and the wind resource there, we have the opportunity to develop as much as 1,200 megawatts over time. 
For the first 156-megawatt phase, SDG&E has signed a 20 year contract for the output from the facility. The contract is subject to approval by the CPUC and the FERC. Pending the receipt of these approvals, we expect to begin construction next year and to complete this phase of the project in 2013. 
We've also reached a preliminary agreement with BP Wind Energy to bring them into the project as a partner. Sempra Generation also signed a 20-year power sales contract with Maui electric for the 2100 megawatt Auwahi Wind project on the island of Maui in Hawaii. The contract is subject to the approval of the Hawaiian Public Utilities Commission and we expect the project will be operational late next year. 
And finally, I'd like to mention that construction is almost complete at the 250 megawatt Cedar Creek 2 wind project in Colorado and operations are expected to begin this quarter. This project is a 50-50 joint venture with BP wind consistent with our long-term contract and strategy there's a 35 year agreement in place for the sale of the project's power. 
Now let's move to the next slide. Last month, Sempra pipelines and storage increased its ownership stake in two South America electric utilities. We now own 100% of Chilquinta Energía in Chile and 76% of Luz del Sur in Peru. Luz del Sur is a publicly traded company in Peru and the remaining 24% of shares on Luz del Sur are held by institutional investors and the general public. 
Last week, the groundbreaking of Luz del Sur's 98 megawatts hydroelectric project was held in Peru. This $150 million run of the river project marks Luz del Sur's entrance into generation and is expected to be complete in 2014. We're excited about the opportunities to grow the business in both Chile and Peru. 
Now please go to the last slide. Let me conclude by saying that I'm very pleased with our strong financial results for the quarter. We are focusing our strategy on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure drove our strong results across all of business segments. These results have us on track and meet our earnings guidance for the year. 
I'm also proud of our recent accomplishments, which include contracting and development of renewable energy and resources and closing the accretive South American acquisition. With that, let me stop and we'll take any questions that any of you may have."

On today's call, we'll start by reviewing our first quarter financial results, and I'll then give you an operational update on our businesses. Early this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $258 million or $1.07 per share, compared with $106 million or $0.42 per share in the same period last year. 
The first quarter of last year included a $96 million or $0.38 per share charge related to the settlement of energy crisis litigation. Excluding the impact of this charge in last year's first quarter, our quarterly earnings per share increased by 34%. All of our businesses are performing well, and each of our business units reported an increase in earnings in the first quarter over the year-ago period. 
There are two things I'd like to highlight before Mark goes into the details of the financial results. As we discussed at the March Analyst Conference, we have already exit from the Commodities Trading business, we have refocused our strategy on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. This quarter's strong results across all of our business segments demonstrates our execution on that strategy going forward.
And second, a key element of our renewable business strategy is the contracting of our portfolio of projects at Sempra Generation. We recently received regulatory approval for the first 150 megawatts phase of the 700 megawatt Mesquite Solar project and signed contracts for 2 wind projects, totaling about 175 megawatts. Now I'd like to hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At the San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the first quarter of 2011 were $89 million compared with earnings of $83 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $7 million of higher authorized margins, offset by $5 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums this year. And in last year's first quarter, we had a $3 million charge related to the passage of the healthcare bill. At Southern California Gas, first quarter 2011 earnings was $68 million, that's up from $65 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Last year's results included a $7 million regulatory award and a $13 million tax charge related to passage of the healthcare bill. 
Now let's go to Slide 5. Our Generation business recorded earnings of $44 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $51 million in the same quarter in 2010. The increase for the quarter is due to lower operating and maintenance costs, less scheduled plant maintenance and an $84 million charge related to a litigation settlement last year. 
Now please move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $54 million in the first quarter of 2011, up from earnings of $38 million in the same quarter of 2010. The quarter benefited from $8 million of higher earnings from pipeline assets in Mexico, which were acquired in the second quarter of 2010, and from $6 million of higher operating results from Chile and Peru. I'd also like to mention that in the next quarter, we expect to report a onetime gain related to our increased ownership stake in Chile and Peru, do a step up of our prior investment to fair value. The size of the gain has not yet been determined, and it was not included in our earnings guidance that we previously provided for this year.
So now please go to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $33 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $32 million in the prior year's period. Both quarters included $11 million of earnings from customer payments related to contracted cargoes that were not delivered. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don who'll begin with Slide 8."
120622,131288521,124812,"Sempra Energy, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 09, 2011",2011-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, Governor Brown signed in the law of California's Renewable Portfolio standard legislation, which calls for a 33% renewables mix by 2020 for all retail providers of",1153,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, Governor Brown signed in the law of California's Renewable Portfolio standard legislation, which calls for a 33% renewables mix by 2020 for all retail providers of electricity in the state. 
You may recall that SDG&E had previously made a voluntary commitment to reach 33% renewable. Since the beginning of this year, SDG&E has signed contracts for about 700 megawatts of renewable energy and is well on its way to reaching a 33% threshold. 
Now moving to Sunrise Powerlink. Construction on the project is well underway. We're now installing towers and have more than 100 towers in various stages of construction. The project is proceeding according to plan, and we expect to complete this line in the second half of next year. 
And finally, at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we filed our applications for both utilities 2012 general rate cases last December. The CPUC rate case plan calls for a decision in approximately March of next year with rates retroactive to January 1 of next year. 
Now let's go to Slide 9. Earlier this year, the CPUC opened up proceedings to assess new safety and reliability regulations for natural gas pipelines following the tragedy in San Bruno. We fully support the commission's efforts and are actively participating in this process. 
Last month, SoCalGas and SDG&E responded to the commission's request for records supporting the maximum allowable operating pressures of their pipelines. This extensive review renewed our confidence that the maximum pressures on our systems have been appropriately set and that we operate our system safely. 
Our utilities operate about 4,000 miles of transmission pipelines, and the records reviewed covered about 1,600 miles of those pipelines in populated areas. Federal regulation issued in 1970 requires specific documentation of pressure testing for transmission pipeline built after the regulation went into place. 
Approximately 500 miles of the pipelines were installed after 1970, and our records and operating procedures give us a very high degree of confidence that all of these pipeline has been pressure tested and is operating safely.
Of the remaining 1,100 miles installed before 1970, we have records indicating that nearly 700 miles of this pipeline was pressure tested. The remaining 400 miles of pipeline had operating pressures determined by using alternate procedures under state and federal regulations. Of these, 170 miles have been smart-pigged, meaning sophisticated devices were inserted into the pipeline and inspected to make sure they are safe. 
We also have extensive construction and/or operating records that support the maximum operating pressure on all of these pipelines. We have also voluntarily taken a number of precautions to provide an added margin of safety, including further reducing operating pressures in certain pipeline segments, conducting tests to validate pipeline strength, assessing possible replacement of certain segments and conducting bimonthly petrols and liquid surveys.
I want to stress that safety is our top priority. We have a strong pipeline integrity program in place, and our financial plan includes a significant amount of spending and investment in this area. The cost we've incurred this year to gather records has been less than $2 million, and we don't expect our utility earnings plans to be impacted by these efforts.
We don't know what the commission will ultimately decide regarding new pipeline regulations but should new requirements result in incremental cost, we would expect to recover those costs. Now let's move to the next slide.
At our analyst conference in March, we discussed plans to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity at Sempra Generation over the next 5 years. Just in the first 4 months of this year alone, we've made significant progress toward that goal. Last month, we received CPUC approval for a 20-year contract to sell PG&E, the output of the first 150-megawatt phase of our Mesquite Solar project. Construction will be begin next month, and we expect to complete this first phase of the project in early 2013. When fully developed, the Mesquite Solar complex has the potential to generate up to 700 megawatts of solar energy.
Two of Sempra Generation's wind development projects also reached important milestones with the signing of long-term power sales contracts. Energía Sierra Juárez is a wind project located about 70 miles east of San Diego and just south of the U.S.-Mexico border. The first phase to be developed is a 156-megawatt project. Given our land position and the wind resource there, we have the opportunity to develop as much as 1,200 megawatts over time. 
For the first 156-megawatt phase, SDG&E has signed a 20-year contract for the output from the facility. The contract is subject to approval by the CPUC and the FERC. Pending of receipt of these approvals, we expect to begin construction next year and to complete this phase of the project in 2013. 
We've also reached a preliminary agreement with BP Wind Energy to bring them into the project as a need for partner. Sempra Generation also signed a 20-year power sales contract with Maui Electric for the 2,100-megawatt Auwahi Wind project on the island of Maui in Hawaii. The contract is subject to the approval of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission, and we expect the project will be operational late next year. 
And finally, I'd like to mention that construction is almost complete at the 250-megawatt Cedar Creek II wind project in Colorado, and operations are expected to begin this quarter. This project is a 50/50 joint venture with BP Wind, consistent with our long-term contract and strategy, there's a 25-year agreement in place for the sale of the project's power. 
Now move to the next slide. Last month, Sempra Pipelines & Storage increased its ownership stake in 2 South American electric utilities. We now own 100% of Chilquinta Energía in Chile and 76% of Luz del Sur in Peru. Luz del Sur is a publicly traded company in Peru, and the remaining 24% of shares on Luz del Sur are held by institutional investors and the general public. 
Last week, the groundbreaking of Luz del Sur's 98-megawatt Santa Teresa hydroelectric project was held in Peru. This $150 million run of the river project marks Luz del Sur's entrance into generation and is expected to be complete in 2014. We're excited about the opportunities to grow the business in both Chile and Peru. 
Now please go to the last slide. Let me conclude by saying that I'm very pleased with our strong financial results for the quarter, where refocusing of our strategy on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure drove our strong results across all of business segments. These results have us on track and meet our earnings guidance for the year. 
I'm also proud of our recent accomplishments, which include contracting and development of renewable energy resources and closing the accretive South American acquisition. With that, let me stop, and we'll take any questions that any of you may have."

On today's call, we'll start by reviewing our first quarter financial results, and I'll then give you an operational update on our businesses. Early this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $258 million or $1.07 per share, compared with $106 million or $0.42 per share in the same period last year. 
The first quarter of last year included a $96 million or $0.38 per share charge related to the settlement of energy crisis litigation. Excluding the impact of this charge in last year's first quarter, our quarterly earnings per share increased by 34%. All of our businesses are performing well, and each of our business units reported an increase in earnings in the first quarter over the year-ago period. 
There are 2 things I'd like to highlight before Mark goes into the details of the financial results. As we discussed at the March analyst conference, with our exit from the commodities trading business, we have refocused our strategy on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. This quarter's strong results across all of our business segments demonstrates our execution on that strategy going forward.
And second, a key element of our renewable business strategy is in the contracting of our portfolio of projects at Sempra Generation. We recently received regulatory approval for the first 150-megawatt phase of the 700-megawatt Mesquite Solar project and signed contracts for 2 wind projects totaling about 175 megawatts.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the first quarter of 2011 were $89 million compared with earnings of $83 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $7 million of higher authorized margins, offset by $5 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums this year. And in last year's first quarter, we had a $3 million charge related to the passage of the healthcare bill.
At Southern California Gas, first quarter 2011 earnings were $68 million. That's up from $65 million in the first quarter of 2010. Last year's results included a $7 million regulatory award and a $13 million tax charge related to passage of the healthcare bill. 
Now let's go to Slide 5. Our generation business [Sempra Generation] recorded earnings of $44 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $51 million in the same quarter in 2010. The increase for the quarter is due to lower operating and maintenance costs, less scheduled plant maintenance and an $84 million charge related to a litigation settlement last year. 
Now please move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $54 million in the first quarter of 2011, up from earnings of $38 million in the same quarter of 2010. The quarter benefited from $8 million of higher earnings from pipeline assets in Mexico, which were acquired in the second quarter of 2010, and from $6 million of higher operating results in Chile and Peru. I'd also like to mention that in the next quarter, we expect to report a onetime gain related to our increased ownership stake in Chile and Peru, due to a step-up of our prior investment to fair value. The size of the gain has not yet been determined, and it was not included in our earnings guidance that we previously provided for this year.
So now let's please go to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $33 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $32 million in the prior year's period. Both quarters included $11 million of earnings from customer payments related to contracted cargoes that were not delivered. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don who'll begin with Slide 8."
120622,131288521,124986,"Sempra Energy, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 09, 2011",2011-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, Governor Brown signed into law California's Renewables Portfolio Standard legislation, which calls for a 33% renewables mix by 2020 for all retail providers of elec",1147,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, Governor Brown signed into law California's Renewables Portfolio Standard legislation, which calls for a 33% renewables mix by 2020 for all retail providers of electricity in the state. You may recall that SDG&E had previously made a voluntary commitment to reach 33% renewable. Since the beginning of this year, SDG&E has signed contracts for about 700 megawatts of renewable energy and is well on its way to reaching a 33% threshold. 
Now moving to Sunrise Powerlink. Construction on the project is well underway. We're now installing towers and have more than 100 towers in various stages of construction. The project is proceeding according to plan, and we expect to complete this line in the second half of next year. 
And finally, at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we filed our applications for both utilities' 2012 general rate cases last December. The CPUC rate case plan calls for a decision in approximately March of next year with rates retroactive to January 1 of next year. 
Now let's go to Slide 9. Earlier this year, the CPUC opened up proceedings to assess new safety and reliability regulations for natural gas pipelines following the tragedy in San Bruno. We fully support the commission's efforts and are actively participating in this process. Last month, SoCalGas and SDG&E responded to the commission's request for records supporting the maximum allowable operating pressures of their pipelines. This extensive review renewed our confidence that the maximum pressures on our systems have been appropriately set and that we operate our system safely. 
Our utilities operate about 4,000 miles of transmission pipelines, and the records reviewed covered about 1,600 miles of those pipelines in populated areas. Federal regulation issued in 1970 requires specific documentation of pressure testing for transmission pipelines built after the regulation went into place. Approximately 500 miles of the pipelines were installed after 1970, and our records and operating procedures give us a very high degree of confidence that all of this pipeline has been pressure tested and is operating safely.
Of the remaining 1,100 miles installed before 1970, we have records indicating that nearly 700 miles of this pipeline was pressure tested. The remaining 400 miles of pipeline had operating pressures determined by using alternate procedures under state and federal regulations. Of these, 170 miles have been smart-pigged, meaning sophisticated devices were inserted into the pipeline and inspected to make sure they are safe. 
We also have extensive construction and/or operating records that support the maximum operating pressure on all of those pipelines. We have also voluntarily taken a number of precautions to provide an added margin of safety, including further reducing operating pressures in certain pipeline segments, conducting tests to validate pipeline strength, assessing possible replacement of certain segments and conducting bimonthly patrols and weekly surveys.
I want to stress that safety is our top priority. We have a strong pipeline-integrity program in place, and our financial plan includes a significant amount of spending and investment in this area. The costs we've incurred this year to gather records has been less than $2 million, and we don't expect our utility earnings plans to be impacted by these efforts. We don't know what the commission will ultimately decide regarding new pipeline regulations but should new requirements result in incremental costs, we would expect to recover those costs.
Now let's move to the next slide. At our analyst conference in March, we discussed plans to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity at Sempra Generation over the next 5 years. Just in the first 4 months of this year alone, we've made significant progress toward that goal. Last month, we received CPUC approval for a 20-year contract to sell PG&E the output of the first 150-megawatt phase of our Mesquite Solar project. Construction will begin next month, and we expect to complete this first phase of the project in early 2013. When fully developed, the Mesquite Solar complex has the potential to generate up to 700 megawatts of solar energy.
Two of Sempra Generation's wind development projects also reached important milestones with the signing of long-term power sales contracts. Energía Sierra Juárez is a wind project located about 70 miles east of San Diego and just south of the U.S.-Mexico border. The first phase to be developed is a 156-megawatt project. Given our land position and the wind resource there, we have the opportunity to develop as much as 1,200 megawatts over time. 
For the first 156-megawatt phase, SDG&E has signed a 20-year contract for the output from the facility. The contract is subject to approval by the CPUC and the FERC. Pending the receipt of these approvals, we expect to begin construction next year and to complete this phase of the project in 2013. 
We've also reached a preliminary agreement with BP Wind Energy to bring them into the project as an equal partner. Sempra Generation also signed a 20-year power sales contract with Maui Electric for the 2,100-megawatt Auwahi Wind project on the island of Maui in Hawaii. The contract is subject to the approval of the Hawaiian Public Utilities Commission, and we expect the project will be operational late next year. 
And finally, I'd like to mention that construction is almost complete at the 250-megawatt Cedar Creek II wind project in Colorado, and operations are expected to begin this quarter. This project is a 50/50 joint venture with BP Wind. Consistent with our long-term contracting strategy, there's a 25-year agreement in place for the sale of the project's power. 
Now move to the next slide, if you would. Last month, Sempra Pipelines & Storage increased its ownership stake in 2 South American electric utilities. We now own 100% of Chilquinta Energía in Chile and 76% of Luz del Sur in Peru. Luz del Sur is a publicly traded company in Peru, and the remaining 24% of shares on Luz del Sur are held by institutional investors and the general public. 
Last week, the groundbreaking of Luz del Sur's 98-megawatt Santa Teresa hydroelectric project was held in Peru. This $150 million run-of-the-river project marks Luz del Sur's entrance into generation and is expected to be complete in 2014. We're excited about the opportunities to grow the business in both Chile and Peru. 
Now please go to the last slide. Let me conclude by saying that I'm very pleased with our strong financial results for the quarter, where refocusing of our strategy on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure drove our strong results across all the business segments. These results have us on track and meet our earnings guidance for the year.
I'm also proud of our recent accomplishments, which include contracting and development of renewable energy resources and closing the accretive South American acquisition. With that, let me stop, and we'll take any questions that any of you may have."

We'll then review our second quarter financial results and then provide an operational update on our businesses. In light Neal Schmale's retirement later this year and my retirement next year, our board engaged in a thoughtful year-long process to ensure a smooth leadership succession. 
That process culminated in the election of Debbie Reed as CEO and as a Sempra board member. As many of you know, Debbie has a broad understanding of the energy industry and has excelled in her 30 year career with the Sempra companies.
She has demonstrated outstanding leadership at every level of responsibility. She is also well-respected by key stakeholders that we interface with, including customers, regulators, elected officials community leaders and our employees. Given this, we decided that she was the right person to lead the company going forward.
Once a decision was reached that Debbie would succeed me as CEO, we decided to make that transition effective immediately. This timing provides Debbie with the opportunity to focus on Sempra's annual strategic review of our business. Additionally, this timing allows and Neal and me to provide support and guidance to Debbie and the rest of the organization during this transition until our retirements. 
We have an excellent management team in place to take the company forward. The board and I are confident that Debbie, Mark, the business unit presidents and the rest of the management team will continue our excellent track record of creating shareholder value and delivering great service to our customers.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Debbie."

Before I review our second quarter results with you, I would like to address a question some of you have asked concerning my strategic vision for Sempra. 
I want to me start by reiterating that our strategy has been and will continue to be focused on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. It is a space within our sector where we have demonstrated success and one in which we have deep competency. 
As Don mentioned, we have just begun our annual strategic review at Sempra in which we update our 5-year business plan. This year, I have 3 objectives that we will complete as part of this process.
First, we will conduct a thorough market assessment of the short- and long-term business environment in which we operate. We will be analyzing market trends to identify opportunities and risks. As an example, environmental regulations are prompting retirements of coal plant. At the same time that nuclear plant development has been substantially slow. This trend is likely to great opportunities for natural gas-fired generation and the development of new gas infrastructure, including storage. 
Secondly, we will be reviewing the current and expected performance of our asset portfolio considering market cycles. And focusing on getting the greatest value from these assets. We will develop specific strategies for assets not meeting our return expectation in this market environment.
Lastly, we will put in place the organization and leadership to execute and deliver on our plan. I am fortunate to have Don, Neal, Mark and the rest of the management team available to draw upon and support me in this process as I transition into my new role. 
As always, we will update you on any development on our quarterly earnings call and at our analyst conference. Now let's move on to the review of our second quarter and year-to-date financial results.
Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $511 million or $2.12 per share compared with $222 million or $0.89 per share in the same period last year. This year's second quarter earnings included a gain of $277 million or $1.15 per share, reflecting the write up in the value of the company's original investments in Chile and Peru. 
This was a result of the acquisition of a controlling interest in those utilities during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this gain, our quarterly earnings per share increased by 9%. Earnings for the first 6 months of 2011, were $769 million or $3.19 per share compared with $328 million or $1.31 per share in 2010. First quarter 2010 our earnings included an after-tax charge of $96 million or $0.38 per share related to a litigation settlement.
Our financial performance for the first half of the year is in line with our expectations for this point of the year and on a full year basis. We remain on track to generate earnings of $4 to $4.30. This, of course, excludes the impact of the ride up that we recognized this quarter. 
While our earnings in the second half of the year will be impacted by the expiration of Sempra Generation's 10-year contract with the California Department of Water Resources at the end of the third quarter, we expect higher second-half earnings at our California utilities consistent with our past performance. Additionally, we are expecting the contribution from some regulatory matters that we anticipate to be resolved later this year.
SDG&E will be requesting the CPUC's approval to recover a total of about $90 million of increased wildfire insurance cost from July 2010 through December of this year. About $60 million of that has already been requested, and we expect to file a request in the third quarter of this year for an additional $30 million. 
You may recall that late last year, the commission allowed SDG&E to recover $29 million of insurance cost for the July 2009 to June 2010 policy period. It also provided guidance for future recovery request until our next general rate case. and our 2 requests will be consistent with that guidance.
The other regulatory matter that we anticipate to be resolved by the end of the year are application for $17 million of energy efficiency award for SDG&E and SoCalGas and a $6 million gas cost incentive mechanism award at SoCalGas. I've noted that all the items are just described are on a pretax basis.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Mark so he can take you through some of the detail of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $71 million compared with earnings of $75 million in the year-ago quarter. The small variance was due to higher AFUDC earnings, which was more than offset by higher litigation expense and insurance premiums. 
For the 6 months of 2011, SDG&E earnings were $160 million, which is in line with the $158 million of earnings last year. At Southern California Gas company, second quarter 2011 earnings were $59 million compared with $69 million in the second quarter of 2010. 
The second quarter of this year was impacted by $5 million from lower storage revenues and higher expenses net of higher CPUC authorized margin and a $4 million adjustment to prior year employee benefit costs.
For the 6 months of 2011, SoCalGas' earnings were $127 million compared with $134 million of earnings last year. Now let's go to Slide 5.
Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $337 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $39 million in the same quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain, earnings were $60 million for the quarter and the quarter benefited from $14 million of higher earnings from our increased ownership stake in the utilities in Chile and Peru. And also from $5 million of higher earnings from the pipeline assets in Mexico, which were acquired in the second quarter of 2010.
For the first half of 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage had earnings of $391 million. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain this year, earnings were $114 million for the first half of 2011 compared with $77 million last year. The increase was mainly due to $20 million higher earnings from Chile and Peru and $13 million higher earnings from Mexican pipeline assets. 
Now let's go to Slide 6. Sempra LNG had earnings of $18 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $13 million in the prior year's period. For the first 6 months of 2011, Sempra LNG's earnings were $51 million, up from $45 million last year. Both the second quarter and year-to-date 2011 results included $11 million higher earnings from customer payments related to the non-delivery of contracted cargoes. 
Now please move to Slide 7. Our generation business recorded earnings of $50 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $52 million in the same quarter of 2010. For the first 6 months of 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings were $94 million, up from $1 million of earnings last year. 
Last year's results included an $84 million charge related to litigation settlement in the first quarter. The improvement in earnings was also due to $15 million of lower operating and maintenance cost as a result of scheduled plant maintenance and earthquake damage to our Mexicali power plant in 2010. This was offset by $4 million higher depreciation expense this year.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Debbie who will begin with Slide 8."
120622,138387817,155089,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2011",2011-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, SDG&E and SoCalGas filed updates to their general rate case application, which reflect the impact of bonus depreciation. The updates were consistent with what we",1156,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, SDG&E and SoCalGas filed updates to their general rate case application, which reflect the impact of bonus depreciation. 
The updates were consistent with what we have included in the guidance provided you in March. The CPUC schedule for the rate case is intervene testimony in September, hearings late in the year and a final CPUC decision around March of 2012. The CPUC has already approved making a new rate establish by this rate cases retroactive to generate through 2012. 
Another important regulatory proceeding is the CPUC's examination of what changes should be made to natural gas pipeline following the tragedy in San Bruno. As we talked about on our last call, the CPUC requested records supporting maximum allowable operating pressures for 1,600 miles out of 4,000 miles of Department of Transportation defined transmission pipelines that SoCalGas and SDG&E operate. 
We conducted an extensive review, which we renewed our confidence that the maximum pressures in our system have been appropriately set in accordance with current regulation, and that we operate our system safely.
The CPUC has also directed the natural gas utilities in California to file implementation plans to comply with new requirements to test or replace all transmission pipelines that have not been pressure tested. We will submit our plan to the CPUC by August 26. We believe the comply with these new requirements has the potential of increasing capital spending at our utility, particularly at SoCalGas by several hundred million dollars per year over a 10-year period. But it will ultimately be the commission's decision to set the appropriate level of spending going forward. Both SoCalGas and SDG&E expect full recovery for all incremental costs related to complying with the new requirement. 
Please go to Slide 9. Now let's move on to some of the major utility project. For the $1.9 billion Sunrise Powerlink project, construction is progressing as planned. The project is on budget and is now about 30% complete. We continue to expect to complete the line in the second half of next year. 
Turning to SDG&E smart meter program, this project is now essentially complete. The mass deployment phase has concluded as of the end of the second quarter over $1.3 million electric and 850,000 gas meters have been installed.
I'd also mention that SoCalGas' advanced metering project is on track and the upgrade of 6 million natural gas meters is expected to begin next year.
As for the push towards meeting the 33% renewable target, SDG&E has made significant progress this year. Since the beginning of the year, contracts for more than 1200 megawatts of renewable energy have been added to our portfolio. One renewable project that I'd like to highlight is Rim Rock, which is a 189-megawatt wind project that demonstrates a unique approach to helping meet the renewable those goals at SDG&E. 
Last month, the CPUC unanimously voted to allow SDG&E to make a tax equity investment for up to $250 million in the Rim Rock project. The investment will be included in rate base and represents the first regulated tax equity structure in the nation. 
We will also make an additional shareholder investment in the project, which is expected to be about $40 million and should earn a utility like return. This innovative structure benefits customers by lowering cost between energy and serve as a model for future projects. 
Now let's move to the next slide. Last week, we announced the expansion of our Copper Mountain Solar complex in Nevada. The project rate Copper Mountain to be supported by a 25 year power sales contract with PG&E that is now pending approval by the CPUC. We expect 92 megawatts to be complete by January of 2013 and 58 megawatts by 2015.
And at the end of the second quarter, the 250-megawatt Cedar Creek II wind project in Colorado was also placed in service. This project is a 50-50 joint venture with DP Wind. There is a 25 year agreement in place with a utility subsidiary of Xcel Energy for the sale of the projects power. 
At our last analyst conference in March, we discussed plans to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity at Sempra Generation over the next 5 years. Already, this goal has been met with projects that have been completed and under construction or have been contracted.
Also, out of the 500 megawatts, about 300 megawatts have already received the necessary regulatory approvals. We are developing and building a robust pipeline of renewable projects and included in our slide presentation is an appendix summarizing these projects that we've launched today. 
In addition to the 1,000 megawatts in our 5-year plan, we have the potential for roughly 1,700 megawatts of additional renewable projects based upon our existing land position.
I'd also like to update you on our efforts to maximize the value of Sempra Generation's natural gas plants. We recently signed a 25-year agreement to supply 240-megawatts of electricity to an association of electric utilities in Arizona and southern Nevada. The contract, which starts in 2015, provides us with an attractive long-term strategic hedge for a significant portion of our existing generation capacity at Palo Verde and serves as a platform for further optimization of the 2 remaining gas-fired plants we will have following the transfer of El Dorado SDG&E on October 1 of this year.
By the way, I'd also like to share with you that I recently visited Peru and had the opportunity to meet with Peru's new president as well as the prime minister and energy minister. We had a very constructive meeting and it gave me confidence that the positive regulatory framework our utility has operated under for over a decade will continue. There is great interest in ensuring that Peru has a robust electric grid and increased generation capacity to keep up with its economic growth. Now please turn to the final slide.
We're pleased that we're on track to meet our guidance for the year, and I have confidence taht our utilities will deliver strong results in the second half of this year consistent with our long track record of solid performance. The major projects that our California utilities are moving forward according to plan and our infrastructure business are performing well. 
Before I open up the call to take questions, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the fact that this is Neal Schmale's final earnings call before his retirement later this year. In his prior role as Chief Financial Officer, and his current role as President and Chief Operating Officer, Neal has made countless significant contributions to Sempra Energy in his 13 years with the company. I want to thank him for his leadership and dedication to our company and wish him the very best in his retirement.
With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any of your questions."

We'll then review our second quarter financial results and then provide an operational update on our businesses. In light of Neal Schmale's retirement later this year and my retirement next year, our board engaged in a thoughtful year-long process to ensure a smooth leadership succession. 
That process culminated in the election of Debbie Reed as CEO and as a Sempra board member. As many of you know, Debbie has a broad understanding of the energy industry and has excelled in her 30-year career with the Sempra companies.
She has demonstrated outstanding leadership at every level of responsibility. She is also well respected by key stakeholders that we interface with, including customers, regulators, elected officials community leaders and our employees. Given this, we decided that she was the right person to lead the company going forward.
Once the decision was reached that Debbie would succeed me as CEO, we decided to make that transition effective immediately. This timing provides Debbie with the opportunity to focus on Sempra's annual strategic review of our business. Additionally, this timing allows Neal and me to provide support and guidance to Debbie and the rest of the organization during this transition until our retirements. 
We have an excellent management team in place to take the company forward. The board and I are confident that Debbie, Mark, the business unit presidents and the rest of the management team will continue our excellent track record of creating shareholder value and delivering great service to our customers.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Debbie."

Before I review our second quarter results with you, I would like to address the question some of you have asked concerning my strategic vision for Sempra. 
I want to start by reiterating that our strategy has been and will continue to be focused on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. It is a space within our sector where we have demonstrated success and one in which we have deep competency. 
As Don mentioned, we have just begun our annual strategic review at Sempra in which we update our 5-year business plan. This year, I have 3 objectives that we will complete as part of this process.
First, we will conduct a thorough market assessment of the short- and long-term business environment in which we operate. We will be analyzing market trends to identify opportunities and risks. As an example, environmental regulations are prompting retirements of coal plant, at the same time that nuclear plant development has been substantially slowed. This trend is likely to create opportunities for natural gas-fired generation and the development of new gas infrastructure, including storage. 
Secondly, we will be reviewing the current and expected performance of our asset portfolio considering market cycles and focusing on getting the greatest value from these assets. We will develop specific strategies for assets not meeting our return expectation in this market environment.
Lastly, we will put in place the organization and leadership to execute and deliver on our plan. I feel fortunate to have Don, Neal, Mark and the rest of the management team available to draw upon and support me in this process as I transition into my new role. 
As always, we will update you on any developments on our quarterly earnings call and at our analyst conference next spring. 
Now let's move on to the review of our second quarter and year-to-date financial results.
Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $511 million or $2.12 per share compared with $222 million or $0.89 per share in the same period last year. This year's second quarter earnings included a gain of $277 million or $1.15 per share, reflecting the write-up in the value of the company's original investments in Chile and Peru. 
This was a result of the acquisition of a controlling interest in those utilities during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this gain, our quarterly earnings per share increased by 9%. Earnings for the first 6 months of 2011 were $769 million or $3.19 per share compared with $328 million or $1.31 per share in 2010. First quarter 2010 earnings included an after-tax charge of $96 million or $0.38 per share related to a litigation settlement.
Our financial performance for the first half of the year is in line with our expectations for this point in the year and on a full year basis. We remain on track to generate earnings of $4 to $4.30 per share. This, of course, excludes the impact of the write-up that we recognized this quarter. 
While our earnings in the second half of the year will be impacted by the expiration of Sempra Generation's 10-year contract with the California Department of Water Resources at the end of the third quarter, we expect higher second half earnings at our California utilities consistent with our past performance. Additionally, we are expecting the contribution from some regulatory matters that we anticipate to be resolved later this year.
SDG&E will be requesting the CPUC's approval to recover a total of about $90 million of increased wildfire insurance costs from July 2010 through December of this year. About $60 million of that has already been requested, and we expect to file a request in the third quarter of this year for an additional $30 million. 
You may recall that late last year, the commission allowed SDG&E to recover $29 million of insurance costs for the July 2009 to June 2010 policy period. It also provided guidance for future recovery requests until our next general rate case, and our 2 requests will be consistent with that guidance.
The other regulatory matters that we anticipate to be resolved by the end of the year are applications for $17 million of energy efficiency awards for SDG&E and SoCalGas and a $6 million gas cost incentive mechanism award at SoCalGas. I'd note that all the items I just described are on a pretax basis.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $71 million compared with earnings of $75 million in the year-ago quarter. The small variance was due to higher AFUDC earnings, which were more than offset by higher litigation expense and insurance premiums. 
For the 6 months of 2011, SDG&E's earnings were $160 million, which is in line with the $158 million of earnings last year. At Southern California Gas Co., second quarter 2011 earnings were $59 million compared with $69 million in the second quarter of 2010. 
The second quarter of this year was impacted by $5 million from lower storage revenues and higher expenses net of higher CPUC authorized margin and a $4 million adjustment to prior year employee benefit costs.
For the 6 months of 2011, SoCalGas' earnings were $127 million compared with $134 million of earnings last year. 
Now let's go to Slide 5. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $337 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $39 million in the same quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain, earnings were $60 million for the quarter, and the quarter benefited from $14 million of higher earnings from our increased ownership stake in the utilities in Chile and Peru and also from $5 million of higher earnings from the pipeline assets in Mexico, which were acquired in the second quarter of 2010.
For the first half of 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage had earnings of $391 million. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain this year, earnings were $114 million for the first half of 2011 compared with $77 million last year. The increase was mainly due to $20 million higher earnings from Chile and Peru and $13 million higher earnings from Mexican pipeline assets. 
Now let's go to Slide 6. Sempra LNG had earnings of $18 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $13 million in the prior year's period. For the first 6 months of 2011, Sempra LNG's earnings were $51 million, up from $45 million last year. Both the second quarter and year-to-date 2011 results included $11 million higher earnings from customer payments related to the nondelivery of contracted cargoes. 
Now please move to Slide 7. Our generation business recorded earnings of $50 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $52 million in the same quarter of 2010. For the first 6 months of 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings were $94 million, up from $1 million of earnings last year. 
Last year's results included an $84 million charge related to a litigation settlement in the first quarter. The improvement in earnings was also due to $15 million of lower operating and maintenance costs as a result of scheduled plant maintenance and earthquake damage to our Mexicali power plant in 2010. This was offset by $4 million higher depreciation expense this year.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Debbie, who will begin with Slide 8."
120622,138387817,155336,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2011",2011-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, SDG&E and SoCalGas filed updates to their general rate case applications, which reflect the impact of bonus depreciation. The updates were consistent with what we",1159,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, SDG&E and SoCalGas filed updates to their general rate case applications, which reflect the impact of bonus depreciation. 
The updates were consistent with what we had included in the guidance provided you in March. The CPUC schedule for the rate cases call for intervener testimony in September, hearings late in the year and a final CPUC decision around March of 2012. The CPUC has already approved making the new rates established by these rate cases retroactive to January 1, 2012. 
Another important regulatory proceeding is the CPUC's examination of what changes should be made to natural gas pipelines following the tragedy in San Bruno. As we talked about on our last call, the CPUC requested records supporting maximum allowable operating pressures for 1,600 miles out of 4,000 miles of Department of Transportation defined transmission pipelines that SoCalGas and SDG&E operate. 
We conducted an extensive review, which renewed our confidence that the maximum pressures on our systems have been appropriately set in accordance with current regulation, and that we operate our systems safely.
The CPUC has also directed the natural gas utilities in California to file implementation plans to comply with new requirements to test or replace all transmission pipelines that have not been pressure tested. We will submit our plan to the CPUC by August 26. We believe that complying with these new requirements has the potential of increasing capital spending at our utilities, particularly at SoCalGas, by several hundred million dollars per year over a 10-year period. But it will ultimately be the commission's decision to set the appropriate level of spending going forward. Both SoCalGas and SDG&E expect full recovery for all incremental costs related to complying with the new requirement. 
Please go to Slide 9. Now let's move on to some of the major utility projects. For the $1.9 billion Sunrise Powerlink project, construction is progressing as planned. The project is on budget and is now about 30% complete. We continue to expect to complete the line in the second half of next year. 
Turning to SDG&E Smart Meter program, this project is now essentially complete. The mass deployment phase has concluded as of the end of the second quarter over 1.3 million electric and 850,000 gas meters have been installed.
I'd also mention that SoCalGas' advanced metering project is on track and the upgrade of 6 million natural gas meters is expected to begin next year.
As for the push towards meeting the 33% renewables target, SDG&E has made significant progress this year. Since the beginning of the year, contracts for more than 1,200 megawatts of renewable energy have been added to its portfolio. One renewable project that I'd like to highlight is Rim Rock, which is a 189-megawatt wind project that demonstrates a unique approach to helping meet the renewable goals at SDG&E. 
Last month, the CPUC unanimously voted to allow SDG&E to make a tax equity investment for up to $250 million in the Rim Rock project. The investment will be included in rate base and represents the first regulated tax equity structure in the nation. 
We will also make an additional shareholder investment in the project, which is expected to be about $40 million and should earn a utility-like return. This innovative structure benefits customers by lowering costs for clean energy and serve as a model for future projects. 
Now let's move to the next slide. Last week, we announced the expansion of our Copper Mountain Solar complex in Nevada. The project, creatively called Copper Mountain 2, is supported by a 25-year power sales contract with PG&E that is now pending approval by the CPUC. We expect 92 megawatts to be complete by January of 2013 and 58 megawatts by 2015.
And at the end of the second quarter, the 250-megawatt Cedar Creek 2 wind project at Colorado was also placed in service. This project is a 50-50 joint venture with BP Wind. There is a 25-year agreement in place with a utility subsidiary of Xcel Energy for the sale of the project's power. 
At our last analyst conference in March, we discussed plans to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity at Sempra Generation over the next 5 years. Already, half of this goal has been met with projects that have been completed and under construction or have been contracted.
Also, out of the 500 megawatts, about 300 megawatts have already received the necessary regulatory approvals. We are developing and building a robust pipeline of renewable projects, and including in our slide presentation is an appendix summarizing these projects that we've launched today. 
In addition to the 1,000 megawatts in our 5-year plan, we have the potential for roughly 1,700 megawatts of additional renewable projects based upon our existing land position.
I'd also like to update you on our efforts to maximize the value of Sempra Generation's natural gas plants. We recently signed a 25-year agreement to supply 240 megawatts of electricity to an association of electric utilities in Arizona and southern Nevada. The contract, which starts in 2015, provides us with an attractive long-term strategic hedge for a significant portion of our existing generation capacity at Palo Verde and serves as a platform for further optimization of the 2 remaining gas-fired plants we will have following the transfer of El Dorado to SDG&E on October 1 of this year.
By the way, I'd also like to share with you that I recently visited Peru and had the opportunity to meet with Peru's new president as well as the prime minister and energy minister. We had a very constructive meeting, and it gave me confidence that the positive regulatory framework our electric utility has operated under for over a decade will continue. There is great interest in ensuring that Peru has a robust electric grid and increased generation capacity to keep up with its economic growth. Now please turn to the final slide.
We're pleased that we're on track to meet our guidance for the year, and I have confidence that our utilities will deliver strong results in the second half of this year consistent with our long track record of solid performance. The major projects at our California utilities are moving forward according to plan and our infrastructure businesses are performing well. 
Before I open up the call to take questions, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the fact that this is Neal Schmale's final earnings call before his retirement later this year. In his prior role as Chief Financial Officer and his current role as President and Chief Operating Officer, Neal has made countless significant contributions to Sempra Energy in his 13 years with the company. I want to thank him for his leadership and dedication to our company and wish him the very best in his retirement.

But I want to stress just in our basic distribution area, kind of our basic growth in our Chilean and Peruvian businesses so you get a good sense of that. If you look at the customer growth that we're seeing in those businesses, it's about 2.5% a year. If you look at the sales growth in those businesses, it's about 5.5% to 7% per year. And we are interested, and if there are some potential distribution companies that could be consolidated and we feel that they would be wise investments for us, we would certainly consider those investments as well.

We'll then review our second quarter financial results and then provide an operational update on our businesses. In light of Neal Schmale's retirement later this year and my retirement next year, our board engaged in a thoughtful year-long process to ensure a smooth leadership succession. 
That process culminated in the election of Debbie Reed as CEO and as a Sempra board member. As many of you know, Debbie has a broad understanding of the energy industry and has excelled in her 30-year career with the Sempra companies.
She has demonstrated outstanding leadership at every level of responsibility. She is also well respected by key stakeholders that we interface with, including customers, regulators, elected officials community leaders and our employees. Given this, we decided that she was the right person to lead the company going forward.
Once the decision was reached that Debbie would succeed me as CEO, we decided to make that transition effective immediately. This timing provides Debbie with the opportunity to focus on Sempra's annual strategic review of our business. Additionally, this timing allows Neal and me to provide support and guidance to Debbie and the rest of the organization during this transition until our retirements. 
We have an excellent management team in place to take the company forward. The board and I are confident that Debbie, Mark, the business unit presidents and the rest of the management team will continue our excellent track record of creating shareholder value and delivering great service to our customers.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Debbie."

Before I review our second quarter results with you, I would like to address the question some of you have asked concerning my strategic vision for Sempra. 
I want to start by reiterating that our strategy has been and will continue to be focused on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. It is a space within our sector where we have demonstrated success and one in which we have deep competency. 
As Don mentioned, we have just begun our annual strategic review at Sempra in which we update our 5-year business plan. This year, I have 3 objectives that we will complete as part of this process.
First, we will conduct a thorough market assessment of the short- and long-term business environment in which we operate. We will be analyzing market trends to identify opportunities and risks. As an example, environmental regulations are prompting retirements of coal plant, at the same time that nuclear plant development has been substantially slowed. This trend is likely to create opportunities for natural gas-fired generation and the development of new gas infrastructure, including storage. 
Secondly, we will be reviewing the current and expected performance of our asset portfolio considering market cycles and focusing on getting the greatest value from these assets. We will develop specific strategies for assets not meeting our return expectation in this market environment.
Lastly, we will put in place the organization and leadership to execute and deliver on our plan. I feel fortunate to have Don, Neal, Mark and the rest of the management team available to draw upon and support me in this process as I transition into my new role. 
As always, we will update you on any developments on our quarterly earnings call and at our analyst conference next spring. 
Now let's move on to the review of our second quarter and year-to-date financial results.
Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $511 million or $2.12 per share compared with $222 million or $0.89 per share in the same period last year. This year's second quarter earnings included a gain of $277 million or $1.15 per share, reflecting the write-up in the value of the company's original investments in Chile and Peru. 
This was a result of the acquisition of a controlling interest in those utilities during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this gain, our quarterly earnings per share increased by 9%. Earnings for the first 6 months of 2011 were $769 million or $3.19 per share compared with $328 million or $1.31 per share in 2010. First quarter 2010 earnings included an after-tax charge of $96 million or $0.38 per share related to a litigation settlement.
Our financial performance for the first half of the year is in line with our expectations for this point in the year and on a full year basis. We remain on track to generate earnings of $4 to $4.30 per share. This, of course, excludes the impact of the write-up that we recognized this quarter. 
While our earnings in the second half of the year will be impacted by the expiration of Sempra Generation's 10-year contract with the California Department of Water Resources at the end of the third quarter, we expect higher second half earnings at our California utilities consistent with our past performance. Additionally, we are expecting the contribution from some regulatory matters that we anticipate to be resolved later this year.
SDG&E will be requesting the CPUC's approval to recover a total of about $90 million of increased wildfire insurance costs from July 2010 through December of this year. About $60 million of that has already been requested, and we expect to file a request in the third quarter of this year for an additional $30 million. 
You may recall that late last year, the commission allowed SDG&E to recover $29 million of insurance costs for the July 2009 to June 2010 policy period. It also provided guidance for future recovery requests until our next general rate case, and our 2 requests will be consistent with that guidance.
The other regulatory matters that we anticipate to be resolved by the end of the year are applications for $17 million of energy efficiency awards for SDG&E and SoCalGas and a $6 million gas cost incentive mechanism award at SoCalGas. I'd note that all the items I just described are on a pretax basis.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $71 million compared with earnings of $75 million in the year-ago quarter. The small variance was due to higher AFUDC earnings, which were more than offset by higher litigation expense and insurance premiums. 
For the 6 months of 2011, SDG&E's earnings were $160 million, which is in line with the $158 million of earnings last year. At Southern California Gas Co., second quarter 2011 earnings were $59 million compared with $69 million in the second quarter of 2010. 
The second quarter of this year was impacted by $5 million from lower storage revenues and higher expenses net of higher CPUC authorized margin and a $4 million adjustment to prior year employee benefit costs.
For the 6 months of 2011, SoCalGas' earnings were $127 million compared with $134 million of earnings last year. 
Now let's go to Slide 5. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $337 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $39 million in the same quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain, earnings were $60 million for the quarter, and the quarter benefited from $14 million of higher earnings from our increased ownership stake in the utilities in Chile and Peru and also from $5 million of higher earnings from the pipeline assets in Mexico, which were acquired in the second quarter of 2010.
For the first half of 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage had earnings of $391 million. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain this year, earnings were $114 million for the first half of 2011 compared with $77 million last year. The increase was mainly due to $20 million higher earnings from Chile and Peru and $13 million higher earnings from Mexican pipeline assets. 
Now let's go to Slide 6. Sempra LNG had earnings of $18 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $13 million in the prior year's period. For the first 6 months of 2011, Sempra LNG's earnings were $51 million, up from $45 million last year. Both the second quarter and year-to-date 2011 results included $11 million higher earnings from customer payments related to the nondelivery of contracted cargoes. 
Now please move to Slide 7. Our generation business recorded earnings of $50 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $52 million in the same quarter of 2010. For the first 6 months of 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings were $94 million, up from $1 million of earnings last year. 
Last year's results included an $84 million charge related to a litigation settlement in the first quarter. The improvement in earnings was also due to $15 million of lower operating and maintenance costs as a result of scheduled plant maintenance and earthquake damage to our Mexicali power plant in 2010. This was offset by $4 million higher depreciation expense this year.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Debbie, who will begin with Slide 8."
120622,138387817,155400,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2011",2011-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, SDG&E and SoCalGas filed updates to their general rate case applications, which reflect the impact of bonus depreciation. The updates were consistent with what we",1159,"Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, SDG&E and SoCalGas filed updates to their general rate case applications, which reflect the impact of bonus depreciation. 
The updates were consistent with what we had included in the guidance provided you in March. The CPUC schedule for the rate cases call for intervener testimony in September, hearings late in the year and a final CPUC decision around March of 2012. The CPUC has already approved making the new rates established by these rate cases retroactive to January 1, 2012. 
Another important regulatory proceeding is the CPUC's examination of what changes should be made to natural gas pipelines following the tragedy in San Bruno. As we talked about on our last call, the CPUC requested records supporting maximum allowable operating pressures for 1,600 miles out of 4,000 miles of Department of Transportation defined transmission pipelines that SoCalGas and SDG&E operate. 
We conducted an extensive review, which renewed our confidence that the maximum pressures on our systems have been appropriately set in accordance with current regulation, and that we operate our systems safely.
The CPUC has also directed the natural gas utilities in California to file implementation plans to comply with new requirements to test or replace all transmission pipelines that have not been pressure tested. We will submit our plan to the CPUC by August 26. We believe that complying with these new requirements has the potential of increasing capital spending at our utilities, particularly at SoCalGas, by several hundred million dollars per year over a 10-year period. But it will ultimately be the commission's decision to set the appropriate level of spending going forward. Both SoCalGas and SDG&E expect full recovery for all incremental costs related to complying with the new requirement. 
Please go to Slide 9. Now let's move on to some of the major utility projects. For the $1.9 billion Sunrise Powerlink project, construction is progressing as planned. The project is on budget and is now about 30% complete. We continue to expect to complete the line in the second half of next year. 
Turning to SDG&E Smart Meter program, this project is now essentially complete. The mass deployment phase has concluded as of the end of the second quarter over 1.3 million electric and 850,000 gas meters have been installed.
I'd also mention that SoCalGas' advanced metering project is on track and the upgrade of 6 million natural gas meters is expected to begin next year.
As for the push towards meeting the 33% renewables target, SDG&E has made significant progress this year. Since the beginning of the year, contracts for more than 1,200 megawatts of renewable energy have been added to its portfolio. One renewable project that I'd like to highlight is Rim Rock, which is a 189-megawatt wind project that demonstrates a unique approach to helping meet the renewable goals at SDG&E. 
Last month, the CPUC unanimously voted to allow SDG&E to make a tax equity investment for up to $250 million in the Rim Rock project. The investment will be included in rate base and represents the first regulated tax equity structure in the nation. 
We will also make an additional shareholder investment in the project, which is expected to be about $40 million and should earn a utility-like return. This innovative structure benefits customers by lowering costs for clean energy and serves as a model for future projects. 
Now let's move to the next slide. Last week, we announced the expansion of our Copper Mountain Solar complex in Nevada. The project, creatively called Copper Mountain 2, is supported by a 25-year power sales contract with PG&E that is now pending approval by the CPUC. We expect 92 megawatts to be complete by January of 2013 and 58 megawatts by 2015.
And at the end of the second quarter, the 250-megawatt Cedar Creek 2 wind project at Colorado was also placed in service. This project is a 50-50 joint venture with BP Wind. There is a 25-year agreement in place with a utility subsidiary of Xcel Energy for the sale of the project's power. 
At our last analyst conference in March, we discussed plans to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity at Sempra Generation over the next 5 years. Already, half of this goal has been met with projects that have been completed and under construction or have been contracted.
Also, out of these 500 megawatts, about 300 megawatts have already received the necessary regulatory approvals. We are developing and building a robust pipeline of renewable projects, and including in our slide presentation is an appendix summarizing these projects that we've launched today. 
In addition to the 1,000 megawatts in our 5-year plan, we have the potential for roughly 1,700 megawatts of additional renewable projects based upon our existing land position.
I'd also like to update you on our efforts to maximize the value of Sempra Generation's natural gas plants. We recently signed a 25-year agreement to supply 240 megawatts of electricity to an association of electric utilities in Arizona and southern Nevada. The contract, which starts in 2015, provides us with an attractive long-term strategic hedge for a significant portion of our existing generation capacity at Palo Verde and serves as a platform for further optimization of the 2 remaining gas-fired plants we will have following the transfer of El Dorado to SDG&E on October 1 of this year.
By the way, I'd also like to share with you that I recently visited Peru and had the opportunity to meet with Peru's new president as well as the prime minister and energy minister. We had a very constructive meeting, and it gave me confidence that the positive regulatory framework our electric utility has operated under for over a decade will continue. There is great interest in ensuring that Peru has a robust electric grid and increased generation capacity to keep up with its economic growth. Now please turn to the final slide.
We're pleased that we're on track to meet our guidance for the year, and I have confidence that our utilities will deliver strong results in the second half of this year consistent with our long track record of solid performance. The major projects at our California utilities are moving forward according to plan and our infrastructure businesses are performing well. 
Before I open up the call to take questions, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the fact that this is Neal Schmale's final earnings call before his retirement later this year. In his prior role as Chief Financial Officer and his current role as President and Chief Operating Officer, Neal has made countless significant contributions to Sempra Energy in his 13 years with the company. I want to thank him for his leadership and dedication to our company and wish him the very best in his retirement.
With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any of your questions."

That project will then give us an opportunity to do more. But I want to stress just in our basic distribution area, kind of our basic growth in our Chilean and Peruvian businesses so you get a good sense of that. If you look at the customer growth that we're seeing in those businesses, it's about 2.5% a year. If you look at the sales growth in those businesses, it's about 5.5% to 7% per year. And we are interested, and if there are some potential distribution companies that could be consolidated and we feel that they would be wise investments for us, we would certainly consider those investments as well. It does have a very high growth environment and have a very stable regulatory environment, which we believe will continue."

We would anticipate doing that there locally. And then obviously, we, like a lot of other companies in the U.S., are lobbying and talking about some kind of change in the tax system that would allow U.S. companies to bring cash home and invest in opportunities here. And we certainly are poised and ready to take advantage of that if that should happen.

Before we begin, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge that 2 of the long-standing members of our leadership team are joining us today in new roles. As part of our ongoing succession planning process, Mark Snell was named President of Sempra Energy. Joe Householder, who had previously served as our Senior Vice President and Controller, was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sempra Energy, the role that Mark had held since 2005. 
In addition, on January 1, Jeff Martin will assume a broader role as the head of U.S. Gas & Power, and George Liparidis will take over all our international operation. I will discuss more about these changes later. 
I think we have a great team in place, one that has worked well together for many years and one that is ready to build on our success and take the company forward. So now, let's discuss our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, beginning on Slide 3.
Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $296 million or $1.22 per share compared with $131 million or $0.53 per share in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $270 million, which excludes a $130 million write-down of our investment and RBS Sempra Commodities. Earnings for the first 9 months of 2011 were $1.1 billion or $4.40 per share compared with $459 million or $1.84 per share in 2010. This year's second quarter earnings included a gain of $277 million to reflecting the writeup and the value of our investments in Chile and Peru. And in 2010, earnings included an after-tax litigation charge of $96 million, as well as the write-down of the investment and RBS Sempra Commodities that I just mentioned.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the first 9 months of 2011 were up 17% compared to last year, and I'm pleased with the strong performance from all of our businesses. 
Now I'd like to hand it over to Joe so we can take you through some of the details of our financial results beginning with Slide 4."
120622,141931986,184115,"Sempra Energy, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Debbie.

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $113 million compared with earnings of $106 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due primarily to higher earnings from work-in progress or AFUDC equity mainly from the Sunrise Powerlink project. For the first 9 months of 2011, SDG&E's earnings were $273 million compared with $264 million last year. The increase was due primarily to higher AFUDC earnings net of increased interest costs. 
At Southern California Gas, third quarter 2011 earnings were $81 million compared with $78 million in the third quarter of 2010. For the first 9 months of 2011, SoCalGas's earnings were $208 million compared with $212 million last year. Now let's go to Slide 5.
Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $66 million in the third quarter 2011 compared to earnings of $43 million in the same quarter of 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily due to $11 million higher earnings from the accretive acquisition we made in Chile and Peru and $18 million higher earnings from nonoperating foreign currency effects in Chile. Partially offsetting this was a net $7 million benefit last year due to nonrecurring items related to our investment in Argentina.
For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage had earnings of $457 million. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain earlier this year, earnings were $180 million for the first 9 months of 2011 compared with earnings of $120 million last year. The increase was mainly due to $31 million higher earnings from operations in Chile and Peru, $13 million higher earnings from the Mexican pipeline operations we acquired in April 2010 and $15 million from the foreign currency benefit in Chile that I just mentioned.
Of note, the currency gain in Chile resulted primarily from having over $200 million in U.S. currency at Chiquita while there was a strengthening of the dollar relative to the Chilean peso. Some of the game will turn around in the fourth quarter because the dollar has since weakened. 
The cash has now been distributed out of the operating company. And because we no longer plan to retain excess funds in excess of operating needs at Chiquita, we do not expect to see this as a significant item in future years.
Now please go to slide 6. Semper LNG had earnings of $24 million in the third quarter off 2011 compared with earnings of $5 million in the prior year's period. For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra LNG's earnings were $75 million, up from $50 million last year. The increase in earnings for both about the quarter and year-to-date was due primarily to higher revenues for contracted cargoes that were not delivered. Now please move to Slide 7.
Our Generation business recorded earnings of $49 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $59 million in the same quarter in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from natural gas power plant operations was partially offset by an income tax benefit. For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings were $143 million, up from $60 million last year. Last year's results included an $86 million charge related to a litigation settlement. 
I also want to mention that as anticipated, Generation's 10-year contract to sell power to the California Department of Water Resources expired at the end of the third quarter. This contract anchored our fleet of gas plants for the past 10 years. Also, on October 1, the 480-megawatt El Dorado gas plant was acquired by SDG&E towards book value about $200 million, and now it were in the rate base returns at SDG&E.
Now let's move to the next slide. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, there was a regulatory idea that I'd like to point out as it relates to our expectation for the remainder of the year. As SDG&E has requested the CPC's approval to recover increased wildfire insurance costs for the period July 2010 through December of this year, which is approved as filed will result in about $50 million of earnings. You may recall that late last year, the commission allowed SDG&E to recover its higher insurance costs for the July 2009 to June 2010 policy period, which resulted in the recognition of $16 million of earnings. It also provided guidance for the future recovery request until our next rate case, and our 2 requests are consistent with that guidance. The amount and the timing of recovery of these requests will play a key role in determining where within our guidance range we end the year.
Given our outlook for the remainder of the year and the strong performance across all our businesses for the first 9 months, we are on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of $4 to $4.30 per share, which excludes the impact of the remeasurement gain from our South American acquisition that we recognized in the second quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Debbie, who will begin with Slide 9."

Now let me update you in activities in our California Utility. In our general rate cases for SDG&E and SoCalGas, the interveners in the proceedings filed their testimony in September, and we filed our rebuttal testimony last month, which sets the stage for settlement discussion. The proceedings schedules call for hearings in December and final CPUC decisions around March of 2012. The CPUC has already approved making these new rates retroactive to January 1, 2012.
Turning to the Sunrise Powerlink project at SDG&E, the project now is about 50% complete and remains on budget. We continue to expect the line to be completed in the second half of 2012. Earlier this year, the CPUC directed the natural gas utilities in California to file implementation plan to comply with new requirement to test our replace all transmission pipeline that have not been pressure tested. We submitted our pipeline safety enhancement plan to the CPUC in late August. This plan calls for spending a total of $3.1 billion over the next 10 years, primarily at SoCalGas. We have requested cost recovery for the first base, which entails spending $1.4 billion of capital and about $300 million of O&M expense through 2015 to pressure tests or replace pipeline in the highest priority areas. 
Both SoCalGas and SDG&E expect the CPUC to allow recovery for all costs associated with complying with these new requirement and to set the appropriate level of spending going forward. Now please go to Slide 10.
Given the dramatic rise in North American natural gas production firm shale resources and a disparity in natural gas prices between North America and both Asian and European market, several liquefaction projects have now been proposed that would export LNG to international markets. 
We have strong interest from large creditworthy counterparties who want to procure liquefaction services from Cameron LNG on long-term 20-plus-year contracts. Due to the significant interest, we will be submitting an application for an LNG export license from the Department of Energy in the very near future. Our goal is to get a long-term contract, fully utilize our existing infrastructure and minimize our future investment risk. Given the stature and enthusiasm of the interested parties, we believe this is a realistic objective. 
Now before I move onto the final slide, I'd like to provide an update on our strategic planning process. As we discussed in our second quarter earnings call, this is an exercise that we undertake each year to update our 5-year business plan. You may recall that I outlined 3 primary objectives part of this year's effort, which are: To conduct a thorough market assessment, to identify opportunities and risks, review the current and expected performance of our outfit portfolio with the goal of getting the greatest value for these assets, and put in place the organizational leadership to execute and deliver on our plan. 
We recently announced management changes and a business unit realignment, which is an initial step in the evolution of our business. I want to stress that our strategy has been and will continue to be focused on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. 
Our realignment reflects this continued focus. The leaders of our 2 California utilities, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas now the report directly to me. In his new role as President, Mark Snell will oversee our operations outside the California Utilities. Effective at the beginning of next year, Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storage and Sempra LNG, will be consolidated to 2 new business units reporting to Mark: Sempra International and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power. 
With regard to our market assessment and portfolio review, our work is ongoing and we plan to detail the results at our analyst conference next spring. Now please turn to the final slide.
To summarize, I'm very pleased with the strong performance across all of our business units so far this year. Our adjusted earnings for the first 9 months of the year are up 17% from last year, and we're on track to meet our earnings outlook for 2011.

As far as the opt out, it's interesting. We haven't had on the SDG&E side a big desire by customers to opt out. We've had basically virtually no complaint in our smart meter program at SDG&E. But I would say that what we did is upfront. We spent a lot of time acquainting customers with the system, what the advantages are, how to opt -- how to use this to their benefit. And so I think that we would be doing the same types of things at SoCalGas. And on the SDG&E side, we're nearly finished. We're at about 98% completion right now. And I think our total complaints were like 0.16% of customers. So I mean, it's nothing. I think we had good experience at SDG&E, we will apply that experience to SoCal."

Before we begin, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge that 2 of the long-standing members of our leadership team are joining us today in new roles. As part of our ongoing succession planning process, Mark Snell was named President of Sempra Energy. Joe Householder, who had previously served as our Senior Vice President and Controller, was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sempra Energy, the role that Mark had held since 2005. 
In addition, on January 1, Jeff Martin will assume a broader role as the head of U.S. Gas & Power, and George Liparidis will take over all of our international operation. I will discuss more about these changes later. 
I think we have a great team in place, one that has worked well together for many years and one that is ready to build on our success to take the company forward. So now let's discuss our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, beginning on Slide 3.
Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $296 million or $1.22 per share compared with $131 million or $0.53 per share in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $270 million, which excludes a $130 million write-down of our investment in RBS Sempra Commodities. Earnings for the first 9 months of 2011 were $1.1 billion or $4.40 per share compared with $459 million or $1.84 per share in 2010. This year's second quarter earnings included a gain of $277 million reflecting the write-up and the value of our investments in Chile and Peru. And in 2010, earnings included an after-tax litigation charge of $96 million, as well as the write-down of the investment in RBS Sempra Commodities that I just mentioned.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the first 9 months of 2011 were up 17% compared to last year, and I'm pleased with the strong performance from all of our businesses. 
Now I'd like to hand it over to Joe, so he can take you through some of the details of our financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $113 million compared with earnings of $106 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due primarily to higher earnings from work-in progress or AFUDC equity mainly from the Sunrise Powerlink project. 
For the first 9 months of 2011, SDG&E's earnings were $273 million compared with $264 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the higher AFUDC earnings net of increased interest costs. 
At Southern California Gas, third quarter 2011 earnings were $81 million compared with $78 million in the third quarter of 2010. For the first 9 months of 2011, SoCalGas's earnings were $208 million compared with $212 million last year. Now let's go to Slide 5.
Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $66 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter of 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily due to $11 million higher earnings from the accretive acquisition we made in Chile and Peru and $18 million higher earnings from non-operating foreign currency effects in Chile. Partially offsetting this was a net $7 million benefit last year due to nonrecurring items related to our investment in Argentina.
For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage had earnings of $457 million. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain earlier this year, earnings were $180 million for the first 9 months of 2011 compared with earnings of $120 million last year. The increase was mainly due to $31 million higher earnings from operations in Chile and Peru, $13 million higher earnings from the Mexican pipeline operations we acquired in April 2010 and $15 million from the foreign currency benefit in Chile that I just mentioned.
Of note, the currency gain in Chile resulted primarily from having over $200 million in U.S. currency at Chilquinta while there was a strengthening of the dollar relative to the Chilean peso. Some of the gain will turn around in the fourth quarter because the dollar has since weakened. 
The cash has now been distributed out of the operating company. And because we no longer plan to retain excess funds in excess of operating needs at Chilquinta, we do not expect to see this as a significant item in future years.
Now please go to slide 6. Sempra LNG had earnings of $24 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $5 million in the prior year's period. For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra LNG's earnings were $75 million, up from $50 million last year. The increase in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date was due primarily to higher revenues for contracted cargoes that were not delivered. Now please move to Slide 7.
Our Generation business recorded earnings of $49 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $59 million in the same quarter in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from natural gas power plant operations, was partially offset by an income tax benefit. For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings were $143 million, up from $60 million last year. Last year's results included an $86 million charge related to a litigation settlement. 
I also want to mention that as anticipated, Generation's 10-year contract to sell power to the California Department of Water Resources expired at the end of the third quarter. This contract anchored our fleet of gas plants for the past 10 years. Also, on October 1, the 480-megawatt El Dorado gas plant was acquired by SDG&E towards book value about $200 million, and now it will earn a rate base return at SDG&E.
Now let's move to the next slide. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, there was a regulatory item that I'd like to point out as it relates to our expectations for the remainder of the year. SDG&E has requested the CPC's approval to recover increased wildfire insurance costs for the period July 2010, through December of this year, which if approved as filed will result in about $50 million of earnings. You may recall that late last year, the Commission allowed SDG&E to recover its higher insurance costs for the July 2009 to June 2010 policy period, which resulted in the recognition of $16 million of earnings. It also provided guidance for the future recovery request until our next rate case, and our 2 requests are consistent with that guidance. The amount and the timing of recovery of these requests will play a key role in determining where, within our guidance range, we end the year.
Given our outlook for the remainder of the year and the strong performance across all of our businesses for the first 9 months, we are on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of $4 to $4.30 per share, which excludes the impact of the remeasurement gain from our South American acquisition that we recognized in the second quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Debbie, who will begin with Slide 9."

Now let me update you in activities in our California utility. In our general rate cases for SDG&E and SoCalGas, the interveners in the proceedings filed their testimony in September, and we filed our rebuttal testimony last month, which sets the stage for settlement discussion. The proceedings schedules call for hearings in December and final CPUC decisions around March of 2012. The CPUC has already approved making these new rates retroactive to January 1, 2012.
Turning to the Sunrise Powerlink project at SDG&E. The project now is about 50% complete and remains on budget. We continue to expect the lines to be completed in the second half of 2012. Earlier this year, the CPUC directed the natural gas utilities in California to file implementation plans to comply with new requirements to test or replace all transmission pipeline that have not been pressure tested. We submitted our pipeline safety enhancement plan to the CPUC in late August. This plan calls for spending a total of $3.1 billion over the next 10 years, primarily at SoCalGas. 
We have requested cost recovery for the first base, which entails spending $1.4 billion of capital and about $300 million of O&M expense through 2015 to pressure test or replace pipeline in the highest priority areas. 
Both SoCalGas and SDG&E expect the CPUC to allow recovery for all costs associated with complying with these new requirement and to set the appropriate level of spending going forward. Now please go to Slide 10.
Given the dramatic rise in North American natural gas production from shale resources and the disparity in natural gas prices between North America and both Asian and European market, several liquefaction projects have now been proposed that would export LNG to international markets. 
We have strong interest from large credit-worthy counterparties who want to procure liquefaction services from Cameron LNG on long-term, 20-plus-year contracts. Due to the significant interest, we will be submitting an application for an LNG export license from the Department of Energy in the very near future. Our goal is to get a long-term contract, fully utilize our existing infrastructure and minimize our future investment risk. Given the stature and enthusiasm of the interested parties, we believe this is a realistic objective. 
Now before I move on to the final slide, I'd like to provide an update on our strategic planning process. As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, this is an exercise that we undertake each year to update our 5-year business plan. You may recall that I outlined 3 primary objectives as part of this year's effort, which are: to conduct a thorough market assessment, to identify opportunities and risks; review the current and expected performance of our outfit portfolio with the goal of getting the greatest value from these assets; and put in place the organizational leadership to execute and deliver on our plans. 
We recently announced management changes and a business unit realignment, which is an initial step in the evolution of our business. I want to stress that our strategy has been and will continue to be focused on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. 
Our realignment reflects this continued focus. The leaders of our 2 California utilities, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas now report directly to me. In his new role as President, Mark Snell will oversee our operations outside the California utilities. Effective at the beginning of next year, Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storage and Sempra LNG, will be consolidated into 2 new business units reporting to Mark: Sempra International and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power. 
With regard to our market assessment and portfolio review, our work is ongoing and we plan to detail the results at our analyst conference next spring. Now please turn to the final slide.
To summarize, I'm very pleased with the strong performance across all of our business units, so far this year. Our adjusted earnings for the first 9 months of the year are up 17% from last year, and we're on track to meet our earnings outlook for 2011.
With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any questions."

It affected generation and it also touches on our other operations in Mexico. Many of those subsidiaries use the U.S. dollars as function of currency. But during the third quarter the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Mexican peso. As a result, U.S. dollar denominated liabilities, generally debt, resulted in Mexican tax benefits. This lowered the tax rate for our Mexican operations and for Sempra. We have economically hedged its exposure in 2011, but the impact of the hedge isn't reflected in tax expenses, it's reflected in other income and expense. Another impact of the weakening peso is that our deferred tax liabilities declined in U.S. dollar terms resulting in lower tax rates. Again, lower tax rates for Mexican operations and for Sempra."

Before we begin, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge that 2 of the long-standing members of our leadership team are joining us today in new roles. As part of our ongoing succession planning process, Mark Snell was named President of Sempra Energy. Joe Householder, who had previously served as our Senior Vice President and Controller, was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sempra Energy, the role that Mark had held since 2005. 
In addition, on January 1, Jeff Martin will assume a broader role as the head of U.S. Gas & Power, and George Liparidis will take over all of our international operation. I will discuss more about these changes later. 
I think we have a great team in place, one that has worked well together for many years and one that is ready to build on our success and take the company forward. So now let's discuss our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, beginning on Slide 3.
Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $296 million or $1.22 per share compared with $131 million or $0.53 per share in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $270 million, which excludes a $130 million write-down of our investment at RBS Sempra Commodities. Earnings for the first 9 months of 2011 were $1.1 billion or $4.40 per share compared with $459 million or $1.84 per share in 2010. This year's second quarter earnings included a gain of $277 million reflecting the write-up and the value of our investments in Chile and Peru. And in 2010, earnings included an after-tax litigation charge of $96 million, as well as the write-down of the investment in RBS Sempra Commodities that I just mentioned.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the first 9 months of 2011 were up 17% compared to last year, and I'm pleased with the strong performance from all of our businesses. 
Now I'd like to hand it over to Joe, so he can take you through some of the details of our financial results beginning with Slide 4."

At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $113 million compared with earnings of $106 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due primarily to higher earnings from work-in progress or AFUDC equity mainly from the Sunrise Powerlink project. 
For the first 9 months of 2011, SDG&E's earnings were $273 million compared with $264 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the higher AFUDC earnings net of increased interest costs. 
At Southern California Gas, third quarter 2011 earnings were $81 million compared with $78 million in the third quarter of 2010. For the first 9 months of 2011, SoCalGas's earnings were $208 million compared with $212 million last year. Now let's go to Slide 5.
Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $66 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter of 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily due to $11 million higher earnings from the accretive acquisition we made in Chile and Peru and $18 million higher earnings from non-operating foreign currency effects in Chile. Partially offsetting this was a net $7 million benefit last year due to nonrecurring items related to our investment in Argentina.
For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage had earnings of $457 million. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain earlier this year, earnings were $180 million for the first 9 months of 2011 compared with earnings of $120 million last year. The increase was mainly due to $31 million higher earnings from operations in Chile and Peru, $13 million higher earnings from the Mexican pipeline operations we acquired in April 2010 and $15 million from the foreign currency benefit in Chile that I just mentioned.
I’d note, the currency gain in Chile resulted primarily from having over $200 million in U.S. currency at Chilquinta while there was a strengthening of the dollar relative to the Chilean peso. Some of the gain will turn around in the fourth quarter because the dollar has since weakened. 
The cash has now been distributed out of the operating company. And because we no longer plan to retain excess funds in excess of operating needs at Chilquinta, we do not expect to see this as a significant item in future years.
Now please go to slide 6. Sempra LNG had earnings of $24 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $5 million in the prior year's period. For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra LNG's earnings were $75 million, up from $50 million last year. The increase in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date was due primarily to higher revenues for contracted cargoes that were not delivered. Now please move to Slide 7.
Our Generation business recorded earnings of $49 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $59 million in the same quarter in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from natural gas fired power plant operations, was partially offset by an income tax benefit. For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings were $143 million, up from $60 million last year. Last year's results included an $86 million charge related to a litigation settlement. 
I also want to mention that as anticipated, Generation's 10-year contract to sell power to the California Department of Water Resources expired at the end of the third quarter. This contract anchored our fleet of gas plants for the past 10 years. Also, on October 1, the 480-megawatt El Dorado gas plant was acquired by SDG&E for its book value about $200 million, and now it will earn a rate base return at SDG&E.
Now let's move to the next slide. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, there is a regulatory item that I'd like to point out as it relates to our expectations for the remainder of the year. SDG&E has requested the CPUC's approval to recover increased wildfire insurance costs for the period July 2010, through December of this year, which if approved as filed will result in about $50 million of earnings. You may recall that late last year, the Commission allowed SDG&E to recover its higher insurance costs for the July 2009 to June 2010 policy period, which resulted in the recognition of $16 million of earnings. It also provided guidance for the future recovery request until our next rate case, and our 2 requests are consistent with that guidance. The amount and the timing of recovery of these requests will play a key role in determining where, within our guidance range, we end the year.
Given our outlook for the remainder of the year and the strong performance across all of our businesses for the first 9 months, we are on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of $4 to $4.30 per share, this excludes the impact of the remeasurement gain from our South American acquisition that we recognized in the second quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Debbie, who will begin with Slide 9."
120622,141931986,184585,"Sempra Energy, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2011",2011-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Now let me update you in activities in our California utility. In our general rate cases for SDG&E and SoCalGas, the interveners in the proceedings filed their testimony in September, and we filed our rebuttal testimony last month, which sets",695,"Thanks, Joe. Now let me update you in activities in our California utility. In our general rate cases for SDG&E and SoCalGas, the interveners in the proceedings filed their testimony in September, and we filed our rebuttal testimony last month, which sets the stage for settlement discussion. The proceedings schedules call for hearings in December and final CPUC decisions around March of 2012. The CPUC has already approved making these new rates retroactive to January 1, 2012.
Turning to the Sunrise Powerlink project at SDG&E. The project now is about 50% complete and remains on budget. We continue to expect the lines to be completed in the second half of 2012. Earlier this year, the CPUC directed the natural gas utilities in California to file implementation plans to comply with new requirements to test or replace all transmission pipeline that have not been pressure tested. We submitted our pipeline safety enhancement plan to the CPUC in late August. This plan calls for spending a total of $3.1 billion over the next 10 years, primarily at SoCalGas. 
We have requested cost recovery for the first phase, which entails spending $1.4 billion of capital and about $300 million of O&M expense through 2015 to pressure test or replace pipeline in the highest priority areas. 
Both SoCalGas and SDG&E expect the CPUC to allow recovery for all costs associated with complying with these new requirement and to set the appropriate level of spending going forward. Now please go to Slide 10.
Given the dramatic rise in North American natural gas production from shale resources and the disparity in natural gas prices between North America and both Asian and European market, several liquefaction projects have now been proposed that would export LNG to international markets. 
We have strong interest from large credit-worthy counterparties who want to procure liquefaction services from Cameron LNG on long-term, 20-plus-year contracts. Due to the significant interest, we will be submitting an application for an LNG export license from the Department of Energy in the very near future. Our goal is to get a long-term contract, fully utilize our existing infrastructure and minimize our future investment risk. Given the stature and enthusiasm of the interested parties, we believe this is a realistic objective. 
Now before I move on to the final slide, I'd like to provide an update on our strategic planning process. As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, this is an exercise that we undertake each year to update our 5-year business plan. You may recall that I outlined 3 primary objectives as part of this year's effort, which are: to conduct a thorough market assessment, to identify opportunities and risks; review the current and expected performance of our asset portfolio with the goal of getting the greatest value from these assets; and put in place the organization and leadership to execute and deliver on our plans. 
We recently announced management changes and a business unit realignment, which is an initial step in the evolution of our business. I want to stress that our strategy has been and will continue to be focused on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. 
Our realignment reflects this continued focus. The leaders of our 2 California utilities, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas now report directly to me. In his new role as President, Mark Snell will oversee our operations outside the California utilities. Effective at the beginning of next year, Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storage and Sempra LNG, will be consolidated into 2 new business units reporting to Mark: Sempra International and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power. 
With regard to our market assessment and portfolio review, our work is ongoing and we plan to detail the results at our analyst conference next spring. Now please turn to the final slide.
To summarize, I'm very pleased with the strong performance across all of our business units, so far this year. Our adjusted earnings for the first 9 months of the year are up 17% from last year, and we're on track to meet our earnings outlook for 2011.
With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any questions."

It affected generation and it also touches on our other operations in Mexico. Many of those subsidiaries use the U.S. dollars as their functional currency. So during the third quarter the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Mexican peso. As a result, U.S. dollar denominated liabilities, generally debt, resulted in Mexican tax benefits. This lowered the tax rate for our Mexican operations and for Sempra. We have economically hedged this exposure in 2011, but the impact of the hedge isn't reflected in tax expenses, it's reflected in other income and expense. Another impact of the weakening peso is that our deferred tax liabilities was declined in U.S. dollar terms resulting in lower tax rates. Again, lower tax rates for Mexican operations and for Sempra."

We have plans in place and we're prepared to lever up all 3 of the businesses, where we have operations, and we're fairly low debt levels in each of those 3 countries. But recall also that we have very attractive growth opportunities in each of those 3 countries. So we do have opportunity to spend the money there.
