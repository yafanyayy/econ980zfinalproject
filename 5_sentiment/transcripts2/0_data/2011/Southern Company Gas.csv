Starting on Slide 3 of our company presentation you can see that we reported 2010 earnings of a record $3 per diluted share or $3.05 per share excluding costs related to the Nicor merger we announced in December.",1463,"Thanks Sarah and good morning everyone.  Starting on Slide 3 of our company presentation you can see that we reported 2010 earnings of a record $3 per diluted share or $3.05 per share excluding costs related to the Nicor merger we announced in December.  On an adjusted basis these results are up 17 cents or 6% from 2009.  In addition, operating income was up by 5% year over year.
Our fourth quarter results were 81 cents per diluted share or 86 cents adjusted for Nicor related costs.  This compares to fourth quarter 2009 EPS of 92 cents.  On the whole, results for both the year and fourth quarter were at the upper end of our guidance range due in large part to an unusually cold December across much of the US.  The strong finish to the year, the effect of new infrastructure investments and rate programs as well as ongoing expense discipline drove record results.
Turning to Slide 4, you can see our solid track record of EPS and dividend growth.  We continue to expect earnings increases of about 4-6% per year going forward and we maintain our policy of increasing dividends while growing earnings.  I’ll speak more to the specifics of our earnings guidance in a few minutes but you can see here that our guidance for 2011 is for diluted earnings per share of between $3.10-3.20 excluding any impacts from the Nicor transaction.
And I’m pleased to report that yesterday our board of directors approved the ninth dividend increase for AGL Resources’ shareholders since 2002.  Our expected dividend for 2011 is now $1.80.  Moving on to Slide 5 you’ll find a snapshot of earnings before interest and taxes by segment.  On the left you can see that despite volatile conditions in the natural gas market over the past few years we’ve managed to produce stable and consistent results across the business.
And on the right, note that our distribution business continues to be the largest contributor to EBIT, representing 59% of total EBIT in 2010.  Retail accounted for 20%, wholesale for 10% and energy investments for the remainder.  I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting on Slide 6.  Just as a reminder, the revenue metric does not carry a particularly heavy weight for most of our business segments as it’s influenced by the price of natural gas, which is passed through to our customers in most instances.
Revenues will be driven by volume and price, to which we are largely agnostic.  So beginning with our distribution business, it performed very well in 2010.  EBIT was up $29 million compared to last year.  The increase is principally due to the addition of earnings from the pipeline projects we put into service last year, Hampton Roads Crossing in Virginia and Magnolia Project in Georgia.
Our new regulatory infrastructure and rate programs at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown also contributed to this increase.  EBIT in the fourth quarter was up 12% versus fourth quarter of 2009 with similar drivers to our annual results.  We continued our discipline in controlling costs throughout the year.  Our operating expenses excluding the cost of gas in the distribution segment increased just 2%, which is primarily a function of expected higher payroll, compensation and benefits cost.
Turning to the retail segment Salstar on Slide 7, we recorded EBIT of $103 million for 2010, down just 2 million from last year.  EBIT for the fourth quarter was also down $2 million versus fourth quarter of 2009.  As was the case with most of our businesses, extremely cold conditions in first quarter and fourth quarter resulted in increased customer usage across our customer base.  However, these favorable weather conditions were offset by the effect of continued strong competition for customers in the Georgia market and a continuing but slowing migration to fixed price plans, which generally produce lower margin.
While we consistently use EBIT as a key measure for each of our segments, at the retail business it’s important to point out that due to our increased stake in Salstar to 85% which went effective January 1st, net income was actually up $11 million year over year as we retained a greater percentage of net earnings.  By utilizing marketing and customer retention programs, Salstar successfully maintained stable market share of 33% in Georgia in 2010 with our customer count remaining around 500,000.
Salstar continues to explore opportunities outside of Georgia to strengthen our offering and expand our customer base.  You’ll find results from our wholesale services segment on Slide 8.  Sequent performance was slightly impacted by cold weather in the first and fourth quarters as I mentioned earlier, as well as very low natural gas price volatility, which persisted throughout the year.  We recorded 2010 EBIT of $49 million, a $2 million increase over 2009.
We have seen a $10 million improvement in year over year commercial activity and OEM expenses in this business have declined 12% or $7 million mainly as a result of lower incentive compensation costs.  Sequent had a strong finish to the year with the cold December weather possibly impacting the asset values in our eastern US and Gulf Coast gas portfolios as pipeline constraints on several eastern pipelines increased the value of firm assets.
As a result, our wholesale services fourth quarter EBIT was $11 million, which is half of what it was in the previous quarter largely as a result of $3 million in mark to market losses during the fourth quarter versus $9 million of mark to market gains in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The mark to market impact in 2010 resulted from changes in forward nimax prices, which impacted storage hedges and changes in forward basis differentials, which impacted transportation hedges.
As we head into 2011 we have $16 million in operating revenues embedded in the store roll out schedule for the year.  This is consistent with our five-year average of about $15 million.  13 million is currently expected to be recognized in the first quarter but as we’ve noted, our withdrawal schedule can change depending on market conditions and changes in gas price.  Moving quickly to our energy investment segment, which is detailed in Slide 9, you can see that our 2010 EBIT of $4 million was down significantly from the $12 million we recorded in 2009.
This is largely due to the sale of AGL Networks in July of this year.  By way of reference, AGL Networks contributed roughly $8 million of EBIT in 2009 versus $3 million in 2010.  We’ll be looking for an increased revenue contribution from Golden Triangle Storage Cavern 1 in 2011 as it came online in September of last year.  Currently we have two BCF under contract and we’re looking to optimize the remaining four BCF as the year progresses.
Total remaining CapEx for this project is approximately $40 million.  Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10.  During 2010 we successfully completed nearly $1.2 billion of refinancing activity including the renewal of our $1 billion senior credit facility that supports our commercial paper program and refinancing of $161 million in credit facilities backing our outstanding revenue bonds.
As a result, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and good access to the capital markets.  In addition to our basic business refinancing activities we successfully established and syndicated a $1.05 billion bridge facility to support the proposed Nicor transaction that will be replaced with long-term debt financing prior to closing the acquisition.  Interest expense for 2010 was up $8 million over the prior year, which was mainly a function of higher average debt balances, which were driven by the issuance of $300 million of long-term debt in August of 2009.
Our capital expenditures for 2010 were up $34 million over the prior year, which primarily reflected the additional spending related Golden Triangle Storage facility, the Strive projects in Georgia and the utility infrastructure programs in New Jersey.  Our base business utility spend was just slightly above our depreciation for the year and of the remaining CapEx nearly 55% was for regulatory infrastructure programs covered under riders where we accelerated recovery of the spend.
For 2011 we expect to deploy about $440 million of capital and a slightly higher percentage of the total will be covered under rider based or similar programs.  I’ll wrap up on Slide 11 with our 2011 guidance.  Our diluted EPS guidance range for 2011 is $3.10-3.20 per share.  And to be clear, this does not include Nicor transaction related costs and also excludes any post merger impact should we close some time in the second half of the year as expected.  The assumptions underlying our guidance are listed here on the slide.  Thanks for your time today and I’ll turn the call over to John.

This is quite an accomplishment and we have our dedicated employees to thank for these results.  AGL Resources continues to be a leader among its LDC peers by many measures including safety, efficiency, low cost of service and stable financial results regardless of economic conditions.
Turning to Slide 12 I will review some of our major operational accomplishments for last year and will then address our priorities for 2011 including an update on the Nicor merger before moving into the Q&A session.  Safety is always the top priority at AGL Resources and we had an outstanding year from this perspective.  For the fourth year in a row we were in the top quartile of the American Gas Association’s occupational safety ratings.
During 2010 we also completed two rate cases, one at Atlanta Gas Light and one at Chattanooga Gas.  The $27 million increase at Atlanta Gas Light marked the first rate increase for the business since 1993.  The new rates have been in effect for about three months now and we’ll continue to see benefits in terms of both financial results and operational improvements for our customers.
Utility rate cases are increasingly complex and require significant amounts of time and energy from our staff.  We have one of the most responsive and experienced regulatory groups in the industry and the fair outcomes achieved in our rate cases are a direct reflection of their work.  We also saw good results at both Salstar and Sequent as Drew mentioned.  Let me go a little deeper on the industry fundamentals that are driving low gas price volatility and impacting our businesses as well as many of our industry peers.
Production is at unprecedented levels primarily as a result of shale gas reserves that have been discovered across the US and advancements of technology to extract gas from these reserves.  Though the EIA reports somewhat increased withdrawals over the last two weeks due to colder than normal temperatures, storage levels remain at relatively high historical levels for this type of year.
If this combination of robust production and high storage inventories persist it likely means continued low volatility and lower margins in terms of optimizing our storage and pipeline assets.  While these factors admittedly present some headwinds, there are also tailwinds on the horizon.  The economy is improving, which should lead to increased customer demand particularly among commercial and industrial customers.  The vast shale gas reserves mean that natural gas prices should stay low for the foreseeable future relative to coal and crude oil, making it more likely that power generation will rely increasingly on natural gas.
When you factor in the environmental benefits of natural gas generation that likelihood is even greater.  And we are starting to look at innovative uses for natural gas such as the LNG for transportation program we have announced in connection with El Paso.  We’re still in the early stages but it’s a potentially exciting opportunity long term.  At our storage business as most of you know, Cavern 1 at Golden Triangle began initial operations on schedule in September of last year and we’ve been serving a 2BCF contract.
We successfully completed dewatering Cavern 1 prior to the end of the year and we are currently removing the gas that we use for the dewatering process.  The facility is operating very well.  The remaining four BCF of space in Cavern 1 will be available prior to April.  This should work well for us from a timing standpoint with April marking the start of the injection season.  Further, though prices for storage are lower than they were when we initiated construction on the project due to many of the supply and demand factors that we’ve discussed earlier, when combined with our existing 2BCF contract our all in blended rate will be higher than prevailing market rates.
Turning to Slide 13 you’ll find our priorities for the year.  Naturally, one of the top priorities will be closing the Nicor transaction and I’ll provide an update on that in just a moment.  We’re often asked about our continuing views on M&A.  This Nicor deal is transformational for AGL Resources, significantly increasing our scale and diversifying both our regulated and non-utility businesses.  So we’ll remain focused on the important work of integrating our companies as we move forward in 2011.
At the distribution business as always, safe, efficient operations is our number one priority.  You’ll see that on our list year in and year out.  We also filed a rate case at Virginia Natural Gas yesterday and will be working to complete that case later in the year.  The main component of our filing is a requested increase of $25 billion with a mitigation plan to phase in the new rates over three years.
Our request brings a portion of the Hampton Roads Crossing facility into rate base and also includes increases in base rates for maintenance and improvements of the distribution system.  You may recall that we spent roughly $150 million to construct Hampton Roads and we have been allowed to capitalize the cost of carry.  But we have not yet rolled VNG customer related portion into the rate base.
Since we have been recognizing the cost of carry, the impact of the rate case is not expected to be material to our earnings.  VNG customers have not seen an increase in their approved base rate since 1996.  Given my earlier words on the natural gas environment, we’ll be looking to pursue responsible growth opportunities at our retail and wholesale businesses.  And as I mentioned, we’ll be looking to contract more Cavern 1 at Golden Triangle as well as to continue the build out of Cavern 2, which is expected to be operational in 2012.
Finally, and this is another one that you’ll always hear from the AGL Resources management team, we’ll be focused on controlling expenses and maintaining capital discipline in each of our business segments.  Before closing I’ll give you a brief update on the Nicor transaction.  AGL Resources and Nicor filed jointly for merger approval with the Illinois Commerce Commission on January 18, 2011 and we are seeking expedited approval by October 1, 2011.
We also filed our S4 registration statement on Friday of last week.  We will keep you posted on timing for our Hart-Scott-Rodino filing as well as shareholder meetings in the coming weeks and months.  From an operational perspective we have already formed a transition team that is chaired by Drew with leadership from senior executives of both companies.  The teams encompass all functions of the company and transition plans are well underway.
We are pleased with our progress to date and remain on track for a second half close.  Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, the natural gas industry is poised for growth as the economy recovers and as we turn more towards clean burning domestic fuels.  With our distribution, retail, wholesale and storage assets, we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends.  Beyond our existing business, 2011 is shaping up to be a transformational year for AGL Resources with the Nicor merger and our continued drive to remain an industry leader.
Again I want to thank our employees for their dedicated and hard work as well as our shareholders and customers for your support of the company.  Thanks for your time today and your interest in AGL Resources.  Operator, I’ll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session.

Good morning everybody.  Maybe if I could start on the guidance, the 3.10-3.20 and understanding that you guys typically don’t delve into the segment details until the annual analyst meeting but you know, there was commentary understandably so about where we are in the gas market, the headwinds if you will with respect to Sequent and the volatility.
By the same token we did have a good December and clearly we had some cold down here in the south in January.  And so I don’t know if there’s maybe more color with respect to the 3.10-3.20 that maybe you could put around Sequent, which does tend to be kind of the more variable part of the equation if we should be thinking that 2011 is going to on the whole look more like 2010 or if the headwinds you were referring to that maybe we’ll see an even more conservative number as far as what’s baked into that guidance.

But as you indicated, what we have seen even though we’ve seen lower volatility and that presents some challenge, we’ve also seen that we’ve been able to position all of our business in a very favorable way.  People talk about the fact that we’re doing more deals that are fixed fee type arrangements and that’s help stabilize our earnings.
As Drew mentioned, we have a $16 million roll out scheduled over a longer time period that’s been slightly less than that.  So we’re starting the year with a good roll out schedule.  If we look how we’re positioned on some of our transportation portfolio compared to just a year ago, that’s favorable.  We view that as favorable.  So we really do see even with the fundamentals and that’s one thing I mentioned earlier.
Even when we see industry fundamentals are a little bit more difficult, because of the way we’ve positioned our business we see stable earnings out of that business.  And so we do see a number pretty much in line with what we’ve traditionally talked to you about, the trajectory for Sequent.  So we don’t expect a materially different number than the type of trajectory we’ve seen in the past because of the way Pete and the team have stabilized that business.  And I’ll turn it over to Pete to add anything else to that.

We have seen significant increases in the power generation demands from gas and the storage and transport portfolio that we have is growing in that area.  We have also seen some growth in our commercial and industrial businesses as well so that has so far planned in ’11 offset some of the headwinds of lower volatility in the business.

We do see that the best approach would be to find parties that are willing to contract for that facility.  And as we’ve talked about, because of the low volatility, high storage levels, high flowing gas, now is not the best time to enter into long-term contracts.  But certainly we’ll consider that.  We’ll consider shorter term contracts but we also have the ability with our own team through services like park and loans and other ways to optimize that asset to make sure that we get the results in 2011 that we have talked about within this guidance range.
So we’ll consider those different opportunities but clearly now given that unique set of circumstances of the shale production, very high storage levels, it is a more challenging time to contract for that.  But our base expectation would be and the good news is we have the time period we’ve talked about between now and April 1, which is a very good time to contract for it.  We have the time to find the right way to move forward on either contracting for that facility or optimizing it under one of these other scenarios.  But the base plan would be to find more contracts for the next 4BCF of capacity.

The same thing we had to do in New Jersey and we were successful in showing we can do that so we’re confident around that.  But Nicor is a very good operator of the facilities so we have to show that quality of service for the customers.  Second thing that’s clearly important not only in Illinois but the other states are jobs.  And so the commitments we made around jobs, there was a strong interest in making sure they understood how we move forward on that.
And the good news from a cost standpoint is Nicor is traditionally and continues to be a very low cost operator.  And they do see the benefits longer term so I think just making sure that they see that we’re going to continue over the long term to be a low cost, prudent operator, I think that’s what’s important.  So I think the good news is it’s been positioned well up front consistent with what they have told us they wanted.

We do have a diverse portfolio into the Midwest and the west as well but the largest transport and storage portfolio that we have is in the east.
And with that cold weather it brought tremendous volatility and we have a lot of optionality in those assets to bring gas to our various customers off of multiple pipelines.  We had the ability to accelerate some storage withdrawals and sell into a higher priced market.  We also had some of our large power generation customers burn significant volumes in December and we served a lot of that volume on a daily as well as intra-day market.  So all of those more extreme volatile conditions allowed our asset position in the east to play quite well into that colder weather.

And that’s very good from our standpoint.  That’s a very good indication but longer term synergies and distribution operations to keep costs lower long term, the opportunities look promising to make sure that we can avoid future rate increases and that our customers will over the long term feel the benefit.
Pete can talk a little bit about how well their wholesale business could fit or does fit with ours, where their expertise is and synergies on back office systems and some of those things.  The synergies between their storage business, which is more depleted aquifer and reservoir background and expertise there and ours is more salt dome but bringing that together and having more opportunities to expand under the right conditions and have different type facilities to expand.
All of that makes sense.  Our retail business is more commodity focused.  Theirs is more focused on other products for retail and customer so that gives us geographic overlay.  The expertise in those different geographies that we think will be beneficial.  And then clearly at the holding company level, those synergies look very much in line.  So the good news is that at this point we’ve done enough work to continue to gain confidence that the types of synergies that we saw up front, that they will be achievable.  And I’ll let Drew or Peter or others add to that.

And we think that in this instance we bought a business at a very nice multiple of cash flow in particular.
The depreciation in these businesses is largely determined by regulatory fiat.  In Illinois they choose a higher depreciation rate, which means a more rapid return of cash flow to the corporation and they had good investment opportunities in their existing rate base and that was the principal driver for the acquisition.  We also felt like the unregulated businesses had really significant parity in the type of businesses that they were in but really core overlap in the services that they provided that I think gives us a lot of opportunity and a good catalyst to begin growing the retail offering again.
But I think those factors are pretty consistent with the rationale that we laid out.  With bonus depreciation and the other regulatory incentives we have to deploy capital in our regulated businesses, we think that this business gives us increased opportunity to invest in the regulated realm and that’s our principal focus.

Starting on slide three of our accompanying presentation, you can see that we reported Q1 2011 of $1.59 per diluted share, or $1.63 per share, excluding costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger we announced in December. On an adjusted basis, these results are down 6% from Q1 2010. The lower year over year earnings are largely reflective of hedge gains realized by Sequent in last year’s Q1, which had the effect of accelerating earnings into that period, and this year we did not have a similar level of accelerated gains. I’ll describe those in more detail in a moment.
The decline in Q1 results, relative to the prior year, also reflects more moderate weathers compared to the prior year. The greatest impact of the moderate weather is in our retail segment, which has the most exposure to temperature fluctuation. We benefitted from strong earnings in the distribution business, which helped to offset these factors, and as a result we are on track to meet our earnings guidance range for the year of $3.10 to $3.20 per share.
You can see the guidance range and our long term EPS and dividend record on slide four of the presentation. Moving on to slide five, you’ll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our stable, consistent results across the business, looking back through to 2006, and underneath that chart is a quarterly look at EBIT which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of our business, with Q1 and Q4 typically being our strongest, due to the heating season.
On the right, note that our distribution business continues to be the largest contributor to EBIT, representing 69% of the total EBIT in Q1 2011. Retail accounted for 20%, wholesale for 10%, and energy investments for the remainder. I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business, on slide six. Primarily as a result of the rate decision and new infrastructure programs at Atlanta Gas Light in Elizabethtown, EBIT was up $5 million or 4% compared to last year.
You may recall that the new rates for Atlanta Gas Light were effective in Q4 2010, and we have infrastructure improvement riders in place for both Georgia and New Jersey. OpEx in the distribution segment increased 4%, and that was mainly driven by higher payroll and benefit cost, associated with hiring new customer service employees, as agreed to in the Atlanta Gas Light rate case.
You can see that our customer count at the end of Q1 was up slightly from this time last year, and across all of our utilities we have focused on minimizing customer attrition over the past few years, and we believe those efforts position us well to take advantage of opportunities to grow our customer base as the economy strengthens over time. Turning to the retail segment, SouthStar, on slide seven, we recorded EBIT of $68 million for Q1 2011, down $6 million from last year.
The decline was mainly the result of warmer weather and lower customer usage and to a much lesser extent, reflected changes in customer mix with more customers moving to fixed price plans. SouthStar’s market share in Georgia is 32% and our customer count for the quarter in the Georgia market was down approximately 2% relative to Q1 2010. This is generally reflective of the more aggressive competition for customers in the Georgia retail market, although if you look at it, our market share and profitability in this business over a longer time horizon, you can clearly see the underlying stability of the business.
You’ll find Q1 2011 results for our wholesale services segment on slide eight. Like other natural gas wholesale marketers, Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility; our diversified approach and ability to capitalize on periods of colder weather in certain regions of the country served us well during the quarter. Commercial activity has been solid of $8 million or over 15% versus Q1 last year. We also have a stronger storage rollout scheduled at the end of the quarter, with $11 million in economic value locked in, compared to $6 million at this point last year.
While Sequent’s EBIT was down $10 million year over year, the decline was due primarily to market to market hedge gains of $22 million in Q1 2010, versus just $1 million of hedge gains through Q1 2011. Hedge gains and losses are largely reflective of changes in IMAC’s natural gas prices, and the impact of these price changes on our hedge positions. Less volatility generally in this case, meant fewer changes in IMAC’s natural gas prices.
You can see the wholesale operating margin component and detail on the chart at the bottom left of your page. The dark blue bar and the green bar represent transportation and storage hedge gains and losses, while the lighter blue bar represents commercial activity and the orange bar shows lower cost at market, or low com adjustments, which have been de minimus over the last several quarters.
Moving to our energy investment segment, which is detailed on slide nine, you can see that Q1 2011 EBIT was $1 million, down from $3 million recorded Q1 2010. This is largely due to the sale of AGL networks in July 2010, and by way of reference, AGL networks contributed roughly $3 million of EBIT Q1 2010. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on slide ten.
In March, we issued $500 million of three year senior notes at an interest rate of five and seven-eighths. The transaction marked the largest fund offering ever completed by AGL and carries the lowest coupon for a 30 year transaction in our history. The interest rate on these notes lowered the weighted average cost of our fixed rate debt to 5.8% from 6%, and the 30 year tenor improved the duration of our fixed rate debt maturities schedule, taking the average tenor from just over nine years to nearly 13 years.
The primary intent of the senior note issue was to refinance the $300 million maturity from January 2011. We did upsize the transaction to $500 million in order to prefund $200 million, or about 20% of the Nicor acquisition financing, and thereby removing the market risk associated with the long dated portion of our financing requirements. We continue to evaluate strategies for other portions of the transaction financing.
Interest expense for Q1 was up $1 million versus last year, driven primarily by higher average long term debt outstanding related to that senior note issuance. In summary, we had a solid quarter to start the year and we remain on track with our $3.10 to $3.20 EPS estimate for the full year, excluding Nicor merger related costs. We continue to look for new opportunities across each of our businesses while ensuring that our culture of rigorous expense management remains in place. Thanks for your time today, and I’ll turn the call over to John.

Since Drew did a thorough job in providing you with the details behind our Q1, I’ll keep it brief today and update you on a few of the major activities we’ve been focused on this year, as well as fundamentals of the natural gas markets.
Turning to slide 11, I’ll start with the Nicor merger process. The most recent development, as most of you know, is that the ICC staff and several interveners filed testimony in the case late last week. The ICC staff recommended denial of the application was filed, which is not without precedent in other merger cases in Illinois.
Staff set forth a number of conditions that could remedy these issues with our application, that we will be reviewing in detail. In accordance with the procedural schedule, we will file our response on or before May 26. Our focus is on ICC approval, but we already managed several important milestones in the transaction approval process. On April 18, we received early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino AntiTrust Improvement Act waiting period from the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission.
As you know, we filed our S-4 registration statement earlier this year, and have filed amendments to the document in the past few weeks. We were notified late last week that the SEC has no further comments, and that our registration statement and joint proxy statement and prospectus have been declared effective. The special shareholders meetings in both companies to approve the merger and share issuance have been set for June 14, 2011. We remain on track to close the transaction in the second half of 2011 as planned.
Our transition committee and integration teams have worked diligently over the past few months to determine how we will operate the combined company going forward, and look forward to sharing more details with you as we get closer to the transaction closing. Turning to slide 12, one of our key objectives in 2011 is working through our rate case with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. We filed a rate case in February, requesting a $25 million increase.
About $15 million of that is for recovery of a significant portion of our investment in the Hampton Roads Crossing Pipeline. We previously had recorded some level of earnings on the project to AFDUC, so the impact of earnings should be negligible to slightly positive. We have not had a rate increase in Virginia since 1996.
Turning briefly to the natural gas market, the fundamentals of the market have not changed materially since our last earnings call. While oil prices globally are sky-rocketing, steady and low natural gas prices are attracting renewed attention from a wide variety of customers. A shift toward increased reliance on natural gas will undoubtedly occur across many sectors of our economy over the coming years.
Specifically today, natural gas prices continue to trade within a narrow range in most areas of the country. The latest storage figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that gas storage for the week ending April 22 was 11% less than the same time last year, while just slightly lower than the five year average. This relative balance shows that while we’ve added significantly more supply in to the system from shale gas producers; demand, largely as a result of the cold winter and continuing very cold spring in the Midwest to Northeast is soaking up this added supply.
Price volatility has the most significant impact on our wholesale storage businesses, wholesale and our storage businesses. As Drew noted, Sequent did quite well during the quarter, finding opportunities where locational spreads widened due to the weather. That business is increasingly flexible and diverse, particularly with a focus on attracting more fee based business opportunities that are not as dependent on market volatility.
This diversity allows us to produce solid results, even in this challenging environment. On the storage front, we continue to make good progress on the second cavern at Golden Triangle Storage. The leaching process is now at 50% complete, and we remain on track to have it in service by March 2012. We are continuing to evaluate possible opportunities for the more BCF of GTS cavern one capacity, that is currently not under contract.
While the market for storage continues to be challenged and reservation rates are at historically low levels, I believe the overall value of natural gas storage remains high and we are firmly committed to our long term storage strategy. Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, slide 13 just serves as a reminder of our priorities for the year. We reviewed these last quarter, so I will not go into great detail, but you recall that based on what we discussed, we’re already making significant progress with the Nicor merger, the B&G rate case, our financing program, and our continuing focus on cost discipline.
With our collection of distribution, retail, wholesale and storage assets, we are well positioned to take advantage of trends that are benefitting the natural gas market; abundant supply, low prices, and clean energy policies signify a long stretch of opportunities ahead. Our management team, comprised of seasoned industry veterans and innovative leaders, is constantly looking for ways to improve and grow our existing businesses at every level, and to create sustainable long term value for our shareholders.
I’d like to point out that our total shareholder return year to date through April 29 is 16%, significantly outpacing the average for the broader natural gas peer group, up 10% on the average on LDC peer group of 80%. On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources, we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of our company. Operator, I’ll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session.

And secondly, we’re just getting into Q2, April is kind of cool this month, and it’s a month of primarily injections, but I can say this; we started out the year with a better storage injection plant, and last year as well, we have three BCF less in the ground at the end of March, but we have a $5 million greater storage rollout schedule.

The improvement in year-over-year earnings is largely reflective of strong performance in our utility business through a combination of reasonable rate case outcomes and infrastructure investment we have made to maintain and enhance the safety and reliability of our system.
For the first six months of the year, we reported diluted GAAP EPS of $1.82 or $1.96 excluding Nicor related expenses, $0.06 higher than the first six months of 2010. We remain on track to meet our earnings guidance range for the year of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. You can see the guidance range on our long-term EPS and dividend track record on Slide 4 of the presentation.
Moving on to Slide 5, you'll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our stable and consistent results across the business, looking back to 2006 and underneath that chart is a quarterly look at EBIT which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of our business.
You'll note that second quarter is not typically a strong earnings quarter for us due to lower heating and cooling demand. On the right, note that our Distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT, representing approximately 69% of total EBIT in the first half of 2011. Retail accounted for 22%, wholesale for 9% and energy investments for the remainder
I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our Distribution business on Slide 6. Primarily as a result of the rate decisions and infrastructure programs at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown, EBIT was up $7 million or 10% compared to last year, mainly due to a $10 million improvement in operating margin. You may recall that the new rates for Atlanta Gas Light were effective in the fourth quarter of 2010 and we have infrastructure improvement riders in place in both Georgia and New Jersey.
Operating expenses in the distribution segment increased just 2% and that was mainly driven by higher payroll and benefit costs associated with hiring new customer service employees, consistent with our commitment we made during the Atlanta Gas Light rate case.
You can see that our average customer count for the second quarter was down just slightly from this time last year, but remains stable. Year-to-date our Distribution business reported EBIT of $217 million, up 6% versus last year. The same major drivers we saw in the quarter also are the factors driving the good performance for the first half of the year and these results put our utility business on track to have a strong year in 2011.
At Virginia Natural Gas we’re in the middle of a rate case, which we expect to be decided sometime during the first half of next year. Consistent with regulation in Virginia, we will put rates into effect on October 1st, subject to refund. The monthly rate increase will average approximately $6 per customer over the course of the year. This is the first rate increase for Virginia Natural Gas customers in 15 years as base rates have not changed there since 1996.
Turning to the retail segment, SouthStar on Slide 7, we recorded EBIT of $1 million for the second quarter of 2011, equal to our results for last year’s second quarter. Due to positive weather variance quarter-over-quarter, we experienced increased margin, but that was offset by the continued competitive environments in Georgia including customer migration toward lower margin plans.
SouthStar’s market share in Georgia is 32%, relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, EBIT at SouthStar is down 8% compared to 2010, due mainly to warmer weather in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2010 and the migration of customers to lower margin pricing plans.
You will find second quarter 2011 results for our Wholesale Services segment on Slide 8. Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility and lower price differentials for storage and transportation, but our diversified approach continued to service well through the first half of the year. We saw modest improvement in commercial activity during the second quarter relative to the prior year period, but the main driver for Sequent’s year-over-year improvement was the fact that we had $8 million in hedge gains during this year’s second quarter associated with hedges on our storage and transportation positions. 
Conversely, last year in the second quarter, we had $8 million of hedge losses, so the $16 million delta was the largest change in Sequent’s second quarter earnings year-over-year. Year-to-date, our wholesale services segment contributed EBIT of $28 million, a $5 million increase over the first half of 2010. Operating margin was higher by $8 million, largely driven by $17 million of higher commercial activity offset by lower hedge gains.
Looking at our current storage rollout schedule at the end of the second quarter, Sequent had $11 million of economic value, which is $14 million below last year at this same time. This reflects the lower volatility and reduced spreads we continue to see in the market, factors that we anticipate will continue to challenge Sequent’s business through the remainder of the year.
However, we expect to partially mitigate these impacts by continuing to grow our asset portfolio, build our fee-based services and maintain our focus on expense control as we support growth in these areas. The lower roll-out schedule also reflects in part the acceleration of value during the first half of this year that would otherwise have been realized later in the year.
Finally, as you think about third quarter results for the wholesale segment, just a reminder that Sequent recorded $30 million in combined transportation and storage hedge gains in the third quarter of 2010. We would not expect to repeat this under normal market conditions.
On Slide 9, you can see that our energy nvestment segment had a slight improvement during the quarter as compared to last year. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. Also, for comparative purposes just keep in mind that we sold our telecommunications business, AGL Networks in July of last year.
In the storage business during the quarter we added new contracts at both Golden Triangle Storage and Jefferson Island Storage & Hub. One of the contracts that GTS signed during the quarter was with Sequent and John will review the rationale behind the transaction with you. You can see here that our blended rate for our 6 Bcf at GTS Cavern 1 is $0.14 and at Jefferson Island it is $0.19. These rates are inclusive of contracts that Sequent has signed with the facility.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. The main thing that I would point out here is that we have made substantial progress toward financing the cash consideration of the Nicor transaction. As we noted in our 10-Q, we are finalizing documentation with various institutional investors for $275 million in funding through the private placement market in five and seven-year tranches, which we expected to take care of the short-duration portion of the curve for our financing activity related to the Nicor merger.
Including the $200 million pre-funding we did early in this year as part of the March senior note series issuance, we have arranged approximately 50% of the expected cash financing necessary for closing. The private placement is a delayed draw and we will not incur interest expense until we move closer to the close of the transaction.
Interest expense was up $6 million for the second quarter and $7 million for the first half of the year versus last year, driven primarily by higher average long-term debt outstanding related to that senior note issuance we issued in March of this year, which is inclusive of the portion to pre-fund the Nicor transaction.
In summary, we had another good performance during the second, we had another much stronger performance during the second quarter and we remain on track with our 3.10 to 3.20 EPS estimate for the full year, excluding Nicor-related merger costs. We continue to look for new opportunities across each of our businesses, while ensuring that our culture of rigorous expense management remains in place.
Thanks for your time today, and I'll turn the call over to John.

Now that we have been through the financial details for the second quarter, let me update you on a few of our other major initiatives, including the Nicor merger approval process which is outlined on Slide 11. With the ex",926,"Thank you, Drew and good morning. Now that we have been through the financial details for the second quarter, let me update you on a few of our other major initiatives, including the Nicor merger approval process which is outlined on Slide 11. With the exception of the Illinois Commerce Commission, we secured all major approvals that we will need to close the Nicor transaction, including shareholder approvals which we received in June.
We continued to make progress towards ICC approval. After several rounds of filed testimony, we participated in evidentiary hearings in Illinois two weeks ago. Our witnesses presented a strong case for merger approval, and we have considerably narrowed the list of issues we need to resolve with the ICC staff. We continue to work for resolution of those issues.
We remain on track for closing the transaction by year end and our integration planning efforts are focused on ensuring we are operationally ready in the event that we are granted expedited approval. As a reminder, we have asked for expedited approval by October 1, but the current Illinois procedural schedule runs through December 16th.
Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved recommendations from Nicor for four new appointees to the AGL Resources' Board of Directors. The nominees are Norman Bobins, Brenda Gaines, Armando Olivera and John Rau and they will join the 12 existing AGL Resources' Board members. Norman, Brenda, Armando and John bring a wealth of experience and diverse backgrounds and we look forward to welcoming them officially when the merger closes.
Turning to Slide 12, you can see our 2011 priorities that we laid out at the beginning of the year. As Drew mentioned, overall we remain on target to meet our guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. The distribution business performed quite well during the first half relative to expectations and we anticipate that this trend will continue through the remainder of the year. Our utilities experienced very little impact from low volatility as they are largely insulated from price fluctuations through riders and weather normalization programs.
The businesses that are impacted more substantially by tight spreads and low volatility are our non-utility businesses. While abundant supply has positive long-term implications for our industry and business, abundant storage combined with historically low spreads creates a challenging environment in the short-term.
At SouthStar, our results year-to-date have fallen slightly below our expectations. We’ve done well (inaudible) a stable customer base and our Georgia market share has been trending mostly upward this year, but we are seeing a continuation of the trend of customers migrating towards lower margin plans. Further impacting that business has been average warmer temperatures and lower volatility.
Sequent has produced strong results today despite a tough environment for wholesale and asset optimization businesses. However, our storage rollout position for the remainder of the year is now lower than it was at this time last year. The positive of this result is that we had strong commercial activity during the first half of the year and affectively monetized many of our positions. The downside is that it also means we have a somewhat weaker position for the remainder of the year assuming low volatility persists. We’ve been diversifying Sequent’s business by focusing on fee-based services, power generation supply and producer services among other initiatives, which should help us mitigate the impacts of low volatility on the business.
Drew mentioned the transaction between Sequent and Golden Triangle Storage and I’ll provide you with a bit more detail. During the second quarter, Sequent executed a 2 Bcf storage agreement with GTS Cavern 1, effective June 1, 2011 for a five-year term. Sequent continues to focus on servicing the core gas-fire generation market as well as expanding its other customer business in Texas. So acquiring well located Texas storage capacity makes sense.
This new GTS storage lease along with Sequent’s other contractual assets in Texas will allow Sequent to continue to grow this business. Further, Sequent adds to the reputable customer portfolio that GTS is cultivating and that it’s an active participant providing gas supply services to the wholesale market. In addition to the Sequent contract, we’ve signed third-party contracts such that GTS Cavern 1 is now fully contracted at a blended rate of approximately $0.14 and that includes the Sequent transaction. Jefferson Island is 93% contracted with an average subscription rate of $0.19 and that also includes an existing contract with Sequent which has been in place since 2007. 
On the construction and development front, we continue to make good progress on the second Cavern at Golden Triangle Storage and remain on track to have it in service in early 2012. The preliminary process for expansion at Jefferson Island is also ongoing, although further capital spending on storage projects will depend on storage market conditions.
As most of you know, third and fourth quarters are always important ones for Sequent, SouthStar and Pivotal. So Pete, Mike, Dana and their teams will be executing on the core business strategies while looking for market opportunities to generate additional economic value.
Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, we’ve had a good start to the year in terms of operating and financial performance. We remain on track with the Nicor merger approval process and we look forward to providing additional updates as they become available. On behalf of our employees at AGL Resources, we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of our Company.

There is an awful lot of transportation contracts that are expiring really throughout the country and Sequent has been very active working with pipelines and securing additional term transportation to diversify our portfolio in really all regions of the country, not just East but in the Midwest and the West as well. So that business is continuing to grow volumetrically and as you stated the margins are definitely tight and spreads through most regions are tight. 
However, we are able to re-contract at much lower values which certainly is in line with those tighter spreads. Your other question related to the fee-based business, that is continuing to grow. We’re seeing significant growth in our producer services group that is working primarily with shale producers, be it in the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and in some of the new shales that we are seeing and we are able to secure production that fits well with our transportation and asset management portfolio there. So that continues to grow in line with what we’ve described in prior meetings and then our gas supply for power generation is also just an anchor for what we are trying to do.
That business is one of our better margin businesses. It does connect very well with the storage positions we take with the asset management transactions that we have in our portfolio and allows us to serve the power plants on the multi-cycle needs and the high service demands that power generators have.

What we attempt to do though is it’s very important to make sure that we pay our employees and reward them and recognize them in the appropriate way. So we do know we’ll have cost increases related to benefits and pay. However, what we try to do is make sure that in all other areas we find efficiencies to do the best job to offset those cost increases and we’ve been fairly successful in that range and I’ll turn it over to Hank for more detail.

And then second question, a peer that has a lot of gas storage capacity had at least on that side a big miss this morning, although the MLP did very well and clearly we’re seeing lower contracted rates at GTS. 
I guess, since the storage build out used to be a couple years ago the longer-term growth driver plan for the business, my big picture question is, what are the longer-term drivers, what are the opportunities looking past the great situation with the Nicor merger? But in terms of organic growth in the business, if gas storage never comes back, are we talking about low turn storage, depleted reservoir? Are we talking about transport fuels? What are we talking about to grow the business longer term?

So, I do expect over time that our full demand charge, portfolio storage and transport to be fairly constant over that time period.

We think that's a very nice balance between contracts we entered into in the past, recent contracts we've entered into, how much capacity Sequent holds and manages, but you are right. If the storage market continues to show the commercial values we're seeing right now, we plan to be very disciplined and only spend what we need to, to keep our opportunities to expand at Jefferson Island and at Golden Triangle well positioned, but not to allocate capital to that until the market improves. 
So what that does mean is that we will have to focus on other growth drivers. The good news is like you've pointed out, we have a good opportunity around the Nicor merger and integration. As Hank pointed out, what we’ve really seen as positive in the utility business is good opportunity to continue to invest. We have invested in infrastructure both from a safety standpoint and reinforcing our system in Atlanta for pressures. Hank pointed out some projects to extend our system. 
We have invested in pipeline projects like HRS. We see opportunities to continue to invest in our regulated business and those take a high, those are a high priority. We also back on storage as you pointed out, another good thing about the Nicor businesses is the projects that they have looked at and or have opportunities around are more in the category of lower turn reservoir storage. And even though the market is depressed now, we see a better opportunity to potentially move some of those projects for us. 
So we'll be very disciplined about that, but that gives us an opportunity as well. As well as Nicor has had success with their retail business around warranty products and some of those things which we very much believe in. So it really is not any one item that will replace if we don’t have investment in storage. It really is a balance between our utility business and these other opportunities that I've talked about, but you are also right about the one last item and I am making this probably too long of an answer, but we do continue to see a trend towards interest in using natural gas for transportation and whether that’s using some of our liquefied natural gas infrastructure to supply on-road and off-road heavy-to-heavy transportation or larger engines, or even a trend towards using more for personal vehicles, it really has shown positive signs, although it’s too early to allocate a lot of our attention and resources and growth plans to that, although it’s something we’re following very closely. 
We think that can be successful, so we’re focused on it, but we’re really looking at those things I mentioned first as the drivers of growth if we don’t have the return to a normal level of volatility that we’ve seen in the past on storage and by the way, we still feel very good when the market is back and balanced. It’s very oversupplied now with storage and flowing gas. We feel there will be an opportunity over the long run to expand Jefferson Island and Golden Triangle.

In fact, two of the three are five-year contracts and one is roughly a two-year contract. I think it may have been some months slightly less than that, but roughly a two-year contract and so the rate you see there really is a balance between rates that we’ve seen over a longer time period because we did not all contract for that recently, but the rates today are lower than that, on average. 
So we would see moving forward if things do not improve that we have downward pressure on those average rates as we re-contract. Now again, we see with a more balanced market the opportunity for us to move back in a positive direction, but today that has not been the case. Essentially what we’ve seen so far this year, even though things aren’t getting lower from the standpoint of the value of storage services, they have leveled out at a low level and they’ve really not shown much improvement, even though we’ve had cold weather this winter and we’ve had some hot weather so far mixed in, in the summer. 
We’ve seen enough gas in storage and enough flowing gas that the volatility has been limited. Pete and Sequent have been able to capture some value on that especially in certain areas where we uniquely hold transportation portfolios, like in upper mid-Atlantic and further up in the East, but it’s been somewhat limited. At Jefferson Island we have a range of contracts there and the terms have been anywhere from one to five years. On average, it’s closer to two-year term right now, two and a half year term. And again that represents contracts that were entered into four, five years ago as well as recent contracts. Again, we’re very happy with that $0.19 rate. If we had to re-contract it all today, it would be at a lower rate.

I would say it’s been a migration since probably 2007-2008. That’s really when it started it was 2008 when the economy turned and consumers started focusing more in the retail sector on value propositions and like I’ve said this occurred in our retail sectors, not just energy or natural gas specifically, so it’s pretty broad.
If you get to percentages, it’s I would say on fixed price plans. Again I probably won’t give you an exact number, I’ll say maybe roughly a third and then if you get to, how do we view that as a business issue for SouthStar? Really what we’re doing is looking at what new products and services we can offer that add value to the consumer that are beyond the fixed price. As an example we just launched a price protection guarantee plan and what it does, it has the advantage of protection of locking in your price if prices go up, but you also get the advantage if prices drop and those kind of price plans have a little better margin than a fixed, but there is also more value for the consumer. 
Again, they get upside protection like a fixed priced plan as well as they get the benefit when prices drop. So, what we’re looking at is how do we create new products, new pricing plans that offer incremental value to the consumer and also provide us more value as well. So I would say at a high level, again it’s been a trend since ’08. The rate is declining. If you look at the rate from ‘09 to ‘10 and now ‘10 to ‘11 that rate is declining year-over-year, so we are seeing that moderate. As I said earlier in the year and again what we’re focused on is how do we provide better services to customers, new products. We're also focused at the call center in terms of how do we have a better experience with the customer and make sure that the CSRs have all the appropriate information to provide the best plan for each customer.

As Mike indicated that the trend has gone in a positive, not a positive direction, but it’s leveled off the migration to those lower margin plans has moderated and in some classes of customers, you see some natural limits of how much you would expect. So there are some natural limits but I think the success we’ve had has also been the addition of these new programs that work very well for our customer, but that still is a risk. Even though we have a good trend, we’ve offered other products and we’ve reached some natural limits in some of the categories of customers. It still was a risk we’re focused on and that’s really one of Mike’s bigger priorities is to keep that stabilized.

There is, we do see though two risks that we’re focused on, and that would be our businesses, both SouthStar’s business and Sequent’s business, and even distribution operations to a very limited extent. If we had a mild start to the winter that can impact those businesses in a way, that’s probably the issue we’ll focus on the most. On the volatility question, that’s a little bit more difficult because as Pete indicated and as Drew indicated, the roll-out schedule is less than it was last year, although if you look historically, it’s not as different as it is compared to last year. 
We had a very strong roll-out scheduled this time than last year and we have the situation that volatility is low, but as Pete indicated he’s been able to get new transportation storage, redo asset management deals with better rates. We have more agreements in place with producers and with power plants that we think can mitigate that. So we think we have a chance in a lower volatility environment to still have good results at Sequent for the year and meet our guidance, but obviously even lower volatility or any other business conditions that would be negative. 
We still have some risk at Sequent in meeting our guidance range. So that was a less precise answer on the second one, but yes, we factored in some, we’re not counting on returning to the type of volatility that we’ve seen on average over the last five years. We certainly could be impacted though if the volatility stays as lower than it is even today.

Starting on slide 3 of our company presentation, you can see that we reported third quarter 2011 earnings loss of $0.04 per diluted share, excluding $5 million of cost incurred during the quarter related to the Ni",1364,"Thanks, Sarah and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3 of our company presentation, you can see that we reported third quarter 2011 earnings loss of $0.04 per diluted share, excluding $5 million of cost incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $0.02. The decline in year-over-year earnings is largely reflective of a significant negative variance in our Wholesale services segment related to lower natural gas price spreads, lower volatility of takeaway capacity constraints in the Marcellus shale production region.
However we continue to see strong performance in our utility business resulting from a combination of reasonable rate case outcomes and infrastructure investments we’ve made to maintain and enhance the safety and reliability of our system. For the first nine months of the year we’ve reported diluted GAAP EPS of $1.78 or $1.98 including Nicor related expenses, $0.21 lower than the first nine months of 2010.
In the press release we issued on October 17th we reduced our 2011 EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3 per share. - from our original guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share and is due to primarily to the degradation of earnings at Sequent. You can see the guidance range in our long term EPS and dividend track record on slide 4 of the presentation.
Moving onto slide five you’ll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment on the top left you can see our results across the business looking back to 2006 and underneath that chart is a quarterly look at EBIT, which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of our business. You’ll note that our wholesale and retail businesses which are more weather dependent tend to have muted earnings in the second and third quarters of the year and that we are heading into our seasonally stronger quarters when we benefit from higher heating demand.
On the right note that our distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT representing approximately 81% of the total positive EBIT contributions in the first nine months of 2011, retail accounted for 18%, energy investments for 1% and you’ll notice the absence of positive EBIT contribution from Sequent year-to-date due to the issue that I just mentioned.
I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on slide six, primarily as a result of rate decisions and infrastructure programs at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas, EBIT was up $15million or 27% compared to last year.
New rates for Atlanta Gas Light were effective in the fourth quarter of 2010 and we have infrastructure improvement riders in place in both Georgia and New Jersey. The combination of these two factors drove the $10 million of operating margin improvement year-over-year.
Operating expenses in the distribution segment decreased by 2% driven mainly by lower incentive compensation approvals. Excluding this issue operating expenses were up $6 million or 5% due to increased depreciation for more assets in service, higher legal expenses, and higher payroll and benefit cost.
You can see that our average customer count for the third quarter was up just slightly from this time last year and remain stable. Year-to-date our distribution business reported EBIT of $287 million up 10% versus last year. The same major drivers we saw in the quarter also are the factors driving good performance for the first nine months of the year and these results for our utility business on track to have a strong year in 2011.
Turning to the retail segment SouthStar on slide seven, we recorded an EBIT loss of $5 million for the third quarter of 2011 up $4 million improvement over our $9 million EBIT loss for last year’s third quarter. Due to reduced transportation and gas cost we experienced increased margins but that was partially offset by the continued competitive environment in Georgia including lower retail price growth.
SouthStar’s market share in Georgia is 32% relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date EBIT at SouthStar is down 3% compared to 2010 due mainly to warmer weather in the first nine months of 2011 versus 2010 and the migration of customers to lower margin price plans.
You’ll find third quarter 2011 results for our wholesale service segment on slide eight. John will provide additional detail on the circumstances surrounding the losses in the quarter, so for now I’ll focus on the financial results in the business.
As expected Sequent continues to face the challenges in lower market volatility and lower price differentials for storage and transportation. This is reflected in our EBIT loss of $37 million, a decline of $52 million compared to third quarter 2010.
The largest component of EBIT decline came from $35 million reduction in commercial activity versus last year giving you a breakdown of commercial activity during the quarter $18 million of the year-over-year decline was related to general poor wholesale market conditions including low price volatility for natural gas and tight transportation and storage.
Transportation spreads between the Gulf Coast and Northeast essentially collapsed for much of the summer significantly hampering our ability to earn margins on gas transportation. Further price differentials between the summer to winter seasons have been driven down in the past few years, do not see near term catalyst that will change these dynamics and we’re working to adapt our business to better weather the circumstances.
We also recognized losses of $15 million related to transportation constraints in the Marcellus Shale region. In addition we took a charge of $2 million related to a customer bankruptcy during the third quarter. We took a similar charge, we took charge for a similar amount in the second quarter and any remaining credit exposure associated with this customer is now fully behind us.
Looking at other factors aside from commercial activity that impacted us during the quarter, as I mentioned in our last earnings call during the third quarter of 2010 we had unusually large storage and transportation hedge gains of $30 million. This compares to $14 million of gains in the third quarter of 2011 translating into $16 million accounting loss year-over-year. We also recorded lower-of-cost-or-market known as LOCOM during the quarter of $9 million compared to $5 million last year resulting in another accounting loss of $4 million more than last year.
Looking briefly at expenses for the quarter they were down $4 million compared to last year due mainly to a reduction in the annual incentive accruals. Year-to-date wholesale services posted an EBIT loss of $9 million, $47 million decrease over the first nine months of 2010, operating margin was lower by $47 million largely driven by the same issues affecting the third quarter with $30 million of the decrease coming from lower hedge gains, higher LOCOM and the remainder due to a transportation constraint in customer credit losses.
Looking to our current storage rollout schedule at the end of the third quarter, Sequent has $6 million of economic value which is equivalent to last year at the same time. From our vantage point today we expect positive EBIT for this segment in the fourth quarter.
Moving onto slide nine, you can see that our energy investments segment had slight improvement during the quarter as compared to last year. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on slide 10. The main thing I want to point out here is that we have effectively completed the financing of the cash consideration of the Nicor transaction. Interest expense for the transaction is better than our expectation but we pre-funded our requirements to reduce our exposure to interest rates. Because of this interest expense was up $4 million for the third quarter and $11 million for the first nine months versus last year.
As a reminder our full year 2011 guidance is now $2.90 to $3 per share excluding Nicor related merger cost. We anticipate providing combined company guidance when we file our 10-K next year and host our fourth quarter and yearend earnings calls.
Thanks for your time today and now I’ll turn the call over to John.

I want to provide some additional context to the information that Drew just reviewed with you related to wholesale services results during the quarter.The fundamentals of the natural gas wholesale business continue to f",1381,"Thank you, Drew and good morning. I want to provide some additional context to the information that Drew just reviewed with you related to wholesale services results during the quarter.
The fundamentals of the natural gas wholesale business continue to face extreme pressure. In most geographic locations in the U.S. the wholesale natural gas industry and Sequent are experiencing continued declining values for pipeline transportation and storage. This fundamental weakening of transportation and storage asset values in the third quarter has been caused by two major factors, third quarter weather dynamics and continued increases in natural gas production.
Starting with third quarter weather, you can see on slide 11 that while there was warmer than usual weather in parts of the country in July and August the primary areas served by Sequent the Northeast and the Midwest experienced cooler temperatures and reduced gas by our power supply relative to 2010.
However Texas and the Mid-Continent experienced record setting temperatures. As a result of this disparity between the Texas region and the Northeast natural gas prices in the producing regions in the Gulf and Mid-Continent increased while prices in the Midwest and Northeast decreased resulting in a negative impact on pipeline transportation values.
Unlike weather which is transitory we continue to see significant increases in shale gas production. U.S. total gas production grew to over 63 billion cubic foot per day in the third quarter with production increasing by almost 5 Bcf per day in the past year, much of this due to the shale gas.
Shale production increases are focused in the Northeast market areas particularly in the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania. Excess gas supply in this region caused severe compression of the price spread differential from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast and significantly eroded third quarter pipeline optimization values.
Such large increases in production coupled with a growing supply of storage capacity have also had a negative impact on storage optimization values. On slide 12 you can see that price differentials between summer to winter seasons have been driven down by approximately 50% in the past few years.
Sequent has about 30 Bcf of storage that is impacted by the change in price spreads over the summer to winter seasons. So a 50% decline in spreads can obviously have a meaningful impact on our business.
Shifting now to the Marcellus constraint issue that we experienced during the third quarter, over the last two years Sequent executed forward purchases of gas supply in the Marcellus, by purchasing gas supply in Pennsylvania and closer to our asset management customer City Gate our view is that Sequent would save money on transportation charges as that is less expensive to transport gas supply from Pennsylvania to the customers than from Texas and Louisiana to those customers.
In securing this forward gas supply Sequent was relying on historical pipeline operations that would allow such gas supply purchases to flow on a secondary basis on the pipeline. These volumes flowed reliably using secondary transportation service until late July at which time Sequent started experiencing curtailments of a portion of secondary transportation due to extreme supply growth in the region.
Curtailments increased as the third quarter progressed and by September the vast majority of secondary flow was curtailed. Sequent and others were relying on this historical secondary flow we’re unable to transport Marcellus gas to market and were forced to either secure a higher price transportation capacity or sell out volumes at lower market prices.
As a result of this issue Sequent experienced losses of $15 million during the third quarter and that includes $7 million associated with re-negotiation - we’re renegotiating certain of its producer agreements. We expect additional losses in the fourth quarter of this year and based on preliminary results we expect the impact in the month of October to be approximately $2 million. Importantly we now have balanced our position with transportation capacity that came online November 1st and expect the impact to further diminish in magnitude going forward.
So what does this all mean for 2012 and beyond? We do expect the low volatility and low spread environment to persist and we’re continuing to modify Sequent’s portfolio accordingly. For example, we are analyzing the fixed cost in the business, reevaluating the types of contracts we pursued going forward and repositioning the company to be successful in a potentially prolong period of reduced volatility.
Assuming that we stay in this low volatility environment for 2012, we may be looking at EBIT for the wholesale segment that is half or potentially a little less than half of our original EBIT projection of $53 million for the business in 2011. There are some possible upside scenarios and we’ll be well positioned if volatility returns to the market sooner than we expect, however at this time we are providing a view that is consistent with the current challenging market conditions in that business.
Moving on to our distribution segment I’ll just reiterate what Drew said in that we are having a very solid year. Our rate cases last year and ongoing infrastructure investment programs are providing support and we have maintained our track record of controlling costs in that business.
Our customer count has remained stable throughout the course of the year and was even up a little under third quarter. At this point we expect to be well ahead of our 2011 EBIT guidance of $374 million for the distribution segment by the time we close out the year.
The only rate case activity on our agenda currently is for Virginia Natural Gas. We filed our rate case in February of this year and consistent with regulations in Virginia, we put rates into effect on October 1st subject to refund. Written testimony has been filed and a hearing is scheduled for this Friday.
As a reminder rate cases typically take 12 to 18 months to prosecute in Virginia. SouthStar is having another good year and is on track to meet full year EBIT in line with our guidance of $97 million. They’ve done a good job managing that business in a very competitive Georgia environment and successfully maintaining a leading market share position. And similar to our distribution business Mike and his team have effectively controlled their costs.
In our storage business we’re still reaching Cavern 2 at Golden Triangle and expect that facility will come on line late in the first quarter of 2012. We initially planned for the facility to have 6 Bcf of working gas capacity. But we’ve extended leaching period and we think we’ll be a little closer to 7 Bcf by the time we begin commercial operation.
We also continue to make permitting progress for expansions at Jefferson Island. Before we conclude today’s call, I want to give you a quick update on the Nicor merger approval process which is outlined on slide 13. With the exception of Illinois Commerce Commission, we have secured all major approvals we need to close the Nicor transaction. At the end of the September, we received a proposed order from the Administrative Law Judge hearing the case in Illinois.
He accepted all of the issues we previously settled with the staff and ruled in a balanced way on the outstanding issues allowing us to move forward. We have been placed on today’s Illinois Commerce Commission Agenda for discussion and a possible look. However, the statutory deadline for decision remains December 16. If we receive approval from the commission we will be prepared to close within 7 to 10 days.
Wrapping up our prepared remarks today that we experienced challenges in our wholesales services business during the third quarter. Our distribution business performed particularly well. SouthStar is on track for another good year and we continue to make progress on our storage assets.
2012 will be a transformational year for us we integrate Nicor’s businesses and welcome their employees and shareholders. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter as we wrap up the year and provide our outlook for the combined company. On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources, we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest and support of our company.
Operator, I’ll now turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session.

The issue that we faced as we’ve laid out the result in the quarter of $15 million was broken up into several pieces. A part of that was simply the higher cost to move gas out of the region for the quarter or the lower prices that we sold the gas for in that time period. That was the largest piece of the 15, but 7 of the 15 was really rebalancing our portfolio, so we did not have a mismatch between our obligations to take gas and our ability to transport the gas out on a firm basis. So that helped balance our position.
Further we entered into pipeline transformation that went online November 1st which helps to balance our position. So we are now not in a position where we need to settle and rebalance this and we’re in a position where we have the pipeline transportation to move gas out. So the challenge we face moving forward and it’s much diminished from what we’ve faced in this time period even in the October time period is that we have pipeline transportation firm capacity with a cost that will need to move these volumes and capture our margin on that. We expect that will be able to largely cover the cost of that transportation moving forward. But that is the remaining issue that we face.

But at this time even though that process has moved slowly it’s also moved in a positive direction we still feel good about our ability to get those permits.
I think that the issue that we’re dealing with is given the situation I laid out in the prepared text with the fact that new capacities come online and so much shale gas and other gas is available, we’ve seen low enough spreads and values for storage that we’re going to be disciplined. So it is possible that when we get those permits next year that the environment will say it’s time to immediately move to construction and it’s very possible as well that we’ll say we want to wait and evaluate the market for this.
So, the timing issue is probably more making sure that we move forward when the commercial value support those expansions saying that these are very good expansions and very liquid locations. So we do think we have a better chance for this to match up and for commercial values to come back in this location there at Henry Hub. So we’re still optimistic about it, but at this point we’re going to be very disciplined about that.

Starting on Slide 3 of our company presentation, you can see that we reported third quarter 2011 earnings loss of $0.04 per diluted share, excluding $5 million of cost incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $0.02. 
The decline in year-over-year earnings is largely reflective of a significant negative variance in our wholesale services segment related to lower natural gas price spreads, lower volatility of takeaway capacity constraints in the Marcellus shale production region.
However we continue to see strong performance in our utility business resulting from a combination of reasonable rate case outcomes and infrastructure investments we’ve made to maintain and enhance the safety and reliability of our system. 
For the first nine months of the year, we reported diluted GAAP EPS of $1.78 or $1.98, including Nicor-related expenses, $0.21 lower than the first 9 months of 2010.
In the press release we issued on October 17th, we reduced our 2011 EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3 per share. This is down from our original guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share and is due primarily to the degradation of earnings at Sequent. You can see the guidance range in our long term EPS and dividend track record on Slide 4 of the presentation.
Moving onto Slide 5, you’ll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our results across the business looking back to 2006. And underneath that chart is a quarterly look at EBIT, which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of our business. You’ll note that our wholesale and retail businesses, which are more weather dependent tend to have muted earnings in the second and third quarters of the year, and that we're heading into our seasonally stronger quarters when we benefit from higher heating demand.
On the right, note that our distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT representing approximately 81% of the total positive EBIT contributions in the first 9 months of 2011. Retail accounted for 18%, energy investments for 1%. And you’ll notice the absence of positive EBIT contribution from Sequent year-to-date due to the issue that I just mentioned.
I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. Primarily as a result of rate decisions and infrastructure programs at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas, EBIT was up $15million or 27% compared to last year.
New rates for Atlanta Gas Light were effective in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we have infrastructure improvement riders in place in both Georgia and New Jersey. The combination of these 2 factors drove the $10 million of operating margin improvement year-over-year.
Operating expenses in the distribution segment decreased by 2% driven mainly by lower incentive compensation accruals. Excluding this issue, operating expenses were up $6 million or 5% due to increased depreciation for more assets in service, higher legal expenses and higher payroll and benefit cost.
You can see that our average customer count for the third quarter was up just slightly from this time last year and remains stable. Year-to-date, our distribution business reported EBIT of $287 million, up 10% versus last year. The same major drivers we saw in the quarter also are the factors driving good performance for the first 9 months of the year, and these results put our utility business on track to have a very strong year in 2011.
Turning to the retail segment. SouthStar on Slide 7. We recorded an EBIT loss at $5 million for the third quarter of 2011, up $4 million improvement over our $9 million EBIT loss for last year’s third quarter. Due to reduced transportation and gas cost, we experienced increased margins, but that was partially offset by the continued competitive environment in Georgia, including lower retail price spreads.
SouthStar’s market share in Georgia is 32%, relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, EBIT at SouthStar is down 3% compared to 2010 due mainly to warmer weather in the first 9 months of 2011 versus 2010 and the migration of customers to lower margin price plans.
You’ll find third quarter 2011 results for our wholesale service segment on Slide 8. John will provide additional detail on the circumstances surrounding the losses in the quarter, so for now, I’ll focus on the financial results in the business.
As expected, Sequent continues to face the challenges in lower market volatility and lower price differentials for storage and transportation. This is reflected in our EBIT loss of $37 million, a decline of $52 million compared to third quarter 2010.
The largest component of EBIT decline came from a $35 million reduction in commercial activity versus last year, giving you a breakdown of commercial activity during the quarter. $18 million of the year-over-year decline was related to general poor wholesale market conditions, including low price volatility for natural gas and tight transportation storage spread.
Transportation spreads between the Gulf Coast and northeast essentially collapsed for much of the summer, significantly hampering our ability to earn margins on gas transportation. Further price differentials between the summer to winter seasons have been driven down in the past few years. We do not see near-term catalyst that will change these dynamics, and we’re working to adapt our business to better weather the circumstances.
We also recognized losses of $15 million related to transportation constraints in the Marcellus Shale region. In addition, we took a charge of $2 million related to a customer bankruptcy during the third quarter. We took a similar charge -- we took a charge for a similar amount in the second quarter and any remaining credit exposure associated with this customer is now fully behind us.
Looking at other factors aside from commercial activity that impacted us during the quarter. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, during the third quarter of 2010, we had unusually large storage and transportation hedge gains of $30 million. This compares to $14 million of gains in the third quarter of 2011 translating into a $16 million accounting loss year-over-year. 
We also recorded lower of cost or market, known as LOCOM, during the quarter of $9 million compared to $5 million last year resulting in another accounting loss of $4 million more than last year.
Looking briefly at expenses for the quarter, they were down $4 million compared to last year, due mainly to a reduction in annual incentive accruals. Year-to-date wholesale services posted an EBIT loss of $9 million, a $47 million decrease over the first 9 months of 2010. Operating margin was lower by $47 million largely driven by the same issues affecting the third quarter with $30 million of the decrease coming from lower hedge gains, higher LOCOM and the remainder due to a transportation constraint in customer credit losses.
Looking to our current storage rollout schedule at the end of the third quarter, Sequent has $6 million of economic value, which is equivalent to last year at the same time. From our vantage point today, we expect positive EBIT for this segment in the fourth quarter.
Moving onto Slide 9, you can see that our energy investments segment had slight improvement during the quarter as compared to last year. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage, which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year.
Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. The main thing I want to point out here is that we have effectively completed the financing for cash consideration of the Nicor transaction. Interest expense for the transaction is better than our expectation but we prefunded our requirements to reduce our exposure to interest rates. Because of this, interest expense was up $4 million for the third quarter and $11 million for the first 9 months of last year -- versus last year.
As a reminder, our full year 2011 guidance is now $2.90 to $3 per share, excluding Nicor-related merger cost. We anticipate providing combined company guidance when we file our 10-K next year and host our fourth quarter and year end earnings calls.
Thanks for your time today, and now I’ll turn the call over to John."

I want to provide some additional context to the information that Drew just reviewed with you related to our wholesale services results during the quarter.The fundamentals of the natural gas wholesale business continue",1383,"Thank you, Drew, and good morning. I want to provide some additional context to the information that Drew just reviewed with you related to our wholesale services results during the quarter.
The fundamentals of the natural gas wholesale business continue to face extreme pressure. In most geographic locations in the U.S., the wholesale natural gas industry and Sequent are experiencing continued declining values for pipeline transportation and storage. This fundamental weakening of transportation and storage asset values in the third quarter has been caused by 2 major factors: third quarter weather dynamics and continued increases in natural gas production.
Starting with third quarter weather, you can see on Slide 11 that while there was warmer than usual weather in parts of the country in July and August, the primary areas served by Sequent, the northeast and the midwest experienced cooler temperatures and reduced gas-fired power supply relative to 2010.
However, Texas and the mid-continent experienced record setting temperatures. As a result of this disparity between the Texas region and the northeast, natural gas prices in the producing regions in the Gulf and mid-continent increased, while prices in the midwest and northeast decreased, resulting in a negative impact on pipeline transportation values.
Unlike weather which is transitory, we continue to see significant increases in shale gas production. U.S. total gas production grew to over 63 billion cubic foot per day in the third quarter with production increasing by almost 5 Bcf per day in the past year, much of this due to the shale gas.
Shale production increases are focused in the northeast market areas, particularly in the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania. Excess gas supply in this region caused severe compression of the price spread differential from the Gulf Coast to the northeast and significantly eroded third quarter pipeline optimization values.
Such large increases in production, coupled with a growing supply of storage capacity, have also had a negative impact on storage optimization values. On Slide 12, you can see that price differentials between summer to winter seasons have been driven down by approximately 50% in the past few years.
Sequent has about 30 Bcf of storage that is impacted by the change in price spreads over the summer to winter seasons. So a 50% decline in spreads can obviously have a meaningful impact on our business.
Shifting now to the Marcellus constraint issue that we experienced during the third quarter, over the last 2 years, Sequent executed forward purchases of gas supply in the Marcellus. By purchasing gas supply in Pennsylvania and closer to our asset management customer, city gates, our view is that Sequent would save money on transportation charges as it is less expensive to transport gas supply from Pennsylvania to the customers than from Texas and Louisiana to those customers.
In securing this forward gas supply, Sequent was relying on historical pipeline operations that would allow such gas supply purchases to flow on a secondary basis on the pipeline. These volumes flowed reliably using secondary transportation service until late July at which time Sequent started experiencing curtailments of a portion of secondary transportation due to extreme supply growth in the region.
Curtailments increased as the third quarter progressed. And by September, the vast majority of secondary flow was curtailed. Sequent and others relying on this historical secondary flow were unable to transport Marcellus gas to market and were forced to either secure higher price transportation capacity or sell out volumes at lower market prices.
As a result of this issue, Sequent experienced losses of $15 million during the third quarter, and that includes $7 million associated with renegotiation -- we’re renegotiating certain of its producer agreements. 
We expect additional losses in the fourth quarter of this year. And based on preliminary results, we expect the impact in the month of October to be approximately $2 million. Importantly, we now have balanced our position with transportation capacity that came online November 1st and expect the impact to further diminish in magnitude going forward.
So what does this all mean for 2012 and beyond? We do expect the low volatility and low spread environment to persist. And we are continuing to modify Sequent’s portfolio accordingly. For example, we are analyzing the fixed cost in the business, reevaluating the types of contracts we pursued going forward and repositioning the company to be successful in a potentially prolonged period of reduced volatility. Assuming that we stay in this low volatility environment for 2012, we may be looking at EBIT for the wholesale segment that is half or potentially a little less than half of our original EBIT projection of $53 million for the business in 2011. There are some possible upside scenarios, and we will be well positioned if volatility returns to the market sooner than we expect. However at this time, we are providing a view that is consistent with the current challenging market conditions in that business.
Moving on to our distribution segment. I’ll just reiterate what Drew said in that we are having a very solid year. Our rate cases last year and ongoing infrastructure investment programs are providing support, and we have maintained our track record of controlling costs in that business.
Our customer count has remained stable throughout the course of the year and was even up a little in the third quarter. At this point, we expect to be well ahead of our 2011 EBIT guidance of $374 million for the distribution segment by the time we close out the year.
The only rate case activity on our agenda currently is for Virginia Natural Gas. We filed our rate case in February of this year and consistent with regulations in Virginia, we put rates into effect on October 1st, subject to refund. Written testimony has been filed and a hearing is scheduled for this Friday. As a reminder, rate cases typically take 12 to 18 months to prosecute in Virginia. 
SouthStar is having another good year and is on track to meet full year EBIT in line with our guidance of $97 million. They’ve done a good job managing that business in a very competitive Georgia environment and successfully maintaining a leading market share position. And similar to our distribution business, Mike and his team have effectively controlled their costs.
In our storage business, we are still reaching Cavern 2 at Golden Triangle and expect that, that facility will come on line late in the first quarter of 2012. We initially planned for the facility to have 6 Bcf of working gas capacity. But we’ve extended leaching period, and we think we’ll be a little closer to 7 Bcf by the time we begin commercial operation. We also continue to make permitting progress for expansions at Jefferson Island. 
Before we conclude today’s call, I want to give you a quick update on the Nicor merger approval process, which is outlined on Slide 13. With the exception of Illinois Commerce Commission, we have secured all major approvals we need to close the Nicor transaction. At the end of September, we received a proposed order from the administrative law judge hearing the case in Illinois. He accepted all of the issues we previously settled with the staff and ruled in a balanced way on the outstanding issues allowing us to move forward. 
We have been placed on today’s Illinois Commerce Commission agenda for discussion and a possible vote. However, the statutory deadline for decision remains December 16. If we receive approval from the commission, we will be prepared to close within 7 to 10 days.
Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, though we experienced challenges in our wholesales services business during the third quarter, our distribution business performed particularly well. SouthStar is on track for another good year, and we continue to make progress on our storage assets.
2012 will be a transformational year for us as we integrate Nicor’s businesses and welcome their employees and shareholders. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter as we wrap up the year and provide our outlook for the combined company. 
On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources, we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest and support of our company.

The issue that we faced as we’ve laid out the result in the quarter of $15 million was broken up into several pieces. A part of that was simply the higher cost to move gas out of the region for the quarter or the lower prices that we sold the gas for in that time period. That was the largest piece of the 15, but 7 of the 15 was really rebalancing our portfolio, so we did not have a mismatch between our obligations to take gas and our ability to transport the gas out on a firm basis. So that helped balance our position. Further, we entered into pipeline transformation that went online November 1, which helps to balance our position. So we're now not in a position where we need to settle and rebalance this, and we’re in a position where we have the pipeline transportation to move gas out. So the challenge we face moving forward, and it’s much diminished from what we’ve faced in this time period even in the October time period, is that we have pipeline transportation firm capacity with a cost that we'll need to move these volumes and capture margin on that. And we expect that we'll be able to largely cover the cost of that transportation moving forward, but that is the remaining issue that we face."

So in total, we like that balance in this difficult environment. We think we’re getting the benefits. We still see that we'll be accretive moving forward, but clearly, we're impacted in the short term with the fact that those 3 businesses, the interchange business, the Sequent business and Tropical Shipping are impacted by the environment each of those businesses face. And I’ll let Drew add to that."

So I think generally, we’re still comfortable on the variances kind of fall within the margin of error in the pennies category when we think about the total combined enterprise."

They had approved everything that you had negotiated with the caveat that you think that new Nicor business stopped selling that ComfortGuard service, which had been somewhat of a controversial product. And I’m wondering, you’re obviously talking about probably on the accretion side, you’re still expecting those results. Maybe it’s -- the timeline is pushing back. Does that incorporating lost revenue that you might lose if you can’t sell those products anymore on the nonregulated side there?"

It includes services deep into the home like warranty of appliance. It’s also in other states. And what we’re losing is the ability to increase the customer count under line guard, and we don’t really expect a large deep attrition rate against that product in general. And so what it hampers is our ability to grow that base. We’re really going to focus that business in other jurisdictions and try to find a good way to modulate around the ruling from the or the opinion of the ALJ. We’ll see how it actually comes out and affect when the ICC completes its deliberations today around the, I guess their next opportunity would be that 8. But it’s a material factor in the way that, that business operates, in some regard, but it’s not unanticipated. And I think what we saw was consistent with what our expectation was, which is that we’re going to have to make some modifications the way that products delivered in that market."

But on that one issue, you're right that is a negative.

But at this time even though that process has moved slowly, it’s also moved in a positive direction. We still feel good about our ability to get those permits. I think that the issue that we’re dealing with is given the situation I laid out in the prepared text with the fact that new capacities come online and so much shale gas and other gas is available, we’ve seen low enough spreads and values for storage that we’re going to be disciplined. So it is possible that when we get those permits next year that the environment will say, it’s time to immediately move to construction and it’s very possible as well that we’ll say we want to wait and evaluate the market for this. So, the timing issue is probably more making sure that we move forward when the commercial value support those expansions. I'm saying that these are very good expansions, they're very liquid locations. So we do think we have a better chance for this to match up and for commercial values to come back in this location there at Henry Hub. So we’re still optimistic about it, but at this point we’re going to be very disciplined about that."
