Continuing the trend of recent quarters, NetApp generated very strong business results in Q3, driven primarily by our successful the product launch in November. Total revenue grew by 25% and product revenue grew b",965,"Thanks, Tara. Good afternoon, everyone. Continuing the trend of recent quarters, NetApp generated very strong business results in Q3, driven primarily by our successful the product launch in November. 
Total revenue grew by 25% and product revenue grew by 32% year-over-year. Our total non-GAAP gross margins remain quite strong at 65.5%, demonstrating the competitive strength of our products and non-GAAP operating margins continued new record highs. 
Non-GAAP net income grew 46% year-over-year and made a large contribution to free cash flow, which registered a robust 33% of revenue. This quarter, we experienced the fastest uptick of the new product line in our history. Customers converted over to the new FAS3200 platform at a far faster rate than we have projected, significantly exceeding our expectations for the mix between the new and the previous FAS3000 product line. As a result, we are experiencing some material constraints, which we believe delayed shipment of approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue. 
We have increased our forecast with suppliers several times over the past few months and we are managing the situation closely. Given the steep ramp in demand, certain materials may remain supply constrained in Q4. Despite this operational challenge, product revenue growth was still above 30%. 
We're very pleased with our overall growth margins, which ended up slightly stronger than expected. Non-GAAP product gross margin behaved as we anticipated, finishing just slightly above 60%. The timing of cost reduction and price reduction that we discussed last quarter is now back in balance. Non-GAAP service gross margins finished about one percentage point stronger than anticipated as support renewals were a bit higher than expected. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% sequentially from Q2 as lower marketing and administrative expenses partially offset the salaries associated with increased headcount and increased variable compensation. We added 415 net new people in Q3 and expect to continue hiring, primarily sales and engineering resources, at slightly higher levels this next quarter. 
Cash generation was another highlight this quarter. Despite a slight increase in accounts receivable, DSOs, our strong net profit, combined with a large uptick in the growth of deferred revenue on the balance sheet is a $364 million in cash from operations and $297 million in free cash flow. 
As I mentioned earlier, free cash flow finished at a very solid 23% of revenue. This was the primary contributor to the $374 million sequential increase in our cash and investments balance. Cash and investments now stand at $4.8 billion. 
Our diluted share count increased 14.5 million shares sequentially to 406 million shares, roughly in line with what we have projected on last quarter's earnings call. The increase was driven primarily by the impact of a higher average quarterly stock price and the accounting for our convertible notes and warrants. 
With an average closing price of $54.77 in Q3, approximately 4.5 million additional shares are included in the dilutive share count to account for the impact of the notes and another 5.5 million additional shares were added to account for the warrant sold as part of the original transaction. You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged while the warrants were not hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedge, then the non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.02 higher. You will find a table on the website which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices. 
Looking forward, our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.38 billion plus or minus 2%, which implies approximately 7% to 11% sequential growth and 15% to 20% year-over-year growth. The current uncertainty regarding our materials constraints has been reflected in this guidance. 
Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to moderate in Q4 to a range around 65%. We anticipate that non-GAAP operating margins will be in the range around 18.2%. Diluted share count will likely continue to be significantly impacted by the accounting for convertible notes and warrants. We expect the dilutive share count to be roughly 414 million shares in Q4, which includes 18 million shares from the convertible debt and 12 million shares from the warrant. 
Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset, bringing our earnings per share estimates to approximately $0.49 to $0.53 per share. Since we cannot accurately predict what the average stock price will be for the full quarter, the dilutive share count was calculated using the $58.22 average share price from the first 10 business days of this quarter. 
If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible bond hedge, that would add $0.02 to the EPS guidance. Despite the renewal of the federal R&D tax credit, our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to remain at 16.3% in Q4, primarily due to a greater concentration of profits in our U.S. geography. 
While on this topic of future guidance, I wanted to make sure that you are aware that consistent with our SEC disclosures, NetApp is required to adopt the new additional accounting standard for revenue recognition for FY12. We will adopt in either Q4 FY11 or Q1 FY12 depending upon the timing of our implementation of systems, tools and processes. Irrespective of the timing, we do not expect any fundamental changes to our business model as a result of this adoption. 
To summarize, we are pleased with the strong demand for our products. We continue to demonstrate compelling differentiation in the market and our competitive position is as strong as it is ever been, evidenced by the continued strength in our gross margins. We will continue to prudently invest in growing our business while at the same time generating strong free cash flow. 
At this point, I will turn the call over to Tom for his perspective. Tom?"

I remain pleased with our financial results and our continued momentum in the marketplace. 
As data centers moved towards a shared virtualized infrastructure, NetApp's innovation leadership is enabling compelling business outcomes for our customers and is propelling our growth. Our recent product announcements further enhance our competitive position and led to the fastest uptick of new platforms in our company's history. 
Unfortunately, after solid execution by marketing sales and engineering, we significantly exceeded our forecast and sold out of the new products. While disappointing in the near term, we remain optimistic as demand is very strong, our margins are evidenced of our competitive strength and we continue to generate significant amounts of cash while simultaneously investing aggressively. 
For the last year, we've been using a two-year compare metric to measure our progress, both internally and externally. These are comparisons to the same quarter two years ago to reduce the overstatement of growth due to the weak quarterly compares posted Monday. We believe it gives a more accurate depiction of true momentum in the market. 
While likely the last time that we will use this metric, the gap between our growth rate and that of the Storage business are of the nearest of the four largest competitors is nearly 30%, the greatest separation we've seen since we have started doing this analysis. This is also inclusive of all of their acquisitions in the intervening periods. 
The result is that NetApp has gained more market share in this interval than at anytime in our history. 
Last month, NetApp was honored to be made number of five on Fortune Magazine's 2011 list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. We improved two positions from last year and was our third consecutive year at the top 10. It is a tribute to the NetApp culture and the commitment of the total NetApp team. 
While the recognition is satisfying, our objective is very pragmatic. NetApp has always stressed that our culture is a long-term strategic advantage, and this process enables to measure ourselves against the very best and identify opportunities for improvement. Our belief is that if the employees are happy, they will demonstrate maximum commitment. And if our employees are happy, our customers can tell. 
A few comments that are more awarding than when a customer says, it simply feels different doing business with NetApp. Our recent product launch further strengthened our position as the platform of choice for the next-generation IT infrastructure. 
IT departments today face tremendous pressure to decrease costs while at the same time increasing their enablement of business objectives. As a result, they are changing how they are architecting their infrastructure in order to achieve greater possibility and efficiency. This means moving away from application-specific hardware silos to a shared infrastructure enabled by server virtualization which can run many applications at once. 
NetApp has been a clear innovation leader in virtualized environments, producing solutions at a far more efficient, flexible, automated and secure, all with far less complexity at a smaller footprint than those of the competition. The announcements we recently made extend our capabilities in each of these dimensions, and we see nothing from our competition today that comes close to providing a storage efficiency and cost savings that we bring to IT infrastructures of the future. 
In addition to products, the diversification of our channels has been a key driver to our growth and an essential part of our strategy. At this point, our channel diversification and channel relationships are the best they have ever been and among the best of any IT company. 
Revenue from our distribution partners, Arrow and Avnet, was up 34% year-over-year and our OEM partners, Fujitsu and IBM, are both expanding with IBM growing double digits year-over-year to a new record. Our newer channel initiatives around service providers and systems integrators continue to broaden our reach as evidenced by the Accenture announcement we made this week. 
An additional element of our strategy has been to deepen our technology integration in our go-to-market activities with other best-of-breed innovators in the industry. We certainly see the major server vendors well for turnkey solutions, including services, the proprietary hardware staff and support. 
Our approach is to partner with other industry leaders to create more highly integrated, technologically superior offerings with a common support infrastructure and enabled by systems integrators and channel partners. 
Publicly announced solutions, include our secure multi-tenancy and FlexPod offerings in partnership with Cisco and VMware. We are also a tough tier provider in the Microsoft, private program. And we have numerous solution offerings with our OEM partners. Our recent announcements at Accenture will further enable those offerings. 
Looking at our business from a geographical breakdown, results of EMEA and U.S. Public Sector are notable. U.S. Public Sector grew 8% after nearly 60% growth last quarter, and EMEA grew 35% after only growing about 15% last quarter. 
In the case of EMEA, despite macro headwinds in certain countries, our own execution in Q2 could've been better. And we made good progress this quarter. Nonetheless, the big variation in quarterly performance of these geos is overstated due to timing of certain large shipments rather than any sudden major shift positive or negative momentum. Averaging the last two quarters will be more indicative of our performance. 
APAC and the Americas excluding the U.S. public sector, were both solid. As NetApp went through the economic downturn, we made many hard decisions to reprioritize our product lines, seizing some activities and investing more heavily others. And those are hard choices have yielded the outcomes you are seeing today. 
We've continued to invest heavily over the past nine to 12 months while making similar prioritization choices and those investments position us well for the future. Despite any number of intermediate term macroeconomic concerns, as long as we continue to gain share and outgrow the market, we intend to continue to spend aggressively to make the most of our opportunity. 
We are clearly winning in the market more broadly than we ever have in the past, and we tend to take maximum advantage of this competitive positions we have created. Should our revenue growth and gross markets remain robust, operating margins will remain above our historic levels. 
In closing, I would like to sincerely thank the nearly 10,000 employees of NetApp and all of our partners and customers for their dedication and support. The team executed the largest product launch in our history and at the same time grew product revenue 32% over a strong compare last year. Our market share gains or evidence and our competitive position has never been more distinct. 
We look forward to spending time with you at our Product Focused Analyst Day on both March to help you gain a deeper understanding of our value proposition and the skill for our competitive differentiation. At this point, I'll open up the floor to questions I remind you to please limit yourself to one so we may address as many folks as possible during our allotted time. Operator?"

And actually more particular than that is on the perspective, I mean we introduced products before but this one actually has 4x the take-up rate of any of our previous products. So clearly, the ramp is pretty steep. And the other thing that's a little bit different about the 3,000 family here is they also have the thing called the iO expansion module which allows you to put more connectivity in. And the demand for that was much higher than we forecasted as well, in fact that is a limiting factor. And probably in retrospect, the lesson learned here is that people are looking to build with a higher performance that we introduced they are looking to build bigger systems. And the other thing is that those slots away the flash cards go in including the demand for our flash cards are very, very high. In fact the attach rate of flash on these cost of machines are actually 10 points higher than they were in the previous flash. So in terms of constraints, it's primarily in the I/O expansion module, certain semiconductor components along the way. But at the end of the day, demand is really strong so it's kind of a bright side at the end of this. But nonetheless, it's primarily and particularly in that dimension, I wouldn't call any individual part, but the simple fact that of the matter is we ended up shipping thousands of these units so we ended up 4x of the demand that we expected. As we go into the next quarter, our guidance currently reflect the fact that we've not resolved these problems yet. We're working on them. We think we have approach that will resolve them but it did cause us to take some consideration here with respect to whether or not we get all the parts of whatever the case. We also can't estimate the mix correctly. We want to make sure that if there was a huge mix shift that one way or the other, more modules. For instance, higher OEM models, we can handle that. So the bottom line here is a we tended to be a little more conservative with our guidance because we have not solved all of the mix and the materials."

So if I look at the market share at least the way we calculated in the markets that we participated is for all of our momentum,",563,"Well, I guess, first to start before we think about that is when you think about just where we are with our existing business. So if I look at the market share at least the way we calculated in the markets that we participated is for all of our momentum, for all of our momentum, we're still 15% or so markets share. So I think still think that's plenty of opportunities of the $15 billion market which I believe going at 70% rate per year, that's a pretty big opportunity. We're number one and number two in market share and probably four out of the 20 largest deals, including our awareness that we need to be better than where it is today. So those also like dodging tasks but what it tells me first and foremost is that A, that there is no limit to our ability to double our business just in the business we are in. And second, the fact that we gained two points of market share as I mentioned. It's just in the last 12 months tells me that market share is been able in this segment. So first and foremost, I think our fundamental core business is very, very healthy and our aspirations double the size of our business right in the stage but we are in. When I think about acquisitions, there's really two components that I think about. Number one is the use to be affinity. Affinity meaning something that our salesforce can sell or something that by virtue of having enough portfolio we can more of our existing products. I think if there's one thing that this industry has shown is that buying up of similar assets with no leverage and no affinity, you don't yield any shareholder value. And I think it's a pretty high profile cases in this market, a very, very good assets that are not great stocks. The other thing that is key to our strategy as well is that we don't want a lot of overlap. We don't want to pursue a part that gave us marginal incremental market but that substantial overlap with what we do and spending the next few years our core team and this new product basically spending money replicating each other's features and basically building what is heart of everything. So at the end of the day, I think the affinity and the lack of overlap our cities that are key to us. So certainly if you think about Data Domain in our past, data domain was a product. It was targeted at our target market, including affinity and it didn't have overlap. On the other hand, I think there was some other properties that change hands recently that have tremendous overlap with what we are doing. And therefore, we were not interested. That's how we see it but right now, I feel no pressure for acquisitions to generate near-term growth nor do I believe that our current market. But that said, I do believe that there are adjacencies that are very, very attractive that I think are high growth and I think part of our active strategy going forward. So I expect that we will be acquisitive but I feel no pressure to do it in the near-term. And likewise, I certainly don't want to signal any lack of conviction about our core business."

How we move that business moves a lot, the product has been very, very strong. And the other big mover or the entry-level products is actually for public sector. And while the Public Sector business, shipments don't look that impressive. That business is actually quite healthy for us. And I think we also reflect the Midrange business as well, it may have brought a little bit of demand particularly from the larger of the smaller machines into a more modern unit.

And the other thing about the 7.5% is that 7.5% will be an average but we'll probably never see another 7.5% here. You'll see 3s and 15s as we go forward, so it will be very lumpy.

You'll see 3s and 15s as we go forward, so it will be very lumpy. So if we think about the business in light of the fact that the market I expect to be lumpy is we think almost exclusively in terms of market share because market share, point of share whether the market is up or down, we continue to gain share. But if you do the math, the point of market share on the market and size growing at this rate, a point of share alone is roughly 15% growth. In this past year, we gained two points a share. So from that perspective, I think the mathematics of us growing at the rate that you talked about I think is it still very, very much achievable. Clearly as we get bigger, it becomes more and more challenging but certainly, I mean we can all year, we are still growing in trends of last 12 months, probably 30%. So the business is robust, it's certainly there and if I look at the geographical landscape, we talked about U.S. public sector. And there's lots of speculation of what may happen but there's been lots of speculation and the business is still strong, certainly stronger than by anybody else's in the Storage business. When I look in Europe, Southern Europe is still a challenging environment but that is not really material to our business. In fact, our growth there at teleteam with no market share in the macro doesn't matter. U.K. is a concern because the government austerity. And I met with the CIOs of the number of agencies to the U.K. Ministry, so I was over there just a couple of weeks ago. And clearly, they are seeing constraint but the German economy is remarkably strong and they are remarkably confident. In Asia-Pacific hasn't been as historically a strong area for us and very pleased with the progress we're making there. And that frankly need to be a bigger percentage of our business going forward. So in the U.S. I think I feel better about our execution in that market than I do about the market at large. So all in all, I'd say what's going on with leaving me to believe that 7.5% is probably a viable estimate going forward. And I feel great about our competitive position."

But I think we guided to that way to remember our second quarter benefited from timing difference between cost-reductions is price reduction is, we straightened all that out for this quarter. We have rich configuration miss last quarter, in fact, we thought we are back to normal this quarter. So the fact that they product gross margins are down was anticipated. And in fact, I would argue that we are slightly ahead of where we expected to be it that is why our gross margin is a little higher than what we have told you. With respect to the components environment out there, our operations people tell me that it's kind of, generally speaking, they are not a huge amount of supply constraints but they're a key components that are under constraint. And unfortunately, we have a couple of those in our products. And when mix is a shift in a manner that fits those particular components, it just gets exacerbated at the system level. So at the end of the day, I think that there are some spot shortages out there. They are not widespread across a whole variety of different components but there are a few that are unfortunately in constraint right now. I think overall in terms of the pricing environment, the key commodities that are interesting to us clearly just drives. And I think the disk drives supply chain has got multiple suppliers and they all appear to be relatively healthy in terms of being able to meet our needs. So I think that, that gives us some multiple choice options. Clearly, DRAM and the other one is flash. About a year ago, we made a very, very significant inventory commitment around flash to guarantee supply, which is not completely burned through. We thought we would be and we are going to move forward with that as well. So all in all, I think the pure commodities are probably seeing some ability to exert a little bit of pricing leverage but not a lot. And the issue that we have with our product isn't certainly in some part in short supply but really is, is that we certainly have tremendous demand for part. And we only need to find them throughout the supply chain or try and convince them to wrestle away from somebody else or in some cases actually have them fabricated by the regional manufacture."

I think FlexPod and are basically strategies by NetApp by EMC and ourselves, to really go after the value proposition of what the server vendors offer. So the server vendors offer a stack of proprietary technologies with front-end technologies and back-end support, and they come effectively a one-stop shop. So the appeal of that is it basically though one point of contact so the downside of it is none of the technologies best in class or state-of-the-art. So ultimately, what you're getting is you're trading off in favor of integration, but you're trading off your trading, you ability to drive lower cost and greater efficiency than your company. So recognizing that there is a title of integration that I think the players in the industry are looking to integrate with other best of providers that basically create integrated solutions that approximate the integration of those server vendors. And then have professional services and income, support at the backend. So I think that effectively, this is the way to effectively compete and nullify the one advantage of the server vendors yet at the same time offer best of grade technology. Thus far as EMC, I think clearly, we have taken different approaches. I think we really designed for more flexibility as opposed to fixed configuration. I think we're a bit more channel family and frankly, is generating a terminus amount of momentum in the market for you guys to check and see that. But first  the engagement in San Francisco is accelerating and FlexPod is a combination of those number of those it to be so all in all, we are good."

Clearly, we are involved in accounts. We do projects together. So I think that continues. One of the things that stood in the way of doing some joint technology development obviously was the loss that they inherited from Sun. And the resolution of that has allowed us to do more collaboration from a technical perspective, while there have been a roadblock there for a few months. So that way we can work more constructive things going forward. As far as Exadata, it's been interesting scenario and that is the idea of a totally integrated stack from software all the way down to storage. In some ways, the idea of building a ship virtual infrastructure taking on multiple different types of NetApp at the same time. And I have a lot of conversations with customers about where you draw the line, do you basically carve off because there's no doubt that the vast majority of the application are going to pursue the virtualization path because of the flexibility and the efficiency and the economics involve. And the question is do they carve off one or two applications and so forth build a dedicated stack. So I think that Exadata has now brought market product. It's really tied to the Oracle and it's really tied to only a really certain class of our core applications. And where the customers ultimately draw the line is Exadata support all the Oracle apps in the enterprise or just one or two. I think time will tell. But at the end of the day, I think our strategy with Oracle is to basically engage them around Exadata rather than competing directly with it. Clearly, the states where Exadata is competing today has clearly occupied a lot more competitors than it is with us. So I think it gives us more of an opportunity to work collaboratively with them around the rest of the infrastructure rather than just the online connection processing database or the data warehouse."

So the professional services strategy of not doing it ourselves in this segment of the market is basically rid of confidence level of our channel partners and I think that fact to give as well. So I think from an economic perspective, from an ease of use perspective, from an integration perspective and from a risk and proponent perspective, I still think we have a superior offering."

There are some that are on the eastern end of the performers and they're going to be split of the new technology as soon as it's available so clearly there's probably some pent-up demand there. But there are other customers that are in the high-end systems or the large systems in mission-critical applications. And for them, they all go through a phase of certification and testing and performance modeling and all that. So I would say that there's a general rule that applies to all of the large systems. I think it depends on the customers said of casually using them. Clearly, one thing that we also see is the connect rate of our flash technology and the high-end system that is externally I. Not quite in every unit item but very, very high. So people using the technology very, very effectively and I think the high-end systems help us with that as well, particularly and also the latest release of the software allows us to use the cache with all of the other features and which drives and things like that. So a lot of competitive compatibility issues with cash Oregon and so it allows the deployment of it more broadly. So I say that's really what's driving it they are. Like you said come up your people buying large systems the way for high-capacity they also by the fourth large-scale mission-critical applications I'd say they operate but have different adopters in our schedule."

Continuing the trend of recent quarters, NetApp generated very strong business results in Q3, driven primarily by our successful new product launch in November. Total revenue grew by 25% and product revenue grew b",966,"Thanks, Tara. Good afternoon, everyone. Continuing the trend of recent quarters, NetApp generated very strong business results in Q3, driven primarily by our successful new product launch in November. 
Total revenue grew by 25% and product revenue grew by 32% year-over-year. Our total non-GAAP gross margins remain quite strong at 65.5%, demonstrating the competitive strength of our products and non-GAAP operating margins continued new record highs. 
Non-GAAP net income grew 46% year-over-year and made a large contribution to free cash flow, which registered a robust 23% of revenue. This quarter, we experienced the fastest uptake of a new product line in our history. Customers converted over to the new FAS3200 platform at a far faster rate than we have projected, significantly exceeding our expectations for the mix between the new and the previous FAS3000 product line. As a result, we are experiencing some material constraints, which we believe delayed the shipment of approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue. 
We have increased our forecast with suppliers several times over the past few months and we are managing the situation closely. Given the steep ramp in demand, certain materials may remain supply constrained in Q4. Despite this operational challenge, product revenue growth was still above 30%. 
We are very pleased with our overall growth margins, which ended up slightly stronger than expected. Non-GAAP product gross margins behaved as we anticipated, finishing just slightly above 60%. The timing of cost reduction and price reduction that we discussed last quarter is now back in balance. Non-GAAP service gross margins finished about one percentage point stronger than anticipated as support renewals were a bit higher than expected. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% sequentially from Q2 as lower marketing and administrative expenses partially offset the salaries associated with increased headcount and increased variable compensation. We added 415 net new people in Q3 and expect to continue hiring, primarily sales and engineering resources, at slightly higher levels this next quarter. 
Cash generation was another highlight this quarter. Despite a slight increase in accounts receivable, DSOs, our strong net profit combined with a large uptick in the growth of deferred revenue on the balance sheet yielded $364 million in cash from operations and $297 million in free cash flow. 
As I mentioned earlier, free cash flow finished at a very solid 23% of revenue. This was the primary contributor to the $374 million sequential increase in our cash and investments balance. Cash and investments now stand at $4.8 billion. 
Our diluted share count increased 14.5 million shares sequentially to 406 million shares, roughly in line with what we had projected on last quarter's earnings call. The increase was driven primarily by the impact of a higher average quarterly stock price and the accounting for our convertible notes and warrants. 
With an average closing price of $54.77 in Q3, approximately 4.5 million additional shares are included in the diluted share count to account for the impact of the notes and another 5.5 million additional shares were added to account for the warrants sold as part of the original transaction. You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged while the warrants were not hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedge, then the non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.02 higher. You will find a table on our website which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices. 
Looking forward, our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.38 billion plus or minus 2%, which implies approximately 7% to 11% sequential growth and 15% to 20% year-over-year growth. The current uncertainty regarding our materials constraints has been reflected in this guidance. 
Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to moderate in Q4 to a range around 65%. We anticipate that non-GAAP operating margins will be in the range around 18.2%. Diluted share count will likely continue to be significantly impacted by the accounting for convertible notes and warrants. We expect the diluted share count to be roughly 414 million shares in Q4, which includes 18 million shares from the convertible debt and 12 million shares from the warrants. 
Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset, bringing our earnings per share estimates to approximately $0.49 to $0.53 per share. Since we cannot accurately predict what the average stock price will be for the full quarter, the diluted share count was calculated using the $58.22 average share price from the first 10 business days of this quarter. 
If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible bond hedge, that would add $0.02 to the EPS guidance. Despite the renewal of the federal R&D tax credit, our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to remain at 16.3% in Q4, primarily due to a greater concentration of profits in our U.S. geography. 
While on this topic of future guidance, I wanted to make sure that you are aware that consistent with our SEC disclosures, NetApp is required to adopt the new additional accounting standard for revenue recognition for FY12. We will adopt in either Q4 FY11 or Q1 FY12 depending upon the timing of our implementation of systems, tools and processes. Irrespective of the timing, we do not expect any fundamental changes to our business model as a result of this adoption. 
To summarize, we are pleased with the strong demand for our products. We continue to demonstrate compelling differentiation in the market and our competitive position is as strong as it has ever been, evidenced by the continued strength in our gross margins. We will continue to prudently invest in growing our business while at the same time generating strong free cash flow. 
At this point, I will turn the call over to Tom for his perspective. Tom?"

I remain pleased with our financial results and our continued momentum in the marketplace. 
As data centers move toward a shared virtualized infrastructure, NetApp's innovation leadership is enabling compelling business outcomes for our customers and is propelling our growth. Our recent product announcements further enhanced our competitive position and led to the fastest uptake of new platforms in our company's history. 
Unfortunately, after solid execution by marketing sales and engineering, we significantly exceeded our forecast and sold out of the new products. While disappointing in the near term, we remain optimistic as demand is very strong, our margins are evidence of our competitive strength and we continue to generate significant amount of cash while simultaneously investing aggressively. 
For the last year, we've been using a two-year compare metric to measure our progress both internally and externally. These are comparisons to the same quarter two years ago to reduce the overstatement of growth due to weak quarterly compares post-Lehman Monday. We believe it gives a more accurate depiction of true momentum in the market. 
While likely the last time we will use this metric, the gap between our growth rate and that of the Storage business of our nearest of the four largest competitors is nearly 30%, the greatest separation we have seen since we have started doing this analysis. This is also inclusive of all of their acquisitions in the intervening periods. 
The result is that NetApp has gained more market share in this interval than at any time in our history. 
Last month, NetApp was honored to be named number five on Fortune Magazine's 2011 list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. We improved two positions from last year and it was our third consecutive year in the top 10. It is a tribute to the NetApp culture and the commitment of the total NetApp team. 
While the recognition is satisfying, our objective is very pragmatic. NetApp has always stressed that our culture is a long-term strategic advantage, and this process enables to measure ourselves against the very best and identify opportunities for improvement. Our belief is that if the employees are happy, they will demonstrate maximum commitment. And if our employees are happy, our customers can tell. 
A few comments are more awarding that when a customer says, it simply feels different doing business with NetApp. Our recent product launch further strengthened our position as the platform of choice for the next-generation IT infrastructure. 
IT departments today face tremendous pressure to decrease costs while at the same time increasing their enablement of business objectives. As a result, they are changing how they are architecting their infrastructure in order to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. This means moving away from application-specific hardware silos to a shared infrastructure enabled by server virtualization which can run many applications at once. 
NetApp has been a clear innovation leader in virtualized environments, producing solutions at a far more efficient, flexible, automated and secure, all with far less complexity and a smaller footprint than those of the competition. The announcements we recently made extend our capabilities in each of these dimensions, and we see nothing from our competition today that comes close to providing a storage efficiency and cost savings that we bring to IT infrastructures of the future. 
In addition to products, the diversification of our channels has been a key driver to our growth and an essential part of our strategy. At this point, our channel diversification and channel relationships are the best they have ever been and among the best of any IT company. 
Revenue from our distribution partners, Arrow and Avnet, was up 34% year-over-year and our OEM partners, Fujitsu and IBM, are both expanding with IBM growing double digits year-over-year to a new record. Our newer channel initiatives around service providers and systems integrators continue to broaden our reach as evidenced by the Accenture announcement we made this week. 
An additional element of our strategy has been to deepen our technology integration in our go-to-market activities with other best-of-breed innovators in the industry. We certainly see the major server vendors offering turnkey solutions including services, their proprietary hardware stocks and support. 
Our approach is to partner with other industry leaders to create more highly integrated, technologically superior offerings with a common support infrastructure and enabled by systems integrators and channel partners. 
Publicly announced solutions include our secure multi-tenancy and FlexPod offerings in partnership with Cisco and VMware. We are also a top tier provider in the Microsoft private cloud program, and we have numerous solution offerings with our OEM partners. Our recent announcement with Accenture will further enable those offerings. 
Looking at our business from a geographical breakdown, the results of EMEA and U.S. Public Sector are notable. U.S. Public Sector grew 8% after nearly 60% growth last quarter and EMEA grew 35% after only growing about 15% last quarter. 
In the case of EMEA, despite macro headwinds in certain countries, our own execution in Q2 could have been better, and we made good progress this quarter. Nonetheless, the big variation in quarterly performance of these geos is overstated due to timing of certain large shipments rather than any sudden major shift in positive or negative momentum. Averaging the last two quarters will be more indicative of our performance. 
APAC and the Americas, excluding U.S. Public Sector, were both solid. As NetApp went through the economic downturn, we made many hard decisions to reprioritize our product lines, seizing some activities and investing more heavily in others. And those hard choices have yielded the outcomes you are seeing today. 
We have continued to invest heavily over the past nine to 12 months while making similar prioritization choices, and those investments positioned us well for the future. Despite any number of intermediate term macroeconomic concerns, as long as we continue to gain share and outgrow the market, we intend to continue to spend aggressively to make the most of our opportunity. 
We are clearly winning in the market more broadly than we ever have in the past, and we intend to take maximum advantage of this competitive position we have created. Should our revenue growth and gross margins remain robust, operating margins will remain above our historic levels. 
In closing, I would like to sincerely thank the nearly 10,000 employees of NetApp and all of our partners and customers for their dedication and support. The team executed the largest product launch in our history and at the same time grew product revenue 32% over a strong compare last year. Our market share gains are evident and our competitive position has never been more distinct. 
We look forward to spending time with you at our product-focused Analyst Day in March to help you gain a deeper understanding of our value proposition and the scope of our competitive differentiation. At this point, I will open up the floor to questions, reminding you to please limit yourself to one so we may address as many folks as possible during our allotted time. Operator?"

And actually more particular than that is -- and to put it in perspective, I mean we've introduced products before, but this one actually had 4x the take-up rate of any of our previous products. So clearly, the ramp is pretty steep. And the other thing that's a little bit different about the 3000 family here is they also have the thing called an I/O expansion module, which allows you to put more connectivity in. And the demand for that was much higher than we forecasted as well, and in fact, that ended up being the limiting factor. And probably in retrospect, the lesson learned here is that people were looking to build with the higher performance systems that we introduced, they were looking to build bigger systems. And the other thing is that those slots where the flash cards go in included demand for our flash cards is very, very high. In fact, the attach rate of flash on these class of machines are actually 10 points higher than they were on the previous class. So, overall in terms of constraints, it's primarily in the I/O expansion module, certain semiconductor components along the way. But at the end of the day, demand is really strong, so it's kind of a bright side at the end of this. But nonetheless, it's primarily and then particularly that dimension, I wouldn't call out any individual part, but the simple fact of the matter is we ended up shipping thousands of these units, so we ended up at 4x the demand that we expected. As we go into the next quarter, our guidance currently reflects the fact that we've not resolved these problems yet. We're working on them. We think we have approaches that will resolve them, but it did cause us to take some consideration here with respect to whether or not we get all the parts we want whatever the case. We also can't estimate the mixes correctly. We want to make sure that if there was this huge mix shift, one way or the other, more modules, for instance, of [ph] OM modules, we can handle that. So the bottom line here is we tended to be a little more conservative with our guidance because we have not solved all of the mix and the material fluff here."

So if I look at the market share at least the way we calculate it in the markets that we participate in is for all of our growth and",587,"Well, I guess, first to start before we think about that is as I think about just where we are with our existing business. So if I look at the market share at least the way we calculate it in the markets that we participate in is for all of our growth and for all of our momentum, we're still 15% or so market share. And so I still think there's plenty of opportunity. So in a $15 billion market and if you believe IDC growing at 7% or 8% per year, that's a pretty big opportunity. We're number one or number two in market share and probably four out of the 20 largest deals, including our awareness seems to be better than where it is today. So those will sound like daunting tasks, but what it tells me first and foremost is that A, that there is no limit to our ability to double our business just in the business we're in; and second, the fact that we gained two points of market share as I measured it, just in the last 12 months, tells me that market share is gainable in this segment. So first and foremost, I think our fundamental core business is very, very healthy and our aspiration is double the size of our business right in the space we're in. When I think about acquisitions, there's really two components that I think about. Number one is there needs to be affinity. Affinity meaning something that our salesforce can sell or something that by virtue of having in our portfolio, we can move more of our existing products. I think if there's one thing that this industry has shown is that buying up of dissimilar assets with no leverage and no affinity, don't yield any shareholder value. And I think there's some pretty high profile cases in this market, of very, very good assets that are not great stocks. The other thing that I think is key to our strategy as well is that we don't want a lot of overlap. We don't want to pursue a product that may give us marginal incremental market, but end up has substantial overlap with what we do and we spend the next several years of our core team and this new product basically spending money, replicating each other's features and basically building Noah's Ark to of everything. So at the end of the day, I think the affinity and the lack of overlap are things that are key to us. So certainly, if you think about Data Domain in our past, Data Domain was a backup product. It was targeted at target market. It clearly had affinity and it didn't have overlap. On the other hand, I think there are some other properties that changed hands recently that had tremendous overlap with what we are doing, and therefore, we were not interested. That's how we see it. But right now, I feel no pressure to do applications or acquisitions to generate near-term growth, nor do I believe that we're out of headroom in our current market. But that said, I do believe that there are adjacencies that are very, very attractive that I think are high growth, and I think that will be part of our acquisition strategy going forward. So I expect that we will be acquisitive, but I feel no pressure to do it in the near term. And likewise, certainly don't want to signal any lack of conviction about our core business."

The business was up double digits and the units were up more than that. So I still consider that to be an important part of our business. I know in midsize enterprise, I believe we've added over 1,500 new accounts this year and a lot of it is driven in that segment. Our Arrow and Avnet business, which moves a lot of that product has been very, very strong. And the other big mover of the entry-level products is actually Public Sector. And while the Public Sector business shipments don't look that impressive, that business is actually quite healthy for us. And I think that we also refreshed the midrange business as well and may have drawn a little bit of demand particularly from the larger of the smaller machines into a more modern unit. So that probably had some impact on the number as well. But fundamentally, I don't see any change in dynamics there that I have any concern about."

But in general here, I think the question is will the mix shift again and it will it shift even more aggressively towards the new products. And I think we're certainly planning as if it is. We've never been a company that optimized ourselves around our inventory position. So I think we want to take material risks to cover uncertainty.

We'll see 3s and 15s as we go forward, so it will be very lumpy. So the way we think about the business in light of the fact that the market, I expect to be lumpy, is we think almost exclusively in terms of market share because market share, a point of share is a point of share where the market is up or down and we tend to continue to gain share. But if you do the math, a point of market share on the market this size growing at this rate, a point of share alone is roughly 15% growth. And this past year, we gained two points a share. So from that perspective, I think the mathematics of us growing at the rates that you talked about I think are still very, very much achievable. Clearly as we get bigger, it becomes more and more challenging but certainly, I mean we've been big all year. We've still been growing by the last trailing last 12 months growth rates, probably in the vicinity of 30%. So the business is robust, it's certainly there. I mean if I look at the geographical landscape, we talked about U.S. Public Sector and there's lots of speculation about what may happen, but there's been lots of speculation and the business is still strong, certainly stronger than anybody else's in the Storage business. When I look at Europe, Southern Europe is still a challenging environment, but that's not really material to our business. In fact, our growth there, I tell the team with no market share, the macro doesn't matter. U.K. is a concern because of the government austerity and I met with the CIOs of a number of agencies of the U.K. Ministry when I was over there just a couple of weeks ago and clearly, they are seeing constraint. But the German economy is remarkably strong and they are remarkably confident. And Asia-Pacific hasn't been historically a strong area for us, but actually we've seen very, very good growth and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making there. And that frankly needs to be a bigger percentage of our business going forward. I mean the U.S. I think I feel better about our execution in that market than I do about the market at large. So all in all, I'd say what's going on would leave me to believe that 7.5% is probably a viable estimate going forward. And I feel good about our competitive position."

And I think that we're going to participate in the segments where we currently play and I think we've got very, very strong relationships there. And certainly, I wouldn't seed any ground functionality, but even in addition to the functionality, there is program, there is relationships, there's longevity, there is trust, there's a whole set of factors that go into building channel loyalty. So certainly, I expect EMC to continue to assault us on all fronts like they've been doing for the last year. And I think it's up to us to compete and I think we'll compete based on compatible channel strategies. I think we'll compete based on product features. We'll compete on our ability to make our channel partners more profitable. So yes, I expect nothing less than EMC to come out very aggressively with their new products just like they have with everything else that they've got. But I really don't see anything happening that's going to fundamentally tilt the balance in this business. If there was one irony in the product releases that there was a heavy dose in the press, I'll talk about EMC closing the gap with NetApp. And on one hand, we can debate the merits of that statement where they're really closing the gap and where there is a whole category of features they haven't even begun to address. But I think the real key component there is that NetApp has become the innovation yardstick by which EMC is measured, and I think at least that part we felt good about."

Remember our second quarter benefited from a timing difference between cost reductions and price reductions. We straightened all that out this quarter. We have rich configuration mix last quarter. We saw that we were  to normal this quarter. So the fact that the product gross margins are down was anticipated. And in fact, I would argue that we're slightly ahead of where we expected to be and that's why our gross margin is a little higher than what we had told you. With respect to the components environment out there, our operations people tell me that it's kind of, generally speaking, there are not a huge amount of supply constraints, but there are key components that are under constraint. And unfortunately, we have a couple of those in our products and when mix is shift in a manner that hits those particular component, it just gets exacerbated at the system level. So at the end of the day, I think that there are some spot shortages out there. They're not widespread across a whole variety of different components, but there are a few that are unfortunately in constraint right now. I think overall in terms of the pricing environment, the key commodities that are interesting to us clearly disk drives. And I think the disk drive supply chain has got multiple suppliers, and they all appear to be relatively healthy in terms of being able to meet our need. So I think that, that gives us some multiple choice options. Clearly, DRAM and the other one is flash. About a year ago, we made a very, very significant inventory commitment around flash to guarantee supply, which is now completely burned through. We're on advancing when we thought it would be and we're going to move forward with that as well. So all in all, I think the pure commodities are probably -- we probably are seeing some ability to exert a little bit of pricing leverage but not a lot. And the issue that we have with our product is in suddenly some part is in short supply. What really is, is that we suddenly have tremendous demand for our part. And we either need to find them throughout the supply chain or try and convince them to rest on their way from somebody else or in some cases actually have them fabricated by the original manufacturer."

I think FlexPod and Vblock are basically strategies by EMC and ourselves to really go after the value proposition of what the server vendors offer. So the server vendors offer a stack of proprietary technologies with front-end services and back-end support, and they come as effectively a one-stop shop. So the appeal of that is basically the one point of contact, but the downside of it is that none of the technology is best-in-class or state-of-the-art. So ultimately, what you're getting is you're trading off in favor of integration, but you're trading off best-of-breed, you're trading off the ability to drive lower cost and greater efficiency than your company. So recognizing that there is a power of integration that I think the players in the industry are looking to integrate with other best-of-breed providers to basically create integrated solutions that approximate the integration of those with the server vendors, and then have professional services and common support on the backend. So I think that effectively, this is the way to effectively compete and nullify the one advantage of the server vendors, yet at the same time offer best-of-breed technology. Now as far as EMC, I think clearly we've clearly taken different approaches. I think we really designed for more flexibility as opposed to fixed configurations. I think we're a bit more channel-friendly, and frankly, it's generating a tremendous amount of momentum in the market. I'm sure you guys check and see that, but those are all the engagements between VMware always been strong, the engagements between us and Cisco is accelerating and FlexPod is a culmination of the number of those activities. So all in all, good."

Clearly, we're involved in accounts. We do projects together, so I think that continues. One of the things that stood in our way of doing some joint technology development obviously was the lawsuit that they inherited from Sun, and the resolution of that has allowed us to do more collaboration from a technical perspective, while there had been a roadblock there for a few months. So with that out of the way, we can work on more constructive things going forward. As far as Exadata, it's an interesting scenario and that is the idea of a totally integrated stack from software all the way down to storage. In some ways, it is orthogonal to the idea of building a shared virtual infrastructure taking [ph] on multiple different types of apps at the same time. And I have a lot of conversations with the customers about where do you draw the line, do you basically carve off because there's no doubt that the vast majority of the applications are going to pursue the virtualization path because of the flexibility and the efficiency and the economics involved. And the question is, do they carve off one or two applications that are so important they're going to build a dedicated stack. So I think that Exadata is not a broad market product. It's really tied to the Oracle and it's really tied to only really a certain class of Oracle applications. And where the customers ultimately draw the line, does Exadata support all the Oracle apps in an enterprise or just one or two? I think time will tell. But at the end of the day, I think our strategy with Oracle is to basically engage them around Exadata rather than competing directly with it. Clearly, the space where Exadata is competing today is clearly occupied a lot more by our competitors than it is with us. So I think it gives us more of an opportunity to work collaboratively with them around the rest of the infrastructure rather than just the online transaction processing database or the data warehouse."

So to be tightly integrated with the applications they run, to be able to run it far more efficiently with our deduplication technology and the maturity improvement  technology as time goes on, I think the raw factor is that that come into play. The other thing is I think that we've enabled our channel partners with our professional services strategy that our channel partners I think are far more capable of helping small customers adopt and put our technology to use than the generic channel partners. So the professional services strategy of not doing it ourselves in this segment of the market has basically raised the confidence level of our channel partners and I think that's a factor here as well.

So there are some that are on the extreme end of the performance and they're going to basically adopt the new technology as soon as it's available, so clearly there's probably some pent-up demand there. But there are other customers that are running the high-end systems or the large systems in mission-critical applications, and to them, they all go through a phase of certification and testing and performance modeling and all of that. So I would say that there's a general rule that applies to all of the large systems. I think it depends on the customer set that's casually using them. Clearly, one thing that we also see is the connect rate of our flash technology in the high-end systems is externally high. Not quite in every unit item but very, very high. So I think people are using that technology very, very effectively and I think the high-end systems help us with that as well particularly and also the latest release of the software allows us to use the cash with all of our other features and large drives and things like that. So a lot of the compatibility issues we have with cash are now gone and so it allows the deployment a little bit more broadly. So I'd say that that's really what's driving it their. Like I said, people buy large systems for high performance, they buy them for high capacity and they also buy them for large-scale mission-critical applications and I'd say that all three of them have a different adoptions schedule."

And some of our software is capacity-based in terms of its pricing so to the extent that we sell larger capacities from a software perspective, that's still going to scale largely linearly. And that too varies if you're talking about the high-end products. Some of the high-end products that are extremely capacity intensive tend not to have the rich software set, but certainly the ones that are in the mission-critical data processing or transaction processing environments, they tend to be very, very software heavy."

We've got revenue recognition relative to other items that are on the PO and what gets deferred and what doesn't get deferred or what other pieces were short. Obviously, some customers in terms of their size and their history and the urgency is a factor as well. So I would say that there is probably no overt geo color, but if you look at the growth rates of the geos, clearly the shipments were not evenly distributed.

Total revenue grew by 25% and product revenue grew b",967,"Thanks, Tara. Good afternoon, everyone. Continuing the trend of recent quarters, NetApp generated very strong business results in Q3, driven primarily by our successful new product launch in November. 
Total revenue grew by 25% and product revenue grew by 32% year-over-year. Our total non-GAAP gross margins remain quite strong at 65.5%, demonstrating the competitive strength of our products and non-GAAP operating margins continued new record highs. 
Non-GAAP net income grew 46% year-over-year and made a large contribution to free cash flow, which registered a robust 23% of revenue. This quarter, we experienced the fastest uptake of a new product line in our history. Customers converted over to the new FAS3200 platform at a far faster rate than we had projected, significantly exceeding our expectations for the mix between the new and the previous FAS3000 product line. As a result, we are experiencing some material constraints, which we believe delayed the shipment of approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue. 
We have increased our forecast with suppliers several times over the past few months and we are managing the situation closely. Given the steep ramp in demand, certain materials may remain supply constrained in Q4. Despite this operational challenge, product revenue growth was still above 30%. 
We are very pleased with our overall growth margins, which ended up slightly stronger than expected. Non-GAAP product gross margins behaved as we have anticipated, finishing just slightly above 60%. The timing of cost reduction and price reduction that we discussed last quarter is now back in balance. Non-GAAP service gross margins finished about one percentage point stronger than anticipated as support renewals were a bit higher than expected. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% sequentially from Q2 as lower marketing and administrative expenses partially offset the salaries associated with increased headcount and increased variable compensation. We added 415 net new people in Q3 and expect to continue hiring, primarily sales and engineering resources, at slightly higher levels this next quarter. 
Cash generation was another highlight this quarter. Despite a slight increase in accounts receivable, DSOs, our strong net profit combined with a large uptick in the growth of deferred revenue on the balance sheet yielded $364 million in cash from operations and $297 million in free cash flow. 
As I mentioned earlier, free cash flow finished at a very solid 23% of revenue. This was the primary contributor to the $374 million sequential increase in our cash and investments balance. Cash and investments now stand at $4.8 billion. 
Our diluted share count increased 14.5 million shares sequentially to 406 million shares, roughly in line with what we had projected on last quarter's earnings call. The increase was driven primarily by the impact of a higher average quarterly stock price and the accounting for our convertible notes and warrants. 
With an average closing price of $54.77 in Q3, approximately 4.5 million additional shares are included in the diluted share count to account for the impact of the notes and another 5.5 million additional shares were added to account for the warrants sold as part of the original transaction. You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged while the warrants were not hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedge, then the non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.02 higher. You will find a table on our website which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices. 
Looking forward, our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.38 billion plus or minus 2%, which implies approximately 7% to 11% sequential growth and 15% to 20% year-over-year growth. The current uncertainty regarding our materials constraints has been reflected in this guidance. 
Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to moderate in Q4 to a range around 65%. We anticipate that non-GAAP operating margins will be in the range around 18.2%. Diluted share count will likely continue to be significantly impacted by the accounting for convertible notes and warrants. We expect the diluted share count to be roughly 414 million shares in Q4, which includes 18 million shares from the convertible debt and 12 million shares from the warrants. 
Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset, bringing our earnings per share estimates to approximately $0.49 to $0.53 per share. Since we cannot accurately predict what the average stock price will be for the full quarter, the diluted share count was calculated using the $58.22 average share price from the first 10 business days of this quarter. 
If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible bond hedge, that would add $0.02 to the EPS guidance. Despite the renewal of the federal R&D tax credit, our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to remain at 16.3% in Q4, primarily due to a greater concentration of profits in our U.S. geography. 
While on this topic of future guidance, I wanted to make sure that you are aware that consistent with our SEC disclosures, NetApp is required to adopt a new additional accounting standard for revenue recognition for FY12. We will adopt in either Q4 FY11 or Q1 FY12 depending upon the timing of our implementation of systems, tools and processes. Irrespective of the timing, we do not expect any fundamental changes to our business model as a result of this adoption. 
To summarize, we are pleased with the strong demand for our products. We continue to demonstrate compelling differentiation in the market and our competitive position is as strong as it has ever been, evidenced by the continued strength in our gross margins. We will continue to prudently invest in growing our business while at the same time generating strong free cash flow. 
At this point, I will turn the call over to Tom for his perspective. Tom?"

I remain pleased with our financial results and our continued momentum in the marketplace. 
As data centers move toward a shared virtualized infrastructure, NetApp's innovation leadership is enabling compelling business outcomes for our customers and is propelling our growth. Our recent product announcements further enhanced our competitive position and led to the fastest uptake of new platforms in our company's history. 
Unfortunately, after solid execution by marketing sales and engineering, we significantly exceeded our forecast and sold out of the new products. While disappointing in the near term, we remain optimistic as demand is very strong, our margins are evidence of our competitive strength and we continue to generate significant amounts of cash while simultaneously investing aggressively. 
For the last year, we've been using a two-year compare metric to measure our progress both internally and externally. These are comparisons to the same quarter two years ago to reduce the overstatement of growth due to weak quarterly compares post-Lehman Monday. We believe it gives a more accurate depiction of true momentum in the market. 
While likely the last time we will use this metric, the gap between our growth rate and that of the Storage business of our nearest of the four largest competitors is nearly 30%, the greatest separation we have seen since we have started doing this analysis. This is also inclusive of all of their acquisitions in the intervening periods. 
The result is that NetApp has gained more market share in this interval than at any time in our history. 
Last month, NetApp was honored to be named number five on Fortune Magazine's 2011 list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. We improved two positions from last year and it was our third consecutive year in the top 10. It is a tribute to the NetApp culture and the commitment of the total NetApp team. 
While the recognition is satisfying, our objective is very pragmatic. NetApp has always stressed that our culture is a long-term strategic advantage, and this process enables to measure ourselves against the very best and identify opportunities for improvement. Our belief is that if the employees are happy, they will demonstrate maximum commitment. And if our employees are happy, our customers can tell. 
A few comments are more awarding that when a customer says, it simply feels different doing business with NetApp. Our recent product launch further strengthened our position as the platform of choice for the next-generation IT infrastructure. 
IT departments today face tremendous pressure to decrease costs while at the same time increasing their enablement of business objectives. As a result, they are changing how they are architecting their infrastructure in order to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. This means moving away from application-specific hardware silos to a shared infrastructure enabled by server virtualization which can run many applications at once. 
NetApp has been a clear innovation leader in virtualized environments, producing solutions at a far more efficient, flexible, automated and secure, all with far less complexity and a smaller footprint than those of the competition. The announcements we recently made extend our capabilities in each of these dimensions, and we see nothing from our competition today that comes close to providing a storage efficiency and cost savings that we bring to IT infrastructures of the future. 
In addition to products, the diversification of our channels has been a key driver to our growth and an essential part of our strategy. At this point, our channel diversification and channel relationships are the best they have ever been and among the best of any IT company. 
Revenue from our distribution partners, Arrow and Avnet, was up 34% year-over-year and our OEM partners, Fujitsu and IBM, are both expanding with IBM growing double digits year-over-year to a new record. Our newer channel initiatives around service providers and systems integrators continue to broaden our reach as evidenced by the Accenture announcement we made this week. 
An additional element of our strategy has been to deepen our technology integration in our go-to-market activities with other best-of-breed innovators in the industry. We certainly see the major server vendors offering turnkey solutions including services, their proprietary hardware stocks and support. 
Our approach is to partner with other industry leaders to create more highly integrated, technologically superior offerings with a common support infrastructure and enabled by systems integrators and channel partners. 
Publicly announced solutions include our secure multi-tenancy and FlexPod offerings in partnership with Cisco and VMware. We are also a top tier provider in the Microsoft private cloud program, and we have numerous solution offerings with our OEM partners. Our recent announcement with Accenture will further enable those offerings. 
Looking at our business from a geographical breakdown, the results of EMEA and U.S. Public Sector are notable. U.S. Public Sector grew 8% after nearly 60% growth last quarter and EMEA grew 35% after only growing about 15% last quarter. 
In the case of EMEA, despite macro headwinds in certain countries, our own execution in Q2 could have been better, and we made good progress this quarter. Nonetheless, the big variation in quarterly performance of these geos is overstated due to timing of certain large shipments rather than any sudden major shift in positive or negative momentum. Averaging the last two quarters will be more indicative of our performance. 
APAC and the Americas, excluding U.S. Public Sector, were both solid. As NetApp went through the economic downturn, we made many hard decisions to reprioritize our product lines, seizing some activities and investing more heavily in others. And those hard choices have yielded the outcomes you are seeing today. 
We have continued to invest heavily over the past nine to 12 months while making similar prioritization choices and those investments positioned us well for the future. Despite any number of intermediate term macroeconomic concerns, as long as we continue to gain share and outgrow the market, we intend to continue to spend aggressively to make the most of our opportunity. 
We are clearly winning in the market more broadly than we ever have in the past, and we intend to take maximum advantage of this competitive position we have created. Should our revenue growth and gross margins remain robust, operating margins will remain above our historic levels. 
In closing, I would like to sincerely thank the nearly 10,000 employees of NetApp and all of our partners and customers for their dedication and support. The team executed the largest product launch in our history and at the same time grew product revenue 32% over a strong compare last year. Our market share gains are evident and our competitive position has never been more distinct. 
We look forward to spending time with you at our product-focused Analyst Day in March to help you gain a deeper understanding of our value proposition and the scope of our competitive differentiation. At this point, I will open up the floor to questions, reminding you to please limit yourself to one so we may address as many folks as possible during our allotted time. Operator?"

And actually more particular than that is -- and to put it in perspective, I mean we've introduced products before, but this one actually had 4x the take-up rate of any of our previous products. So clearly, the ramp is pretty steep. And the other thing that's a little bit different about the 3000 family here is they also have this thing called an I/O expansion module, which allows you to put more connectivity in. And the demand for that was much higher than we forecasted as well, and in fact, that ended up being the limiting factor. And probably in retrospect, the lesson learned here is that people were looking to build with the higher performance systems that we introduced, they were looking to build bigger systems. And the other thing is that those slots where the flash cards go in included demand for our flash cards is very, very high. In fact, the attach rate of flash on these class of machines are actually 10 points higher than they were on the previous class. So, overall in terms of constraints, it's primarily in the I/O expansion module, certain semiconductor components along the way. But at the end of the day, demand is really strong, so it's kind of a bright side at the end of this. But nonetheless, it's primarily and then particularly that dimension, I wouldn't call out any individual part, but the simple fact of the matter is we ended up shipping thousands of these units, so we ended up at 4x the demand that we expected. As we go into the next quarter, our guidance currently reflects the fact that we've not resolved these problems yet. We're working on them. We think we have approaches that will resolve them, but it did cause us to take some consideration here with respect to whether or not we get all the parts we want whatever the case. We also can't estimate the mixes correctly. We want to make sure that if there was this huge mix shift, that one way or the other, more modules, for instance, of come on -- OM modules, we can handle that. So the bottom line here is we tended to be a little more conservative with our guidance because we have not solved all of the mix and the material stuff yet."

32052,119111028,103925,"NetApp, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Well, I guess, first to start before we think about that is as I think about just where we are with our existing business. So if I look at the market share at least the way we calculate it in the markets that we participate in is for all of our growth and",587,"Well, I guess, first to start before we think about that is as I think about just where we are with our existing business. So if I look at the market share at least the way we calculate it in the markets that we participate in is for all of our growth and for all of our momentum, we're still 15% or so market share. And so I still think there's plenty of opportunity. So in a $15 billion market and if you believe IDC growing at 7% or 8% per year, that's a pretty big opportunity. We're number one or number two in market share and probably four out of the 20 largest deals, including our awareness seems to be better than where it is today. So those will sound like daunting tasks, but what it tells me first and foremost is that A, that there is no limit to our ability to double our business just in the business we're in; and second, the fact that we gained two points of market share as I measured it, just in the last 12 months, tells me that market share is gainable in this segment. So first and foremost, I think our fundamental core business is very, very healthy and our aspiration is double the size of our business right in the space we're in. When I think about acquisitions, there's really two components that I think about. Number one is there needs to be affinity. Affinity meaning something that our salesforce can sell or something that by virtue of having in our portfolio, we can move more of our existing products. I think if there's one thing that this industry has shown is that buying up of dissimilar assets with no leverage and no affinity, don't yield any shareholder value. And I think there's some pretty high profile cases in this market, of very, very good assets that are not great stocks. The other thing that I think is key to our strategy as well is that we don't want a lot of overlap. We don't want to pursue a product that may give us marginal incremental market, but end up has substantial overlap with what we do and we spend the next several years of our core team and this new product basically spending money, replicating each other's features and basically building Noah's Ark to of everything. So at the end of the day, I think the affinity and the lack of overlap are things that are key to us. So certainly, if you think about Data Domain in our past, Data Domain was a backup product. It was targeted at target market. It clearly had affinity and it didn't have overlap. On the other hand, I think there are some other properties that changed hands recently that had tremendous overlap with what we are doing, and therefore, we were not interested. That's how we see it. But right now, I feel no pressure to do applications or acquisitions to generate near-term growth, nor do I believe that we're out of headroom in our current market. But that said, I do believe that there are adjacencies that are very, very attractive that I think are high growth, and I think that will be part of our acquisition strategy going forward. So I expect that we will be acquisitive, but I feel no pressure to do it in the near term. And likewise, certainly don't want to signal any lack of conviction about our core business."

The business was up double digits and the units were up more than that. So I still consider that to be an important part of our business. I know in midsize enterprise, I believe we've added over 1,500 new accounts this year and a lot of it is driven in that segment. Our Arrow and Avnet business, which moves a lot of that product has been very, very strong. And the other big mover of the entry-level products is actually Public Sector. And while the Public Sector business shipments don't look that impressive, that business is actually quite healthy for us. And I think that we also refreshed the midrange business as well and may have drawn a little bit of demand particularly from the larger of the smaller machines into a more modern unit. So that probably had some impact on the number as well. But fundamentally, I don't see any change in dynamics there that I have any concern about."

But in general here, I think the question is will the mix shift again and will it shift even more aggressively towards the new products. And I think we're certainly planning as if it is. We've never been a company that optimized ourselves around our inventory position. So I think we’re willing to take material risks to cover uncertainty.

We'll see 3s and 15s as we go forward, so it will be very lumpy. So the way we think about the business in light of the fact that the market, I expect to be lumpy, is we think almost exclusively in terms of market share because market share, a point of share is a point of share whether the market is up or down and we tend to continue to gain share. But if you do the math, a point of market share on the market this size growing at this rate; a point of share alone is roughly 15% growth. And this past year, we gained two points a share. So from that perspective, I think the mathematics of us growing at the rates that you talked about I think are still very, very much achievable. Clearly as we get bigger, it becomes more and more challenging but certainly, I mean we've been big all year. We've still been growing by the last trailing 12 months growth rates, probably in the vicinity of 30%. So the business is robust, it's certainly there. I mean if I look at the geographical landscape, we talked about U.S. Public Sector and there's lots of speculation about what may happen, but there's been lots of speculation and the business is still strong, certainly stronger than anybody else's in the Storage business. When I look at Europe, Southern Europe is still a challenging environment, but that's not really material to our business. In fact, our growth there, I tell the team with no market share, the macro doesn't matter. U.K. is a concern because of the government austerity and I met with the CIOs of a number of agencies of the U.K. Ministry when I was over there just a couple of weeks ago and clearly, they are seeing constraint. But the German economy is remarkably strong and they are remarkably confident. And Asia-Pacific hasn't been historically a strong area for us, but actually we've seen very, very good growth and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making there. And that frankly needs to be a bigger percentage of our business going forward. I mean the U.S. I think I feel better about our execution in that market than I do about the market at large. So all in all, I'd say what's going on would leave me to believe that 7.5% is probably a viable estimate going forward. And I feel good about our competitive position."

Clearly, when you look at the grand scheme of things, new product introductions are always tricky, but we came out with really not much engineering trauma and these products came out, like I said we built thousands of these, it's not like we can't build them and ship them.

Remember our second quarter benefited from a timing difference between cost reductions and price reductions. We straightened all that out this quarter. We had rich configuration mix last quarter. We saw that we were back to normal this quarter. So the fact that the product gross margins are down was anticipated. And in fact, I would argue that we're slightly ahead of where we expected to be and that's why our gross margin is a little higher than what we had told you. With respect to the components environment out there, our operations people tell me that it's kind of, generally speaking, there are not a huge amount of supply constraints, but there are key components that are under constraint. And unfortunately, we have a couple of those in our products and when mix is shift in a manner that hits those particular components, it just gets exacerbated at the system level. So at the end of the day, I think that there are some spot shortages out there. They're not widespread across a whole variety of different components, but there are a few that are unfortunately in constraint right now. I think overall in terms of the pricing environment, the key commodities that are interesting to us clearly disk drives. And I think the disk drive supply chain has got multiple suppliers, and they all appear to be relatively healthy in terms of being able to meet our needs. So I think that, that gives us some multiple choice options. Clearly, DRAM and the other one is flash. About a year ago, we made a very, very significant inventory commitment around flash to guarantee supply, which is now completely burned through. We're on advancing when we thought it would be and we're going to move forward with that as well. So all in all, I think the pure commodities are probably -- we probably are seeing some ability to exert a little bit of pricing leverage but not a lot.

I think FlexPod and Vblock are basically strategies by EMC and ourselves to really go after the value proposition of what the server vendors offer. So the server vendors offer a stack of proprietary technologies with front-end services and back-end support, and they come as effectively a one-stop shop. So the appeal of that is basically the one point of contact, but the downside of it is that none of the technology is best-in-class or state-of-the-art. So ultimately, what you're getting is you're trading off in favor of integration, but you're trading off best-of-breed, you're trading off the ability to drive lower cost and greater efficiency than your company. So recognizing that there is a power of integration that I think the players in the industry are looking to integrate with other best-of-breed providers to basically create integrated solutions that approximate the integration of those with the server vendors, and then have professional services and common support on the backend. So I think that effectively, this is the way to effectively compete and nullify the one advantage of the server vendors, yet at the same time offer best-of-breed technology. Now as far as EMC, I think clearly we've clearly taken different approaches. I think we really designed for more flexibility as opposed to fixed configurations. I think we're a bit more channel-friendly, and frankly, it's generating a tremendous amount of momentum in the market. I'm sure you guys check and see that, but those are all the engagements between VMware always been strong, the engagements between us and Cisco is accelerating and FlexPod is a culmination of the number of those activities. So all in all, good."

Clearly, we're involved in accounts. We do projects together, so I think that continues. One of the things that stood in our way of doing some joint technology development obviously was the lawsuit that they inherited from Sun, and the resolution of that has allowed us to do more collaboration from a technical perspective, while that had been a roadblock there for a few months. So with that out of the way, we can work on more constructive things going forward. As far as Exadata, it's an interesting scenario and that is the idea of a totally integrated stack from software all the way down to storage. In some ways, it is orthogonal to the idea of building a shared virtual infrastructure that can run multiple different types of apps at the same time. And I have a lot of conversations with customers about where do you draw the line, do you basically carve off because there's no doubt that the vast majority of the applications are going to pursue the virtualization path because of the flexibility and the efficiency and the economics involved. And the question is, do they carve off one or two applications that are so important they're going to build a dedicated stack. So I think that Exadata is not a broad market product. It's really tied to the Oracle and it's really tied to only really a certain class of Oracle applications. And where the customers ultimately draw the line, does Exadata support all the Oracle apps in an enterprise or just one or two? I think time will tell. But at the end of the day, I think our strategy with Oracle is to basically engage them around Exadata rather than competing directly with it. Clearly, the space where Exadata is competing today is clearly occupied a lot more by our competitors than it is with us. So I think it gives us more of an opportunity to work collaboratively with them around the rest of the infrastructure rather than just the online transaction processing database or the data warehouse."

And then I think more generally, I think the breadth of our software features, the breadth of our integration, the efficiency technology particularly in that segment of the market, the ability to drive economics because most at the very, very low end we talked about people with relatively small IT budgets. So to be tightly integrated with the applications they run, to be able to run it far more efficiently with our deduplication technology and the maturity improvement technology as time goes on, I think the raw factor is that that come into play. The other thing is I think that we've enabled our channel partners with our professional services strategy that our channel partners I think are far more capable of helping small customers adopt and put our technology to use than the generic channel partners. So the professional services strategy of not doing it ourselves in this segment of the market has basically raised the confidence level of our channel partners and I think that's a factor here as well.

There are some that are on the extreme end of the performance and they're going to basically adopt a new technology as soon as it's available, so clearly there's probably some pent-up demand there. But there are other customers that are running the high-end systems or the large systems in mission-critical applications, and to them, they all go through a phase of certification and testing and performance modeling and all of that. So I would say that there's a general rule that applies to all of the large systems. I think it depends on the customer set that's actually using them. Clearly, one thing that we also see is the connect rate of our flash technology in the high-end systems is extremely high. Not quite in every unit item but very, very high. So I think people are using that technology very, very effectively and I think the high-end systems help us with that as well particularly and also the latest release of the software allows us to use the cash with all of our other features and large drives and things like that. So a lot of the compatibility issues we have with cash are now gone and so it allows the deployment a little bit more broadly. So I'd say that that's really what's driving it there. Like I said, people buy large systems for high performance, they buy them for high capacity and they also buy them for large-scale mission-critical applications and all three of them have a different adoptions schedule."

32052,131690006,131728,"NetApp, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tara. Good afternoon, everyone. From a financial performance standpoint, Q4 put an exclamation point on a very strong FY '11. Despite being hampered by supply constraints through the first half of the quarter, NetApp finished Q4 with solid revenue",1108,"Thanks, Tara. Good afternoon, everyone. From a financial performance standpoint, Q4 put an exclamation point on a very strong FY '11. Despite being hampered by supply constraints through the first half of the quarter, NetApp finished Q4 with solid revenue growth, record earnings per share and new record free cash flow generation. As you can see from our financial statements, NetApp also adopted the required new accounting standards for revenue recognition this quarter and recast the previous 3 quarters financial statements under the new standards. As a result, the numbers I will reference for all periods in FY '11 and going forward reflect this new accounting methodology.
The change in accounting treatment of revenue complicates the evaluation of our performance relative to the Q4 guidance we gave last quarter, which was for revenue to finish at $1.38 billion, plus or minus 2%. This guidance implies sequential revenue growth of 7% to 11%. With the adoption of the new accounting standards in Q4, the only apples-to-apples comparison we have to assess Q4's revenue performance is the actual 11% sequential revenue growth reported under the new methodology.
This sequential growth rate corresponds to the high end of our guidance range for revenue. With this new methodology, it is important to remember that revenue value is neither created nor destroyed. There is simply a modest impact from the timing of when certain revenue elements are recognized. Because there is zero revenue impact over the total life of a multielement arrangement, our business model remains unchanged. Finally, with the adoption of the new rule, our revenue recognition is now comparable to all major competitors who have adopted this convention about a year ago. 
Turning now to our results as I mentioned, total revenue grew 11% sequentially to $1.428 billion in Q4. More importantly, product revenue grew 14% sequentially to about $960 million, the second-highest sequential growth rate in the past 5 years.
Non-GAAP gross margins declined modestly to 65.5%, in line with our expectation. Product margins also finished the quarter in line with what we were expecting. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 14% sequentially, up more than forecasted in Q3, due primarily to higher commission expenses, reflecting the strength of our core business.
We ended Q4 with 454 net new employees, which does not include the folks we welcomed from Engenio as the transaction closed post Q4. As I highlighted earlier, the underlying business dynamics in Q4 were very strong. Our total units shipped were up 29% year-over-year despite material constraints through the middle of the quarter. The material constraints contributed to a back end loaded shipment profile, which in turn, drove our accounts receivables days sales outstanding to 47 days.
With the material supply constraints solved for Q1 FY '12, we are expecting a more linear shipment quarter and a reduction in DSO to the high 30s in Q1. One of the biggest highlights of the quarter was our cash generation. Despite the increase in accounts receivable DSOs, our strong net profit and large increase in deferred revenues yielded a near record $459 million in cash from operations, with free cash flow finishing at $386 million.
Our cash and investments rose to $5.2 billion in Q4 and deferred revenue grew 21% year-over-year, up $243 million from last quarter. Our diluted share count declined by 2.7 million shares sequentially to about 404 million shares, driven primarily by the effect that a lower average quarterly stock price has on the accounting for our convertible notes and warrants. With the average closing price of $51.23 in Q4, approximately 15 million additional shares are included in the diluted share count to account for the impact of the notes and another 8 million additional shares account for the warrants sold as part of the original transaction.
You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged, while the warrants were not hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedge, then the non-GAAP EPS would've been about $0.01 higher. You will find a table on our website, which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices.
Looking forward, our target revenue range for Q1 is $1.5 billion, plus or minus 3%, which implies approximately 2% to 8% sequential growth and 26% to 34% year-over-year growth. This guidance includes revenue from the Engenio business. Consolidated non-GAAP gross margins are expected to finish Q1 at just over 62% as the OEM business from Engenio is now included in our results. We anticipate that non-GAAP operating margin will finish at about 18% to 18.5%. Diluted share count will likely continue to be significantly impacted by the accounting for convertible notes and warrants. We expect diluted share count to rise to roughly 410 million shares in Q1, which includes about 16 million shares from the convertible debt and 9 million shares from the warrant. Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset, bringing our earnings per share estimates to approximately $0.52 to $0.57 per share. Bear in mind as we told you when the acquisition was announced, the first quarter EPS includes about $0.01 dilution due to the consolidation of the Engenio business. Since we cannot accurately predict what the average stock price will be for the full quarter, the diluted share count was calculated using the $52.98 average share price from the first 10 business days of this quarter. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible bond hedge, that would add about $0.02 to the EPS guidance.
It should be noted that we are expecting our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to 18.5% in FY '12. The vast majority of this increase reflects our expectation that the distribution pretax profit will shift slightly next year, such that a greater proportion of pretax profits will be realized in the U.S. and subject to a higher corporate tax rate. The primary drivers of this shift are our core business, where the U.S. is growing faster than our international business and the consolidation of the Engenio business, which has a higher concentration of pretax profits in the U.S. To summarize, we are very pleased with the strong growth in our product revenue despite the supply constraints in the first half of the quarter. The strength of our business model is evident, with record revenues, record earnings per share and near record cash from operations. We plan to continue to prudently invest in growing our business, while at the same time, generating strong free cash flow. At this point, I'll turn it over to Tom for his perspective. Tom?"
32052,131690006,131728,"NetApp, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. The NetApp team delivered a very strong close to our fiscal year. With a record number of deals over $1 million and a record number of deals over $5 million, our Q4 results demonstrated our continued momentum i",1402,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. The NetApp team delivered a very strong close to our fiscal year. With a record number of deals over $1 million and a record number of deals over $5 million, our Q4 results demonstrated our continued momentum in the market and expanded presence in some of the largest data centers around the world.
NetApp's innovation leadership continues to be the yardstick by which all other storage vendors are measured and our November product announcements further enhanced our competitive position, leading to our fastest uptake ever of new platforms. We continue to expand the most diversified channel and partner network in the industry, enabling the largest market share gains in our history. The associated supply chain issues experienced in Q3 were resolved during the quarter despite very strong demand and we ended Q4 with near record increases in cash and deferred revenue generation. Our platform refresh of the 3000 and 6000 family in November continued its strong momentum during Q4. The 6000 family saw units increase 86% sequentially and 64% year-over-year.
The 3000 family grew 39% sequentially and 51% year-over-year. The 2000 family was up 11% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, as some demand moved up to the newer 3200 platforms. The V series, which continues to be a compelling vehicle for enabling the introduction of data on tap into new accounts, grew 37% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. In fairness, the 3000 compares were modestly assisted by ending backlog from last quarter due to parts availability issues. To be more specific, the supply constraints were on an I/O expansion module, a new capability of the 3000 family that enables the installation of additional feature cards. The major driver of this demand was a customer preference for additional Flash Cache modules, which increased about 200% from Q4 of last year and are now attached to 2/3 of the 6200s and 1/3 of the 3200s. This is evidence of the rapid adoption of the Flash Cache and Serial ATA drives as a compelling approach to optimizing price performance of storage systems as opposed to the administrative and operational complexity of storage gearing schemes.
The last couple of quarters have seen virtually every storage competitor make announcements about the shipment and promise of new capabilities. From our perspective, the overwhelming majority of the messaging can be summarized with the simple phrase, ""just like NetApp"", as competitors attempt to address NetApp's innovation leadership in the areas of storage efficiency, virtualization, caching, flash integration and unified storage.
While one can debate where the first generation approaches that are inconsistently and incompatibly implemented across multiple platforms realistically narrow the gap, there no longer seems to be any debate about our innovation leadership. In addition to the innovation dimensions I already mentioned, other areas, such as integrated data protection, where NetApp has now become the number one provider of replication software, deduplication for primary storage and secured multi-tenancy remains unchallenged in production environments and we have a roadmap of continued innovation well into the future.
Recent competitor announcements notwithstanding, we remain confident in our competitive position and our sustained market share gains confirm our success. From a geographic year-over-year growth perspective, EMEA grew 15%, Asia Pacific grew 21%, Americas grew 14% and the U.S. Public Sector an incredible 73%. As with prior quarters, the timing of shipments impacts these numbers and U.S. Public Sector is probably a bit overstated, and the APAC and the Americas are understated. Nonetheless, our U.S. Public Sector business remains particularly robust as virtualization and cloud deployments remain a broad governmental priority.
For full transparency, the year-over-year comparisons are slightly enhanced as last Q4 numbers were not adjusted for the mandatory new accounting regulations. Our reference to build the most diversified channels to market continued to have significant impact on the business in Q4 as our indirect business grew to a record 75% of revenue. Our distribution partners, Arrow and Avnet, grew 39% year-over-year to 31% of our total business. Our business with Fujitsu finished the year strongly with 18% growth over last Q4 and our newly acquired Engenio business expands and creates new OEM partnerships. Examples are terra data in the data warehousing and analytics space and at the entry level and server test segments of the market, the IBM and Dell relationships will enable us to achieve product volumes in these price bands that cannot be attained through branded channels of standalone storage companies.
Besides our channel partners, we have accelerated our alliance partner activity as well. Our Accenture relationship continues to expand, along with a significant number of jointly developed practices and solutions with other systems integrators around the world. Our SI relationships continue to thrive as they know that NetApp strategy is to not compete with them for professional services and they also see NetApp becoming more relevant in their existing and targeted accounts. The strong collaboration with VMware and Cisco continues to create an ever-increasing number of joint business opportunities. The past few weeks have been particularly notable as more partners embraced FlexPod. With the recently announced FlexPod integrations with Citrix, Microsoft and SAP, as well as the Microsoft on NetApp and Hyper-V cloud fast-track program, NetApp continues to build out what we call the innovation stack, a tightly integrated set of best-of-breed hardware and software solutions. The NetApp innovation stack now provides customer the largest portfolio of best-of-breed solution offerings of any of our server or storage competitors. The completion of the Engenio acquisition brings an entirely new set of market and channel expansion opportunities for NetApp. Engenio develops a set of building blocks that can be combined with additional technologies to create a number of market solutions. The building blocks can be bundled with NetApp-owned or OEM IP to create solutions for workloads we have not previously served, as well as emerging workloads that will have very large storage requirements in the future.
In addition, the building blocks can be bundled with the OEM partner's IP to create solutions that are brought to market in channels that we previously could not reach. Meanwhile, the positioning of Data ONTAP as the industry's premier platform for our traditional enterprise IT and technical computing markets remains unchanged for our direct sales team and our channel partners. Overall, we are off to a good start with Engenio as the high end has just been refreshed, the first NetApp solutions have been announced. We issued our first quotes and we have communicated our field engagement approach through our existing channels as we seek to expand our relationship with our new OEM partners.
The recent few weeks have brought to a conclusion a number of items that have consumed a great deal of energy in Q4. We resolved the materials availability issues that impacted our Q3. We implemented the mandatory accounting changes and we enclosed the Engenio assets purchase. The closure of these items, in addition to the extreme intensity typical of a Q4, is indicative of the enhanced execution capabilities of the company. With these transitional items behind us, we can concentrate all of our efforts on gaining share in our core business and deriving increasing value from the Engenio acquisition. As fiscal year 2011 comes to a close, we can take a minute but no more than a minute, to reflect on a year of 30% revenue growth, the largest market share gains in our history, a 50% increase in million dollar accounts and the biggest new product launch in our history. I would like to thank the now more than 11,000 NetApp employees for all they have done for our customers, our shareholders, our partners, our community and each other to make these accomplishments possible.
I would like to especially recognize our team in Japan for being an inspiration to all of us in their difficult times. Finally, I want to take the opportunity to welcome the Engenio group to the NetApp team and I look forward to another year of records in fiscal year '12. We also look forward to spending time with the financial community at our Analyst Day on June 30 to help you gain a deeper understanding of our strategy, our financial picture and the scope of our competitive differentiation.
At this point, I will open up the floor to questions. Please limit yourself to one so we may address as many people as possible during our remaining time. Thank you. Operator?"

Our operating expenses are also going to be lower by about 2 percentage points as a percent of revenue and our operating margin is probably about a point lower as a result of the transaction.

As we go through the various different geographies, certainly, Europe, Germany has been strong. Obviously the U.K., the government itself is undergoing a relatively significant austerity and some of the southern European countries for NetApp have not been big markets for us historically. So I think some of the upheaval there has not been as impactful to us and in fact, actually we had pretty good quarters in some of those. So part of my advice to the team is that when you got a little more market share, the macroeconomics don't really matter very much and I think we've been managed to grow and gain share in those segments despite the macro environment. So I think we're making progress there but if we had our traditional market share, I think that clearly it will have some impact on NetApp. But for us, we still see them as opportunities. And historically Asia Pacific is in the same category. I think we're pleased with the growth that we've been seeing with Asia Pacific all year. I think we're making some good progress, but as a percentage of NetApp's revenue, Asia PAC isn't as high as where it needs to be, so I think that that's yet another opportunity for us. So I expect to see next year, some significant growth in APAC, both in terms of our own penetration and also relative to the opportunity that at this point we're underpenetrated."

So I expect that there will be flash in large quantities deployed in the servers and I think there'll be various ways of utilizing it, some simply as a cache, some as effectively permanent storage or effectively like disk drives. So I think as time goes on, I think you'll continue to see innovation, you'll continue to see participation from NetApp in various different dimensions putting cache into these environments, I'm sorry flash into these environments. I expect Flash to be a big deal and I think the Flash Cache has been very, very effective for us and I think we've got aspirations to do more with it as time goes on and you'll see that come up from NetApp over the next couple of years."

We're the market leader. The other thing is unlike some of the other OEMs, I think there's a lot more partnership opportunity with Terra Data and that is we're not going to be in the analytics space. We're not going to compete with them. We have a broader channel and we already had exploratory dialogue about what more can we do from a relationship perspective or a go-to-market perspective. So I don't know what will come of that except to say that I think that Terra Data and NetApp are very, very complimentary in our technologies. I think we both have a lot of momentum and I think that together, we might be able to create some opportunities that we wouldn't be able to have without the Terra Data relationship and Terra Data would not have been able to have without the previous LSI relationship.

However, our initial press in that particular dimension clearly is not going to be in conflict with the OEMs. We're certainly not going to go after the IBM installed base, because clearly that will be detrimental to the relationship. They've got an important base here. So I think the V series represents an opportunity to add value to that installed base but we're going to do it in collaboration with the OEMs, because to try to go around them I think would jeopardize all the OEM business and that's clearly not our intention now. Our intention is to keep the OEM business alive and well and thriving. So for a lot of them, the ability to add V series to their existing installed base is an opportunity to protect their installed base and add more value to that customers and reduce the risk of them being replaced by some joint competitor. So I'd say that the V Series opportunity is not explicitly measured by the number of Engenio products that are out in the field. It's also going to be modulated by our level of cooperation with the OEMs, and at this point, our intention is not to go around them."

So overall, yes, it didn't work out that way but like I said, the U.S. Public Sector in all honesty at 73% is not indicative of that business level either. So we get some distortion on the shipment side, so I think a better way to look at the revenue split is over a smooth basis.

With respect to product mix and customer mix, there was almost no impact last quarter from that. It had a very, very small impact. Cost reductions and pricing is adjustments were in line. So at the end of the day, it turned out to be primarily an impact due solely to the FX. Going forward, I think you can't quite see it because we've added the Engenio business. I don't expect a lot of change to our product margins going forward in our first quarter forecast. I think they're going to hang roughly right where they are.

You get to around -- you get north of 30% for sure and they've been chugging right along.

And so all that's factored into the forecast that we gave. On the other hand, our observation with them is that the business is going to be a very, very opportunistic. The desire by their internal groups to develop their own products makes their positioning very, very complicated and we're happy with the positioning though. On the other hand, our engagement with IBM's customer facing groups, the people who actually have to put solutions in front of customers, that relationship is actually exceptionally strong. So I think that an approach to storage from a pure platform perspective, and basically creating products and NAS products and unified products in a very, very hardware point of view. It's interesting but it's just recreating the fractured product line that's given us an opportunity to gain share. I think what's really important is actually creating solutions for customers. How do we solve virtualization, how do we  solve database, how do we do a virtual desktop, how do we build a cloud, how do we handle high-bandwidth applications and the like, and I think that's where the software value proposition is really what separates us. So I think that there'll be a lot of motion with IBM around their existing products, but I also expect that there's still going to be a lot of customer facing demand for NetApp and it's been that way for the last 5 years. I mean it's really no different today. IBM has introduced products that are competitive with both Engenio and with the NetApp offerings over the years, yet that business still continues to grow, still continues to be robust. So I think we understand. I think our eyes are wide open as are theirs. I think that internal groups looking to compete and develop competitive products. If they truly are competitive and they truly can't compete with our feature set both from a hardware and a software perspective, clearly demand will shift in that direction. But if we continue to outinnovate them and have a higher development gains and introduce products to market faster, then we'll preserve the business. It's no different. It all comes down to innovation and execution excellence. So and it's been that way for the last 5 years and that's the nature of the OEM business."

They're always going to go for the biggest and fastest thing. The other thing about the high end is that I don't necessarily support that language because it means a whole bunch of different things. The large systems that we build serve a bunch of purposes. Some of them are high-performance computing related or around semiconductor and software development. Some of them are around mission-critical enterprise IT, but a lot of it is also content repositories and very, very large drive counts. So all of those have got different dynamics around the high-end platform. The ones that are around enterprise IT in mission-critical applications, typical databases and things like that, those tend to have a longer evaluation cycle and come up with new platforms because they need to be evaluated and tested before they go into production. Some of the other markets, particularly around the content repository and around some of the performance sensitive, they tend to move to new platforms faster. So high end computing in terms of data growth for mission-critical applications, I agree that that's a slow growth markets. On the other hand, the need for the large amounts of data that can be supported by these systems for other types of applications that demand large systems. I think those are growing quite rapidly. And that's why the traditional midrange and high end doesn't mean anything because traditionally high end means things that are connected to mission-critical apps. But we're seeing a lot of demand from very, very large systems that are not mission-critical apps related that are looking for high drive count and high performance and I think that part of the market is alive and well."

I think the Q4 dynamics are kind of hard to read because they represent the culmination of a full year's worth of work, but all year long, the deals in those categories have been very, very strong and just as a practical matter, the number of million-dollar accounts that NetApp grew 50% last year and that didn't all happen in the fourth quarter. So we certainly have the selling dynamics. There's a lot of money at stake. Customers are also expecting us to behave that way and use this as a time to consolidate purchasing power in hopes of getting better discounts and all the normal dynamics that go on.

Independent of the merits of any individual vendor, I think one of the issues that the server vendors have is that at the end of the day, nobody buys storage from a server vendor unless they buy their servers. So step number one, their ability to monetize their storage investments is by the server market share. And the server market share is very volatile and very fluid and probably the least value add component of the stack. So as a result, I think that they're always going to be challenged from an investment point of view and they've all lost a lot of ground. They've all lost a tremendous amount of market share, so effectively reloading by acquiring companies out there that actually have innovated. But I think the same old single dynamic is still at play and the ability to sustain that investment I still think is very much in doubt. So at the end of the day, I think companies like NetApp and EMC for that matter, especially I hate to say it, are actually going to be ongoing innovators because I think we're going to be the only guys that are going to be able to sustain the level of investment to stay competitive. So what I see happening is the companies, the server guys are basically going to use the value proposition that's effectively one of integration, so that they will basically come to the end users with a stack of hardware, software and services as a single support function and basically sell an integration and it's easy to deploy solutions. I think that will be the value proposition that they will promote. Now what the customer's finding is what they're gaining in integration, they're giving up best of breed and they maybe willing to accept that tradeoff or not and those that are willing to accept that tradeoff is why the OEM business matters to us because there's still going to be a set of customers that they can't reach. For those that don't want to make a trade-off, then I think it's incumbent upon us to partner with other best-of-breed players in this industry, whether it be Cisco or Microsoft or VMware and you could see the list building. You've talked about Citrix and a number of other players out there, SAP, and Accenture around professional services. And the idea is that we can come to the customer with something that is every bit as integrated with a common support on the back end and companies that can provide professional services on the front end, then the customer doesn't have to trade off best of breed for integrated solution. They can get something that is actually even more integrated, yet still best of breed. And I think that's the value proposition that we're pushing. So when we talk about FlexPod and EMC talks about Vblock, effectively, the target of those is to compete with the integration value proposition of the server OEMs as effectively that's the only value proposition they have."

And that is we don't quite have it for the full quarter. We have it for 12 or 13 weeks. And one of the things that we're not entirely sure is that any transitional idiosyncrasies that we're going to see on a onetime basis, whether it be the prior owner accelerating revenue, whether it be the sales rep having incentive to do one thing or the other or even the OEMs themselves trying to accelerate business into the prior periods to reduce execution risks. So I think that there's a fair amount of uncertainty around the Engenio business and that's kind of why we gave the guidance that we gave with the wide range around this quarter. So we'll see how that all plays out. So the OEM business I think is clearly going to be moderated or impacted by effectively the quarterly boundaries of the OEMs themselves. So IBM and NCR or our national calendar boundaries, although Dell and some of the other players are not. And LSI were to be on the calendar boundaries as well, so it kind of supported that. So I'm guessing is that I won't commission an accelerated structure. I'd rather distort it a little bit but I still believe that at the end of the day, these products are not built to inventory. There's no channel stuffing. There's none of that going on. So I'd expect some seasonality to stay substantially similar to the seasonality we've previously seen as driven by the OEMs themselves. Now the NetApp branded component of that, which in the first quarter is not going to be very significant but will build over time, I would expect that element of the portfolio to actually move to our calendarization."

From a financial performance standpoint, Q4 put an exclamation point on a very strong FY '11. Despite being hampered by supply constraints through the first half of the quarter, NetApp finished Q4 with solid revenue",1110,"Thanks, Tara. Good afternoon, everyone. From a financial performance standpoint, Q4 put an exclamation point on a very strong FY '11. Despite being hampered by supply constraints through the first half of the quarter, NetApp finished Q4 with solid revenue growth, record earnings per share and new record free cash flow generation. As you can see from our financial statements, NetApp also adopted the required new accounting standards for revenue recognition this quarter and recast the previous 3 quarters' financial statements under the new standards. As a result, the numbers I will reference for all periods in FY '11 and going forward reflect this new accounting methodology.
The change in accounting treatment of revenue complicates the evaluation of our performance relative to the Q4 guidance we gave last quarter, which was for revenue to finish at $1.38 billion, plus or minus 2%. This guidance implies sequential revenue growth of 7% to 11%. With the adoption of the new accounting standards in Q4, the only apples-to-apples comparison we have to assess Q4's revenue performance is the actual 11% sequential revenue growth reported under the new methodology.
This sequential growth rate corresponds to the high end of our guidance range for revenue. With this new methodology, it's important to remember that revenue value is neither created nor destroyed. There is simply a modest impact from the timing of when certain revenue elements are recognized. Because there is 0 revenue impact over the total life of a multielement arrangement, our business model remains unchanged. Finally, with the adoption of the new rules, our revenue recognition is now comparable to all major competitors who have adopted this convention about a year ago. 
Turning now to our results. As I mentioned, total revenue grew 11% sequentially to $1.428 billion in Q4. More importantly, product revenue grew 14% sequentially to about $960 million, the second highest sequential growth rate in the past 5 years.
Non-GAAP gross margins declined modestly to 65.5%, in line with our expectation. Product margins also finished the quarter in line with what we were expecting. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 14% sequentially, up more than forecasted in Q3 due primarily to higher commission expenses, reflecting the strength of our core business. We ended Q4 with 454 net new employees which does not include the folks we welcomed from Engenio as the transaction closed post Q4. 
As I highlighted earlier, the underlying business dynamics in Q4 were very strong. Our total units shipped were up 29% year-over-year despite material constraints through the middle of the quarter. The material constraints contributed to a back end loaded shipment profile, which in turn, drove our accounts receivables days sales outstanding to 47 days. With the material supply constraints solved for Q1 FY '12, we are expecting a more linear shipment quarter and a reduction in DSO to the high 30s in Q1. 
One of the biggest highlights of the quarter was our cash generation. Despite the increase in accounts receivable DSOs, our strong net profit and large increase in deferred revenue yielded a near record $459 million in cash from operations, with free cash flow finishing at $386 million.
Our cash and investments rose to $5.2 billion in Q4 and deferred revenue grew 21% year-over-year, up $243 million from last quarter. 
Our diluted share count declined by 2.7 million shares sequentially to about 404 million shares, driven primarily by the effect that a lower average quarterly stock price has on the accounting for our convertible notes and warrants. With the average closing price of $51.23 in Q4, approximately 15 million additional shares are included in the dilutive share count to account for the impact of the notes, and another 8 million additional shares account for the warrants sold as part of the original transaction.
You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged, while the warrants were not hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedge, then the non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.01 higher. You will find a table on our website which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices.
Looking forward, our target revenue range for Q1 is $1.5 billion, plus or minus 3%, which implies approximately 2% to 8% sequential growth and 26% to 34% year-over-year growth. This guidance includes revenue from the Engenio business. Consolidated non-GAAP gross margins are expected to finish Q1 at just over 62% as the OEM business from Engenio is now included in our results. We anticipate that non-GAAP operating margin will finish at about 18% to 18.5%. Dilutive share count will likely continue to be significantly impacted by the accounting for convertible notes and warrants. We expect dilutive share count to rise to roughly 410 million shares in Q1, which includes about 16 million shares from the convertible debt and 9 million shares from the warrant. 
Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset, bringing our earnings per share estimates to approximately $0.52 to $0.57 per share. Bear in mind, as we told you when the acquisition was announced, the first quarter EPS includes about $0.01 dilution due to the consolidation of the Engenio business. Since we cannot accurately predict what the average stock price will be for the full quarter, the dilutive share count was calculated using the $52.98 average share price from the first 10 business days of this quarter. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible bond hedge, that would add about $0.02 to the EPS guidance.
It should be noted that we are expecting our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to 18.5% in FY '12. The vast majority of this increase reflects our expectation that the distribution of pretax profits will shift slightly next year, such that a greater proportion of pretax profits will be realized in the U.S. and subject to a higher corporate tax rate. The primary drivers of this shift are our core business, where the U.S. is growing faster than our international business, and the consolidation of the Engenio business, which has a higher concentration of pretax profits in the U.S. 
To summarize, we are very pleased with the strong growth in our product revenue despite the supply constraints in the first half of the quarter. The strength of our business model is evident, with record revenues, record earnings per share and near record cash from operations. We plan to continue to prudently invest in growing our business while at the same time generating strong free cash flow. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Tom for his perspective. Tom?"
32052,131690006,131765,"NetApp, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. The NetApp team delivered a very strong close to our fiscal year. With a record number of deals over $1 million and a record number of deals over $5 million, our Q4 results demonstrated our continued momentum i",1402,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. The NetApp team delivered a very strong close to our fiscal year. With a record number of deals over $1 million and a record number of deals over $5 million, our Q4 results demonstrated our continued momentum in the market and expanded presence in some of the largest data centers around the world.
NetApp's innovation leadership continues to be the yardstick by which all other storage vendors are measured and our November product announcements further enhanced our competitive position, leading to our fastest uptake ever of new platforms. 
We continue to expand the most diversified channel and partner network in the industry, enabling the largest market share gains in our history. The associated supply chain issues experienced in Q3 were resolved during the quarter despite very strong demand and we ended Q4 with near record increases in cash and deferred revenue generation. 
Our platform refresh of the 3000 and 6000 family in November continued its strong momentum during Q4. The 6000 family saw units increase 86% sequentially and 64% year-over-year. The 3000 family grew 39% sequentially and 51% year-over-year. The 2000 family was up 11% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, as some demand moved up to the newer 3200 platforms. The V-Series, which continues to be a compelling vehicle for enabling the introduction of Data ONTAP into new accounts, grew 37% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. 
In fairness, the 3000 compares were modestly assisted by ending backlog from last quarter due to parts availability issues. To be more specific, the supply constraints were on an I/O expansion module, a new capability of the 3000 family that enables the installation of additional feature cards. The major driver of this demand was the customer preference for additional Flash Cache modules, which increased about 200% from Q4 of last year and are now attached to 2/3 of the 6200s and 1/3 of the 3200s. 
This is evidence of the rapid adoption of the Flash Cache and serial ATA drives as a compelling approach to optimizing price performance of storage systems as opposed to the administrative and operational complexity of storage tearing schemes.
The last couple of quarters have seen virtually every storage competitor make announcements about the shipment and promise of new capabilities. From our perspective, the overwhelming majority of the messaging can be summarized with the simple phrase, ""just like NetApp"", as competitors attempt to address NetApp's innovation leadership in the areas of storage efficiency, virtualization, caching, flash integration and unified storage.
While one can debate whether the first generation approaches that are inconsistently and incompatibly implemented across multiple platforms realistically narrow the gap, there no longer seems to be any debate about our innovation leadership. 
In addition to the innovation dimensions I already mentioned, other areas such as integrated data protection, where NetApp has now become the number one provider of replication software, deduplication for primary storage and secured multi-tenancy remain unchallenged in production environments and we have a roadmap of continued innovation well into the future. Recent competitor announcements notwithstanding, we remain confident in our competitive position, and our sustained market share gains confirm our success. 
From a geographic year-over-year growth perspective, EMEA grew 15%, Asia Pacific grew 21%, Americas grew 14% and the U.S. Public Sector an incredible 73%. As with prior quarters, the timing of shipments impacts these numbers and U.S. Public Sector is probably a bit overstated and the APAC and the Americas are understated. Nonetheless, our U.S. Public Sector business remains particularly robust as virtualization and cloud deployments remain a broad governmental priority. For full transparency, the year-over-year comparisons are slightly enhanced as last Q4 numbers were not adjusted for the mandatory new accounting regulations. 
Our reference to build the most diversified channels to market continued to have significant impact on the business in Q4 as our indirect business grew to a record 75% of revenue. Our distribution partners, Arrow and Avnet, grew 39% year-over-year to 31% of our total business. Our business with Fujitsu finished the year strongly with 18% growth over last Q4, and our newly acquired Engenio business expands and creates new OEM partnerships. Examples are Teradata in the data warehousing and analytics space and at the entry level and server test segments of the market, the IBM and Dell relationships will enable us to achieve product volumes in these price bands that cannot be attained through branded channels of standalone storage companies.
Besides our channel partners, we have accelerated our alliance partner activity as well. Our Accenture relationship continues to expand, along with a significant number of jointly developed practices and solutions with other systems integrators around the world. Our SI relationships continue to thrive as they know that NetApp strategy is to not compete with them for professional services and they also see NetApp becoming more relevant in their existing and targeted accounts. The strong collaboration with VMware and Cisco continues to create an ever-increasing number of joint business opportunities. 
The past few weeks have been particularly notable as more partners embraced FlexPod. With the recently announced FlexPod integrations with Citrix, Microsoft and SAP, as well as the Microsoft on NetApp and Hyper-V Cloud Fast Track program, NetApp continues to build out what we call the innovation stack, a tightly integrated set of best-of-breed hardware and software solutions. The NetApp innovation stack now provides customers the largest portfolio of best-of-breed solution offerings of any of our server or storage competitors. 
The completion of the Engenio acquisition brings an entirely new set of market and channel expansion opportunities for NetApp. Engenio develops a set of building blocks that can be combined with additional technologies to create a number of market solutions. The building blocks can be bundled with NetApp-owned or OEM IP to create solutions for workloads we have not previously served, as well as emerging workloads that will have very large storage requirements in the future.
In addition, the building blocks can be bundled with the OEM partner's IP to create solutions that are brought to market in channels that we previously could not reach. 
Meanwhile, the positioning of Data ONTAP as the industry's premier platform for our traditional enterprise IT and technical computing markets remains unchanged for our direct sales team and our channel partners. Overall, we are off to a good start with Engenio as the high end has just been refreshed, the first NetApp solutions have been announced, we issued our first quotes and we have communicated our field engagement approach through our existing channels as we seek to expand our relationship with our new OEM partners.
The recent few weeks have brought to a conclusion a number of items that have consumed a great deal of energy in Q4. We resolved the materials availability issues that impacted our Q3. We implemented the mandatory accounting changes. And we enclosed the Engenio assets purchase. The closure of these items, in addition to the extreme intensity typical of a Q4, is indicative of the enhanced execution capabilities of the company. With these transitional items behind us, we can concentrate all of our efforts on gaining share in our core business and in deriving increasing value from the Engenio acquisition. 
As fiscal year 2011 comes to a close, we can take a minute but no more than a minute, to reflect on a year of 30% revenue growth, the largest market share gains in our history, a 50% increase in million dollar accounts and the biggest new product launch in our history. I would like to thank the now more than 11,000 NetApp employees for all they have done for our customers, our shareholders, our partners, our community and to each other to make these accomplishments possible. I would like to especially recognize our team in Japan for being an inspiration to all of us in their difficult times. Finally, I want to take the opportunity to welcome the Engenio group to the NetApp team, and I look forward to another year of records in fiscal year '12. We also look forward to spending time with the financial community at our Analyst Day on June 30 to help you gain a deeper understanding of our strategy, our financial picture and the scope of our competitive differentiation.
At this point, I will open up the floor to questions. Please limit yourself to one so we may address as many people as possible during our remaining time. Thank you. Operator?"

Indeed, we think that there's been about a 3 percentage point impact on our gross margins as a company as a result of the Engenio transaction and you see that in the first quarter. Our operating expenses are also going to be lower by about 2 percentage points as a percent of revenue. And our operating margin is probably about a point lower as a result of the transaction.

As we go through the various different geographies, certainly, Europe, Germany has been strong. Obviously the U.K., the government itself is undergoing a relatively significant austerity and some of the Southern European countries for NetApp have not been big markets for us historically. So I think some of the upheaval there has not been as impactful to us. And in fact, actually we had pretty good quarters in some of those. So part of my advice to the team is that when you got little more market share, the macroeconomics don't really matter very much. And I think we've been managed to grow and gain share in those segments despite the macro environment. So I think we're making progress there but if we had our traditional market share, I think that clearly that would have some impact on NetApp. But for us, we still see them as opportunities. And I sort of put of Asia Pacific in the same category. I think we're pleased with the growth that we've been seeing with Asia Pacific all year. I think we're making some good progress, but as a percentage of NetApp's revenue, Asia Pac isn't as high as where it needs to be, so I think that that's yet another opportunity for us. So I expect to see next year, some significant growth in APAC, both in terms of our own penetration and also relative to the opportunity that at this point we're underpenetrated."

And this is an opportunity for us to participate in that segment with the market leader. The other thing is unlike perhaps some of the other OEMs, I think there's a lot more partnership opportunity with Teradata, and that is we're not going to be in the analytics space. We're not going to compete with them. We have a broader channel and we've already had exploratory dialogue about what more can we do from a relationship perspective or on a go-to-market perspective. So I don't know what will come of that except to say that I think that Teradata and NetApp are very, very complementary in our technologies. I think we both have a lot of momentum and I think that together, we might be able to create some opportunities that we wouldn't be able to have without the Teradata relationship and Teradata would not have been able to have without -- with the previous LSI relationship.

However, our initial thrust in that particular dimension clearly is not going to be in conflict with the OEMs. We're certainly not going to go after the IBM installed base because clearly that will be detrimental to the relationship. They've got an important phase here. So I think the V-Series represents an opportunity to add value to that installed base but we're going to do it in collaboration with the OEMs because to try to go around them I think would jeopardize all the OEM business and that's clearly not our intention now. Our intention is to keep the OEM business alive and well and thriving. So for a lot of them, the ability to add V-Series to their existing installed base is an opportunity to protect their installed base and add more value to that customers and reduce the risk of them being replaced by some joint competitor. So I'd say that the V-Series opportunity is not explicitly measured by the number of Engenio products that are out in the field. It's also going to be modulated by our level of cooperation with the OEMs, and at this point, our intention is not to go around them."

FX was just not as favorable in the fourth quarter as it was in the third and we saw that coming. So that was based -- that was built into our forecast. So that's the single biggest thing. With respect to product mix and customer mix, there was almost no impact last quarter from that. It had a very, very small impact. Cost reductions and pricing adjustments were in line. So at the end of the day, it turned out to be primarily an impact due solely to the FX. Going forward, I think -- you can't quite see it because we've added the Engenio business. I don't expect a lot of change to our product margins going forward in our first quarter forecast. I think they're going to hang roughly right where they are.

But if you took the average of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, I think the third quarter was up 6%, the fourth quarter was up 73%. You get to around -- you get north of 30% for sure and they've been chugging right along. The U.S. commercial team is doing extremely well, particularly penetrating new channels and developing those new channels, broadening out those new channels. All of that's adding to the U.S. growth. The Europe vision has been challenged a little bit, particularly Southern Europe, but even some of the bigger countries with the sovereign debt issues that are going out of there and some of the uncertainty, so we've probably been a little cautious in that area.

And certainly all that's factored into the forecast that we gave. On the other hand, our observation with them is that the business is going to be a very, very opportunistic. The desire by their internal groups to develop their own products makes the positioning very, very complicated, and we're happy with the positioning though. On the other hand, our engagement with IBM's customer facing groups, the people who actually have to put solutions in front of customers, that relationship is actually exceptionally strong. So I think that an approach to storage from a pure platform perspective and basically creating SAN products and NAS products and unified products in a very, very hardware point of view, it's interesting but it's just recreating the fractured product line that's given us an opportunity to gain share. I think what's really important is actually creating solutions for customers. How do we solve virtualization, how do we solve database, how do we do a virtual desktop, how do we build a cloud, how do we handle high bandwidth applications and the like. And I think that's where the software value proposition is really what separates us. So I think that there'll be a lot of motion with IBM around their existing products. But I also expect that there's still going to be a lot of customer facing demand for NetApp, and it's been that way for the last 5 years. I mean, it's really no different today. IBM has introduced products that are competitive with both Engenio and with the NetApp offerings over the years, yet that business still continues to grow, it still continues to be robust. So I think we understand. I think our eyes are wide open as are theirs. I think that internal groups are looking to compete and develop competitive products. If they truly are competitive and they truly can compete with our feature set both from a hardware and a software perspective, clearly demand will shift in that direction. But if we continue to out-innovate them and have a higher development gains and introduce products to market faster, then we'll preserve the business. It's no different. It all comes down to innovation and execution excellence. And it's been that way for the last 5 years and that's the nature of the OEM business."

They're always going to go for the biggest and fastest thing. The other thing about the high end is that I don't necessarily support that language because it means a whole bunch of different things. The large systems that we build serve a bunch of purposes. Some of them are high-performance computing related or around semiconductor and software development. Some of them are around mission-critical enterprise IT, but a lot of it is also around content repositories and very, very large drive counts. So all of those have got different dynamics around the high-end platform. The ones that are around enterprise IT and mission-critical applications, typical databases and things like that, those tend to have a longer evaluation cycle and come up with new platforms because they need to be evaluated and tested before they go into production. Some of the other markets, particularly around the content repository and around some of the performance sensitive, they tend to move to new platforms faster. So high-end computing in terms of data growth for mission-critical applications, I agree that that's a slow growth market. On the other hand, the need for large amounts of data that can be supported by these systems for other types of applications that demand large systems, I think those are growing quite rapidly. And that's why the traditional midrange and high end doesn't mean anything because traditionally high end means things that are connected to mission-critical apps. But we're seeing a lot of demand from very, very large systems that are not mission-critical apps related that are looking for high drive count and high performance. And I think that part of the market is alive and well."

I think the Q4 dynamics are kind of hard to read because they represent the culmination of a full year's worth of work. But all year long, the amount of deals in those categories have been very, very strong. And just as a practical matter, the number of million-dollar accounts that NetApp has then grew 50% last year and that didn't all happen in the fourth quarter. So we certainly have the selling dynamics. There's a lot of money at stake. Customers are also expecting us to behave that way and use this as a time to consolidate purchasing power in hopes of getting better discounts and all the normal dynamics that go on.

It's not going to be available to either our direct or indirect, outside of either special circumstances or whether it's bundled with NetApp hardware. So as far as the high-end product is concerned, the companies that sell that, the various OEM partners that sell that continue to do that, assure that we're not going to be attacking them in their core business. So our focus is going to be on a set of new workloads that we talked about, whether it be a dupe around the analytics space, which we recently announced, and obviously full motion video. So as far as this being a new product, it's really the -- I kind of distract myself it's either the sixth generation or the seventh generation. So it's not a new architecture. It's not a new design. It's basically an evolution of existing design, substantially, the same code base with new hardware underneath it.

Independent of the merits of any individual vendor, I think one of the issues that the server vendors have is that at the end of the day, nobody buys storage from a server vendor unless they buy their servers. So step number one, their ability to monetize their storage investments is throttled by the server market share. And the server market share is very volatile and very fluid and probably the least value add component of the stack. So as a result, I think that they're always going to be challenged from an investment point of view. And they've all lost a lot of ground. They've all lost a tremendous amount of market share. So they're effectively reloading by acquiring companies out there that actually have innovated. But I think the same old dynamic is still at play. And the ability to sustain that investment I still think is very much in doubt. So at the end of the day, I think companies like NetApp and EMC for that matter, especially I hate to say it, are actually going to be the ongoing innovators because I think we're going to be the only guys that are going to be able to sustain the level of investment to stay competitive. So what I see happening is the companies, the server guys are basically going to use the value proposition that's effectively one of integration, that they will basically come to the end users with a stack of hardware, software and services with a single support function and basically sell an integration -- integrated, easy to deploy solution. I think that will be the value proposition they will promote. Now what the customers find is what they're gaining in integration, they're giving up in best of breed. And they maybe willing to accept that trade-off or not. And those that are willing to accept that trade-off is why the OEM business matters to us because there's still going to be a set of customers that they can't reach. For those that don't want to make the trade-off, then I think it's incumbent upon us to partner with other best-of-breed players in this industry, whether it be Cisco or Microsoft or VMware and you could see the list building. We talked about Citrix and there will be a number of other players out there, SAP, and Accenture around professional services. And the idea is that we can come to the customer with something that is every bit is integrated with a common support on the back end and companies that can provide professional services on the front end, then the customer doesn't have to trade off best of breed for integrated solution. They can get something that is actually even more integrated yet still best of breed. And I think that's the value proposition that we're pushing. So when we talk about FlexPod and EMC talks about Vblock, effectively, the target of those is to basically compete with the integration value proposition of the server OEMs because effectively, that's the only value proposition they have."

So any color on that would be appreciated. And second, how should we think about the seasonality of your Engenio business going forward. If I remember correctly, they were part a of LSI, and if I remember correctly, LSI had a December year end. How did the year end bonuses structure to the salespeople over there gets changed such that the seasonality and the patterns in that business start matching your own core versus still mimic LSI's?"

So it's identical. But, Ittai, I would not point you towards consolidated revenue because I think the deferred elements, which are really artifacts of history, distort it. I think what you have to look at is product revenue. And over the past 5 years, the 5-year average of product revenue transition from fourth to first, the sequential growth, fourth to first is down 10.7%. This guidance is down 7.5%. In fact, this is the second best quarter we're having in the past 5 years. It's the second best first quarter we're having in the past 5 years."

And one of which is reflected in the guidance that we're giving this quarter. And that is we don't quite have it for the full quarter. We have it for 12 of the 13 weeks. And one of the things that we're not entirely sure of is are there any transitional idiosyncrasies that we're going to see on a onetime basis, whether it be the prior owner accelerating revenue, whether it be the sales rep having incentive to do one thing or the other or even the OEMs themselves trying to accelerate business into the prior periods to reduce execution risks. So I think that there's a fair amount of uncertainty around the Engenio business and that's kind of why we gave the guidance that we gave with the wide range around this quarter. So we'll see how that all plays out. So the OEM business, I think, is clearly going to be moderated or impacted by effectively the quarterly boundaries of the OEMs themselves. So IBM and NCR or on natural calendar boundaries, although Dell and some of the other players are not. And LSI was indeed on the calendar boundaries as well, so it kind of supported that. So I'm guessing is that our own commission and accelerator structure are going to distort it a little bit, but I still believe that at the end of the day, these products are not built to inventory. There's no channel stuffing. There's none of that going on. So I would expect the seasonality to stay substantially similar to the seasonality that they've previously seen because they'll be driven by the OEMs themselves. Now the NetApp branded component of that, which in the first quarter is not going to be very significant but will build over time, I would expect that element of the portfolio to actually move to our calendarization."

They clearly focus on design wins and winning next generation platforms but driving close end demand is always a challenge to them. So the fact that they've gone this period of time, I don't think that's going to change the dynamic very much. A lot of their compensation scheme is related to design wins which are asynchronous to their quarterly boundaries."

32052,131690006,131772,"NetApp, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tara. Good afternoon, everyone. From a financial performance standpoint, Q4 put an exclamation point on a very strong FY '11. Despite being hampered by supply constraints through the first half of the quarter, NetApp finished Q4 with solid revenue",1110,"Thanks, Tara. Good afternoon, everyone. From a financial performance standpoint, Q4 put an exclamation point on a very strong FY '11. Despite being hampered by supply constraints through the first half of the quarter, NetApp finished Q4 with solid revenue growth, record earnings per share and new record free cash flow generation. As you can see from our financial statements, NetApp also adopted the required new accounting standards for revenue recognition this quarter and recast the previous 3 quarters' financial statements under the new standards. As a result, the numbers I will reference for all periods in FY '11 and going forward reflect this new accounting methodology.
The change in accounting treatment of revenue complicates the evaluation of our performance relative to the Q4 guidance we gave last quarter, which was for revenue to finish at $1.38 billion, plus or minus 2%. This guidance implies sequential revenue growth of 7% to 11%. With the adoption of the new accounting standards in Q4, the only apples-to-apples comparison we have to assess Q4's revenue performance is the actual 11% sequential revenue growth reported under the new methodology.
This sequential growth rate corresponds to the high end of our guidance range for revenue. With this new methodology, it's important to remember that revenue value is neither created nor destroyed. There is simply a modest impact from the timing of when certain revenue elements are recognized. Because there is 0 revenue impact over the total life of a multi-element arrangement, our business model remains unchanged. Finally, with the adoption of the new rules, our revenue recognition is now comparable to all major competitors who have adopted this convention about a year ago. 
Turning now to our results. As I mentioned, total revenue grew 11% sequentially to $1.428 billion in Q4. More importantly, product revenue grew 14% sequentially to about $960 million, the second highest sequential growth rate in the past 5 years.
Non-GAAP gross margins declined modestly to 65.5%, in line with our expectations. Product margins also finished the quarter in line with what we were expecting. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 14% sequentially, up more than forecasted in Q3 due primarily to higher commission expenses, reflecting the strength of our core business. We ended Q4 with 454 net new employees, which does not include the folks we welcomed from Engenio as the transaction closed post Q4. 
As I highlighted earlier, the underlying business dynamics in Q4 were very strong. Our total units shipped were up 29% year-over-year despite material constraints through the middle of the quarter. The material constraints contributed to a back end loaded shipment profile which in turn, drove our accounts receivables days sales outstanding to 47 days. With the material supply constraints solved for Q1 FY '12, we are expecting a more linear shipment quarter and a reduction in DSO to the high 30s in Q1. 
One of the biggest highlights of the quarter was our cash generation. Despite the increase in accounts receivable DSOs, our strong net profit and large increase in deferred revenue yielded a near record $459 million in cash from operations, with free cash flow finishing at $386 million.
Our cash and investments rose to $5.2 billion in Q4 and deferred revenue grew 21% year-over-year, up $243 million from last quarter. 
Our diluted share count declined by 2.7 million shares sequentially to about 404 million shares, driven primarily by the effect that a lower average quarterly stock price has on the accounting for our convertible notes and warrants. With the average closing price of $51.23 in Q4, approximately 15 million additional shares are included in the dilutive share count to account for the impact of the notes, and another 8 million additional shares account for the warrants sold as part of the original transaction.
You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged, while the warrants were not hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedge, then the non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.01 higher. You will find a table on our website which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices.
Looking forward, our target revenue range for Q1 is $1.5 billion, plus or minus 3%, which implies approximately 2% to 8% sequential growth and 26% to 34% year-over-year growth. This guidance includes revenue from the Engenio business. Consolidated non-GAAP gross margins are expected to finish Q1 at just over 62%, as the OEM business from Engenio is now included in our results. We anticipate that non-GAAP operating margins will finish at about 18% to 18.5%. Dilutive share count will likely continue to be significantly impacted by the accounting for convertible notes and warrants. We expect dilutive share count to rise to roughly 410 million shares in Q1, which includes about 16 million shares from the convertible debt and 9 million shares from the warrant. 
Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset, bringing our earnings per share estimates to approximately $0.52 to $0.57 per share. Bear in mind, as we told you when the acquisition was announced, the first quarter EPS includes about $0.01 dilution due to the consolidation of the Engenio business. Since we cannot accurately predict what the average stock price will be for the full quarter, the dilutive share count was calculated using the $52.98 average share price from the first 10 business days of this quarter. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible bond hedge, that would add about $0.02 to the EPS guidance.
It should be noted that we are expecting our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to 18.5% in FY '12. The vast majority of this increase reflects our expectation that the distribution of pretax profits will shift slightly next year, such that a greater proportion of pretax profits will be realized in the U.S. and subject to a higher corporate tax rate. The primary drivers of this shift are our core business, where the U.S. is growing faster than our international business, and the consolidation of the Engenio business, which has a higher concentration of pretax profits in the U.S. 
To summarize, we are very pleased with the strong growth in our product revenue despite the supply constraints in the first half of the quarter. The strength of our business model is evident with record revenues, record earnings per share and near record cash from operations. We plan to continue to prudently invest in growing our business while at the same time generating strong free cash flow. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Tom for his perspective. Tom?"
32052,131690006,131772,"NetApp, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, May 25, 2011",2011-05-25,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. The NetApp team delivered a very strong close to our fiscal year. With a record number of deals over $1 million and a record number of deals over $5 million, our Q4 results demonstrated our continued momentum i",1401,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. The NetApp team delivered a very strong close to our fiscal year. With a record number of deals over $1 million and a record number of deals over $5 million, our Q4 results demonstrated our continued momentum in the market and expanded presence in some of the largest data centers around the world.
NetApp's innovation leadership continues to be the yardstick by which all other storage vendors are measured and our November product announcements further enhanced our competitive position, leading to our fastest uptake ever of new platforms. 
We continue to expand the most diversified channel and partner network in the industry, enabling the largest market share gains in our history. The associated supply chain issues experienced in Q3 were resolved during the quarter despite very strong demand and we ended Q4 with near record increases in cash and deferred revenue generation. 
Our platform refresh of the 3000 and 6000 family in November continued its strong momentum during Q4. The 6000 family saw units increase 86% sequentially and 64% year-over-year. The 3000 family grew 39% sequentially and 51% year-over-year. The 2000 family was up 11% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, as some demand moved up to the newer 3200 platforms. The V-Series, which continues to be a compelling vehicle for enabling the introduction of Data ONTAP into new accounts, grew 37% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. 
In fairness, the 3000 compares were modestly assisted by ending backlog from last quarter due to parts availability issues. To be more specific, the supply constraints were on an I/O expansion module, a new capability of the 3000 family that enables the installation of additional feature cards. The major driver of this demand was the customer preference for additional Flash Cache modules which increased about 200% from Q4 of last year and are now attached to 2/3 of the 6200s and 1/3 of the 3200s. 
This is evidence of the rapid adoption of the Flash Cache and serial ATA drives as a compelling approach to optimizing price performance of storage systems as opposed to the administrative and operational complexity of storage tearing schemes.
The last couple of quarters have seen virtually every storage competitor make announcements about the shipment and promise of new capabilities. From our perspective, the overwhelming majority of the messaging can be summarized with the simple phrase, ""just like NetApp"", as competitors attempt to address NetApp's innovation leadership in the areas of storage efficiency, virtualization, caching, flash integration and unified storage.
While one can debate whether the first generation approaches that are inconsistently and incompatibly implemented across multiple platforms realistically narrow the gap, there no longer seems to be any debate about our innovation leadership. 
In addition to the innovation dimensions I already mentioned, other areas such as integrated data protection, where NetApp has now become the number one provider of replication software, deduplication for primary storage and secured multi-tenancy remain unchallenged in production environments and we have a roadmap of continued innovation well into the future. Recent competitor announcements notwithstanding, we remain confident in our competitive position, and our sustained market share gains confirm our success. 
From a geographic year-over-year growth perspective, EMEA grew 15%, Asia Pacific grew 21%, Americas grew 14% and the U.S. Public Sector an incredible 73%. As with prior quarters, the timing of shipments impacts these numbers and U.S. Public Sector is probably a bit overstated and the APAC and the Americas are understated. Nonetheless, our U.S. Public Sector business remains particularly robust as virtualization and cloud deployments remain a broad governmental priority. For full transparency, the year-over-year comparisons are slightly enhanced as last Q4 numbers were not adjusted for the mandatory new accounting regulations. 
Our reference to build the most diversified channels to market continued to have significant impact on the business in Q4, as our indirect business grew to a record 75% of revenue. Our distribution partners, Arrow and Avnet, grew 39% year-over-year to 31% of our total business. Our business with Fujitsu finished the year strongly with 18% growth over last Q4, and our newly acquired Engenio business expands and creates new OEM partnerships. Examples are Teradata in the data warehousing and analytics space and at the entry level and server test segments of the market, the IBM and Dell relationships will enable us to achieve product volumes in these price bands that cannot be attained through branded channels of standalone storage companies.
Besides our channel partners, we have accelerated our alliance partner activity as well. Our Accenture relationship continues to expand, along with a significant number of jointly developed practices and solutions with other systems integrators around the world. Our SI relationships continue to thrive, as they know that NetApp strategy is to not compete with them for professional services and they also see NetApp becoming more relevant in their existing and targeted accounts. The strong collaboration with VMware and Cisco continues to create an ever-increasing number of joint business opportunities. 
The past few weeks have been particularly notable as more partners embraced FlexPod. With the recently announced FlexPod integrations with Citrix, Microsoft and SAP, as well as the Microsoft on NetApp and Hyper-V Cloud Fast Track program, NetApp continues to build out what we call the innovation stack, a tightly integrated set of best-of-breed hardware and software solutions. The NetApp innovation stack now provides customers the largest portfolio of best-of-breed solution offerings of any of our server or storage competitors. 
The completion of the Engenio acquisition brings an entirely new set of market and channel expansion opportunities for NetApp. Engenio develops a set of building blocks that can be combined with additional technologies to create a number of market solutions. The building blocks can be bundled with NetApp-owned or OEM IP to create solutions for workloads we have not previously served, as well as emerging workloads that will have very large storage requirements in the future.
In addition, the building blocks can be bundled with the OEM partner's IP to create solutions that are brought to market in channels that we previously could not reach. 
Meanwhile, the positioning of Data ONTAP as the industry's premier platform for our traditional enterprise IT and technical computing markets remains unchanged for our direct sales team and our channel partners. Overall, we are off to a good start with Engenio as the high end has just been refreshed, the first NetApp solutions have been announced, we issued our first quotes and we have communicated our field engagement approach through our existing channels as we seek to expand our relationship with our new OEM partners.
The recent few weeks have brought to a conclusion a number of items that have consumed a great deal of energy in Q4. We resolved the materials availability issues that impacted our Q3, we implemented the mandatory accounting changes and we closed the Engenio assets purchase. The closure of these items, in addition to the extreme intensity typical of a Q4, is indicative of the enhanced execution capabilities of the company. With these transitional items behind us, we can concentrate all of our efforts on gaining share in our core business and in deriving increasing value from the Engenio acquisition. 
As fiscal year 2011 comes to a close, we can take a minute, but no more than a minute, to reflect on a year of 30% revenue growth, the largest market share gains in our history, a 50% increase in million dollar accounts and the biggest new product launch in our history. I would like to thank the now more than 11,000 NetApp employees for all they have done for our customers, our shareholders, our partners, our community and each other to make these accomplishments possible. I would like to especially recognize our team in Japan for being an inspiration to all of us in their difficult times. Finally, I want to take the opportunity to welcome the Engenio group to the NetApp team, and I look forward to another year of records in fiscal year '12. We also look forward to spending time with the financial community at our Analyst Day on June 30 to help you gain a deeper understanding of our strategy, our financial picture and the scope of our competitive differentiation.
At this point, I will open up the floor to questions. Please limit yourself to one so we may address as many people as possible during our remaining time. Thank you. Operator?"

Indeed, we think that there's been about a 3-percentage point impact on our gross margins as a company as a result of the Engenio transaction and you see that in the first quarter.

As we go through the various different geographies, certainly Europe, Germany has been strong. Obviously the U.K., the government itself is undergoing a relatively significant austerity and some of the Southern European countries for NetApp have not been big markets for us historically. So I think some of the upheaval there has not been as impactful to us. And in fact, actually we had pretty good quarters in some of those. So part of my advice to the team is that when you've got more market share, the macroeconomics don't really matter very much. And I think we've been managed to grow and gain share in those segments despite the macro environment. So I think we're making progress there but if we had our traditional market share, I think that clearly that would have some impact on NetApp. But for us, we still see them as opportunities. And I sort of put Asia Pacific in the same category. I think we're pleased with the growth that we've been seeing with Asia Pacific all year. I think we're making some good progress but as a percentage of NetApp's revenue, Asia Pac isn't as high as where it needs to be, so I think that that's yet another opportunity for us. So I expect to see next year some significant growth in APAC, both in terms of our own penetration and also relative to the opportunity that at this point we're underpenetrated."

And this is an opportunity for us to participate in that segment with the market leader. The other thing is unlike perhaps some of the other OEMs, I think there's a lot more partnership opportunity with Teradata, and that is we're not going to be in the analytics space. We're not going to compete with them. We have a broader channel and we've already had exploratory dialogue about what more can we do from a relationship perspective or on a go-to-market perspective. So I don't know what will come of that except to say that I think that Teradata and NetApp are very, very complementary in our technologies. I think we both have a lot of momentum and I think that together, we might be able to create some opportunities that we wouldn't be able to have without the Teradata relationship and Teradata would not have been able to have without -- with the previous LSI relationship.

However, our initial thrust in that particular dimension clearly is not going to be in conflict with the OEMs. We're certainly not going to go after the IBM installed base, because clearly that would be detrimental to the relationship. I think we're in an important phase here. So I think the V-Series represents an opportunity to add value to that installed base, but we're going to do it in collaboration with the OEMs because to try to go around them I think would jeopardize all the OEM business and that's clearly not our intention now. Our intention is to keep the OEM business alive and well and thriving. So for a lot of them, the ability to add V-Series to their existing installed base is an opportunity to protect their installed base and add more value to their customers and reduce the risk of them being replaced by some joint competitor. So I'd say that the V-Series opportunity is not explicitly measured by the number of Engenio products that are out in the field. It's also going to be modulated by our level of cooperation with the OEMs, and at this point, our intention is not to go around them."

With respect to product mix and customer mix, there was almost no impact last quarter from that. It had a very, very small impact. Cost reductions and pricing adjustments were in line. So at the end of the day, it turned out to be primarily an impact due solely to the FX. Going forward, I think -- you can't quite see it because we've added the Engenio business, I don't expect a lot of change to our product margins going forward in our first quarter forecast.

But if you took the average of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, I think the third quarter was up 6%, the fourth quarter was up 73%. You get to around -- you get north of 30% for sure and they've been chugging right along. The U.S. commercial team is doing extremely well, particularly penetrating new channels and developing those new channels, broadening out those new channels. All of that's adding to the U.S. growth. Europe as you know has been challenged a little bit, particularly Southern Europe, but even some of the bigger countries with the sovereign debt issues that are going on over there and some of the uncertainty, so we've probably been a little cautious in that area.

And certainly all that's factored into the forecast that we gave. On the other hand, our observation with them is that the business is going to be a very, very opportunistic. The desire by their internal groups to develop their own products makes the positioning very, very complicated. And are we happy with the positioning? No. On the other hand, our engagement with IBM's customer facing groups, the people who actually have to put solutions in front of customers, that relationship is actually exceptionally strong. So I think that an approach to storage from a pure platform perspective and basically creating SAN products and NAS products and unified products in a very, very hardware point of view is interesting, but it's just recreating the fractured product line that's given us an opportunity to gain share. I think what's really important is actually creating solutions for customers. How do we solve virtualization, how do we solve database, how do we do virtual desktop, how do we build a cloud, how do we handle high bandwidth applications and the like. And I think that's where the software value proposition is really what separates us. So I think that there'll be a lot of motion with IBM around their existing products. But I also expect that there's still going to be a lot of customer facing demand for NetApp, and it's been that way for the last 5 years. I mean, it's really no different today. IBM has introduced products that are competitive with both Engenio and with the NetApp offerings over the years, yet this business still continues to grow, it still continues to be robust. So I think we understand. I think our eyes are wide open as are theirs. I think that internal groups are looking to compete and develop competitive products and if they truly are competitive and they truly can compete with our feature set both from a hardware and a software perspective, clearly demand will shift in that direction. But if we continue to out-innovate them and have a higher development gains and introduce products to market faster, then we'll preserve the business. It's no different. It all comes down to innovation and execution excellence. And it's been that way for the last 5 years and that's the nature of the OEM business."

The other thing about the high end is that I don't necessarily support that language because it means a whole bunch of different things. The large systems that we build serve a bunch of purposes. Some of them are high-performance computing related around semiconductor and software development. Some of them are around mission-critical enterprise IT, but a lot of it is also around content repositories and very, very large drive counts. So all of those have got different dynamics around the high-end platform. The ones that are around enterprise IT and mission-critical applications, typical databases and things like that, those tend to have a longer evaluation cycle and come up with new platforms because they need to be evaluated and tested before they go into production. Some of the other markets, particularly around the content repository and around some of the performance sensitive, they tend to move to new platforms faster. So high-end computing in terms of data growth for mission-critical applications, I agree that that's a slow growth market. On the other hand, the need for large amounts of data that can be supported by these systems for other types of applications that demand large systems, I think those are growing quite rapidly. And that's why the traditional midrange and high end doesn't mean anything, because traditionally high end means things that are connected to mission-critical apps. But we're seeing a lot of demand from very, very large systems that are not mission-critical apps related that are looking for high drive count and high performance. And I think that part of the market is alive and well."

I think the Q4 dynamics are kind of hard to read because they represent the culmination of a full year's worth of work. But all year long the amount of deals in those categories have been very, very strong. And just as a practical matter, the number of million-dollar accounts that NetApp has then grew 50% last year and that didn't all happen in the fourth quarter. So we certainly have the selling dynamics. There's a lot of money at stake. Customers are also expecting us to behave that way and use this as a time to consolidate purchasing power in hopes of getting better discounts and all the normal dynamics that go on. But I wouldn't say -- if there was a market trend underneath, then I'd say it was probably matched by the fact that it was all fourth quarter.

But I want to be really clear is that we are not jeopardizing any of the positioning of Data ONTAP in our core markets. Data ONTAP is the core product. This is not going to overlap. It's not going to be available to either our direct or indirect, outside of either special circumstances or whether it's bundled with NetApp hardware. So as far as the high-end product is concerned, the companies that sell that, the various OEM partners that sell that continue to do that, assure that we're not going to be attacking them in their core business. So our focus is going to be on a set of new workloads that we talked about, whether it be Hadoop around the analytics space which we recently announced, and obviously full motion video. So as far as this being a new product, it's really the -- I kind of lose track myself. It's either the sixth generation or the seventh generation. So it's not a new architecture. It's not a new design. It's basically an evolution of existing design, substantially the same code base with new hardware underneath it. So I'm confident in the maturity of the design team and I'm confident in the maturity of the architecture.

Independent of the merits of any individual vendor, I think one of the issues that the server vendors have is that at the end of the day, nobody buys storage from a server vendor unless they buy their servers. So step number one, their ability to monetize their storage investments is throttled by the server market share. And the server market share is very volatile and very fluid and probably the least value add component of the stack. So as a result, I think that they're always going to be challenged from an investment point of view. And they've all lost a lot of ground. They've all lost a tremendous amount of market share. So they're effectively reloading by acquiring companies out there that actually have innovated. But I think the same old dynamics are still at play. And the ability to sustain that investment I still think is very much in doubt. So at the end of the day, I think companies like NetApp and EMC for that matter, especially I hate to say it, are actually going to be the ongoing innovators because I think we're going to be the only guys that are going to be able to sustain the level of investment to stay competitive. So what I see happening is the companies, the server guys are basically going to use the value proposition that's effectively one of integration, that they will basically come to the end users with a stack of hardware, software and services with a single support function and basically sell an integration -- integrated, easy to deploy solution. I think that'll be the value proposition they will promote. Now what the customers find is what they're gaining in integration, they're giving up in best of breed and they may be willing to accept that trade-off or not. And those that are willing to accept that trade-off is why the OEM business matters to us because there's still going to be a set of customers that they can't reach. For those that don't want to make the trade-off, then I think it's incumbent upon us to partner with other best-of-breed players in this industry, whether it be Cisco or Microsoft or VMware and you could see the list building. We talked about Citrix and there will be a number of other players out there, SAP, and Accenture around professional services. And the idea is that if we can come to the customer with something that is every bit as integrated with a common support on the back end and companies that can provide professional services on the front end, then the customer doesn't have to trade off best of breed for an integrated solution. They can get something that is actually even more integrated yet still best of breed, and I think that's the value proposition that we're pushing. So when we talk about FlexPod and EMC talks about Vblock, effectively, the target of those is to basically compete with the integration value proposition of the server OEMs because effectively, that's the only value proposition they have."

And second, how should we think about the seasonality of your Engenio business going forward. If I remember correctly, they were part of LSI and if I remember correctly, LSI had a December year end. How did the year-end bonuses structure to the salespeople over there get changed such that the seasonality and the patterns in that business start matching your own core versus still mimic LSI's?"

So it's identical. But I would not point you towards consolidated revenue because I think the deferred elements, which are really artifacts of history, distort it. I think what you have to look at is product revenue. And over the past 5 years, the 5-year average of product revenue transition from fourth to first, or sequential growth fourth to first, is down 10.7%. This guidance is down 7.5%. In fact, this is the second best quarter we're having in the past 5 years. It's the second best first quarter we're having in the past 5 years."

And one of which is reflected in the guidance that we're giving this quarter. And that is we don't quite have it for the full quarter. We have it for 12 of the 13 weeks. And one of the things that we're not entirely sure of is are there any transitional idiosyncrasies that we're going to see on a onetime basis, whether it be the prior owner accelerating revenue, whether it be the sales reps having incentive to do one thing or the other or even the OEMs themselves trying to accelerate business into the prior periods to reduce execution risks. So I think that there's a fair amount of uncertainty around the Engenio business and that's kind of why we gave the guidance that we gave with the wide range around this quarter. So we'll see how that all plays out. So the OEM business, I think, is clearly going to be moderated or impacted by effectively the quarterly boundaries of the OEMs themselves. So IBM and NCR are on natural calendar boundaries, although Dell and some of the other players are not. And LSI was indeed on the calendar boundaries as well, so it kind of supported that. So I'm guessing is that our own commission and accelerator structure are going to distort it a little bit, but I still believe that at the end of the day, these products are not built to inventory. There's no channel stuffing. There's none of that going on. So I would expect the seasonality to stay substantially similar to the seasonality that they've previously seen because they'll be driven by the OEMs themselves. Now the NetApp branded component of that, which in the first quarter is not going to be very significant but will build over time, I would expect that element of the portfolio to actually move to our calendarization."

NetApp achieved mixed results this quarter after getting off to an extremely strong start during the first 2 months. Unfortunately, business softened dramatically during the last few weeks of July under the weight of the debt ceiling crisis and the macroeconomic uncertainty. Our growth rate in July ended up at about half of our growth rate in May. As a result, our revenue came in at the bottom end of our targeted range. However, non-GAAP EPS was at the midpoint of our target helped by stronger margins. 
As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in June, moving forward, we will focus our color commentary on the performance of our total OEM revenue, our total NetApp branded revenue and our total consolidated revenue. In some markets, the distinctions between the branded E-Series and branded FAS may blur. And as a result, we will be focusing on optimizing the total branded revenues. In the case of OEM revenue, our large accounts such as IBM, may see a shift in the mix between our FAS offering and E-Series OEM offerings and some OEM customers may even in carry both product families in the future. Bottom line, we feel that understanding revenues from a branded, OEM and total perspective is the most useful way to assess our performance. 
Our E-Series OEM revenue performance was a bright spot this quarter coming in well above plan at $157 million in revenue with better-than-expected product cost performance. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margins were also a bright spot coming in about 0.5 point higher than our expectations despite slightly slower revenue. Moreover, non-GAAP product margins were in line with the model we presented at our Analyst Day despite the larger-than-forecasted amount of E-Series OEM revenue in the mix. Remember, E-Series OEM revenue carries a significantly lower gross margin profile that our NetApp branded products. 
The strength of our product margins is indicative of the strength of our competitive position. In addition, the improving product cost and the positive implications for the margin synergies we discussed at Analyst Day are beginning to make a way to the earnings statement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses declined more than we had forecast in Q1. Expenses benefited from better-than-anticipated operating efficiencies as well as lower-than-anticipated costs in several areas of engineered integration. The combination of favorable gross margin performance and operating expense performance drove our operating margins slightly above our expectation. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $4.7 billion in cash and in the short-term investments as the highlight. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased to 37 days from the 47 days reported in Q4 with 90% of the accounts receivable balance in the current category. The deferred revenue balance increased $68 million sequentially and grew 23% year-over-year. The effect of the Engenio acquisition is minor for most balance sheet category but the largest impact can be observed on goodwill and other intangibles net and of course, our cash balance. As a reminder, we spent $480 million to acquire LSI's engineering assets. 
Relative to typical Q1, cash generation was very solid this quarter. Remember in Q1, the company always makes the annual payout for our incentive compensation program and the payout for the Q4 commission. These 2 large payouts always depress Q1 cash flow performance. And this year, they drove a $200 million in accrued compensation. Despite this, cash from operations at $241 million increased 36% from the same period last year. 
Free cash flow finished the quarter at $142.3 million. Our diluted share count increased 1.9 million shares sequentially to about 406 million shares. The average closing price of NetApp shares in Q1 was very similar to Q4, thus the accounting for our convertible notes and warrants have the minimal sequential impact. Approximately 15 million shares are included in the dilutive share count to account for the impact of the note and another 8 million shares account for the warrant sold as part of the original transaction. You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged while the warrants were not hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedged, then non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.02 higher. You can find a table on our website, which shows the impact on the diluted share count for a range of stock prices. 
Looking forward, our target revenue range for Q2 is $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which implies approximately 3% to 10% sequential growth and 20% to 28% year-over-year growth. Consolidated non-GAAP gross margins are expected to finish at around 63.5%. We anticipate that non-GAAP operating margins will finish in a tight band around 18.5%, bringing our earnings per share estimates to approximately $0.58 to $0.62 per share. 
Diluted share count is forecasted to decline to about 392 million shares in Q2 based on our average stock price of $43.04 for the first 10 days of the quarter. This will include about 10 million shares from the convertible notes and 2 million shares from the warrant. Remember that the favorable impact of the note hedges was not included as an offset. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible note hedged, that would add about $0.01 to the EPS guidance. We do plan to continue our stock repurchase program this quarter. However, the details of the repurchase has not been finalized. Therefore, the potential impact is not included in the share count guidance. 
We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at approximately 18.7% in FY '12, up slightly from our Analyst Day guidance. This is based upon the distribution of our pretax profit between the U.S. and overseas as well as the exploration of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. 
To summarize, the fundamentals of our business remains solid, the E-Series OEM program got off to a great start in the first quarter, demonstrating the resiliency of this OEM revenue. Our business model showed its underlying strength as we achieved our operating margin and EPS target despite some revenue softness. In terms of the full year, it's just too early to tell whether we will need to modify the revenue targets we laid out at our Analyst Day. and Asia/Pac business levels were robust in Q1 but remains to be seen whether the U.S. levels recover. It will depend upon whether broader, economic stability occurs in the coming months. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to take a moment to comment on my upcoming retirement. It's been a goal of mine to retire by the time I'm 60 and that milestone is just around the corner. I look forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing a number of personal interests, which always took second priority while working full time. Over the next 4.5 months, my CFO responsibility will remain the same and I will be working with Nick to ensure a smooth transition as part of our planned succession. Nick has made tremendous contributions to the organization during his tenure and I have the utmost confidence in his abilities. you'll be in great hands come the first of 2012. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?"

Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Steve for his tremendous contributions and strategic counsel over the past 9 years and also to congratulate Nick on his promotion. Both are well-deserved.",1293,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Steve for his tremendous contributions and strategic counsel over the past 9 years and also to congratulate Nick on his promotion. Both are well-deserved. But Steve had not retired yet and I do not expect improvements in his golf game until next year. 
Turning now to the business. As Steve described, we exited Q4 with strong momentum and that continued into Q1. Even without the new E-Series products in combination of April and May were the strongest consecutive bookings growth quarters in the year. We entered the month of July with forecast and results well ahead of our expectations despite the geographical balance being uneven. APAC and EMEA bookings were especially strong. Americas commercial was on track but U.S. federal is behind. 
Over the course of July, the International business remains strong but the Federal business struggled to catch up with a backdrop of the debt ceiling dispute. However, July also brought some weakness in our business in the U.S. particularly in the Financial Services sector. We had 24 U.S. firms in our major accounts program, 6 of them were in financial services. All 6 of them saw bookings declines from Q1 of last year. Despite the weakness in U.S. federal and financial services, we did see strength in other parts of the Americas with very strong growth in our state, local and higher education group, our telco and service provider group and in the channel. 
We also had our second highest ever Storage 5000 new customer acquisition quarter. Although anticlimactic, Q1 actually ended up as the third consecutive quarter of increasing year-over-year bookings growth in the organic NetApp business. However, the trajectory weakened as the last month was roughly half the growth rate of the first, causing us to come in lower than what we had anticipated. Economic conditions remain uncertain but they are clearly than they were 90 days ago. It is in the context of the July and early August business climate that we based our Q2 guidance. 
Despite some sector weakness in our core business, we are pleased with the initial quarter of our new E-Series. Operationally, we booked and shipped product on the day the deal closed and transition costs were lower than expected, while product cost performance was better than expected. We closed our first Full Motion Video Deal, a deal we did not we with our FAS product. And last week, we closed a nearly $14 million branded E-Series  deal in the high-performance computing space. 
We are still learning the monthly cadence of the OEM side of the business but have finished ahead of our overall expectations. It also included a new product release from one of our larger partners and a commitment from Oracle to continue the OEM relationship. 
Overall, with our first quarter of business behind us, the internal execution as well as the help of both the OEM and branded E-Series businesses are positive. Our channels to market continue to serve as a source of strength and a differentiator for NetApp in both FAS and E-Series. We believe we have the most diversified go-to-market motion in the industry and the best relationships with our partners of all the major storage vendors. 
Our indirect channels grew to 76% of revenue assisted by the inclusion of the E-Series OEM. Keep in mind that the addition of E-Series thus changed the mix analysis somewhat for several facets of the business, including channels, geographies and disk drive capacity trends. Our NetApp contributed 56% of our total revenue, up 21% year-over-year. Total OEM contribution was 15% of total revenue in Q1. This includes E-Series OEM and the prior OEM sales with IBM and Fujitsu. 
In addition to our channel development, our partnerships and alliances continue to grow and deepen. We now have active codevelopment programs going on with Microsoft, VMware and Oracle. This quarter, we nearly doubled the number of our FlexPod customers to over 300. FlexPod is a suite of highly integrated modular and validated solutions offered in collaboration with Cisco, VMware, Microsoft, Citrix and SAP. We are seeing a notable uptrend in FlexPod average deal size in the Americas accounts and a number of installations around the world continues to grow. We believe the innovations stacks built around NetApp's offerings provides customers the largest portfolio of best-of-breed solutions of any of our server or storage competitors. 
On the product side, gross margins remained strong in all areas, an indication that despite market headwinds, our competitive position and the value proposition remain intact. The growth of our new product platforms continues to be incredibly robust and has contributed to the margin strength. Our 6000 Series delivered record high revenues and a record number of units shipped this quarter. Our 3000 Series was also very strong, contributing over half of all FAS platform revenue with volume of units shipped second only to last quarter's record level. Our 2000 Series saw a decline from both last quarter and the year ago quarter. We believe this is due in part to migration to the low end of the newer 3000 family, as well as the drop in the public sector business this quarter with units of the 2000 Series shipped to the Federal Government down over 20% from a year ago. However, the volume-oriented demand remains strong as evidenced by the growth of our distribution partners and our General Territory business. Lastly, our E-Series continues to be solid, especially as a vehicle to enter new accounts with growth of over 30% year-over-year. 
We remain confident in our competitive products and our positioning in the market. We see strong differentiation and customer interest in our storage efficiency offerings, our ability to enable users to rearchitect their datacenters to maximize the use of virtualization and the private cloud, and our ability to allow them to optimize their environments using our unique tiering approach that offers superior price performance, reduce complexity and limited administration overhead. 
The new E-Series platforms open new work roads and big bandwidth and analytics and will continue to see new innovation brought to market, including beta of  SAP 8.1 as the year progresses. 
Overall, the July slowdown notwithstanding, the business performance has been strong. The June IDC numbers showed us gaining 2.7 points of share in the first calendar quarter of 2011, the biggest gain in our history. We've had 9 months of accelerating bookings performance in the organic NetApp business. We had a second highest level of new Storage 5000 customer acquisitions in Q1 and a number of million dollar deals was up substantially over Q1 of last year. Despite a very positive indicators of our market momentum, the sector weaknesses of July made the internal goals we set for ourselves unattainable. 
Looking ahead, the environment remains unsettled and macroeconomic forecasting is beyond our scope. Internally, our approach is essentially unchanged and our focus remains on continued market share gains. In the last downturn, following the financial crisis, we found economic pressures forcing customers to consider new options. With our competitors and competency weakened and with our compelling innovation to help customers, we achieved record new customer acquisitions, creating a more diversified customer set and position us for best-in-class growth when the market improved. While due caution is influencing our guidance, we are still innovating on our roadmap, doubling down on our areas of strength to enable us to continue to gain share and position the company for continued growth in the future.

I think at this point in time, the trajectory of the full year guidance is going to be a function of a macro and I don't think that's what we're going to predict. When I think about the guidance we gave, the EPS was already in line so we're certainly not off our EPS trajectory certainly not after one quarter and our revenue certainly is a little bit behind. But if we have some reasonable health of the market, I believe we can close the gap. The July thing was obviously surprising as you can well imagine. We just came off Analyst Day. So the last thing we've done is we didn't believe we would say it would have been hard to pull up Analyst Day but we are in good shape. I mean we exploded out April, we closed last quarter exceptionally strong. We're very pleased with how our last quarter ended. May was very strong so we came out huge. So there was no evidence that we have drained the swap, we have no business to carry into this year. And June was strong so we were rolling. We were ahead on the results. We were ahead on the forecast and we felt really, really good about where we were. But the combination of April and May was the best 60-day period we had in the whole year. So for us, I think we felt pretty good. I mean now what we didn't know at the time, let me be clear, we didn't know at the time that we were a little uneven, the settled business was clearly lagging. And we saw that. But we were overpowering it on the strength of basically the Asia/PAC and the EMEA business. And the feeling was that we don't necessarily have to hit on all 4 cylinders to get there. And we had a lot of confidence in the federal team so we thought they might be able to close the gap as the quarter progressed. But it turns out to be more of a struggling and I don't know whether that ceiling was a factor or not. I want to assume it didn't help us any. But what we didn't expect is the U.S. side of the House weakened as the quarter went on as well. And financial services in particular, I wouldn't go so far as the say they were the only one. But I'd say if you look at our other businesses, we had accounts that are were up or down. Our financial services are affected all 6 of them and our major accounts program was down. It's an indicator that something is going on there that I don't think is specific to NetApp. So it's probably the big wrinkle is the federal team, which as you follow up with our performance dramatically outperforming the industry I do think that they could close the gap and it turned out, they couldn't. But the U.S. surprise was the other one. And while on the other hand, the international business remains strong. I'd say, it's across the U.S. but it wasn't all weak. Our state and local were strong. Our telcos were strong. Our channel was strong. Our new customer acquisition was strong. It's really these large accounts that are specifically financial services."

So I think it's fair. I think the answer to that we probably ask is first and foremost, we used to look inside first. The numbers certainly correspond to weakness that certainly other people are reporting so it's very plausible that would make sense but I think we need to investigate ourselves. So I mean first and foremost, the high-level between is whether it be EMC or HP or IBM or Dell with new offerings. I think it was too sudden and too concentrated to think it was suddenly a competitive issue. And on top of that on the federal side, that's an area where we are very, very strong and none of those guys are reporting competitive losses. If you go beyond that, I think that the margins are strong. So there wasn't any indication that we will see margin degradation. So I think the proximate cause of the shortfall in revenue relative to our plan, I don't believe was competitive. I think the question that we are evaluating is while it might not have been the approximate cost of the revenue shortfall, why are these various products nibbling at us around the edges. And when that becomes relevant is as we need to make an assessment as to whether we think federal and the Americas are going to bounce back quickly. And if we're going to double down with some other area and clearly, understanding the dynamics of those other sectors in the market mattered to us. But I think from a purely competitive perspective, I'd say just the nature of it, the timing, the specificity of it, the fact that a handful of accounts, we have a lot of intelligent visible accounts, I don't think it's competitive. Could there be nibbling around the edges up to the rest of the business that chopped off a little of our upside, perhaps that's what we're looking out at."

I think that ceiling dynamic was a little bit different because they were facing this arbitrary deadline of August 2 and cash, to the extent that that deadline I think might have been in play. But I don't want to too much on that speculate. The bottom line here is I think there's a few moving part on the government. I think we took our best shot and we, ourselves are anticipating that our U.S. Public Sector will be up significantly from this quarter as it typically is. But the dynamic of that business and this year is no different is that a substantial amount of budget is still not allocated to individual projects until the end. And a fair amount of the activity in that business has positioned themselves in the event money becomes available. And for the question that there's really 2 questions. One of them is how much money will be available and what projects will fund and clearly, what agencies and the term whether they're successful or not. So what do I think we are the government being the government they'll find a way to spend all that money, probably a last minute thing but I can put it, which agencies will get what funding."

So as the team grows up from the field here and looking at bookings forecast  and the things like that, that's kind of buried in there and factored in. We know specific vertical forecast certainly, I don't. As far as EMEA, we'll see. I think EMEA is remarkably strong. One of the things about we did go through it in the script is sometimes, there's a little bit of a spread between the bookings performance and the reported revenue performance and the revenues kind of mixed up now between the 2 businesses. But the EMEA booking performance was really strong. Even if you adjust out the currency events, we're very, very pleased with what happened in EMEA and really across all the territories, including the mature ones, the U.K., France and Germany. So I think we are anticipating continued right now but we just did that in the quarter where a certainly the German GDP growth was not that impressive yet we still had a pretty good quarter. So my general sense of the business is we only have these backdrops but I expect to overachieve against the backdrops. So we've been doing it for last year and if Europe is weak, obviously, that's not going to make it easier for us but I expect it will be better than most."

And it doesn't take much of a move in a favorable direction to get us in pretty good shape. So I think we're a long way away from that. Now I think right now trying to extrapolate $50 million, the macro is going to have a bigger lever on driving that one way or the other. The other part of it is the deferred revenue coming off the balance sheet that we built in prior years is going to get stronger as the year goes on so I think we have that buffering in the business. So our business doesn't inch quarter-to-quarter purely on bookings, we also have some underlying -- it's roughly 1/3 to 40% of our revenue is actually coming up the balance sheet. So that gives us some stability both on the revenue side and on the margin side quite frankly. But I think going forward, I mean one thing that -- we were in really good shape midway through the quarter. And in one of our geographies we're behind so I don't think that we need to execute to perfection to get to that number. I just think we need to see some rebound, either a little bit and both to it that underperformed or one of them coming completely back. So as far as the full year, it's way too early to tell.

Yes, we had a couple of slowdown in a couple sector and if deteriorates from here, clearly, we'll change direction. I think if there's one thing we've proven in the last downturn, where we actually got back to our operating plan in one quarter is that we put the brakes on, we can put the brace back on hard but we're not doing it now. I still see there is still way too many pockets where we are outperforming and gaining share as long. As that's the case, we're going to invest in them.

They were just hard to close at some industries than others and then you have this big government overhang, which is completely different.

I may feel that way 90 days from now but it doesn't feel yet that like today. In fact, the government is saying I don't know how much the political overhang is a factor here and we'll just see what happens.

That's not really what's dominating our thought process at this point in time. As I think about market share gains, clearly that's going to be in the context of an overall adequate P&L performance. And we're certainly not going to chase market share gains in all the way into a loss position. And frankly several years ago, we didn't do that. In fact, it was clear that market share gains was there to be had and when the industry was in distress, we actually reduced that and it was one of the few painful layoffs in our history. So it's market share and then price. I just think that we are in a situation where the revenue was a little weak. On the other hand our earnings were right there. Our gross margins were strong. It doesn't feel that we're losing competitive position. There are certain geographies that we're exceptionally strong. Right now, I think what we're probably spending a little bit more time on is, which of these areas are going to come, which ones do we think are going to come back or we let those go for a little while, maintain investment and reinvest in other areas where we have some strength. So I think our aspiration is unless the market deteriorates substantially from where we are today, our goal is to get back to our guidance and even if we have to make it up in other areas. So that's really where we are. And make no mistake to get the market deteriorates and we're dropping and this is just the business to be had and we're going to protect the P&L.

Some of which I think we're probably obviously upside that we're looking for P&L but some of them are very specific internally. And that is we have a clear message to us to the team and that is there's a lot of initiatives we want to pursue but the spending levels are flat. So in the context of a flat investment environment, how are we going to fund these initiatives? And we put a pretty big effort on one of the low yield activities we had underway that we are going to shed so we can move and stop at things that matter going forward. And I think we did that. And other than that, we shed some product line that was painful, we crisp up our market message, I think we did a bunch of things that served us well. So I think that even under the covers of the an investment that is realigning the investments whether it's realigning them geographically to take advantage of market opportunities, whether it's product side. But as far as an ultimate threshold, I would say it depends on what we see happening. If we think it's competitive, we might do one thing. If we think it's a reasonable slowdown, we might do something else. But I don't really want to commit to that number. Our focus is going to be on EPS and clearly, we want to protect the EPS guidance that we just gave. The other thing I think is somewhat in our back pocket which will play out a little at a time. I think the synergies from the acquisitions we just did. I think we're seeing probably the near term supply lines energy of just basically our buying power come into play. I think as time goes on, we'll basically bring them into our manufacturing full and get leverage there as opposed to have a split manufacturing like we did today. And I think in the long run, it's obviously some engineering synergies around common components. So I think that there's Engenio leverage over time that will play out. And we opened out some transition services underway with them because we did not buy an operating business. We just bought assets. So there's still some on the side that we're trying to wind down over time. So I think there's a number of sources of synergies and product even before we think about increasing the OpEx below."

But I'll say that in general, we're not in that state on a worldwide basis yet. So I'm not anticipating any significant pressure from the margin side other than what we would normally see. It's interesting that I took a look at that myself and we actually saw lower discounting in the past quarter than we did in the prior quarter. And it's noticeable we had a slight impact on the gross margins. That's one of the reasons why the product gross margins were stronger. So if it is getting more competitive, we haven't seen it yet.

Very competitive all the time and people will do something to get a footprint in a particular installation or customer side.

So Europe had a very, very good first quarter. That's all there is to it. Now we read the papers everyday like everybody else and it looks like there is storm clouds brewing over there.

But even if they disappear tomorrow, it wouldn't be material. Although we're clearly getting bigger and bigger as each quarter goes by. But the general European trend, the German GDP numbers that we reported this week were a bit of a surprise to me. Because in general, I kind of felt over the last year the Germans in particular were remarkably bullish. In light of everything else that's going on, they're were enormously confident. And I just talked about our sales guidance and about the customers themselves. And we'll see if that confidence is shaken. But in the midst of this relatively low GDP quarter, there's still a lot of stuff and they still show a lot of confidence. So I guess it's just like anything else.

So and that's got applications in many dimensions, including obviously the obvious ones on a purely performance side and the scalability side and content repository side. But the thing that's especially unique about it is that we bring the data management suite and we are bringing it to enterprise customers and traditional business NetApp's and we're marrying that with 2 scale requesting and that's really a going to be the only true platform of its type that's targeted at the enterprise customer. So it's really a monetization of storage for the enterprise customer. Mostly enterprise applications are still running on applications that are 15 to 20 years old. So that is that really is the big push on this and so it will spill over to high-performance computing, it will spill over to high technical computing and a lot of the scalability boundary limits and things like that will be relaxed so make things easier to manage. So value proposition I think is clearly the ability to bring up, value proposition to a greater set of customers and a greater set of applications. For exiting customers, obviously, the manageability and the scalability and the performance and the ability to manage storage as a pool as oppose to individual box. I think we will have tremendous advantages from the complexity perspective or performance perspective. And really the ability to build a virtualized infrastructure, the ability to the broader storage pool to serve a big server that is capable of running multiple apps at the same time and manage security, manage performance, manage capacity, manage cost. So I think from that perspective, that's a generic value proposition whether the industry is up or the industry is down. I think what it will do is it will broaden the applicability of our storage efficiency technologies, our deduplication for primaries which we are still the only player to do that probably, the provisioning, the use of ATA drives. So what we'll be able to do is bring that storage value proposition, which I think will be particularly relevant to the downturn. It's really was the last time. I think the storage efficiency messaging really helped us a lot as the economic to what we are depressed overall my view is I think what I'll do is broadly applicability of the things that do have value in the downturn, which is primarily storage efficiency. But will also open up at least customers and to us that perhaps some markets are concerned about our scalability in the past. So is there anything specific about a downturn that would make this particularly applicable? No, just the ability to play storage efficiency more broadly. But absent that, I think this is a fundamentally different approach to enterprise storage and it's going to be a big departure from what customers have and really deliver what I think is unquestionably the biggest software feature set in the industry and bring that to enterprise app in scale."

I think the big server spend would be less on storage. I really don't know.  I never really see the correlation there. What's interesting about our businesses is that the customer behavior is actually more driven by platform refreshes than there are software refreshes. So think about 8.1 is it's going to run on the platforms that we currently ship so if they make an investment on the platform today and then they can upgrade to 8.1, it isn't like the equipment is obsolete. So from that perspective, I'm not expecting that there's a big way for 8.1 to come along. I just don't see that. If 8.1 only ran on a platform, a new platform that only ran in 8.1 that would be a little different but I just don't think that's the case. So the server thing I think is somewhat irrelevant but what I do think though is the demand tends to flow through towards newer platforms. And I think we see that with the 3000, we see that with the 6000. I mean the 6000 just blew it out. And I think that some of that is people might be buying a new 6000  instead of a couple 3000, sold a couple of 2000s, and then the public sector business hit. If you look at our 2000 family, it kind of goes into a few categories. There are some that goes into the big accounts for like branch office types of things. And that was kind of mediocre, the channel business, which mostly has the midsized enterprise and small businesses, state local governments, was actually strong. And then it was the public sector use, which could be anything from ships to cars to boats to planes to whatever and that was very weak. And that was the big mover on the platform in this quarter."

NetApp achieved mixed results this quarter after getting off to an extremely strong start during the first 2 months. Unfortunately, business softened dramatically during the last few weeks of July under the weight of the debt ceiling crisis and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our growth rate in July ended up at about half of our growth rate in May. As a result, our revenue came in at the bottom end of our targeted range. However, non-GAAP EPS was at the midpoint of our target helped by stronger margins. 
As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in June, moving forward, we will focus our color commentary on the performance of our total OEM revenue, our total NetApp branded revenue and our total consolidated revenue. In some markets, the distinctions between the branded E-Series and branded FAS may blur. And as a result, we'll be focusing on optimizing the total branded revenues. In the case of OEM revenue, a large account such as IBM may see a shift in the mix between our FAS offerings and E-Series OEM offerings, and some OEM customers may even in carry both product families in the future. Bottom line, we feel that understanding revenues from a branded, OEM and total perspective is the most useful way to assess our performance. 
Our E-Series OEM revenue performance was a bright spot this quarter coming in well above plan at $157 million in revenue with better than expected product cost performance. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margins were also a bright spot coming in about 0.5 point higher than our expectations despite slightly softer revenue. Moreover, non-GAAP product margins were in line with the model we presented at our Analyst Day despite the larger than forecasted amount of E-Series OEM revenue in the mix. Remember, E-Series OEM revenue carries a significantly lower gross margin profile that our NetApp branded products. 
The strength of our product margins is indicative of the strength of our competitive position. In addition, the improving product cost and the positive implications it has for the margin synergies we discussed at Analyst Day are beginning to make a way to the earnings statement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses declined more than we had forecast in Q1. Expenses benefited from better than anticipated operating efficiencies as well as lower than anticipated costs in several areas of the Engenio integration. The combination of favorable gross margin performance and operating expense performance drove our operating margins slightly above our expectation. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $4.7 billion in cash and in the short-term investments as the highlight. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased to 37 days from the 47 days reported in Q4 with 90% of the accounts receivable balance in the current category. The deferred revenue balance increased $68 million sequentially and grew 23% year-over-year. The effect of the Engenio acquisition is minor for most balance sheet categories, but the largest impact can be observed on goodwill and other intangibles net, and of course, our cash balance. As a reminder, we spent $480 million to acquire LSI's Engenio assets. 
Relative to typical Q1, cash generation was very solid this quarter. Remember in Q1, the company always makes the annual payout for our incentive compensation program and the payout for the Q4 commission. These 2 large payouts always depress Q1 cash flow performance. And this year, they drove a $200 million reduction in accrued compensation. Despite this, cash from operations at $241 million increased 36% from the same period last year. 
Free cash flow finished the quarter at $142.3 million. Our diluted share count increased 1.9 million shares sequentially to about 406 million shares. The average closing price of NetApp shares in Q1 was very similar to Q4, thus the accounting for our convertible notes and warrants had the minimal sequential impact. Approximately 15 million shares are included in the dilutive share count to account for the impact of the notes, and another 8 million shares account for the warrants sold as part of the original transaction. You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged while the warrants were not hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedged, then non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.02 higher. You can find a table on our website which shows the impact on the diluted share count for a range of stock prices. 
Looking forward, our target revenue range for Q2 is $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which implies approximately 3% to 10% sequential growth and 20% to 28% year-over-year growth. Consolidated non-GAAP gross margins are expected to finish at around 63.5%. We anticipate that non-GAAP operating margins will finish in a tight band around 18.5%, bringing our earnings per share estimates to approximately $0.58 to $0.62 per share. 
Diluted share count is forecasted to decline to about 392 million shares in Q2 based on our average stock price of $43.04 for the first 10 days of the quarter. This will include about 10 million shares from the convertible notes and 2 million shares from the warrants. Remember that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible note hedged, that would add about $0.01 to the EPS guidance. We do plan to continue our stock repurchase program this quarter. However, the details of the repurchase have not been finalized. Therefore, the potential impact is not included in the share count guidance. 
We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at approximately 18.7% in FY '12, up slightly from our Analyst Day guidance. This is based upon the distribution of our pretax profits between the U.S. and overseas as well as the exploration of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. 
To summarize, the fundamentals of our business remain solid, the E-Series OEM program got off to a great start in the first quarter, demonstrating the resiliency of this OEM revenue. Our business model showed its underlying strength as we achieved our operating margin and EPS targets despite some revenue softness. In terms of the full year, it's just too early to tell whether we will need to modify the revenue targets we laid out at our Analyst Day. EMEA and Asia/Pac business levels were robust in Q1, but remains to be seen whether the U.S. levels recover. It will depend upon whether broader, economic stability occurs in the coming months. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to take a moment to comment on my upcoming retirement. It's been a goal of mine to retire by the time I'm 60, and that milestone is just around the corner. I look forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing a number of personal interests, which always took second priority while working full time. Over the next 4.5 months, my CFO responsibilities will remain the same and I will be working with Nick to ensure a smooth transition as part of our planned succession.

Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Steve for his tremendous contributions and strategic counsel over the past 9 years and also to congratulate Nick on his promotion. Both are well deserved.",1296,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Steve for his tremendous contributions and strategic counsel over the past 9 years and also to congratulate Nick on his promotion. Both are well deserved. But Steve had not retired yet, and I do not expect improvements in his golf game until next year. 
Turning now to the business. As Steve described, we exited Q4 with strong momentum and it continued into Q1. Even without the new E-Series products, the combination of April and May were the strongest consecutive bookings growth quarters in the year. We entered the month of July with forecast and results well ahead of our expectations despite the geographical balance being uneven. APAC and EMEA bookings were especially strong. Americas commercial was on track, but U.S. federal is behind. 
Over the course of July, the International business remains strong but the Federal business struggled to catch up with the backdrop of the debt ceiling dispute. However, July also brought some weakness in our business in the U.S. particularly in the Financial Services sector. We had 23 U.S. firms in our major accounts program, 6 of them are in financial services. All 6 of them saw a bookings decline from Q1 of last year. Despite the weakness in U.S. federal and financial services, we did see strength in other parts of the Americas with very strong growth in our state, local and higher education group, our telco and service provider group and in the channel.  We also had our second highest ever Storage 5000 new customer acquisition quarter. Although anticlimactic, Q1 actually ended up as the third consecutive quarter of increasing year-over-year bookings growth in the organic NetApp business. However, the trajectory weakened as the last month was roughly half the growth rate of the first, causing us to come in lower than what we had anticipated. Economic conditions remain uncertain, but they are clearly than they were 90 days ago. It is in the context of the July and early August business climate that we base our Q2 guidance. 
Despite some sector weakness in our core business, we are pleased with the initial quarter of our new E-Series. Operationally, we booked and shipped product on the day the deal closed and transition costs were lower than expected, while product cost performance was better than expected. We closed our first Full-Motion Video deal, a deal we did not win with our FAS product. And last week, we closed a nearly $14 million branded E-Series deal in the high-performance computing space. 
We are still learning the monthly cadence of the OEM side of the business, but it finished ahead of our overall expectations. It also included a new product release from one of our larger partners and a commitment from Oracle to continue the OEM relationship.  Overall, with our first quarter of business behind us, the internal execution, as well as the help of both the OEM and branded E-Series businesses, are positive. 
Our channels to market continue to serve as a source of strength and a differentiator for NetApp in both FAS and E-Series. We believe we have the most diversified go-to-market motion in the industry and the best relationships with our partners of all the major storage vendors. 
Our indirect channels grew to 76% of revenue assisted by the inclusion of the E-Series OEM. Keep in mind that the addition of E-Series does change the mix analysis somewhat for several facets of the business, including channels, geographies and disk drive capacity trends. Our own AppNet contributed 26% of our total revenue, up 21% year-over-year. Total OEM contribution was 15% of total revenue in Q1. This includes E-Series OEM and the prior OEM sales with IBM and Fujitsu. 
In addition to our channel development, our partnerships and alliances continue to grow and deepen. We now have active co-development programs going on with Microsoft, VMware and Oracle. This quarter, we nearly doubled the number of our FlexPod customers to over 300. FlexPod is a suite of tightly integrated modular and validated solutions offered in collaboration with Cisco, VMware, Microsoft, Citrix and SAP. We are seeing a notable uptrend in FlexPod average deal sizes in the Americas accounts and a number of installations around the world continues to grow. We believe the innovations stacks built around NetApp's offerings provides customers the largest portfolio of best-of-breed solutions of any of our server or storage competitors. 
On the product side, gross margins remained strong in all areas, an indication that despite market headwinds, our competitive position and the value proposition remain intact. The growth of our new product platforms continues to be incredibly robust and has contributed to the margin strength. Our 6000 Series delivered record high revenues and a record number of units shipped this quarter. Our 3000 Series was also very strong, contributing over half of all FAS platform revenue with volume of units shipped second only to last quarter's record level. Our 2000 Series saw a decline from both last quarter and the year ago quarter. We believe this is due in part to migration to the low end of the newer 3000 family, as well as a drop in the public sector business this quarter, with units of the 2000 Series shipped to the Federal government down over 20% from a year ago. However, the volume-oriented demand remains strong as evidenced by the growth of our distribution partners and our General Territory business. Lastly, our V-Series continues to be solid, especially as a vehicle to enter new accounts with growth of over 30% year-over-year. 
We remain confident in our competitive products and our positioning in the market. We see strong differentiation and customer interest in our storage efficiency offerings, our ability to enable end users to re-architect their data centers to maximize the use of virtualization in the private cloud, and our ability to allow them to optimize their environments using our unique tiering approach that offers superior price performance, reduce complexity and limited administration overhead. 
The new E-Series platforms open new work loads and big bandwidth and analytics and will continue to see new innovation brought to market, including Data ONTAP 8.1 as the year progresses. 
Overall, the July slowdown notwithstanding, the business performance has been strong. The June IDC numbers showed us gaining 2.7 points of share in the first calendar quarter of 2011, the biggest gain in our history. We have had 9 months of accelerating bookings performance in the organic NetApp business. We had our second highest level of new Storage 5000 customer acquisitions in Q1 and a number of million dollar deals was up substantially over Q1 of last year. Despite the very positive indicators of our market momentum, the sector weaknesses of July made the internal goals we set for ourselves unattainable. 
Looking ahead, the environment remains unsettled and macroeconomic forecasting is beyond our scope. Internally, our approach is essentially unchanged and our focus remains on continued market share gains. In the last downturn, following the financial crisis, we found economic pressures forcing customers to consider new options. With our competitors' incumbency weakened and with our compelling innovation to help customers, we achieved record new customer acquisitions, creating a more diversified customer set and position us for best-in-class growth when the market improved. While due caution is influencing our guidance, we are still innovating on our roadmap, doubling down on our areas of strength to enable us to continue to gain share and position the company for continued growth in the future. 
At this point, I will open up the floor to questions. As always, we ask that you please limit yourself to one so we may address as many people as possible during our remaining time. Thank you. Operator?"

I think at this point in time, the trajectory of the full year guidance is going to be a function of the macro, and I don't think that's what we're going to predict. When I think about the guidance we gave, the EPS was already in line so we're certainly not off our EPS trajectory, certainly not after one quarter and the revenue's certainly a little bit behind. But if we have some reasonable health in the market, I'm more than of the belief that we can close the gap. The July thing was obviously surprising, as you can well imagine. We just came off Analyst Day. So the last thing we've done is that if we didn't believe we were saying, it would have been hard to pull up Analyst Day, but we were in good shape. I mean, we exploded out; April, we closed last quarter exceptionally strong. We're very pleased with how last quarter ended. May was very strong so we came out as huge. So there was no evidence that we had drained the swamp. We had no business to carry into this year. And June was strong so we were rolling. We were ahead on the results. We were ahead on the forecast, and we felt really, really good about where we were. But the combination of April and May was the best 60-day period we had in the whole year. So for us, I think we felt pretty good. Now what we didn't know at the time -- let me be clear, we did know at the time that we were a little uneven. The Federal business was clearly lagging, and we saw that. But we were overpowering it on the strength of basically the Asia/Pac and the EMEA business. And the feeling was that we don't necessarily have to hit on all 4 cylinders to get there. And we have a lot of confidence in the federal team so we thought they might be able to close the gap as the quarter progressed. But it turns out to be more of a struggle, and I don't know whether the debt ceiling was a factor or not. It's probably safe to assume it didn't help us any. But what we didn't expect is the U.S. side of the house weakened as the quarter wore on as well. And financial services, in particular, I wouldn't go so far as the say they were the only one. But I'd say if you look at our other businesses, we have accounts that were up, accounts that were down. Our financial services, the fact that all 6 of them in our major accounts program was down is an indicator that something's going on there that I don't think is specific to NetApp. So it's probably the big wrinkle is the federal team, which as you follow up performance is dramatically outperforming the industry. They thought they could close the gap and turns out they couldn't, but I think the U.S. surprise was the other one. And while on the other hand, the International business remains strong. And the other thing I'd say is across the U.S., it wasn't all weak. Our state and local were strong. Our telcos were strong. Our channel was strong. Our new customer acquisition was strong. It's really around large accounts that are specifically financial services."

And I think it's fair. I think the answer to that we probably ask is first and foremost, we need to look inside first. The numbers certainly correspond to weakness that certainly other people are reporting so it's very plausible that would make sense, but I think we need to investigate ourselves. So I mean, first and foremost, the high-level bet is whether it be EMC or HP or IBM or Dell with new offerings. I think it was too sudden and too concentrated to think it was suddenly a competitive issue. And on top of that, on the federal side, that's an area where we're very, very strong and none of those guys are reporting competitive losses. If you go beyond that, I think that the margins were strong so there wasn't any indication that we will see margin degradation. So I think the proximate cause of the shortfall in revenue relative to our plan, I don't believe was competitive. I think the question that we are evaluating is while it might not have been the approximate cost of the revenue shortfall, what are these various different nibbling at us around the edges. And where that becomes relevant is we need to make an assessment as to whether we think Federal and the Americas are going to bounce back quickly. And if we're going to double down in some other area, and clearly understanding the dynamics of those other sectors in the market matter to us. But I think from a purely competitive perspective, I'd say just the nature of it, the timing, the specificity of it, the fact that the handful of accounts we have, a lot of intelligence into those accounts. I don't think it's competitive. Could there be nibbling around the edges up to the rest of the business that chopped off a little of our upside? Perhaps and that's what we're looking at."

I think the question that nobody's going to know the answer to until October 1 is where are they. Federal spending is reportedly behind and we had different schools of thought, one of was that austerity is coming, and they're going to spend every cent they possibly have now. And there's another school of thought that says austerity is coming and they want to conserve cash now. So we'll see what happens. I think the debt ceiling dynamic was a little bit different because they were facing this arbitrary deadline of August 2 and cash hoarding to extend that deadline, I think, might have been in play. But I don't want to dwell too much on that and speculate. The bottom line here is I think there's a few moving parts on the government. I think we took our best shot. Certainly, we're anticipating that our U.S. Public Sector will be up significantly from this quarter as it typically is. But the dynamic of that business, and this year is no different, is that a substantial amount of budget is still not allocated to individual projects until the end. And a fair amount of the activity in that business has positioned themselves in the event money becomes available. And for the question, there's really 2 questions. One of them is how much money will be available and what projects will it fund. And corollary to that, and what agencies. And that will determine whether we're successful or not. So what do I think? I think the government being the government, they'll find a way to spend all that money. It will probably be a last minute thing, but I can predict which agencies will get what funding."

So as the team rolls up from the field, and we're looking at bookings forecast  and the things of the like, that's kind of buried in there and factored in. We know the specific vertical forecast. Certainly, I don't. As far as EMEA, we'll see. I think EMEA was remarkably strong. One of the things about -- we didn't go through it in the script is sometimes, there's a little bit of a spread between the bookings performance and the reported revenue performance and the revenues kind of mixed up now between the 2 businesses. But the EMEA booking performance was really strong. Even if you adjust out the currency effects, we're very, very pleased with what happened in EMEA and really across all the territories, including the mature ones, the U.K., France and Germany. So I think we're anticipating continued strength. We just did that in the quarter where certainly the German GDP growth was not that impressive yet we still had a pretty good quarter. So my general sense of the business is yes, we have these backdrops, but I expect to overachieve against the backdrops. So we've been doing it for the last year and if Europe's weak, obviously, that's not going to make it easier for us, but I expect us to do better than most."

The other part of it is the deferred revenue coming off the balance sheet that we built in prior years is going to get stronger as the year goes on so I think we have that buffeting in the business. So our business doesn't hinge quarter-to-quarter purely on bookings. We also have some underlying -- it's roughly 1/3 to 40% of our overall revenue is actually coming off the balance sheet. So that gives us some stability both on the revenue side and on the margin side, frankly. But I think going forward, I mean, one thing that was -- we were in really good shape midway through the quarter. And in one of our geographies, we're behind so I don't think that we need to execute to perfection to get to that number. I just think we need to see some rebound, either a little bit in both of the 2 that underperformed or one of them coming completely back. So as far as the full year, it's way too early to tell.

This year, those deferreds that we put on the balance sheet during those growth periods are actually going to stop to create growth for us so we'll actually see roughly 20% growth in the deferreds as the year wears on. So from that perspective, I think we have that base to build on. So if you think about it in terms of what the incremental year-over-year product growth is going to achieve the numbers, it's not quite as intimidating."

That's not really what's dominating our thought process at this point in time. As I think about market share gains, clearly that's going to be in the context of an overall adequate P&L performance. And we're certainly not going to chase market share gains in all the way into a loss position. And frankly several years ago, we didn't do that. In fact, once it was clear that market share gains weren't there to be had and the industry was in distress, we actually reduced OpEx and it was one of the few painful layoffs in our history. So it's market share and then price. I just think that we're in a situation where the revenue was a little weak. On the other hand, our earnings were right there. Our gross margins were strong. It doesn't appear that we're losing competitive position. There are certain geographies where we're exceptionally strong. Right now, I think what we're probably spending a little bit more time on is which of these areas are going to come back, which ones do we think are going to come back or do we kind of let those go for a little while, maintain investment and reinvest in other areas where we have some strength. So I think our aspiration is unless the market deteriorates substantially from where we are today, our goal is to get back to our guidance even if we have to make it up in other areas. So that's really where we are. And make no mistake, if the market deteriorates and we're dropping and if there just isn't business to be had, we're going to protect the P&L. At the very least, try to protect the EPS guidance we gave. But beyond that, as long as we're in the range, we're going to try and find ways to eke out growth out of this environment wherever the opportunity lies."

And I think we have a fair amount of investment leverage and still be able to do that even if the market doesn't materially improve from here. Now a couple years ago, we did a few things, some of which I think were probably obvious to the outside, we're out looking at the P&L, but some of them are very specific internally. And that is we have a clear message to us to the team and that is there's a lot of initiatives we want to pursue, but the spending levels are flat. So in the context of a flat investment environment, how are we going to fund these initiatives? And we put a pretty big effort on one of the low yield activities we had underway that we are going to shed so we can move to stop the things that matter going forward. And I think we did that. And out of that, we shed some product line and it was painful. I think we crisped up our marketing message. I think we did a bunch of things that served us well. So I think that even under the covers of an investment is that realigning the investments, whether it's realigning them geographically to take advantage of market opportunities, whether it's product side. But as far as an ultimate threshold, I would say it depends on what we see happening. If we think it's competitive, we might do one thing. If we think it's a reasonable slowdown, we might do something else. But I don't really want to commit to that number. Our focus is going to be on EPS, and clearly we want to protect the EPS guidance that we just gave. The other thing I think is somewhat in our back pocket, which will play out a little at a time, I think is synergies from the acquisition we just did. I think we're seeing probably the near term supply lines synergy of just basically our buying power coming into play. I think as time goes on, we'll basically bring them into our manufacturing fold and get leverage there as opposed to have split manufacturing like we do today. And I think in the longer run, it's obviously some engineering synergies around common components. So I think that there's Engenio leverage over time that will play out. And we opened up some transition services underway with them because we did not buy an operating business, we just bought assets. So there's still some dependency on the other side that we're trying to wind down over time. So I think there's a number of sources of synergies and reprioritization even before we think about increasing the OpEx envelope."

I think they were saying, ""We don't have any money. We're not going to buy anything."" If it becomes more widespread, then you have the inevitable issue of too much worldwide sales capacity chasing too many deals and limited opportunities that people can't afford to lose any, and as a result, pricing becomes  very competitive. And I wouldn't rule that we'll see some of that in the financial services side if this continues. But I say that, in general, we're not in that state on a worldwide basis yet. So I'm not anticipating any significant pressure from the margin side other than what we normally see. It's interesting that I took a look at that myself and we actually saw lower discounting this past quarter than we did in the prior quarter. And it's noticeable, it had a slight impact on the prior gross margins. That's one of the reasons why the product gross margins are stronger. So if it is getting more competitive, we haven't seen it yet. So I would characterize it the same way I have over the past several years, Bill, is that it is a tough market out there. It is very competitive all the time, and people will do something to get a footprint in a particular installation or customer side.

Teradata was very, very strong. IBM is continuing. We had good conversations with Oracle this quarter and made all the noise. We have commitments from them that this business will continue unchanged. On the branded side, the enthusiasm is very high. There's nothing like a $40 million deal to get people's attention. But even beyond that, the amount of activity, the ability to getting all that stuff through our systems and parts of them because we're shipping the branded stuff out of our systems, not through LSIs, has been a little slow.

But the general European trend, the German GDP numbers that we reported this week were a bit of a surprise to me.

And I'm not just talking about our sales guys, I'm talking about the customers themselves. And we'll see if that confidence is shaken.

And that's got applications in many dimensions, including obviously the obvious ones on the purely performance side and the scalability side and content repository side. But the thing that's especially unique about it is that we bring the data management suite that we're bringing to enterprise customers and traditional business apps, that we're marrying that with true scale and true clustering. That's really going to be the only true platform of its type that's targeted at the enterprise customer. So it's really a monetization of storage for the enterprise customer. Most of the enterprise applications are still running on architectures that are 15 to 20 years old. So that is really the big push on this, and so we will spill over into high-performance computing, it will spill over to technical computing and a lot of the scalability boundary limits and things like that will be relaxed so make things easier to manage. So value proposition, I think, is clearly the ability to bring our broader value proposition to a greater set of customers and a greater set of applications. For existing customers, obviously, the manageability and the scalability and the performance and the ability to manage storage as a pool as opposed to an individual box, I think will have tremendous advantages from a complexity perspective or performance perspective. And really the ability to build a virtualized infrastructure, the ability to the broad storage pool to serve a big server farm that's capable of running multiple apps at the same time and manage security, manage performance, manage capacity, manage cost. So I think from that perspective, I think that's a generic value proposition whether the industry is up or the industry is down. I think what it will do is it will broaden the applicability of our storage efficiency technologies, our deduplication for primaries which we're still the only player to do that broadly, the thin provisioning, the use of ATA drives. So what we'll be able to do is bring that storage value proposition, which I think will be particularly relevant  in the downturn. It certainly was the last time. I think that the storage efficiency messaging really helped us a lot as the economic -- we're depressed. So overall, my view is I think what it'll do is it will broaden the applicability of those things that do have value in a downturn, which is primarily storage efficiency. But it will also open up new sets of customers and new sets of apps to us. But perhaps there are some who are concerned about our scalability in the past. So is there anything specific about a downturn that would make this particularly applicable? No, just the ability to play storage efficiency more broadly. But absent that, I think this is a fundamentally different approach to enterprise storage, and it's going to be a big departure from what customers have and really deliver what I think is unquestionably the biggest software feature set in the industry and bring that to enterprise apps and scale."

I think people are operating under the old rules and basically spending is being modulated at high levels when these things have to be signed off.

I think if they have a big server spend coming up, they might spend less on storage. I don't really know, but I've never really seen the correlation there. What's interesting about our business is that the customer behavior is actually more driven by platform refreshes than they are software refreshes. So the thing about 8.1 is it's going to run on the platforms that we currently ship so if they make an investment on the platform today and then they can upgrade to 8.1, it isn't like the equipment is obsolete. So from that perspective, I'm not expecting that there's a big waiting for 8.1 to come along. I just don't see that. If 8.1 only ran on a platform, a new platform that only ran 8.1, then it would be a little bit different, but I just don't think that's the case. So the server thing, I think, is somewhat irrelevant. But what I do think, though, is that the demand tends to flow towards the newer platforms. And I think we see that with the 3000, we see that with the 6000. I mean, the 6000 just blew it out. And I think that some of that is people might be buying a new 6000 instead of a couple 3000s, to kind of get on the new technology at the high end. I think that some of that's happening to with the 2000s. They'll buy a 3000 instead of a couple of 2000s. And then the public sector business hit. If you look at our 2000 family, it kind of goes into a few categories. There are some that goes into the big accounts for like branch office type of things. And that was kind of mediocre. There's the Channel business, which mostly goes to midsized enterprise and small businesses, state, local governments. That was actually strong. And then there was the public sector use, which could be anything from ships to cars to boats to planes to whatever. And that was very weak.

NetApp achieved mixed results this quarter after getting off to an extremely strong start during the first 2 months. Unfortunately, business softened dramatically during the last few weeks of July under the weight of the debt ceiling crisis and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our growth rate in July ended up at about half of our growth rate in May. As a result, our revenue came in at the bottom end of our targeted range. However, non-GAAP EPS was at the midpoint of our target helped by stronger margins. 
As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in June, moving forward, we will focus our color commentary on the performance of our total OEM revenues, our total NetApp branded revenues and our total consolidated revenues. In some markets, the distinctions between the branded E-Series and branded FAS may blur. And as a result, we'll be focusing on optimizing the total branded revenues. In the case of OEM revenue, a large account such as IBM may see a shift in the mix between our FAS offerings and E-Series OEM offerings, and some OEM customers may even in carry both product families in the future. Bottom line, we feel that understanding revenues from a branded, OEM and total perspective is the most useful way to assess our performance. 
Our E-Series OEM revenue performance was a bright spot this quarter, coming in well above plan at $157 million in revenue with better than expected product cost performance. Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margins were also a bright spot coming in about 0.5 point higher than our expectations despite slightly softer revenue. Moreover, non-GAAP product margins were in line with the model we presented at our Analyst Day despite the larger than forecasted amount of E-Series OEM revenue in the mix. Remember, E-Series OEM revenue carries a significantly lower gross margin profile than our NetApp branded products. 
The strength of our product margins is indicative of the strength of our competitive position. In addition, the improving product cost and the positive implications it has for the margin synergies we discussed at Analyst Day are beginning to make their way to the earnings statement. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses declined more than we had forecast in Q1. Expenses benefited from better than anticipated operating efficiencies, as well as lower than anticipated costs in several areas of the Engenio integration. The combination of favorable gross margin performance and operating expense performance drove our operating margins slightly above our expectation. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $4.7 billion in cash and short-term investments as the highlight. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased to 37 days from the 47 days reported in Q4 with 90% of the accounts receivable balance in the current category. The deferred revenue balance increased $68 million sequentially and grew 23% year-over-year. The effect of the Engenio acquisition is minor for most balance sheet categories, but the largest impact can be observed on goodwill and other intangibles net, and of course, our cash balance. As a reminder, we spent $480 million to acquire LSI's Engenio assets. 
Relative to typical Q1, cash generation was very solid this quarter. Remember, in Q1 the company always makes the annual, payout for our incentive compensation program and the payout for the Q4 commission. These 2 large payouts always depress Q1 cash flow performance. And this year, they drove a $200 million reduction in accrued compensation. Despite this, cash from operations at $241 million increased 36% from the same period last year. 
Free cash flow finished the quarter at $142.3 million. Our diluted share count increased 1.9 million shares sequentially to about 406 million shares. The average closing price of NetApp shares in Q1 was very similar to Q4, thus the accounting for our convertible notes and warrants had minimal sequential impact. Approximately 15 million shares are included in the dilutive share count to account for the impact of the notes, and another 8 million shares account for the warrants sold as part of the original transaction. You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged while the warrants were not hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedge, then non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.02 higher. You can find a table on our website which shows the impact on the diluted share count for a range of stock prices. 
Looking forward, our target revenue range for Q2 is $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which implies approximately 3% to 10% sequential growth and 20% to 28% year-over-year growth. Consolidated non-GAAP gross margins are expected to finish at around 63.5%. We anticipate that non-GAAP operating margins will finish in a tight band around 18.5%, bringing our earnings per share estimates to approximately $0.58 to $0.62 per share. 
Diluted share count is forecasted to decline to about 392 million shares in Q2 based on our average stock price of $43.04 for the first 10 days of the quarter. This will include about 10 million shares from the convertible notes and 2 million shares from the warrants. Remember that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible note hedged, that would add about $0.01 to the EPS guidance. We do plan to continue our stock repurchase program this quarter. However, the details of the repurchase have not been finalized. Therefore, the potential impact is not included in the share count guidance. 
We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at approximately 18.7% in FY '12, up slightly from our Analyst Day guidance. This is based upon the distribution of our pretax profits between the U.S. and overseas, as well as the expiration of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. 
To summarize, the fundamentals of our business remain solid. The E-Series OEM program got off to a great start in the first quarter, demonstrating the resiliency of this OEM revenue. Our business model showed its underlying strength as we achieved our operating margin and EPS targets despite some revenue softness. In terms of the full year, it's just too early to tell whether we will need to modify the revenue targets we laid out at our Analyst Day. EMEA and Asia/Pac business levels were robust in Q1, but remains to be seen whether the U.S. levels recover. It will depend upon whether broader, economic stability occurs in the coming months. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to take a moment to comment on my upcoming retirement. It's been a goal of mine to retire by the time I'm 60, and that milestone is just around the corner. I look forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing a number of personal interests, which always took second priority while working full time. Over the next 4.5 months, my CFO responsibilities will remain the same and I will be working with Nick to ensure a smooth transition as part of our planned succession. Nick has made tremendous contributions to the organization during his tenure, and I have the utmost confidence in his abilities. You will be in great hands come the first of 2012. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?"

Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Steve for his tremendous contributions and strategic counsel over the past 9 years and also to congratulate Nick on his promotion. Both are well deserved. But Steve had not retired yet, and I do not expect improvements in his golf game until next year. 
Turning now to the business. As Steve described, we exited Q4 with strong momentum and it continued into Q1. Even without the new E-Series products, the combination of April and May were the strongest consecutive bookings growth quarters in the year. We entered the month of July with forecasts and results well ahead of our expectations despite the geographical balance being uneven. APAC and EMEA bookings were especially strong. Americas commercial was on track, but U.S. federal is behind. 
Over the course of July, the International business remained strong but the Federal business struggled to catch up with the backdrop of the debt ceiling dispute. However, July also brought some weakness in our business in the U.S., particularly in the Financial Services sector. We had 23 U.S. firms in our major accounts program, 6 of them are in financial services. All 6 of them saw bookings decline from Q1 of last year. Despite the weakness in U.S. federal and financial services, we did see strength in other parts of the Americas with very strong growth in our state, local and higher education group, our telco and service provider group and in the channel.  We also had our second highest ever Storage 5000 new customer acquisition quarter. Although anticlimactic, Q1 actually ended up as the third consecutive quarter of increasing year-over-year bookings growth in the organic NetApp business. However, the trajectory weakened as the last month was roughly half the growth rate of the first, causing us to come in lower than what we had anticipated. Economic conditions remain uncertain, but they are clearly different than they were 90 days ago. It is in the context of the July and early August business climate that we base our Q2 guidance. 
Despite some sector weakness in our core business, we are pleased with the initial quarter of our new E-Series. Operationally, we booked and shipped product on the day the deal closed and transition costs were lower than expected, while product cost performance was better than expected. We closed our first Full-Motion Video deal, a deal we did not win with our FAS product. And last week, we closed a nearly $14 million branded E-Series deal in the high-performance computing space. 
We are still learning the monthly cadence of the OEM side of the business, but it finished ahead of our overall expectations. It also included a new product release from one of our larger partners and a commitment from Oracle to continue the OEM relationship.  Overall, with our first quarter of business behind us, the internal execution, as well as the help of both the OEM and branded E-Series businesses, are positive. 
Our channels to market continue to serve as a source of strength and a differentiator for NetApp in both FAS and E-Series. We believe we have the most diversified go-to-market motion in the industry and the best relationships with our partners of all the major storage vendors. 
Our indirect channels grew to 76% of revenue assisted by the inclusion of the E-Series OEM. Keep in mind that the addition of E-Series does change the mix analysis somewhat for several facets of the business, including channels, geographies and disk drive capacity trends. Arrow and AppNet contributed 26% of our total revenue, up 21% year-over-year. Total OEM contribution was 15% of total revenue in Q1. This includes E-Series OEM and the prior OEM sales with IBM and Fujitsu. 
In addition to our channel development, our partnerships and alliances continue to grow and deepen. We now have active co-development programs going on with Microsoft, VMware and Oracle. This quarter, we nearly doubled the number of our FlexPod customers to over 300. FlexPod is a suite of tightly integrated modular and validated solutions offered in collaboration with Cisco, VMware, Microsoft, Citrix and SAP. We are seeing a notable uptrend in FlexPod average deal sizes in the Americas accounts and the number of installations around the world continues to grow. We believe the innovations stacks built around NetApp's offerings provides customers the largest portfolio of best-of-breed solutions of any of our server or storage competitors. 
On the product side, gross margins remained strong in all areas, an indication that despite market headwinds, our competitive position and the value proposition remain intact. The growth of our new product platforms continues to be incredibly robust and has contributed to the margin strength. Our 6000 Series delivered record high revenues and a record number of units shipped this quarter. Our 3000 Series was also very strong, contributing over half of all FAS platform revenue with volume of units shipped second only to last quarter's record level. Our 2000 Series saw a decline from both last quarter and the year ago quarter. We believe this is due in part to migration to the low end of the newer 3000 family, as well as a drop in the public sector business this quarter, with units of the 2000 Series shipped to the Federal government down over 30% from a year ago. However, the volume-oriented demand remains strong as evidenced by the growth of our distribution partners and our General Territory business. Lastly, our V-Series continues to be solid, especially as a vehicle to enter new accounts with growth of over 30% year-over-year. 
We remain confident in our competitive products and our positioning in the market. We see strong differentiation and customer interest in our storage efficiency offerings, our ability to enable end users to re-architect their data centers to maximize the use of virtualization in the private cloud, and our ability to allow them to optimize their environments using our unique tiering approach that offers superior price performance, reduced complexity and limited administration overhead. 
The new E-Series platforms open new work loads and big bandwidth and analytics and will continue to see new innovation brought to market, including Data ONTAP 8.1 as the year progresses. 
Overall, the July slowdown notwithstanding, the business performance has been strong. The June IDC numbers showed us gaining 2.7 points of share in the first calendar quarter of 2011, the biggest gain in our history. We have had 9 months of accelerating bookings performance in the organic NetApp business. We had our second highest level of new Storage 5000 customer acquisitions in Q1 and the number of million dollar deals was up substantially over Q1 of last year. Despite the very positive indicators of our market momentum, the sector weaknesses of July made the internal goals we set for ourselves unattainable. 
Looking ahead, the environment remains unsettled and macroeconomic forecasting is beyond our scope. Internally, our approach is essentially unchanged and our focus remains on continued market share gains. In the last downturn, following the financial crisis, we found economic pressures forcing customers to consider new options. With our competitors' incumbency weakened and with our compelling innovation to help customers, we achieved record new customer acquisitions, creating a more diversified customer set and positioned us for best-in-class growth when the market improved. While due caution is influencing our guidance, we are still innovating on our roadmap, doubling down on our areas of strength to enable us to continue to gain share and position the company for continued growth in the future. 
At this point, I will open up the floor to questions. As always, we ask that you please limit yourself to one so we may address as many people as possible during our remaining time. Thank you. Operator?"

I think at this point in time, the trajectory of the full year guidance is going to be a function of the macro, and I don't think that's what we're going to predict. When I think about the guidance we gave, the EPS was already in line so we're certainly not off our EPS trajectory, certainly not after one quarter. And the revenue's certainly a little bit behind, but if we have some reasonable health in the market, I'm more than of the belief that we can close the gap. The July thing was obviously surprising, as you can well imagine. We just came off Analyst Day. So the last thing we've done is that if we didn't believe we were saying, it would have been hard to pull up Analyst Day, but we were in good shape. I mean, we exploded out April, we closed last quarter exceptionally strong. We're very pleased with how last quarter ended. May was very strong so we came out of the shoot [ph]. So there was no evidence that we had drained the swamp. We had no business to carry into this year. And June was strong. so we were rolling. We were ahead on the results. We were ahead on the forecast, and we felt really, really good about where we were. But the combination of April and May was the best 60-day period we had in the whole year. So for us, I think we felt pretty good. Now what we didn't know at the time -- let me be clear, we did know at the time that we were a little uneven. The Federal business was clearly lagging, and we saw that. But we were overpowering it on the strength of basically the Asia/Pac and the EMEA business. And the feeling was that we don't necessarily have to hit on all 4 cylinders to get there. And we have a lot of confidence in the federal team so we thought they might be able to close the gap as the quarter progressed. But it turns out to be more of a struggle, and I don't know whether the debt ceiling was a factor or not. It's probably safe to assume it didn't help us any. But what we didn't expect is the U.S. side of the house weakened as the quarter wore on as well. And financial services, in particular, I wouldn't go so far as the say they were the only one. But I'd say if you look at our other businesses, we have accounts that were up, accounts that were down. But financial services, the fact that all 6 of them in our major accounts program was down is an indicator that something's going on there that I don't think is specific to NetApp. So it's probably the big wrinkle is the federal team, which as you follow our performance is dramatically outperforming the industry. They thought they could close the gap and turns out they couldn't, but I think the U.S. surprise was the other one. And while on the other hand, the International business remains strong. And the other thing I'd say is across the U.S., it wasn't all weak. Our state and local were strong. Our telcos were strong. Our channel was strong. Our new customer acquisition was strong. It's really around large accounts that are specifically financial services."

And I think it's fair. I think the answer to that we probably ask is first and foremost, we need to look inside first. The numbers certainly correspond to weakness that certainly other people are reporting so it's very plausible that would make sense, but I think we need to investigate ourselves. So I mean, first and foremost, the high-level bet is whether it be EMC or HP or IBM or Dell with new offerings. I think it was too sudden and too concentrated to think it was suddenly a competitive issue. And on top of that, on the federal side, that's an area where we're very, very strong and none of those guys are reporting competitive losses. If you go beyond that, I think that the margins were strong so there wasn't any indication that we we're seeing margin degradation. So I think the proximate cause of the shortfall in revenue relative to our plan, I don't believe was competitive. I think the question that we are evaluating is while it might not have been the approximate cause of the revenue shortfall, a lot of these various different products nibbling at us around the edges. And where that becomes relevant is we need to make an assessment as to whether we think Federal and the Americas are going to bounce back quickly. And if we're going to double down in some other area, then clearly understanding the dynamics of those other sectors in the market matter to us. But I think from a purely competitive perspective, I'd say just the nature of it, the timing, the specificity of it, the fact that it's a handful of accounts we have, a lot of intelligence into those accounts. I don't think it's competitive. Could there be nibbling around the edges to the rest of the business that chopped off a little of our upside? Perhaps and that's what we're looking at."

I think the question that nobody's going to know the answer to until October 1 is where are they. Federal spending is reportedly behind and we have different schools of thought, one of was that austerity is coming, and they're going to spend every cent they possibly have now. And there's another school of thought that says austerity is coming and they want to conserve cash now. So we'll see what happens. I think the debt ceiling dynamic was a little bit different because they were facing this arbitrary deadline of August 2 and cash hoarding to extend that deadline, I think, might have been in play. But I don't want to dwell too much on that and speculate. The bottom line here is I think there's a few moving parts on the government. I think we took our best shot. Certainly, we're anticipating that our U.S. Public Sector will be up significantly from this quarter as it typically is. But the dynamic of that business, and this year is no different, is that a substantial amount of budget is still not allocated to individual projects until the end. And a fair amount of the activity in that business has positioned themselves in the event money becomes available. And for the question, there's really 2 questions. One of them is how much money will be available and what projects will it fund? And correlate to that, and what agencies? And that will determine whether we're successful or not. So what do I think? I think the government being the government, they'll find a way to spend all their money. It will probably be a last minute thing, but I can predict which agencies will get what funding."

So as the team rolls up from the field, and we're looking at bookings forecast and the things of the like, that's kind of buried in there and factored in. We don't do specific vertical forecast. Certainly, I don't. As far as EMEA, we'll see. I think EMEA was remarkably strong. One of the things about -- we didn't go through it in the script is sometimes, there's a little bit of a spread between the bookings performance and the reported revenue performance and the revenues kind of mixed up now between the 2 businesses. But the EMEA booking performance was really strong. Even if you adjust out the currency effects, we're very, very pleased with what happened in EMEA and really across all the territories, including the mature ones, the U.K., France and Germany. So I think we're anticipating continued strength. We just did that in a quarter where certainly the German GDP growth was not that impressive yet we still had a pretty good quarter. So my general sense of the business is yes, we have these backdrops, but I expect to overachieve against the backdrops. So we've been doing it for the last year and if Europe's weak, obviously, that's not going to make it easier for us, but I expect us to do better than most."

The other part of it is the deferred revenue coming off the balance sheet that we built in prior years is going to get stronger as the year goes on so I think we have that buffeting the business. So our business doesn't hinge quarter-to-quarter purely on bookings. We also have some underlying -- it's roughly 1/3 to 40% of our overall revenue is actually coming off the balance sheet. So I think that gives us some stability both on the revenue side and on the margin side, frankly. But I think going forward, I mean, one thing that was -- we were in really good shape midway through the quarter. And in one of our geographies, we're behind so I don't think that we need to execute to perfection to get to that number.

If it deteriorates from here, clearly, we'll change direction. I think if there's one thing we've proved in the last downturn, where we actually got back to our operating plan in one quarter is that if we put the brakes on, we can put the brakes on hard, but we're not doing that now.

They were just hard to close at some industries than others, and then you have this big government overhang, which is completely different. So if you took the Fed piece out, I think the story would look a lot different. So I don't feel like we're on the trajectory that we were in a couple years back.

That's not really what's dominating our thought process at this point in time. As I think about market share gains, clearly that's going to be in the context of an overall adequate P&L performance. And we're certainly not going to chase market share gains all the way into a loss position. And frankly several years ago, we didn't do that. In fact, once it was clear that market share gains weren't there to be had and the industry was in distress, we actually reduced OpEx and it was one of the few painful layoffs in our history. So it isn't, it's market share at any price. I just think that we're in a situation where the revenue is a little weak. On the other hand, our earnings were right there. Our gross margins were strong. It doesn't appear that we're losing competitive position. There are certain geographies where we're exceptionally strong. Right now, I think what we're probably spending a little bit more time on is which of these areas are going to come back, which ones do we think are going to come back or do we kind of let those go for a little while, maintain investment and reinvest in other areas where we have some strength. So I think our aspiration is unless the market deteriorates substantially from where we are today, our goal is to get back to our guidance even if we have to make it up in other areas.

And I think we have a fair amount of investment leverage and still be able to do that even if the market doesn't materially improve from here. Now a couple years ago, we did a few things, some of which I think were probably obvious to the outside world looking at the P&L, but some of them are very specific internally. And that is we had a clear message to us to the team and that is there's a lot of initiatives we want to pursue, but the spending levels are flat. So in the context of a flat investment environment, how are we going to fund these initiatives? And we put a pretty big effort on one of the low yield activities we have underway that we are going to shed so we can move to stop the things that matter going forward. And I think we did that. And out of that, we shed some product lines and it was painful. I think we crisped up our marketing message. I think we did a bunch of things that served us well. So I think that even under the covers of an investment is that realigning the investments, whether it's realigning them geographically to take advantage of market opportunities, whether it's product side. But as far as an ultimate threshold, I would say it depends on what we see happening. If we think it's competitive, we might do one thing. If we think it's a regional slowdown, we might do something else. But I don't really want to commit to that number. Our focus is going to be on EPS, and clearly we want to protect the EPS guidance that we just gave. The other thing that I think is somewhat in our back pocket, which will play out a little at a time, I think is synergies from the acquisition we just did. I think we're seeing probably the near term supply lines synergy of just basically our buying power coming into play. I think as time goes on, we'll basically bring them into our manufacturing fold and get leverage there as opposed to have split manufacturing like we do today. And I think in the longer run, there's obviously some engineering synergies around common components. So I think that there's Engenio leverage over time that will play out. And we opened up some transition services underway with them because we did not buy an operating business, we just bought assets. So there's still some dependency on the other side that we'll try and wind down over time. So I think there's a number of sources of synergies and reprioritization even before we think about increasing the OpEx envelope."

If the federal has -- in the federal accounts, I don't think they were standing across the table saying, ""You guys are too expensive. If you guys were cheaper, we would buy."" I think they were saying, ""We don't have any money. We're not going to buy anything."" If it becomes more widespread, then you have the inevitable issue of too much worldwide sales capacity chasing too many deals and limited opportunities then people can't afford to lose any, and as a result, pricing becomes very competitive. And I wouldn't rule out that we'll see some of that in the financial services side if this continues. But I say that, in general, we're not in that state on a worldwide basis yet. So I'm not anticipating any significant pressure from the margin side other than what we normally see. It's interesting that I took a look at that myself and we actually saw lower discounting this past quarter than we did in the prior quarter. And it's noticeable, it had a slight impact on the prior gross margins. That's one of the reasons why the product gross margins are stronger. So if it is getting more competitive, we haven't seen it yet. So I would characterize it the same way I have over the past several years, Bill, is that it is a tough market out there. It is very competitive all the time, and people will do something to get a footprint in a particular installation or customer site. But at the end of the day, I don't think this quarter we saw anything to give it any indication that the competitive situation has changed."

Even the question of did we see the same July effect in the Engenio business as we saw in the rest of the business is still something that we're trying to sort out. One of the things that's a little bit different dynamic is that the big customers in that business have quarter ends that don't line up with ours. So at this point, I think we're just trying to build up our own intelligence around the business and what the seasonality's going to be. So I don't think we want to tip the numbers up or down. I think we're very pleased how we came out of the shoot. I'd say, probably from a pure accretion perspective, I think we're ahead of where we are. There's still opportunities on the cost side as time goes on as well. So, so far so good. But even if the core business was strong, and I don't think that we would be changing our expectations for the new E-Series business just yet. In terms of in the market, the OEMs continue. Teradata was very, very strong. IBM is continuing. We had good conversations with Oracle this quarter amid all the noise. And we have commitments from them that this business will continue unchanged. On the branded side, the enthusiasm is very high. There's nothing like a $14 million deal to get people's attention. But even beyond that, the amount of activity, the ability to getting all that stuff through our systems and parts of them because we're shipping the branded stuff out of our systems, not through LSIs, has been a little slow. That's probably the only execution concern I'd have. But the enthusiasm for the field, the amount of bids that are out there, the amount of opportunities being pursued, the OEM business appears to be on track. It's not as spectacular, but the branded side has a lot of activity and I'm still very optimistic about that."

So I think in a lot of those geographies, we don't really have a strong presence that we're building up. So we grew in all of those, in fact. But even if they disappear tomorrow, it wouldn't be material, although we're clearly getting bigger and bigger as each quarter goes by. But the general European trend, the German GDP numbers that were reported this week were a bit of a surprise to me. Because in general, I kind of felt over the last year, the Germans in particular were remarkably bullish. In light of everything else that's going on, they were enormously confident. And I'm not just talking about our sales guys, I'm talking about the customers themselves. And we'll see if that confidence is shaken. But in the midst of this relatively low GDP quarter, they still bought a lot of stuff, and they still showed a lot of confidence. So I guess it's just like anything else. As long as we're winning and gaining share, we're going to continue to invest. And the papers are interesting, but until they affect our business, we're not going to do anything different."

The key thing there, not surprisingly, is really leadership. We've replaced a lot of our leaders in a lot of these geographies. A lot of them have been in place now for 1 year to 1.5 years and we're seeing the impact. Asia/Pac had a very, very good booking quarter last  -- a very, very good booking year last year, and they had a very, very good first quarter. So I think we're just plain executing better.

And that's got applications in many dimensions, including obviously the obvious ones on the purely performance side and the scalability side and content repository side. But the thing that's especially unique about it is that we bring the data management suite that we're bringing to enterprise customers and traditional business apps, that we're marrying that with true scale and true clustering. That's really going to be the only platform of its type that's targeted at the enterprise customer. So it's really a monetization of storage for the enterprise customer. Most of the enterprise applications are still running on architectures that are 15 or 20 years old. So that is really the big push on this. Now it will spill over into high-performance computing, it will spill over to technical computing and a lot of the scalability boundary limits and things like that will be relaxed so it will make these things easier to manage. So value proposition, I think, is clearly the ability to bring our broader value proposition to a greater set of customers and a greater set of applications. For existing customers, obviously, the manageability and the scalability and the performance and the ability to manage storage as a pool as opposed to an individual box, I think will have tremendous advantages from a complexity perspective or performance perspective. And really the ability to build a virtualized infrastructure, the ability to build a broad storage pool to serve a big server farm that's capable of running multiple apps at the same time and manage security, manage performance, manage capacity, manage cost. So I think from that perspective, I think that's a generic value proposition where the industry is up or the industry is down. I think what it will do is it will broaden the applicability of our storage efficiency technologies, our deduplication for primaries which we're still the only player to do that broadly, the thin provisioning, the use of ATA drives. So what we'll be able to do is bring that storage value proposition, which I think will be particularly relevant  in the downturn. It certainly was the last time. I think that the storage efficiency messaging really helped us a lot as the economic -- we're depressed. So overall, my view is I think what it'll do is it will broaden the applicability of those things that do have value in a downturn, which is primarily storage efficiency. But it will also open up new sets of customers and new sets of apps to us. But perhaps there are some who are concerned about our scalability in the past. So is there anything specific about a downturn that would make this particularly applicable? No, just the ability to deploy storage efficiency more broadly. But absent that, I think this is a fundamentally different approach to enterprise storage, and it's going to be a big departure from what customers have and really deliver what I think is unquestionably the biggest software feature set in the industry and bring that to enterprise apps and scale."

I think if they have a big server spend coming up, they might spend less on storage. I don't really know, but I've never really seen the correlation there. What's interesting about our business is that the customer behavior is actually more driven by platform refreshes than they are software refreshes. So the thing about 8.1 is it's going to run on the platforms that we currently ship so if they make an investment in the platform today and then they can upgrade to 8.1, it isn't like the equipment is obsolete. So from that perspective, I'm not expecting that there's a big waiting for 8.1 to come along. I just don't see that. If 8.1 only ran on a platform, a new platform that only ran 8.1, then it would be a little bit different, but I just don't think that's the case. So the server thing, I think, is somewhat irrelevant. But what I do think, though, is that the demand tends to flow towards the newer platforms. And I think we see that with the 3000, we see that with the 6000. I mean, the 6000 just blew it out. And I think that some of that is people might be buying a new 6000 instead of a couple 3000s, to kind of get on the new technology at the high end. I think that some of that's happening to with the 2000s. They'll buy a 3000 instead of a couple of 2000s. And then the public sector business hit. If you look at our 2000 family, it kind of goes into a few categories. There are some that goes into the big accounts for like branch office type of things. And that was kind of mediocre. There's the Channel business, which mostly goes to midsized enterprise and small businesses, state, local governments. That was actually strong. And then there was the public sector use, which could be anything from ships to cars to boats to planes to whatever. And that was very weak.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, among others, general macroeconomic and market conditions, particularly the continuing fiscal challenges in the U.S. and Europe, the effects of flooding in Thailand, customer demand for our products and services including our recently announced new product introductions and other equally important factors, which are detailed in our accompanying press release, which we have filed on an 8-K with the SEC, as well as our 10-K and 10-Q reports also on file with the SEC and available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference in today's discussion. 
All numbers discussed today are GAAP unless stated otherwise. The reconciling items between non-GAAP and GAAP that we refer to a table on our press release, our supplemental commentary or our website. In a moment, Steve will provide you with some additional color on our financial results, Nick will walk you through our guidance for Q3 of FY '12. And then Tom will walk you through his perspective on the business this quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Steve for his thoughts. Steve?"

This quarter financial performance can be characterized by contrast. In terms of business demand, we continue to see strength across most of our business with the normal puts and takes. For instance, our Euro",890,"Thank you, Tara, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter financial performance can be characterized by contrast. In terms of business demand, we continue to see strength across most of our business with the normal puts and takes. For instance, our European enterprise and our Asia PAC geographies were robust and our E-Series OEM had another solid quarter. 
Similarly, our volume channel businesses were very strong and our largest channel partners demonstrated solid growth, where we saw underperformance to our revenue forecast within our major account program. Our Q2 guidance included an analysis of the business dynamics associated with these large accounts,  their seasonality as well as relatively modest expectations for sequential revenue growth from them. Of the 46 accounts in the program, just 9 of the U.S. accounts produced the entire shortfall from the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Nevertheless, despite lower-than-expected revenue, with our non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share were quite strong with non-GAAP EPS above our targeted range and at record level. 
Our total OEM revenues were strongest quarter at $230 million, growing 8% sequentially from Q1. NetApp brand revenues grew 3% sequentially, impacted primarily by softness on those 9 major accounts I just mentioned. 
Software entitlements and maintenance revenue and services revenue showed a sequential decline this quarter. In the case of SEM, the revenue decline was a function of a minor perturbation in our deferred revenue schedule. For the services revenue, the sequential decline was due to a Q2 drop in professional services revenue, which tends to be lumpy. The underlying revenue growth trends for both SEM and service maintenance contracts remain intact. Moreover, our deferred revenue balance increased by $56 million sequentially and grew 25% year-over-year. We expect that the absolute revenue level will increase for both of these revenue categories next quarter. 
Our non-GAAP product gross margins declined 0.6 percentage points from Q1 levels as the favorable effects of increased volume and configuration mix were more than offset by increased mix of E-Series OEM business, warranty cost and some pricing discount. Normalizing for mix, these product margins remain within the range of our expectation. 
Non-GAAP service gross margin declined 3.2 percentage points sequentially primarily as a result of a loss on a single transaction. We expect the services margin to bounce back next quarter. The underlying service maintenance contract gross margin remains very healthy. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased less than 1% sequentially this quarter as we maintained our discipline on expense management. Employment growth moderated during the quarter and was lower than every quarter in the past year. 
The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was also lower than forecast, finishing the quarter at 16.4% as we're now anticipating a larger mix of our FY '12 pretax earnings will come from international geographies. We expect our tax rate to return to about 17.5% next quarter and average of 17.5% for FY '12. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $4.6 billion in cash and investment, down only slightly from Q1 despite the $400 million accelerated share repurchase we executed early in the quarter. Our accounts receivable, day sales outstanding was relatively steady as it increased to 38 days from the 37 days reported in Q1. Inventory turns decrease again this quarter to 14.1x. 
There are several reasons for this including a large proactive pre-buy flash memory and a large disc drive pre-buy as the flooding in Thailand was unfolding. We believe we will have sufficient drive inventory through to the end of December but it's difficult for anyone to predict the business impact beyond that. 
Cash from operations at $370 million increased 4% from the same period last year. Free cash flow finished the quarter at $277 million. Our diluted share count decreased by 29.5 million shares sequentially to about 376 million shares primarily due to a lower average quarterly share price and to our share repurchase. 
Our average quarterly closing price was down from last quarter to $38.25 per share. The accounting per share is associated with our convertible notes and warrants had a large impact, removing about 17 million shares from the diluted share count on a sequential basis, leaving about 7 million shares to account for the convertible notes. 
As you may recall, 80% of the convertible notes are hedged. If we were to do just the share count to reflect the bond hedged then the non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.01 higher. You can find a table on our website, which shows the impact on the diluted share count for a range of stock prices. 
In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Nick to talk to you about our guidance given his responsibility in January. As I said last quarter, it's been a goal of mine to retire by the time I'm 60 and that milestone is all too close. December 31 will be my last day at NetApp. And therefore, this is my last earnings call. I've enjoyed working with all of you over the years and I hope to have an opportunity to say goodbye over the next 6 weeks. In the meantime, my CFO responsibilities remain the same as Nick and I work together to facilitate a smooth leadership transition. We will be in great hands in the first of 2012. So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Nick"

I'm sure I speak for everyone at NetApp when I say you will truly be missed. 
Now looking forward, our target revenue range for Q3 is at $1.52 billion to $1.61 billion, which at the midpoint implies approximately 4% sequential growth and 21% year-over-year growth. Consolidated non-GAAP gross margins are expected to finish around 60%. We expect that non-GAAP operating margins will finish around 17%. As Steve mentioned earlier, we expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5% based upon a shift in distribution of our earnings to our international geographies, bringing our non-GAAP earnings per share estimate to approximately $0.56 to $0.60 per share. 
Diluted share count is forecast to increase to about 380 million shares in Q3 based on our average stock price of $41.84 for the first 10 days of the quarter. This will include about 9 million shares from the convertible notes and 0.5 million shares from the warrant. Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible note hedged, that would add about $0.01 to the EPS guidance. 
To summarize, our business model continued to show its underlying resiliency in the second quarter as we exceeded our operating margin and EPS target despite some revenue softness. In fact for the first half, we generated 23% year-over-year revenue growth at a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.5%. However, the original financial targets we laid out at our Analyst Day did not foresee the 2 substantial macroeconomic factors we find ourselves managing through today. Those being the increasing economic turmoil in Europe and flooding in Thailand. These conditions make forecasting both revenue and cost of sales going forward far less predictable. Therefore, we cannot confidently forecast a specific range for Q4 revenue and earnings per share at this time. We will provide you with an update on our Q3 earnings call. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?"

As a Steve indicated, the sequential decline in our major account program in a quarter where we expected seasonal growth was the biggest deviation from our forecast. While we were not anticipating sequential growth comparable to last year, we needed better performance from this group to meet our objectives. Fortunately, most of the unexpected shortfall was confined to a small number of accounts, where the customer-specific dynamics can be understood. Unlike last quarter, the companies were not concentrated in any specific industry. Beyond this concentrated shortfall, the rest of the businesses were generally positive. 
The strength in the other areas of our business is evident when looking at it from a geographical perspective. Our U.S. Commercial business grew 24% year-over-year. Our Asia-Pacific business grew 55% year-over-year and our EMEA business grew 12% year-over-year in a challenging environment. 
Our E-Series OEM business remains well ahead of plans with 11% sequential growth. We even saw some rebound in spending from the financial services sector. We also saw some budget flush in the U.S. Public Sector, which were up only 9% year-over-year, it was over a margin compare and it grew 56% sequentially. 
Outside of those 9 major accounts, our Enterprise business was generally strong. Our number of transactions over $1 billion was the second highest ever, increasing 17% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year, while the total net new customer account acquisition is at a 2.5-year high. The volume segments of the business around midsized enterprise at state, local and higher education were very robust and the highest growth areas of the portfolio. 
Our emphasis on pathway diversification continues to pay off as we saw record sales from our indirect channels, representing the highest ever percentage of our revenue. Our largest distribution partners Arrow and AppNet grew 31% of total revenue and grew 18% year-over-year. CBW, our largest reseller in fiscal year '12, who over 75% year-over-year. 
Our alliance program continues to generate leverage as we broaden our portfolio of tightly integrated service offerings in partnership with other, vendors. We are in the process of conducting our Global Insight Events where we train thousands of technical resources both internally and from our resellers and partners. At the event, we further enhanced our solution offerings by introducing 4 new verified architectures: Microsoft Private Cloud, Oracle Database, Media Content Management and FlexPod Data Center Solutions. 
FlexPod is our modular data center solution developed in conjunction with Cisco to provide partners and customers with an integrated standardized and scalable and for structure to support a variety of workloads. Together, we have a validated designs for VMware, SharePoint, SAP, Citrix and Red Hat Linux. 
FlexPod had another strong quarter and our relationship with Cisco continues to deepen as a result. We now have over 400 FlexPod customers and a robust pipeline for future FlexPod business. On the product side, the new 3000 and 6000 platforms both have solid quarters. Units shipped of the 3000 were up 34% year-over-year. And in fact 6000 units more than doubled over last year's Q2 levels. The 2000 was down year-over-year and down slightly on a sequential basis. 
We saw decreased demand in double channel in our Large Enterprises as well as the shift in business to the newer 3000 family. However, last week, we introduced newly designed 2000 class models for this segment with our smart decisions are built on NetApp campaign. With refresh technology, attractive price points and our latest Data ONTAP 8.1 operating system, it represents a compelling solution for each of its target segments. 
Our product launch had a particular focus on the midsize enterprise and our state, local and higher education channels where our momentum is strong and the partners are eager to introduce the new offerings to their customers. In addition to being the standard operating system on our 2000 series, Data ONTAP 8.1 is now available on our 3000 and 6000 platforms. Our 8.1 operating system is the first product in the market to marry the industry's richest portfolio of data management and storage efficiency technologies with clustering to enable unmatched scalability and nonstop operations. 
Previous architectures, including both traditional approaches and newer niche implementations, have forced customers to make trade-offs amongst these features. NetApp is the only vendor to have a functionality and configurability to produce optimized solutions for the widest range of applications including virtualization, technical computing, competent repositories and traditional business applications all from a single architecture. 
Evidence on the scalability was demonstrated where recently published compelling results from an independent spec FAS benchmark test in which a 24-node cluster of NetApp FAS6000 with the 8.1 produced 1.5 million ops per second. That's over 35% faster than the previous record and we did it with 50% fewer discs and 80% fewer controller nodes, demonstrating a real-world configuration with far better results in far lower cost. 
Our total E-Series product family continues to make a big impact as well. Our 14% sequential growth was driven by a specially strong demand from Teradata and Dell, but our other 2 major OEMs on IBM and Oracle were up sequentially as well. We have been sufficiently clear about our commitment to this business. Initially in words and now, in behavior, that each of our major OEM partners have confirmed the expectation of an ongoing relationship and a couple of our introduced new offerings based on the E-Series technology. 
The E-Series products are also key to our Big Data strategy in the areas of analytics and big bandwidth. For analytics, E-Series has now been designed into 3 integrated analytic appliances. We also have integrated into our initial Hadoop solutions and partner engagements. 
For Big Bandwidth, we're continually broadening the solution offerings to our field enabling some high-profile Full-Motion Video and High Performance Computing wins. All in all, our business operated largely within the balance of our expectation this quarter and we're not for an exception of an expected large slowdown in a handful of our biggest accounts, we were at least at the midpoint of our targeted revenue range. 
And we continue this ability in Europe, the persistent economic uncertainty in the U.S. and the associated uncertainty around federal spending, all things considered, the rest of the business was essentially in line or slightly better than we anticipated 90 days ago. Nonetheless, the response to the aggregated revenue performance, the organization once again demonstrated its ability to manage through the business model, enabling us to increase our operating margins over the last quarter and produce record earnings per share. 
Looking ahead, the impact of the Thailand flooding can potentially be the biggest swing factor on both our top and bottom line in the second half. The large buyer drives we did as this was all unfolding should sustain us to a good part of Q3 but probably not all of it. Although enterprise class drives are considered to be the least impacted, we still anticipate some amount of supply and pricing complexity. We have all heard the predictions of the industry analyst and the drive vendors themselves. Some of the information is conflicting and most of it is changing daily in regards to scope and ultimate impact. 
I expect NetApp will fare better than most in this process. But it's far too early to state the exact extent this will impact our business either directly or through our OEM partners. On the other hand, our FAS business will begin to get uplift from the just reset, refreshed 2000 series and our partners and technical teams are coming off in an invigorating symposium where they will brief on Data ONTAP 8.1 and competing using NetApp products. 
I believe NetApp continues to have the best product portfolio and the best partnerships in the industry, both of which will pay off in the long run. Before I open up the call to Q&A, I'd like to again thank Steve for more than 9 years of tremendous contributions to NetApp. 
I'd also like to congratulate the entire NetApp team for being ranked #3 on the world's best multinational list by the Great Place Work Institute. The culture at NetApp is one of the key to success and this recognition is a strong validation of our commitment to creating a model company. It is this commitment that will drive us to continue to gain market share in both good and challenging times. 
At this point, I'll open up the call for Q&A. As always, I'll ask that you be respectable of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question so we can try to address everyone in our allotted time today. Thank you. Operator?"

I think there's certainly some accounts that certainly have well-known headlines that we knew going into the quarter we're going to have some issues associated with them. Certainly, I was concerned about the DoD and federal spending and obviously, some individual accounts that we're probably are well aware of. That we knew are going to be problematic and we factored that into the forecast. I think that the other ones we actually probably expected more of our normal Q1 to Q2 seasonality as we think about them and that's really not what happened. And I'd also add that these were not necessarily problem accounts. These are accounts may have on the ascendancy that shows the slowdown. So we want to indicate that we've actually had 9 more problem accounts on our major account portfolio. I think some of those are clearly in the ascendancy with NetApp, which is that we are expecting more from them this particular quarter. I think from competitive pressures I think certainly pricing clearly in a market where demand is limited, there's a lot of capacity chasing deals. Our customers are using that to their advantage. But for a pure competitor perspective, in those 9 accounts, there's probably only one that I would say has a meaningful competitive component to it. But I think all the other ones are either macro related or company-specific."

One was E-Series OEM business and then the other one was the E-Series  overall. So the E-Series  OEM business had a more natural compare than the overall since we just really started with the branded business that's why that number is a little bit higher. So and of course, those are our revenue number. I believe on the last call, I talked about the large $14 million deal that would not come to revenue this quarter. And that's clearly still true if you're wondering where the $14 million went. I think on the broader question, the real question here as we think about the market and we think about the macro, the NetApp's focus is almost exclusively on market share because that's really the true measure of our penetration. And the key component in market share, the only thing that actually gets counted in the market share as reported by the industry analysts is actually product revenue growth. So as you think about companies in the space with product transitions and acquisitions, I think we're dealing with a different macro environment this year than we were last year. I think probably it might be the best way to think about that is actually taking about sequential growth. So if I look at our sequential growth from last quarter, there's about 5.2% on the product side. So if I compare that to say, EMC's product growth in storage, the most recent quarter, I think that number is about 1.2%. So you could say it's a NetApp Q1 to Q2. For them, it's a Q2 to Q3. But if you go back another quarter with EMC and look at the Q1 to Q2 transition to them that's only about 2%. So from a market share perspective, which is really a measure of product growth, NetApp actually had more sequential growth in the last 3 months and the EMC's last in on a percentage basis. So to the extent that it's #1 or #2 market share players in this market, I had to think that our market share gains are greater than this."

But the other thing to notice of our business is that the segments of the market that are most dependent upon products of that class, which is our volume channel business have the strongest part of our business so. Clearly they moved some of the demands to the new 3000. So I would expect some of that demand to actually come back from the 3000 into the 2000. So I wouldn't, it would be really easy for me to say that it will be incremental. But I think that there will be some reversed cannibalization of the 3000 just like what we saw when the 3000 came out. As far as the enterprise and Department of Defense or I'll just say U.S. Public Sector, those are big consumers of this class of products as well. And there is some attributes of this product in terms of size and compatibility with prior products, which actually will enable the product transition in our favor here that was held up in the previous generation. So I do expect not only this will impact our channel business but I do expect this to impact our enterprise and our U.S. Public Sector business as well."

Can you help us understand, I understand that you can't lump in the weakness into one specific reason for all of them, but how are you addressing the weakness? Is there some execution issues that you're looking at? And my memory may be foggy but this sounds somewhat similar to the shortfall you guys had in mid-2007 where you had some issues with large accounts. And I know you were able to reconcile that with basically a different approach to a broader customer base. How should we compare it to that prior hick up understanding that there was a big recession here later and sort of how should we think about how you're addressing this weakness and preventing it from spreading frankly?"

We're lapping up the quarter in the face of that crisis and I don't really know whether that impacted that us or not. But also last call, we talked about the U.S. Public Sector and we talked about financial services. So you can actually argue that's is actually even more concentrated than it was last quarter so instead of spreading it might actually be contracting. But as far as the accounts are we need to look at every single one of them, more than clearly it's really visually competitive or it's largely competitive and I think we need to take that on clearly. I think that's than anybody. But I think most of the other ones I think our most of those accounts that are actually doing quite well from a NetApp perspective. And they took a pause. And some of them obviously, we did some insight to see when we expect them to come back. Some of them some of them will pause a little bit longer based on their own company dynamics. So I think that the advantage of it being a definable set of named accounts is that we can build and actually play around each every single one of them. As opposed to if we saw a broad weakness in the channel, that would be 1000 account problems. So I think there are things that we're going to jump onto. I'd say that most of those accounts are still relatively favorable and we're not losing any share in them. We may or may not, depending on each individual situation as you see a rebound next quarter and that's factored into our guidance."

It is becoming an integral part of these types of arrays. And the ability of flash and ATA drives as we move higher cost from enterprise drives, it clearly drive the cost point at very, very competitive and is driven up adoption. So that is bundled in and not exactly tied to customer preference. It's hard to talk about flash adoption but I would venture to guess certainly on the 6000 and the majority of the 3000 is the part of the solution.  So the way we go from here, I think you'll continue to see innovation on the flash side from NetApp, both inside and outside the array. I don't want to preannounce any products. So i don't think that I think the planning horizon in the model that you guys are trying to put up for Q3, I think you should expect that flash drives are going to be substantial the way it is. As far as PCI flash products, yes, you need to be clear on what the opportunity is there. I think for us, things that are going to represent permanent storage, we want to bring into our data management methodology. So that clearly is our interest. As far as flash-based PCI board as a revenue opportunity on a stand-alone basis, that's not nearly as interesting to us. But if it's a vehicle to sell software and broaden our footprint, clearly that's the boat that we'll be pushing."

So in terms of win rates particularly around scale ONTAP scale, it isn't just about 8.1, we're certainly competing with cluster node in that technology with existing functionality of 8.x. And I think what 8.1 brings to us is not only the performance that's you saw the new operating system on the platforms clearly is compelling but. What it also does is it reduces the trade off necessary of trade off clustering versus the premium software features. So many of the premium software features of our standard version of ONTAP are now fully clusterable. And from that perspective, obviously the product has much broader appeal not just scale out mass but really around traditional applications. They really have very, very, rich data management, which is not typical of products in traditional business applications. And then next clustering virtually gives tremendous possibility and build scale of performance of capacity and also clustering is a key enabling technology of a true nonstop operation. So from our perspective, the scale out ONTAP is just one data point. But the real focus of our 8.x journey is effectively to bring clustering and premium software features into the traditional business applications area, wherein have been relatively modest from an innovation perspective in all the period of time."

I'll go to my direct answer and the real dynamic here is not the overall fundamental health of those accounts. As the performance of those accounts this quarter against our expectations the performance this quarter that we had 90 days ago. So there're clearly some accounts that might be problematic growth accounts for company-specific reasons. And we knew that going in. And those weren't factored in. And those might be accounts that might be tough for us to drive growth in overtime whether we gain share from them or not. On the other hand, these are accounts where we've had higher expectations by what they did, which is to say that they're broken on they're damaged and that they're losing ground. So and some of these accounts made a lot of progress. And they all did spend money, it's just a question of not as much. So I think from that perspective, I realize that ultimately, not needing to a satisfactory answer you keep coming back to it. But I say that overall the point is it that the major accounts in general are being a proxy for the broader environment as certainly price pressure both from a pricing perspective and from a demand perspective. And I think that those accounts being large as they stop and go, have a much bigger impact on our business. So those 9 accounts had a disproportionate amount of our business relative to our expectation, which isn't to say that we're in trouble that any of them like I said, I think the competitive pressures are really only relevant in one. And they aren't necessarily the 9 worst accounts because clearly, we have accounts that we know are going to be problematic and certainly sectors are going to be problem but those were already factored into our forecast. So I just want to be clear it's not like we only have 9 accounts that we're not happy with. I think these accounts will be very strong for us going forward and there will be other accounts that are not on this list that we know are going to be problematic and that was factored into our guidance.

So that's built into product gross margins, that flows through to the overall operating margin line.

On the other hand with some uncertainty ahead but macroeconomic we and also the trial of flooding, we need to be careful about where the top line is going and therefore, we are prudent with up to this particular quarter. So we're still hiring 300-something people. It's not like we're sitting out and die but that's the balance that we need to have going forward is how do we model the spending in proportion to the business. But I also want to be clear as I said earlier the impact of the Thailand flood, we expect to be temporary. And I'm not going to modulate operating expense on it  because: a, it's going to be hard to predict and I hate to just kind of change the organization around a set of data points that are changing everyday."

I think when we think about, clearly they were targeting us before EMC brought them and certainly that has not let up. It's approximately causing these accounts like I said, the accounts that are on the ascendancy have suddenly stopped buying or paused for a period of time. That was an intercept of the business by a competitive activity. Certainly if that was a threat we're contracting the forecast 90 days ago things like that don't happen that quickly. As far as, itself, if you look at the value points that it has around NAS performance, data value point has really about manageability of large content tools. From a strict performance perspective, it's subjectively measured clearly the E-Series the high performance computing is clearly much higher performance. Certainly the benchmark that we just did around that spec and, scalability are dramatically. Clearly, from a performance perspective NetApp is more than able to hold its own. In fact, it has a compelling leadership position there. On a general question of manageability, that's kind of a tough thing to objectively benchmark. But if you look at where we're strongest at now with 8.1, the marriage of other premium features which don't exist in that the product. And therefore, it makes it difficult to sell into traditional business applications. And also kind of the merger where we're heading, with the, acquisition and object-oriented stuff, effectively going to be bringing the functionality of both, and if you will. So I feel good about our roadmap. I think clearly from a performance perspective, NetApp is really taking the high ground. And I think from the perspective, obviously that's a little bit harder to objectively measure but I think you'll see much better functionality from NetApp and continued competitive from that front. So I think where I see, is from the premium side of the business around performance and key scientific applications more than comfortable with our stance there. In terms of large content repository pools kind of lower value data, that's primarily manageability and you'll certainly hear more from NetApp hopefully at 8.1 and in the future releases. So from us, do we see them? Yes. Will there be a certain pause over the dynamics of the major accounts? Certainly we see them but they were not the primary cause of what we saw some 90 days ago."

The flipside to that argument and I would also argue is don't assume that our channel business has do a touch from our direct sales organization. In some cases I wish it was more independent. But our direct sales organizations involved in a lot of accounts. So I think our direct selling motion is clearly creating demand.

For instance, ou",894,"Thank you, Tara, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter's financial performance can be characterized by its contrast. In terms of business demand, we continue to see strength across most of our business with the normal puts and takes. For instance, our European enterprise and our Asia/Pac geographies were robust and our E-Series OEM had another stellar quarter. Similarly, our volume channel businesses were very strong and our largest channel partners demonstrated solid growth, where we saw underperformance to our revenue forecast within our major account program. 
Our Q2 guidance included an analysis of the business dynamics associated with these large accounts, their seasonality as well as relatively modest expectations for sequential revenue growth from them. Of the 46 accounts in the program, just 9 of the U.S. accounts produced the entire shortfall from the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Nevertheless, despite lower-than-expected revenue, with our non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share, we're quite strong with non-GAAP EPS above our targeted range and at record level. 
Our total OEM revenues were strong this quarter at $230 million, growing 8% sequentially from Q1. NetApp-branded revenues grew 3% sequentially, impacted primarily by softness in those 9 major accounts I just mentioned. 
Software entitlements and maintenance revenue and services revenue showed a sequential decline this quarter. In the case of SEM, the revenue decline was a function of a minor perturbation in our deferred revenue schedule. For the services revenue, the sequential decline was due to a Q2 drop in professional services revenue, which tends to be lumpy. The underlying revenue growth trends for both SEM and service maintenance contracts remain intact. Moreover, our deferred revenue balance increased by $56 million sequentially and grew 25% year-over-year. We expect that the absolute revenue level will increase for both of these revenue categories next quarter. 
Our non-GAAP product gross margins declined 0.6 percentage points from Q1 levels as the favorable effects of increased volume and configuration mix were more than offset by increased mix of E-Series OEM business, warranty costs and some pricing discounts. Normalizing for mix, these product margins remain within the range of our expectation. 
Non-GAAP service gross margin declined 3.2 percentage points sequentially primarily as a result of a loss on a single transaction. We expect the services margin to bounce back next quarter. The underlying service maintenance contract gross margin remains very healthy. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased less than 1% sequentially this quarter as we maintained our discipline on expense management. Employment growth moderated during the quarter and was lower than every quarter in the past year. 
The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was also lower than forecast, finishing the quarter at 16.4% as we are now anticipating a larger mix of our FY '12 pretax earnings will come from international geographies. We expect our tax rate to return to about 17.5% next quarter, an average 17.5% for FY '12. 
Our balance sheet remained strong with approximately $4.6 billion in cash and investments, down only slightly from Q1 despite the $400 million accelerated share repurchase we executed early in the quarter. Our accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was relatively steady as it increased to 38 days from the 37 days reported in Q1. Inventory turns decreased again this quarter to 14.1x. 
There are several reasons for this, including a large proactive pre-buy of flash memory and a large disc drive pre-buy as the flooding in Thailand was unfolding. We believe we will have sufficient drive inventory through the end of December, but it's difficult for anyone to predict the business impact beyond that. 
Cash from operations at $370 million increased 4% from the same period last year. Free cash flow finished the quarter at $277 million. Our diluted share count decreased by 29.5 million shares sequentially to about 376 million shares, primarily due to a lower average quarterly share price and to our share repurchase. 
Our average quarterly closing price was down from last quarter to $38.25 per share. The accounting per share is associated with our convertible notes and warrants had a large impact, removing about 17 million shares from the diluted share count on a sequential basis, leaving about 7 million shares to account for the convertible notes. 
As you may recall, 80% of the convertible notes are hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedged, then the non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.01 higher. You can find the table on our website, which shows the impact on the diluted share count for a range of stock prices. 
In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Nick to talk with you about our guidance given that he'll have responsibility for it come January. As I said last quarter, it's been a goal of mine to retire by the time I'm 60, and that milestone is all too close. December 31 will be my last day at NetApp. And therefore, this is my last earnings call. I have enjoyed working with all of you over the years, and I hope to have an opportunity to say goodbye over the next 6 weeks. In the meantime, my CFO responsibilities remain the same as Nick and I work together to facilitate a smooth leadership transition. We will be in great hands come the first of 2012. 
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Nick."

I'm sure I speak for everyone at NetApp when I say you will truly be missed. 
Now looking forward, our target revenue range for Q3 is $1.52 billion to $1.61 billion, which at the midpoint implies approximately 4% sequential growth and 21% year-over-year growth. Consolidated non-GAAP gross margins are expected to finish around 60%. We expect that non-GAAP operating margins will finish around 17%. As Steve mentioned earlier, we expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5% based upon a shift in distribution of our earnings to our international geographies, bringing our non-GAAP earnings per share estimate to approximately $0.56 to $0.60 per share. 
Diluted share count is forecast to increase to about 380 million shares in Q3 based on our average stock price of $41.84 for the first 10 days of the quarter. This will include about 9 million shares from the convertible notes and 0.5 million shares from the warrants. Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible note hedged, that would add about $0.01 to the EPS guidance. 
To summarize, our business model continued to show its underlying resiliency in the second quarter as we exceeded our operating margin and EPS targets despite some revenue softness. In fact, for the first half, we generated 23% year-over-year revenue growth at a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.5%. However, the original financial targets we laid out at our Analyst Day did not foresee the 2 substantial macroeconomic factors we find ourselves managing through today, those being the increasing economic turmoil in Europe and flooding in Thailand. These conditions make forecasting, both revenue and cost of sales going forward, far less predictable. Therefore, we cannot confidently forecast a specific range for Q4 revenue and earnings per share at this time. We will provide you with an update on our Q3 earnings call.

While we were not anticipating sequential growth comparable to last year, we needed better performance from this group to meet our objectives. Fortunately, most of the unexpected shortfall was confined to a small number of accounts where the customer-specific dynamics can be understood. Unlike last quarter, the companies were not concentrated in any specific industry. Beyond this concentrated shortfall, the rest of the business was generally positive. 
The strength in the other areas of our business is evident when looking at it from a geographical perspective. Our U.S. Commercial business grew 24% year-over-year, our Asia-Pacific business grew 55% year-over-year and our EMEA business grew 12% year-over-year in a challenging environment. 
Our E-Series OEM business remains well ahead of plan with 11% sequential growth. We even saw some rebound in spending from the financial services sector. We also saw some budget flush in the U.S. Public Sector, which while up only 9% year-over-year, it was over a month on a compare and it grew 56% sequentially. 
Outside of those 9 major accounts, our Enterprise business was generally strong. Our number of transactions over $1 billion was the second highest ever, increasing 17% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year, while the total net new customer account acquisition is at a 2.5-year high. The volume segments of the business around midsized enterprise and state, local and higher education were very robust and were the highest growth areas of the portfolio. 
Our emphasis on pathway diversification continues to pay off as we saw record sales from our indirect channels, representing the highest ever percentage of our revenue. Our largest distribution partners, Arrow and AppNet, grew to 31% of total revenue and grew 18% year-over-year. CDW, our largest reseller in fiscal year '12, grew over 75% year-over-year. 
Our alliance program continues to generate leverage as we broaden our portfolio of tightly integrated solution offerings in partnership with other best-of-breed vendors. We're in the process of conducting a global Insight event where we train thousands of technical resources, both internally and from our resellers and partners. At the event, we further enhanced our solution offerings by introducing 4 new verified architectures: Microsoft private cloud, Oracle Database, Media Content Management and FlexPod data center solutions. 
FlexPod is a modular data center solution developed in conjunction with Cisco to provide partners and customers with an integrated, standardized and scalable and for structure to support a variety of workloads. Together, we offer validated designs for VMware, SharePoint, SAP, Citrix and Red Hat Linux. 
FlexPod had another strong quarter, and our relationship with Cisco continues to deepen as a result. We now have over 400 FlexPod customers and a robust pipeline for future FlexPod business. On the product side, the newer 3000 and 6000 platforms both had solid quarters. Units shipped of the 3000 were up 34% year-over-year. And FAS6000 units more than doubled over last year's Q2 levels. The 2000 was down year-over-year and down slightly on a sequential basis. 
We saw a decreased demand in both the channel and our large enterprises as well as a shift in business to the newer 3000 family. However, last week, we introduced newly designed 2000 class models for this segment, but our smart decisions are built on NetApp campaign. With refreshed technology, attractive price points and our latest Data ONTAP 8.1 operating system, it represents a compelling solution for each of its target segments. 
Our product launch had a particular focus on the midsized enterprise and our state, local and higher education channels, where our momentum is strong and the partners are eager to introduce the new offerings to their customers. In addition to being the standard operating system on our 2000 series, Data ONTAP 8.1 is now available on our 3000 and 6000 platforms. Our 8.1 operating system is the first product in the market to marry the industry's richest portfolio of data management and storage efficiency technologies with clustering to enable unmatched scalability and nonstop operations. 
Previous architectures, including both traditional approaches and newer niche implementations, have forced customers to make trade-offs amongst these features. NetApp is the only vendor to have the functionality and configurability to produce optimized solutions for the widest range of applications, including virtualization, technical computing, competent repositories and traditional business applications all from a single architecture. 
Evidence on its scalability was demonstrated, while recently published compelling results from an independent SPECsfs benchmark test in which a 24-node cluster of NetApp FAS6000s running 8.1 produced 1.5 million ops per second. This is over 35% faster than the previous record, and we did it with 50% fewer discs and 80% fewer controller nodes, demonstrating a real-world configuration with far better results and far lower cost. 
Our total E-Series product family continues to make a big impact as well. Our 14% sequential growth was driven by a specially strong demand from Teradata and Dell, but our other 2 major OEMs, IBM and Oracle, were up sequentially as well. We have been sufficiently clear about our commitment to this business initially in words and now in behavior that each of our major OEM partners have confirmed the expectation of an ongoing relationship and a couple of already introduced new offerings based on the E-Series technology. 
The E-Series products are also key to our big data strategy in the areas of analytics and big bandwidth. For analytics, E-Series has now been designed into 3 integrated analytic appliances. We also have integrated it into our initial Hadoop solutions and partner engagements. 
For big bandwidth, we are continually broadening the solution offerings to our field, enabling some high-profile full-motion video and high-performance computing wins. All in all, our business operated largely within the balance of our expectation this quarter and were not for the exception of an expectedly large slowdown in a handful of our biggest accounts. We are at least been at the midpoint of our targeted revenue range. 
And we continue this ability in Europe, the persistent economic concerns in the U.S. and the associated uncertainty around federal spending, all things considered, the rest of the business was essentially in line or slightly better than we anticipated 90 days ago. Nonetheless, in response to the aggregate revenue performance, the organization once again demonstrated its ability to manage through the business model, enabling us to increase operating margins over the last quarter and produce record earnings per share. 
Looking ahead, the impact of the Thailand flooding can potentially be the biggest swing factor on both our top and bottom line in the second half. The large buyer drives we did, as this was all unfolding, should sustain us through a good part of Q3 but probably not all of it. Although enterprise class drives are considered to be the least impacted, we still anticipate some amount of supply and pricing complexity. We have all heard the predictions of the industry analyst and the drive vendors themselves. Some of the information is conflicting and most of it is changing daily in regards to scope and ultimate impact. 
I expect NetApp to fare better than most in this process, but it is far too early to state the exact extent this will impact our business either directly or through our OEM partners. On the other hand, our FAS business will begin to get uplift from the just reset -- refreshed 2000 series, and our partners and technical teams are coming off an invigorating symposium where they will brief on Data ONTAP 8.1 and competing using NetApp products. 
I believe NetApp continues to have the best product portfolio and the best partnerships in the industry, both of which will pay off in the long run. 
Before I open up the call to Q&A, I'd like to again thank Steve for more than 9 years of tremendous contributions to NetApp. I'd also like to congratulate the entire NetApp team for being ranked #3 on the World's Best Multinational Workplaces list by the Great Place to Work Institute. The culture at NetApp is one of our keys to success, and this recognition is strong validation of our commitment to creating a model company. It is this commitment that will drive us to continue to gain market share in both good and challenging times. 
At this point, I'll open up the call for Q&A. As always, I'll ask that you'd be respectable of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question, so we can try to address everyone in our allotted time today. Thank you. Operator?"

Clearly, that's a competitive business. And certainly, our largest competitor there is being aggressive in the channel and certainly is doing a number of incentives to gain market share or gain mine share. But I would say, frankly, the pricing dynamics are a lot more complicated at the large accounts because they see obviously lesser demand and the opportunity to take advantage of that. So I'd say the pricing environment is probably no different, which isn't to say that it's calm. It's just to say that it's no different. But to the extent the pricing is relevant, I'd say it's probably a little bit more on the major account side."

One of them is the performance of the accounts and the other one is what was our expectation of the performance. I think there are certainly some accounts that certainly have well-known headlines that we knew going into the quarter were going to have some issues associated with them. Certainly, I was concerned about the DoD and federal spending and obviously some individual accounts that we're probably are well aware of, that we knew were going to be problematic and we factored that into the forecast. I think that the other ones, we actually probably expected more of our normal Q1 to Q2 seasonality as we think about them, and that's really not what happened. And I'd also add that these were not necessarily problem accounts. These are accounts -- may have them actually on the ascendancy that shows the slowdown. So we want to indicate that we've actually had 9 more problem accounts on our major account portfolio. I think some of those are clearly in the ascendancy with NetApp, which is that we're expecting more from them this particular quarter. I think from competitive pressures, I think, certainly, pricing, clearly in a market where demand is limited and there's a lot of capacity chasing deals, customers are using that to [indiscernible]. But from a pure competitor perspective, in those 9 accounts, there's probably only one that I would say has a meaningful competitive component to it. But I think all the other ones are either macro-related or company-specific."

One was E-Series OEM business and the other one was E-Series overall. So the E-Series OEM business had a more natural compare of the overall since we just really started with the branded business. That's why that number is a little bit higher. So -- and of course, those are our revenue number. I believe on the last call, I talked about a large $14 million deal that would not come to revenue this quarter, and that's clearly still true if you're wondering where the $14 million went. I think on the broader question, the real question here, as we think about the market and we think about the macro, NetApp's focus is almost exclusively on market share because that's really the true measure of our penetration. And the key component in market share or the only thing that gets actually counted in the market share, as reported by the industry analysts, is actually product revenue growth. So as I think about companies in the space with product transitions and acquisitions and I think we're dealing with a different macro environment this year than we were last year, I think, probably, might be the best way to think about that is actually thinking about sequential growth. So if I look at our sequential growth from last quarter, it was about 5.2% on the product side. So if I compare that to, say, EMC's product growth in storage on the most recent quarter, I think that number is about 1.2%. So you could say, well, it's a NetApp Q1 to Q2, and for them, it's a Q2 to Q3. But if you go back another quarter with EMC and look at the Q1 to Q2 transition to them, that's only about 2%. So in terms -- from a market share perspective, which is really a measure of product growth, NetApp actually had more sequential growth in the last 3 months and EMC's had in the last 6 months as on a percentage basis. So to the extent that we're this 1 or #2 market share players in this market, I'd have to think that our market share gains are greater than this."

And I would say it'd be really easy for us to just say you should -- we should expect to get all those units back in all of the incremental. But the other thing to notice about our business is that the segments of the market that are most dependent upon products of that class, which is our Volume Channel business, have been the strongest part of our business. So clearly, they moved some of the demands to the newer 3000. So I would expect some of that demand to actually come back from the 3000 into the 2000. So I wouldn't -- it'd be really easy for me to say that it will all be incremental. But I think that there will be some reversed cannibalization of the 3000 just like we saw when the 3000 came out. As far as the enterprise and Department of Defense, or I'll just say U.S. Public Sector, those are big consumers of this class of product as well. And there are some attributes of this product in terms of size and compatibility with prior products, which actually will enable the product transition in our favor here that was held up with the previous generation. So I do expect not only this to impact our Channel business but I do expect that impact our enterprise and our U.S. Public Sector business as well."

We're wrapping up the quarter in the face of the debt-ceiling crisis, and I don't really know whether that impacted us or not. But we also -- on the last call, we talked about the U.S. Public Sector and we talked about financial services. So you can actually argue that it's actually even more concentrated than it was last quarter, so instead of spreading it might actually be contracting. And as far as the accounts are -- we need to look at every single one of them. More than clearly, it's really competitive and/or it's largely competitive, and I think we need to take that on clearly. And I don't think that's less than anybody. But I think most of the other ones, I think, most of those are accounts that are actually doing quite well from a NetApp perspective. And they took a pause. And some of them, obviously, we did some insight to see when we expect them to come back. Some of them will, some of them will pause a little bit longer based on their own company dynamics. So I think that the advantage of it having being a definable set of named accounts is that we can build and actually play in around every single one of them. As opposed to if we saw a broad weakness in the channel, that would be 1,000 account problems. So I think there are things that we're going to jump onto. I'd say that most of those accounts are still relatively favorable at NetApp and we're not losing any share in them. We may or may not, depending on each individual situation as you see a rebound in them next quarter and that's what's factored into our guidance."

I wouldn't roll out that we'll see some reversed cannibalization of the 3000s going to next quarter moving back to the 2000.

The one thing I -- just from a point of view of managing the business, I think from this particular quarter, I think, once again, we proved that when we want to put some control on expense that we can snap back, to use the 2007 analogy, I think when things ought to slow down, we said we would get back on the model in the year, we were back in a quarter. The one thing that's a little bit different this time is, on the matter of Thailand, clearly, it's concern about availability of drives but there's also concern about pricing of drives. And from the point of view of managing to the P&L and managing to the business model, I think on a normal circumstance is, clearly, we would modulate operating expenses to protect the business model. But if we think that we're going to get a hit to gross margin as a result of this transaction and certainly with modeling some of that in, then that's going to be temporary in nature. I don't want whip saw the operation and modulate operating expense based on pricing of disc drives. But frankly, to the extent that the gross margin is impacted by the drive situation, that's going to flow through the bottom line on a temporary basis, and the operating expense is going to be more modulated by the overall size of the opportunity that we see."

It's just becoming an integral part of these types of arrays. And the ability of flash and ATA drives in lieu of higher costs, enterprise drives, clearly drives a cost point that's very, very competitive and it's driven up adoption. So the fact that it's bundled in and not exactly tied to customer preference makes it hard to talk about flash adoption. But I would venture to guess, certainly, on the 6000 and the majority of the 3000, that's an integral part of the solution. In terms of the way we go from here, I think you'll continue to see innovation on the flash side from NetApp, both inside the array and outside the array. I don't want to preannounce any products. I don't think that -- I think through the planning horizon in the model that you guys are trying to put up for Q3, I think you should expect that flash drives are going to be substantial the way it is. As far as PCI flash products, you need to be clear on what the opportunity is there. I think for us, things that are going to represent permanent storage, we want to bring into our data management methodology, so that's clearly our interest. As far as flash-based PCI boards as a revenue opportunity on a stand-alone basis, that's not nearly as interesting to us. But as a vehicle to sell software and broaden our footprint, clearly, that's the vector that we'll be pushing."

They are shipping actually a prior version of ONTAP 8 as the default. And they can actually ship a 7.x for some of the models also. So in terms of win rates, particularly around scale-out NAS, it isn't just about 8.1, we're certainly competing with cluster node in that technology with the existing functionality of 8.x. And I think what 8.1 brings to us is not, only the performance that you saw, the new operating system on the platforms clearly is compelling. But what it also does is it reduces the trade off necessary of trading off clustering versus the premium software features. So many of the premium software features in our standard version of ONTAP are now fully clusterable. And from that perspective, obviously, the product has much broader appeal, not just in scale-out NAS but really around traditional business applications. And we really have very, very, rich data management, which is not typical of products in traditional business applications. And then next clustering, to basically give tremendous flexibility and both scale of performance of capacity and also clustering, is a key-enabling technology, a true nonstop operation. So from our perspective, the scale-out NAS is just about one data point. The real focus of our 8.x journey is effectively to bring clustering and premium software features into the traditional business applications area, which have been relatively modest from an innovation perspective for a long period of time."

I want to go back to my first answer is the real dynamic here is not the overall fundamental health of those accounts, it's the performance of those accounts this quarter against our expectation of that performance this quarter that we had 90 days ago. So there are clearly some accounts that might be problematic growth accounts for company-specific reasons. And we knew that going in. And those weren't factored in. And those might be accounts that might be tough for us to drive growth in overtime whether we gain share on them or not. On the other hand, these are accounts where we had higher expectations than what they did, which isn't to say that they're broken or they're damaged and they were losing ground. So -- and some of these accounts are accounts that we've made a lot of progress. And they all did spend money. It's just a question of not as much. So I think from that perspective, I realize that's ultimately not needing to a satisfactory answer, you keep coming back to it. But I'd say that overall, the point is, is that the major accounts, in general, at being a proxy for the broader environment has certainly seen price -- certainly seen pressure, both from a pricing perspective and a demand perspective. And I think that those accounts, being large as they stop and go, have a much bigger impact on our business. So those 9 accounts had a disproportionate amount of our business relative to our expectation, which isn't to say that we're in trouble at any of them. Like I said, I think the competitive pressures are really only relevant in one. And they aren't necessarily the 9 worst accounts because, clearly, we have accounts that we know are going to be problematic and certainly sectors that are going to be problematic, but those were already factored into our forecast. So I just want to be clear is that, we only know -- it's not like we only have 9 accounts that messed -- that we're not happy with. I think these accounts will be very strong for us going forward, and there'd be other accounts that are not on this list that we know are problematic, and that was factored to our guidance. And it is continued to be factored into our guidance going forward."

We do a bottoms up, that's built in and that's how we've kind of come up with the guidance on those. On the OpEx side of the fence and really back to a question of operating margin, the operating margin shortfall is really reflected in the gross margin shortfall. And the gross margin shortfall is driven by the cost pressure that we believe is going to come and we're seeing a little bit of in terms of drive situation that's out there. So that's built into product gross margins, that flows through to the overall operating margin line.

And clearly, the revenue didn't quite come up for a forecast in either K, so we're quite cognizant of that. So the issue that we're trying to solve here, obviously, is we're trying to drive growth as opposed to deal with operating expense. On the other hand, with some uncertainty ahead, both at macro-economically and also with the Thailand flooding, now we need to be careful about where the top line is going and, therefore, we were prudent this particular quarter. So we still hire 300-and-something people. It's not like we were [indiscernible], but that's the balance that we need to have going forward is how do we modulate the spending in proportion to the business. But I also wanted to be clear, as I said earlier, is the impact of the Thailand flood, we expect to be temporary.

We see them certainly replacing a lot of Solara. We see them agitating in our accounts. I think when we think about Isilon, clearly, they were targeting us before EMC bought them. And, certainly, that has not led up. It's approximately causing these accounts. Like I said, the accounts that are on the ascendancy, that suddenly stopped buying or paused for a period of time. That was an intercept of the business by a competitive activity. Certainly, if that was a threat that we're contracting to the forecast 90 days ago, things like that don't happen that quickly. As far as Isilon itself, if you look at the value points that it has around NAS performance, and the other value point has really about manageability of large content tools. Now from a straight performance perspectives, since that subjectively measure clearly the E-Series for high-performance computing, it's clearly much higher performance. Certainly, the benchmark that we just did around SPECsfs around NAS performance and NAS scalability are dramatically less to hardware. So I think from a performance perspective, NetApp is more than able to hold its own. In fact, it has a compelling leadership position there. On a general question of manageability, that's kind of a tough thing to objectively benchmark. But if you look at where we're going with that, now with 8.1, the marriage of all the premium features, which don't exist in that particular product, and, therefore, it makes it difficult to sell into traditional business applications. And also, kind of the merger where we're heading with the Bycast acquisition and object-oriented stuff effectively going to be bringing the functionality of both an Atmos and an Isilon together, if you will. So I feel good about our roadmap. I think, clearly, from a performance perspective, NetApp is really clearly retaking the high ground. And I think from a manageability perspective, obviously, that's a little bit harder to objectively measure, but I think you'll see much better functionality from NetApp and continued competitiveness on that front. So I guess where I see Isilon is some of the premium side of the business around performance and key scientific applications more than comfortable with our stance there. In terms of large content repository pools kind of lower value data, that's primarily a manageability plague. You'll certainly hear more from NetApp hopefully at 8.1 in the future releases. So from us, do we see them? Yes. Were they important fossil of the dynamics of the major accounts? Certainly, we see them, but they were not the primary cause of what we saw in -- from 90 days ago."

So the fact that some of our big accounts may choose to go through a channel partner or go through an integrator or the systems integrators now moving more hardware through their business. So the same involvement of our sales reps might actually have a different fulfillment model, and I think that's in play here, too. The flip-side to that argument that I would also argue is don't assume that our Channel business has 0 touch from our direct sales organization. In some cases, I wish it was more independent. But our direct sales organization is actively involved in a lot of accounts. So I think our direct selling motion is clearly creating demand. And the question is, will they fulfill it directly through NetApp or they prefer to go through in a third party. In a lot of cases, that's a customer choice. So we don't actually measure demand creation by channel. So I wouldn't read into that the direct sales force numbers are necessarily indicative of the lower direct sales force productivity."

Certainly, the last product release was remarkably successful in terms of conversion of customer demand. So I expect the 2000 to pick up as well. So from an overall branded business, like I said, I think the other thing that you need to put in context is just what you believe about the macro environment. So I think the year-over-year growth numbers are all interesting, but I think we're dealing with a different macro environment. Obviously, NetApp has got other elements of the portfolio now that we can rely upon for growth. And I think if you go back to a sequential number, I think the NetApp sequential product performance is actually pretty darn good this quarter than the 9 accounts or the major account in general notwithstanding. I think 5% sequential growth, and even despite everything else that's going on 4% sequential growth from here. If we sustain that for the next couple of years, that would -- or I should say, if we can sustain that though a difficult period, I think that would be pretty good for us and I think we'll certainly be in a share gaining position."

I'm not here to suggest that we found a legal way to achieve an objective to sell products to a banned country. We have no intention of doing that, and we are just as disturbed as this product is in a banned country as anybody else. The other thing is that NetApp produces storage products. We don't produce the applications that are being talked about in this particular article. And our products have been deployed in this solution and in a very generic way, and that NetApp does not produce this application or participated in its development at all.

For instance, ou",894,"Thank you, Tara, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter's financial performance can be characterized by its contrast. In terms of business demand, we continue to see strength across most of our business with the normal puts and takes. For instance, our European enterprise and our Asia/Pac geographies were robust and our E-Series OEM had another stellar quarter. Similarly, our volume channel businesses were very strong and our largest channel partners demonstrated solid growth, where we saw underperformance to our revenue forecast within our major account program. 
Our Q2 guidance included an analysis of the business dynamics associated with these large accounts, their seasonality as well as relatively modest expectations for sequential revenue growth from them. Of the 46 accounts in the program, just 9 of the U.S. accounts produced the entire shortfall from the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Nevertheless, despite lower-than-expected revenue, with our non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share, we're quite strong with non-GAAP EPS above our targeted range and at record level. 
Our total OEM revenues were strong this quarter at $230 million, growing 8% sequentially from Q1. NetApp-branded revenues grew 3% sequentially, impacted primarily by softness in those 9 major accounts I just mentioned. 
Software entitlements and maintenance revenue and services revenue showed a sequential decline this quarter. In the case of SEM, the revenue decline was a function of a minor perturbation in our deferred revenue schedule. For the services revenue, the sequential decline was due to a Q2 drop in professional services revenue, which tends to be lumpy. The underlying revenue growth trends for both SEM and service maintenance contracts remain intact. Moreover, our deferred revenue balance increased by $56 million sequentially and grew 25% year-over-year. We expect that the absolute revenue level will increase for both of these revenue categories next quarter. 
Our non-GAAP product gross margins declined 0.6 percentage points from Q1 levels as the favorable effects of increased volume and configuration mix were more than offset by increased mix of E-Series OEM business, warranty costs and some pricing discounts. Normalizing for mix, these product margins remain within the range of our expectation. 
Non-GAAP service gross margin declined 3.2 percentage points sequentially primarily as a result of a loss on a single transaction. We expect the services margin to bounce back next quarter. The underlying service maintenance contract gross margin remains very healthy. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased less than 1% sequentially this quarter as we maintained our discipline on expense management. Employment growth moderated during the quarter and was lower than every quarter in the past year. 
The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was also lower than forecast, finishing the quarter at 16.4% as we are now anticipating a larger mix of our FY '12 pretax earnings will come from international geographies. We expect our tax rate to return to about 17.5% next quarter, an average 17.5% for FY '12. 
Our balance sheet remained strong with approximately $4.6 billion in cash and investments, down only slightly from Q1 despite the $400 million accelerated share repurchase we executed early in the quarter. Our accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was relatively steady as it increased to 38 days from the 37 days reported in Q1. Inventory turns decreased again this quarter to 14.1x. 
There are several reasons for this, including a large proactive pre-buy of flash memory and a large disc drive pre-buy as the flooding in Thailand was unfolding. We believe we will have sufficient drive inventory through the end of December, but it's difficult for anyone to predict the business impact beyond that. 
Cash from operations at $370 million increased 4% from the same period last year. Free cash flow finished the quarter at $277 million. Our diluted share count decreased by 29.5 million shares sequentially to about 376 million shares, primarily due to a lower average quarterly share price and to our share repurchase. 
Our average quarterly closing price was down from last quarter to $38.25 per share. The accounting per share is associated with our convertible notes and warrants had a large impact, removing about 17 million shares from the diluted share count on a sequential basis, leaving about 7 million shares to account for the convertible notes. 
As you may recall, 80% of the convertible notes are hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the bond hedged, then the non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.01 higher. You can find the table on our website, which shows the impact on the diluted share count for a range of stock prices. 
In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Nick to talk with you about our guidance given that he'll have responsibility for it come January. As I said last quarter, it's been a goal of mine to retire by the time I'm 60, and that milestone is all too close. December 31 will be my last day at NetApp. And therefore, this is my last earnings call. I have enjoyed working with all of you over the years, and I hope to have an opportunity to say goodbye over the next 6 weeks. In the meantime, my CFO responsibilities remain the same as Nick and I work together to facilitate a smooth leadership transition. We will be in great hands come the first of 2012. 
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Nick."

I'm sure I speak for everyone at NetApp when I say you will truly be missed. 
Now looking forward, our target revenue range for Q3 is $1.52 billion to $1.61 billion, which at the midpoint implies approximately 4% sequential growth and 21% year-over-year growth. Consolidated non-GAAP gross margins are expected to finish around 60%. We expect that non-GAAP operating margins will finish around 17%. As Steve mentioned earlier, we expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5% based upon a shift in distribution of our earnings to our international geographies, bringing our non-GAAP earnings per share estimate to approximately $0.56 to $0.60 per share. 
Diluted share count is forecast to increase to about 380 million shares in Q3 based on our average stock price of $41.84 for the first 10 days of the quarter. This will include about 9 million shares from the convertible notes and 0.5 million shares from the warrants. Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible note hedged, that would add about $0.01 to the EPS guidance. 
To summarize, our business model continued to show its underlying resiliency in the second quarter as we exceeded our operating margin and EPS targets despite some revenue softness. In fact, for the first half, we generated 23% year-over-year revenue growth at a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.5%. However, the original financial targets we laid out at our Analyst Day did not foresee the 2 substantial macroeconomic factors we find ourselves managing through today, those being the increasing economic turmoil in Europe and flooding in Thailand. These conditions make forecasting, both revenue and cost of sales going forward, far less predictable. Therefore, we cannot confidently forecast a specific range for Q4 revenue and earnings per share at this time. We will provide you with an update on our Q3 earnings call.

As Steve indicated, the sequential decline in our major account program in a quarter where we expected seasonal growth was the biggest deviation from our forecast. While we were not anticipating sequential growth comparable to last year, we needed better performance from this group to meet our objectives. Fortunately, most of the unexpected shortfall was confined to a small number of accounts where the customer-specific dynamics can be understood. Unlike last quarter, the companies were not concentrated in any specific industry. Beyond this concentrated shortfall, the rest of the business was generally positive. 
The strength in the other areas of our business is evident when looking at it from a geographical perspective. Our U.S. Commercial business grew 24% year-over-year, our Asia-Pacific business grew 55% year-over-year and our EMEA business grew 12% year-over-year in a challenging environment. 
Our E-Series OEM business remains well ahead of plan with 11% sequential growth. We even saw some rebound in spending from the financial services sector. We also saw some budget flush in the U.S. Public Sector, which while up only 9% year-over-year, it was over a month on a compare and it grew 56% sequentially. 
Outside of those 9 major accounts, our Enterprise business was generally strong. Our number of transactions over $1 billion was the second highest ever, increasing 17% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year, while the total net new customer account acquisition is at a 2.5-year high. The volume segments of the business around midsized enterprise and state, local and higher education were very robust and were the highest growth areas of the portfolio. 
Our emphasis on pathway diversification continues to pay off as we saw record sales from our indirect channels, representing the highest ever percentage of our revenue. Our largest distribution partners, Arrow and AppNet, grew to 31% of total revenue and grew 18% year-over-year. CDW, our largest reseller in fiscal year '12, grew over 75% year-over-year. 
Our alliance program continues to generate leverage as we broaden our portfolio of tightly integrated solution offerings in partnership with other best-of-breed vendors. We're in the process of conducting a global Insight event where we train thousands of technical resources, both internally and from our resellers and partners. At the event, we further enhanced our solution offerings by introducing 4 new verified architectures: Microsoft private cloud, Oracle Database, Media Content Management and FlexPod data center solutions. 
FlexPod is a modular data center solution developed in conjunction with Cisco to provide partners and customers with an integrated, standardized and scalable and for structure to support a variety of workloads. Together, we offer validated designs for VMware, SharePoint, SAP, Citrix and Red Hat Linux. 
FlexPod had another strong quarter, and our relationship with Cisco continues to deepen as a result. We now have over 400 FlexPod customers and a robust pipeline for future FlexPod business. On the product side, the newer 3000 and 6000 platforms both had solid quarters. Units shipped of the 3000 were up 34% year-over-year. And FAS6000 units more than doubled over last year's Q2 levels. The 2000 was down year-over-year and down slightly on a sequential basis. 
We saw a decreased demand in both the channel and our large enterprises as well as a shift in business to the newer 3000 family. However, last week, we introduced newly designed 2000 class models for this segment, but our smart decisions are built on NetApp campaign. With refreshed technology, attractive price points and our latest Data ONTAP 8.1 operating system, it represents a compelling solution for each of its target segments. 
Our product launch had a particular focus on the midsized enterprise and our state, local and higher education channels, where our momentum is strong and the partners are eager to introduce the new offerings to their customers. In addition to being the standard operating system on our 2000 series, Data ONTAP 8.1 is now available on our 3000 and 6000 platforms. Our 8.1 operating system is the first product in the market to marry the industry's richest portfolio of data management and storage efficiency technologies with clustering to enable unmatched scalability and nonstop operations. 
Previous architectures, including both traditional approaches and newer niche implementations, have forced customers to make trade-offs amongst these features. NetApp is the only vendor to have the functionality and configurability to produce optimized solutions for the widest range of applications, including virtualization, technical computing, competent repositories and traditional business applications all from a single architecture. 
Evidence on its scalability was demonstrated, while recently published compelling results from an independent SPECsfs benchmark test in which a 24-node cluster of NetApp FAS6000s running 8.1 produced 1.5 million ops per second. This is over 35% faster than the previous record, and we did it with 50% fewer discs and 80% fewer controller nodes, demonstrating a real-world configuration with far better results and far lower cost. 
Our total E-Series product family continues to make a big impact as well. Our 14% sequential growth was driven by an especially strong demand from Teradata and Dell, but our other 2 major OEMs, IBM and Oracle, were up sequentially as well. We have been sufficiently clear about our commitment to this business initially in words and now in behavior that each of our major OEM partners have confirmed the expectation of an ongoing relationship and a couple of already introduced new offerings based on the E-Series technology. 
The E-Series products are also key to our big data strategy in the areas of analytics and big bandwidth. For analytics, E-Series has now been designed into 3 integrated analytic appliances. We also have integrated it into our initial Hadoop solutions and partner engagements. 
For big bandwidth, we are continually broadening the solution offerings to our field, enabling some high-profile full-motion video and high-performance computing wins. All in all, our business operated largely within the balance of our expectation this quarter and were not for the exception of an expectedly large slowdown in a handful of our biggest accounts. We are at least been at the midpoint of our targeted revenue range. 
And we continue this ability in Europe, the persistent economic concerns in the U.S. and the associated uncertainty around federal spending, all things considered, the rest of the business was essentially in line or slightly better than we anticipated 90 days ago. Nonetheless, in response to the aggregate revenue performance, the organization once again demonstrated its ability to manage through the business model, enabling us to increase operating margins over the last quarter and produce record earnings per share. 
Looking ahead, the impact of the Thailand flooding can potentially be the biggest swing factor on both our top and bottom line in the second half. The large buyer drives we did, as this was all unfolding, should sustain us through a good part of Q3 but probably not all of it. Although enterprise class drives are considered to be the least impacted, we still anticipate some amount of supply and pricing complexity. We have all heard the predictions of the industry analyst and the drive vendors themselves. Some of the information is conflicting and most of it is changing daily in regards to scope and ultimate impact. 
I expect NetApp to fare better than most in this process, but it is far too early to state the exact extent this will impact our business either directly or through our OEM partners. On the other hand, our FAS business will begin to get uplift from the just reset -- refreshed 2000 series, and our partners and technical teams are coming off an invigorating symposium where they will brief on Data ONTAP 8.1 and competing using NetApp products. 
I believe NetApp continues to have the best product portfolio and the best partnerships in the industry, both of which will pay off in the long run. 
Before I open up the call to Q&A, I'd like to again thank Steve for more than 9 years of tremendous contributions to NetApp. I'd also like to congratulate the entire NetApp team for being ranked #3 on the World's Best Multinational Workplaces list by the Great Place to Work Institute. The culture at NetApp is one of our keys to success, and this recognition is strong validation of our commitment to creating a model company.

Clearly, that's a competitive business. And certainly, our largest competitor there is being aggressive in the channel and certainly is doing a number of incentives to gain market share or gain mine share. But I would say, frankly, the pricing dynamics are a lot more complicated at the large accounts because they see obviously lesser demand and the opportunity to take advantage of that. So I'd say the pricing environment is probably no different, which isn't to say that it's calm. It's just to say that it's no different. But to the extent the pricing is relevant, I'd say it's probably a little bit more on the major account side."

One of them is the performance of the accounts and the other one is what was our expectation of the performance. I think there are certainly some accounts that certainly have well-known headlines that we knew going into the quarter were going to have some issues associated with them. Certainly, there was concern about the DoD and federal spending and obviously some individual accounts that we're probably are well aware of, that we knew were going to be problematic and we factored that into the forecast. I think that the other ones, we actually probably expected more of our normal Q1 to Q2 seasonality as we think about them, and that's really not what happened. And I'd also add that these were not necessarily problem accounts. These are accounts -- may have them actually on the ascendancy that shows the slowdown. So we want to indicate that we've actually had 9 more problem accounts on our major account portfolio. I think some of those are clearly in the ascendancy with NetApp, which is that we're expecting more from them this particular quarter. I think from competitive pressures, I think, certainly, pricing, clearly in a market where demand is limited and there's a lot of capacity chasing deals, customers are using that to [indiscernible]. But from a pure competitor perspective, in those 9 accounts, there's probably only one that I would say has a meaningful competitive component to it. But I think all the other ones are either macro-related or company-specific."

One was E-Series OEM business and the other one was E-Series overall. So the E-Series OEM business had a more natural compare of the overall since we just really started with the branded business. That's why that number is a little bit higher. So -- and of course, those are our revenue number. I believe on the last call, I talked about a large $14 million deal that would not come to revenues this quarter, and that's clearly still true if you're wondering where the $14 million went. I think on the broader question, the real question here, as we think about the market and we think about the macro, NetApp's focus is almost exclusively on market share because that's really the true measure of our penetration. And the key component in market share or the only thing that gets actually counted in the market share, as reported by the industry analysts, is actually product revenue growth. So as we think about companies in the space with product transitions and acquisitions and I think we're dealing with a different macro environment this year than we were last year, I think, probably, might be the best way to think about that is actually thinking about sequential growth. So if I look at our sequential growth from last quarter, it was about 5.2% on the product side. So if I compare that to, say, EMC's product growth in storage on the most recent quarter, I think that number is about 1.2%. So you could say, well, it's a NetApp Q1 to Q2, and for them, it's a Q2 to Q3. But if you go back another quarter with EMC and look at the Q1 to Q2 transition to them, that's only about 2%. So in terms -- from a market share perspective, which is really a measure of product growth, NetApp actually had more sequential growth in the last 3 months and EMC's had in the last 6 months as on a percentage basis. So to the extent that we're this 1 or #2 market share players in this market, I'd have to think that our market share gains are greater than theirs."

And I would say it'd be really easy for us to just say you should -- we should expect to get all those units back in all of the incremental. But the other thing to notice about our business is that the segments of the market that are most dependent upon products of that class, which is our Volume Channel business, have been the strongest part of our business. So clearly, they moved some of the demands to the newer 3000. So I would expect some of that demand to actually come back from the 3000 into the 2000. So I wouldn't -- it'd be really easy for me to say that it will all be incremental. But I think that there will be some reversed cannibalization of the 3000 just like we saw when the 3000 came out. As far as the enterprise and Department of Defense, or I'll just say U.S. Public Sector, those are big consumers of this class of product as well. And there are some attributes of this product in terms of size and compatibility with prior products, which actually will enable the product transition in our favor here that was held up with the previous generation. So I do expect not only this to impact our Channel business but I do expect that impact our enterprise and our U.S. Public Sector business as well."

I think if you think about it from last quarter, clearly, the federal side was a concern for us. We're wrapping up the quarter in the face of the debt-ceiling crisis, and I don't really know whether that impacted us or not. But we also -- on the last call, we talked about the U.S. Public Sector and we talked about financial services. So you can actually argue that it's actually even more concentrated than it was last quarter, so instead of spreading it might actually be contracting. And as far as the accounts are -- we need to look at every single one of them. More than clearly, it's really competitive and/or it's largely competitive, and I think we need to take that on clearly. And I don't think that's less than anybody. But I think most of the other ones, I think, most of those are accounts that are actually doing quite well from a NetApp perspective. And they took a pause. And some of them, obviously, we did some insight to see when we expect them to come back. Some of them will, some of them will pause a little bit longer based on their own company dynamics. So I think that the advantage of it having being a definable set of named accounts is that we can build and actually play in around every single one of them. As opposed to if we saw a broad weakness in the channel that would be 1,000 account problems. So I think there are things that we're going to jump onto. I'd say that most of those accounts are still relatively favorable at NetApp and we're not losing any share in them. We may or may not, depending on each individual situation as you see a rebound in them next quarter and that's what's factored into our guidance."

And from the point of view of managing to the P&L and managing to the business model, I think on a normal circumstance is, clearly, we would modulate operating expenses to protect the business model.

It's just becoming an integral part of these types of arrays. And the ability of flash and ATA drives in lieu of higher costs, enterprise drives, clearly drives a cost point that's very, very competitive and it's driven up adoption. So the fact that it's bundled in and not exactly tied to customer preference makes it hard to talk about flash adoption. But I would venture to guess, certainly, on the 6000 and the majority of the 3000, that's an integral part of the solution. In terms of the way we go from here, I think you'll continue to see innovation on the flash side from NetApp, both inside the array and outside the array. I don't want to preannounce any products. I don't think that -- I think through the planning horizon in the model that you guys are trying to put up for Q3, I think you should expect that flash drives are going to be substantial the way it is. As far as PCI flash products, you need to be clear on what the opportunity is there. I think for us, things that are going to represent permanent storage, we want to bring into our data management methodology, so that's clearly our interest. As far as flash-based PCI boards as a revenue opportunity on a stand-alone basis, that's not nearly as interesting to us. But as a vehicle to sell software and broaden our footprint, clearly, that's the vector that we'll be pushing."

They are shipping actually a prior version of ONTAP 8 as the default. And they can actually ship a 7.x for some of the models also. So in terms of win rates, particularly around scale-out NAS, it isn't just about 8.1, we're certainly competing with cluster node in that technology with the existing functionality of 8.x. And I think what 8.1 brings to us is not, only the performance that you saw, the new operating system on the platforms clearly is compelling. But what it also does is it reduces the trade off necessary of trading off clustering versus the premium software features. So, many of the premium software features in our standard version of ONTAP are now fully clusterable. And from that perspective, obviously, the product has much broader appeal, not just in scale-out NAS but really around traditional business applications. And we really have very, very, rich data management, which is not typical of products in traditional business applications. And then next clustering, to basically give tremendous flexibility and both scale of performance of capacity and also clustering, is a key-enabling technology, a true nonstop operation. So from our perspective, the scale-out NAS is just about one data point. The real focus of our 8.x journey is effectively to bring clustering and premium software features into the traditional business applications area, which have been relatively modest from an innovation perspective for a long period of time."

I want to go back to my first answer is the real dynamic here is not the overall fundamental health of those accounts, it's the performance of those accounts this quarter against our expectation of that performance this quarter that we had 90 days ago. So there are clearly some accounts that might be problematic growth accounts for company-specific reasons. And we knew that going in. And those weren't factored in. And those might be accounts that might be tough for us to drive growth in overtime whether we gain share on them or not. On the other hand, these are accounts where we had higher expectations than what they did, which isn't to say that they're broken or they're damaged and they were losing ground. So -- and some of these accounts are accounts that we've made a lot of progress. And they all did spend money. It's just a question of not as much. So I think from that perspective, I realize that's ultimately not needing to a satisfactory answer, you keep coming back to it. But I'd say that overall, the point is, is that the major accounts, in general, at being a proxy for the broader environment have certainly seen price -- certainly seen pressure, both from a pricing perspective and a demand perspective. And I think that those accounts, being large as they stop and go, have a much bigger impact on our business. So those 9 accounts had a disproportionate amount of our business relative to our expectation, which isn't to say that we're in trouble at any of them. Like I said, I think the competitive pressures are really only relevant in one. And they aren't necessarily the 9 worst accounts because, clearly, we have accounts that we know are going to be problematic and certainly sectors that are going to be problematic, but those were already factored into our forecast. So I just want to be clear that, we only know -- it's not like we only have 9 accounts that messed -- that we're not happy with. I think these accounts will be very strong for us going forward, and there'd be other accounts that are not on this list that we know are problematic, and that was factored to our guidance. And it is continued to be factored into our guidance going forward."

We do a bottoms up, that's built in and that's how we've kind of come up with the guidance on those. On the OpEx side of the fence and really back to a question of operating margin, the operating margin shortfall is really reflected in the gross margin shortfall. And the gross margin shortfall is driven by the cost pressure that we believe is going to come and we're seeing a little bit of in terms of drive situation that's out there. So that's built into product gross margins, that flows through to the overall operating margin line. And I've made reference before to the OpEx as a percentage of revenue is basically flat, so the expense structure we've managed pretty well."

It would be programs. It would be hiring and things of that nature. If you look at this quarter similar to last quarter, we came in over the top on the EPS side. And clearly, the revenue didn't quite come up for a forecast in either K, so we're quite cognizant of that. So the issue that we're trying to solve here, obviously, is we're trying to drive growth as opposed to deal with operating expense. On the other hand, with some uncertainty ahead, both at macro-economically and also with the Thailand flooding, now we need to be careful about where the top line is going and, therefore, we were prudent this particular quarter. So we still hire 300-and-something people. It's not like we were sitting idlely by, but that's the balance that we need to have going forward is how do we modulate the spending in proportion to the business. But I also wanted to be clear, as I said earlier, is the impact of the Thailand flood, we expect to be temporary. And I'm not going to modulate operating expense too much on that because, a, it's going to be hard to predict, and I hate to just kind of jerk the organization around a set of data points that are changing every day."

We see them certainly replacing a lot of Solara. We certainly see them agitating in our accounts. I think when we think about Isilon, clearly, they were targeting us before EMC bought them. And, certainly, that has not led up. It's approximately causing these accounts. Like I said, the accounts that are on the ascendancy, that suddenly stopped buying or paused for a period of time. That wasn’t an intercept of the business by a competitive activity. Certainly, if that was a threat that we're contracting to the forecast 90 days ago, things like that don't happen that quickly. As far as Isilon itself, if you look at the value points that it has around NAS performance, and the other value point has really about manageability of large content tools. From a straight performance perspective, since that’s subjectively measure, clearly the E-Series for high-performance computing, it's clearly much higher performance. Certainly, the benchmark that we just did around SPECsfs around NAS performance and NAS scalability are dramatically less hardware. So I think from a performance perspective, NetApp is more than able to hold its own. In fact, it has a compelling leadership position there. On a general question of manageability, that's kind of a tough thing to objectively benchmark. But if you look at where we're going with that, now with 8.1, the marriage of all the premium features, which don't exist in that particular product and, therefore, it makes it difficult to sell into traditional business applications. And also, kind of the merger where we're heading with the Bycast acquisition and object-oriented stuff effectively going to be bringing the functionality of both an Atmos and an Isilon together, if you will. So I feel good about our roadmap. I think, clearly, from a performance perspective, NetApp is really clearly retaking the high ground. And I think from a manageability perspective, obviously, that's a little bit harder to objectively measure, but I think you'll see much better functionality from NetApp and continued competitiveness on that front. So I guess where I see Isilon is some of the premium side of the business around performance and key scientific applications more than comfortable with our stance there. In terms of large content repository pools kind of lower value data, that's primarily a manageability plague. You'll certainly hear more from NetApp hopefully at 8.1 in the future releases. So from us, do we see them? Yes. Were they important part and parcel of the dynamics of the major accounts? Certainly, we see them, but they were not the primary cause of what we saw in -- from 90 days ago."

The flip-side to that argument that I would also argue is don't assume that our Channel business has 0 touch from our direct sales organization. In some cases, I wish it was more independent. But our direct sales organization is actively involved in a lot of accounts. So I think our direct selling motion is clearly creating demand. And the question is, will they fulfill it directly through NetApp or they prefer to go through in a third party. In a lot of cases, that's a customer choice.

Obviously, NetApp has got other elements of the portfolio now that we can rely upon for growth.

I think it's tied more to the fiscal situation in the United States than it is to anything else."

The VNXe in terms of EMC's channel incentives is something that we've seen more of. Certainly, if you look at the performance of our volume segments, clearly, that's been the strongest part of our portfolio. So I don't think they've slowed us down much. But nonetheless, I'd say that VNXe is something that we see particularly because of that channel push. And I think that's been something that's generated a more discussion within NetApp and actually the VNX itself. I think the VNX itself is -- I think has been inflicting more pain on Dell than it has been put -- inflicting on NetApp."

Just one last thing before we wrap up is I wanted to bring up that we are quite aware of a number of press articles about NetApp products being deployed in Syria by our systems integrator named Aria. And the one thing I wanted to be very, very clear about this is I want to assure the people on the call, our customers, our partners, our employees, that we absolutely do not support the sale of NetApp equipment to Syria. I'm not here to suggest that we found a legal way to achieve an objective to sell product to a banned country. We have no intention of doing that, and we are just as disturbed as this product is in a banned country as anybody else. The other thing is that NetApp produces storage products. We don't produce the applications that are being talked about in this particular article. And our products have been deployed in this solution and in a very generic way, and that NetApp does not produce this application or participated in its development at all. 
And the last thing I probably want to point out is that NetApp has proactively reached out to the government, and we've offered a full assistance in reviewing the matter, sharing any information that we have about the situation and ultimately get to the facts. At this point, we don't know even whether the story is true or acting as if it were and taking all the appropriate precautions. So I can assure you that this is a situation that we did not actively seek out. We did not choose to sell to the Syrian government. We did not deal with the Syrian government and we're not looking a way to circumvent U.S. law to sell to the Syrian government. We have no interest in providing product to a banned country. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. 
So with that, I would like to thank you for your time today and your interest in NetApp, and we'll see you all in 90 days."
