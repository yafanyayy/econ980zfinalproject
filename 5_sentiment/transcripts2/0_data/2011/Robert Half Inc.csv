Now let's review our fourth quarter results. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $852 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter of last year. Income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.17, up 89% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter was $74 million, and capital expenditures were $13 million. 
We paid a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders at $0.13 per share for a total of $19 million. We also repurchased 700,000 RHI shares during the fourth quarter at a cost of $20 million. Approximately 11.4 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
During the fourth quarter, demand for our professional staffing and consulting services continued to improve across-the-board. Each of our lines of business reported sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The Robert Half Finance & Accounting a Permanent Placement division continued to perform well, with revenues up 30% versus one year ago. 
Our technology and office administration divisions also reported strong revenue growth, as did our international operations. Protiviti reported its best operating results in more than two years. Now I'll turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at our fourth quarter financial results. We'll have time for questions after our remarks."

Fourth quarter revenues were $852 million, an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter of last year and an increase of 4% sequentially. On a constant currency basis, the year-over-year sequential growth rates were 16% and 3%, respectively. There were 62 billing days in the fourth quarter of 2010, the same as the fourth quarter of the prior year. There will be 63 billing days in the first quarter of 2011. 
Revenues for Accountemps where $319 million, up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 6% sequentially on a same-day basis. Accountemps is our largest staffing division, with 354 offices worldwide. It accounts for 37% of company revenues. 
OfficeTeam had revenues of $174 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 11% sequentially on a same-day basis. OfficeTeam, which was introduced in 1991, is our high end administrative staffing division. It represents 21% of company revenues. There are 320 OfficeTeam locations worldwide. 
Fourth quarter 2010 revenues for Robert Half Management Resources were $103 million, up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 9% sequentially on a same-day basis. This division was introduced in '97 and places senior-level accounting and finance professionals on a project basis. It has 153 locations worldwide and, it makes up 12% of company revenues.
Revenues for Robert Half Technology were $92 million in the fourth quarter, up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 10% sequentially on a same-day basis. Robert Half Technology was introduced in 1994 and places information technology professionals on a consulting and full-time basis. This business operates in 116 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company revenues.
Robert Half Finance & Accounting, our Permanent Placement division, had revenues of $59 million in the fourth quarter. As Max indicated, this is a 30% increase from the fourth quarter of 2009 and an increase of 8% on a same-day sequential basis. Our Permanent Placement services were established in 1948 and are in 354 locations worldwide. This business accounts for 7% of company-wide revenues.
Fourth quarter revenues for our international staffing operations were $221 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 13% sequentially on a same-day basis. On a constant currency, same-day basis, these growth rates were 19% versus one year ago and 8% sequentially. We have staffing operations in 100 locations in 18 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 30% of total staffing revenues. 
Protiviti revenues were $104 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. It has 60 locations in 16 countries and accounts for 12% of total RHI revenues. Protiviti's international operations represent 29% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $238 million or 34.5% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 34.1% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010. The fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 included workers' compensation credits of $1.5 million and $4 million, respectively. These were made pursuant to independent actuarial reviews. 
On a sequential and year-over-year basis, we saw improvements in pay bill spreads and temp-to-hire conversions. Overall staffing gross margin was $297 million in the fourth quarter or 39.7% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.1% of staffing revenues in Q4 2009 and 39.3% of revenues in Q3 2010. The mix of Permanent Placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represent 7.9%, 7.1% and 8% of revenues for Q4 2010, Q4 2009 and Q3 2010, respectively. 
Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $30 million or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 28.7% of Protiviti revenues in Q4 2009 and $27 million or 27% of revenues in the third quarter of 2010. The increases are due primarily to higher utilization rates, both in the United States and internationally. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs. Staffing SG&A costs for the fourth quarter were $257 million or 34.4% of staffing revenues. This compares to $229 million or 35.7% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $245 million or 34.2% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010. The increase in the quarter relates primarily to staff compensation costs. We continue to invest aggressively in additional headcount in the technology staffing sector. 
In addition, we backfilled positions in certain locations that had become understaffed during the downturn. We ended 2010 with 8,200 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year. Fourth quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were $27 million or 25.6% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 28.4% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $27 million again or 26.9% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010. We ended the year with 2,500 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, the same number as 2009.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $40 million during the fourth quarter or 5.3% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions contributed $36 million of this amount or 5.2% of applicable revenues. Fourth quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $4 million or 6.3% of applicable revenues. 
Operating income for Protiviti was $3.3 million in the fourth quarter or 3.2% of revenues. This compares to $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 or 0.3% of revenues. The year-over-year increases are due to significant improvements in Protiviti's non-U.S. operations during the quarter. 
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $423 million, with implied days outstanding of 45.2 days, which compares to 44.7 days at the end of the fourth quarter one year ago. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We saw the following trends in our business during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first few weeks of January. On a same-day sequential basis, temporary and consulting revenues were up in October, up in November and up again in December. On a same-day basis, Permanent Placement revenues were up in October and down in November and December. 
During the first two weeks of January, revenues from our temporary and consulting businesses were up 14% compared to the same period last year. For the first three weeks of January, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 38% compared to the same period last year. As we've said many times before, it's very difficult to evaluate Perm Placement trends over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these are early trends, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues, $850 million to $900 million; income per share, $0.13 to $0.18 per share. As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. The estimates we provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Now I'll turn it back to Max."
276703,118409911,95634,"Robert Half International Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2011",2011-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Robert Half Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith.

As I said at the start of this call, we were pleased to see broad-based improvement throughout our operations during the fourth quarter. As many companies that had placed hiring plans on hold began adding staff on both a temporary and full-time basis as a result of better business conditions., U.S. unemployment levels remain high by historical standards, but we characterize the mood among our clients as certainly more optimistic than it has been in quite a while. 
We also were pleased with Protiviti's operating results during the quarter, including those outside the United States. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, Protiviti's financial services industry practice is working with clients to help them understand and comply with the various financial reform measures that have either been enacted or are in process around the world. Protiviti's information technology practice is serving clients in areas such as IT, security and privacy, IT applications controls and infrastructure of management. 
Reflecting back on the year as a whole, we believe we have positioned the business well to take advantage of improving economic conditions. As we head into 2011, we are optimistic about the growth prospects for our business for a number of reasons: The macroeconomic environment does appear to be improving. The U.S. economy added more than 1.1 million jobs last year. That is the most job growth since 2006. Hiring demand has improved outside the United States as well. As Keith indicated, revenues for our non-U.S. staffing operations were up 19% year-over-year and up 8% from third quarter of 2010. 
Businesses are benefiting from the use of variable cost of labor. In our experience, one effect to the global recession has been wider adoption by companies of flexible staffing models, including these some temporary and project professionals. For the small and mid-sized businesses that make up the largest percentage of our client base, the ability to keep labor costs variable is invaluable. 
Macro trends point to future hiring demand. Financial regulatory reform in the wake of the global financial crisis offers potential revenue sources for Protiviti and our staffing divisions. We also continue to believe the impending retirement of baby boomers from the workforce will heighten the demand for skilled workers in the coming years. 
Historically, we have emerged from economic downturns stronger than before. While we cannot predict the future, we hope this cycle is no exception. So far, this is among the fastest recoveries we've ever experienced post-downturn. In 2010, we saw higher demand for our staffing and consulting services across-the-board. This demand accelerated in the second half of the year. 
We have an experienced team in place, both in the field and corporate services. I recently attended a meeting of our senior field managers in Phoenix, Arizona and was reminded once again what a talented and tenured team we have. They know what it takes to come back strong following the downturn because they have been there before, and I am confident in their leadership. We kept our domestic and international office network largely intact during the recession, which means we're well positioned to respond to improved hiring demand. As Keith noted earlier in the call, we did begin adding staff in the fourth quarter to support future growth. 
The middle market and professional segments of the market are under-penetrated in our view. We work with a fraction of the middle market business as we feel we could be working with. We are particularly optimistic about the opportunities we see in the technology staffing sector and are also encouraged by the growth potential in the accounting and finance segment, where we are already recognized leaders. 
We have strong brand names and we supported them during the downturn with marketing and promotional campaigns to stay visible with clients and candidates. We see business opportunities in the blended service model offered by our staffing divisions and Protiviti. We are able to deliver a full range of staffing and consulting services to our clients at a competitive price. 
Finally, we are in a strong financial position. We had positive operating cash flow of $176 million in 2010, which helped to fund approximately $96 million in RHI stock repurchases, $35 million in capital expenditures and the payment of $77 million in dividends to stockholders. We kept a close watch on accounts receivable in 2010 and as a result, the collection period remained virtually unchanged during the year. This was a strong contributor to our cash flow. We ended the year with $315 million in cash and cash equivalents and essentially no debt. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. We would ask, as usual, that you please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up as needed. If you have additional questions, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

The first as you just alluded to, we do expect the state unemployment rates to increase in 2011 about at the same rate that they did in 2010. 2010, when all is said and done, there was a 75 basis point increase in state unemployment rates, which we ultimately totally recovered but it took us some time over the course of the year to do so. We expect that same 75 basis points in 2011, which again, we're cautiously optimistic we'll pass through. It just won't all happen in the first quarter. Our guidance, we're assuming that there will be a 50 to 75 basis points sequentially reduction in temp gross margins for that reason alone. The other big margin impact for the first quarter is Protiviti seasonality. If you look back for the last several years, you'll see that Protiviti revenues declined sequentially on a seasonal basis between 6% and 18%. Our guidance has a declining in the 10% range, which means Protiviti would lose in $3 million to $5 million in the first quarter. At the midpoint there, that's half as much as they lost a year ago, coming off what was a very good fourth quarter for Protiviti. So the temp margins, because of state unemployment, Protiviti seasonality, notwithstanding a very positive backdrop both in the fourth quarter and for 2011 as a full year, are the principal drivers for the lower margins in our guidance."

In the U.S. particularly, we're seeing regulatory-related engagements. You have many thrifts trying to get in front of their new regulator, the OCC, which they expect to be a tougher regulator than they've had in the past. We see a lot of attention by financial services clients around consumer lending, fair lending regulations. So our financial services practice clearly is benefiting from even anticipated regulatory reform, which was a big, big story in the fourth quarter. We don't think that stated positively. We do think that the success we saw in the fourth quarter will continue into 2011 for Protiviti. Just on a seasonal basis as we've discussed for many years running here, our clients tend to focus on their 10-Ks, getting their books closed, the same buyers that we have in internal audit and SOX [Sarbanes-Oxley Act] also tend to be buyers that are impacted as well on the consulting side of our business. So seasonally, the first quarter is always going to be the lightest for Protiviti. But I can tell you in Protiviti and in staffing as well, there's clearly the most positive backdrop of business environment as we speak, as we've seen in several quarters."

We've been systematically backfilling where we got really small for three or four quarters. They got more pronounced during the fourth quarter, and we feel like we pretty much backfilled those really tiny locations where we needed more presence to participate in the upside. We've also made a big investment in technology. Our bias, as you know, is always to build rather than buy when we can. We're very encouraged with the early results in the technology space. If you think about today versus 10 years ago, even our middle-market clients have websites that are an integral part of their marketing strategy, which creates Web development demand. In addition to that, they're all listed in web analytics as to who's coming to their site, et cetera. And so the combination of those, we think, presents a unique opportunity in the technology space with respect to middle market companies where we can get margins that are close, if not at the levels we've got in accounting and finance. One other footnote on headcount and backfilling, et cetera, if you look back in time, you'll note that in the second half of 2003, just as business was beginning to improve in that recovery, we added disproportionately to our headcount, which positioned us well thereafter. And so, it's not since 2003 that we've added a higher percentage of headcount than was our revenue growth, which was the case in 2010. So what you've seen in the second half of 2010, quite frankly, is very similar to the same thing we did. Now maybe it's more technology-related this time versus in the past, but essentially, we staffed up in advance of the last recovery, and it's with that same intent that we did this year, the second half."

We'll underspent that to some degree for timing reasons. That rolls into '11. Further, we've got big lease expirations in London and Brussels. That will create some TI costs. We're refreshing our desktops and laptops, both in staffing and in Protiviti. Further, we're making IT, back office infrastructure investments particularly in Europe. So all of those things together, the CapEx looking like $50 million to $55 million. Tax rate, as the business improves, the tax rate should come down. The non-deductible items become a lesser portion of the total. As we do better outside the U.S., particularly in Protiviti, you get a favorable tax impact from that. So I would think over the course of 2011, the tax rate will drift down. I wouldn't have it go down a lot in the first quarter but it should drift down the rest of the year."

Clearly, yes, we do go to market together, and we provide a blended service where Protiviti provides the supervision, the deliverables, the arms and legs often come from the staffing side.

While we tend to think very discreetly about consulting versus staffing, trust me, many clients don't and many clients have a problem. And whether we staff that internally from Protiviti or from staffing, that's kind of our call. The second piece of your question is to the extent to which Protiviti uses contractors sourced through our staffing operations on their engagements. That is also somewhere where we're having increasing success. If you look at first quarter of 2010 versus our guidance for first quarter of 2011, you will see when you work through the numbers, we're expecting the cost to flex quite a bit more in '11 than they did in '10 because of the higher contractor mix, which is variable that they're currently using. And we hope to take that even higher into the future. So long story short, yes, we're going to market together. We think we have a competitive advantage because nobody under the same roof has the consulting and staffing capabilities that we do. Clients get that and they're responding favorably to it. And yes, Protiviti is making its cost structure more and more variable. It's now over double digits as a percentage of its workforce and its sources grew staffing.

We want to grow each of those businesses on their own right. Given the market opportunity in Tech, I think it's reasonable to say it will be a larger percent. As to organically versus acquisition, we've got almost a 25-year history here now. Clearly, we believe in organic growth and the superior returns it gives on capital to acquisitions. So not that we're negative on acquisitions but if we can build it ourselves, why in the world would we buy it, particularly in the current market? If you've got a technology business, you think you're sitting on a gold mine, and the prices are higher than ever. We're very encouraged to the extent over the last six to 12 months, we've invested in technology on an organic basis, the returns are good. We think there's a unique opportunity where tech development is reaching down in the middle market companies for reasons that we spoke about earlier. So we're very positive on Tech."

Now let's review our fourth quarter results. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $852 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter of last year. Income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.17, up 89% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter was $74 million, and capital expenditures were $13 million. 
We paid a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders at $0.13 per share for a total of $19 million. We also repurchased 700,000 RHI shares during the fourth quarter at a cost of $20 million. Approximately 11.4 million shares remain available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
During the fourth quarter, demand for our professional staffing and consulting services continued to improve across the board. Each of our lines of business reported sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Our Robert Half Finance & Accounting Permanent Placement division continued to perform well, with revenues up 30% versus one year ago. 
Our technology and office Administration divisions also reported strong revenue growth, as did our international operations. Protiviti reported its best operating results in more than two years.

There were 62 billing days in the fourth quarter of 2010, the same as the fourth quarter of the prior year. There will be 63 billing days in the first quarter of 2011. 
Revenues for Accountemps where $319 million, up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 6% sequentially on a same-day basis. Accountemps is our largest staffing division, with 354 offices worldwide. It accounts for 37% of company revenues. 
OfficeTeam had revenues of $174 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 11% sequentially on a same-day basis. OfficeTeam, which was introduced in 1991, is our high-end administrative staffing division. It represents 21% of company revenues. There are 320 OfficeTeam locations worldwide. 
Fourth quarter 2010 revenues for Robert Half Management Resources were $103 million, up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 9% sequentially on a same-day basis. This division was introduced in '97 and places senior-level accounting and finance professionals on a project basis. It has 153 locations worldwide, and it makes up 12% of company revenues.
Revenues for Robert Half Technology were $92 million in the fourth quarter, up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 10% sequentially on a same-day basis. Robert Half Technology was introduced in 1994 and places information technology professionals on a consulting and full-time basis. This business operates in 116 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company revenues.
Robert Half Finance & Accounting, our Permanent Placement division, had revenues of $59 million in the fourth quarter. As Max indicated, this is a 30% increase from the fourth quarter of 2009 and an increase of 8% on a same-day sequential basis. Our Permanent Placement services were established in 1948 and are in 354 locations worldwide. This business accounts for 7% of company-wide revenues.
Fourth quarter revenues for our international staffing operations were $221 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 13% sequentially on a same-day basis. On a constant currency same-day basis, these growth rates were 19% versus one year ago and 8% sequentially. We have staffing operations at 100 locations in 18 countries outside the U.S. international staffing operations represent 30% of total staffing revenues. 
Protiviti revenues were $104 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and an internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. It has 60 locations in 16 countries and accounts for 12% of total RHI revenues. Protiviti's International operations represent 29% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting staffing operations was $238 million or 34.5% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 34.1% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010. The fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 included workers' compensation credits of $1.5 million and $4 million, respectively. These were made pursuant to independent actuarial reviews. 
On a sequential and year-over-year basis, we saw improvements in pay bill spreads and temp-to-hire conversions. Overall staffing gross margin was $297 million in the fourth quarter or 39.7% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.1% of staffing revenues in Q4 2009 and 39.3% of revenues in Q3 2010. The mix of Permanent Placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 7.9%, 7.1% and 8% of revenues for Q4 2010, Q4 2009 and Q3 2010, respectively. 
Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $30 million or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 28.7% of Protiviti revenues in Q4 2009 and $27 million or 27% of revenues in the third quarter of 2010. The increases are due primarily to higher utilization rates, both in the United States and internationally. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative cost. Staffing SG&A cost for the fourth quarter were $257 million or 34.4% of staffing revenues. This compares to $229 million or 35.7% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $245 million or 34.2% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010. The increase in the quarter relates primarily to staff compensation cost. We continue to invest aggressively in additional headcount in the technology staffing sector. 
In addition, we backfilled positions in certain locations that had become understaffed during the downturn. We ended 2010 with 8,200 full-time-employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year. Fourth quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million or 25.6% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 28.4% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $27 million again or 26.9% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010. We ended the year with 2,500 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, the same number as 2009.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $40 million during the fourth quarter or 5.3% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $36 million of this amount or 5.2% of applicable revenues. Fourth quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $4 million or 6.3% of applicable revenues. 
Operating income for Protiviti was $3.3 million in the fourth quarter or 3.2% of revenues. This compares to $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 or 0.3% of revenues. The year-over-year increases are due to significant improvements in Protiviti's non-U.S. operations during the quarter. 
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $423 million, with implied days outstanding of 45.2 days, which compares to 44.7 days at the end of the fourth quarter one year ago. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We saw the following trends in our business during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first few weeks of January. On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were up in October, up in November and up again in December. On a same-day basis, Permanent Placement revenues were up in October and down in November and December. 
During the first two weeks of January, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 14% compared to the same period last year. For the first three weeks of January, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 38% compared to the same period last year. As we've said many times before, it's very difficult to evaluate Perm Placement trends over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these are early trends, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $850 million to $900 million; income per share, $0.13 to $0.18 per share. As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. The estimates we've provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Now I'll turn it back to Max."

As I said at the start of this call, we were pleased to see broad-based improvement throughout our operations during the fourth quarter as many companies that had placed hiring plans on hold began adding staff on both a temporary and ful",813,"Thank you, Keith. As I said at the start of this call, we were pleased to see broad-based improvement throughout our operations during the fourth quarter as many companies that had placed hiring plans on hold began adding staff on both a temporary and full-time basis as a result of better business conditions. U.S. unemployment levels remain high by historical standards, but we characterize the mood among our clients as certainly more optimistic than it has been in quite a while. 
We also were pleased with Protiviti's operating results during the quarter, including those outside the United States. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, Protiviti's financial services industry practice is working with clients to help them understand and comply with the various financial reform measures that have either been enacted or are in process around the world. Protiviti's information technology practice is serving clients in areas such as IT, security and privacy, IT applications controls and infrastructure management. 
Reflecting back on the year as a whole, we believe we have positioned the business well to take advantage of improving economic conditions. As we head into 2011, we are optimistic about the growth prospects for our business for a number of reasons. The macroeconomic environment does appear to be improving. The U.S. economy added more than 1.1 million jobs last year. That is the most job growth since 2006. Hiring demand has improved outside the United States as well. As Keith indicated, revenues for our non-U.S. staffing operations were up 19% year-over-year and up 8% from the third quarter of 2010. 
Businesses are benefiting from the use of variable cost of labor. In our experience, one effect of the global recession has been wider adoption by companies of flexible staffing models, including these are temporary and project professionals. For the small and mid-sized businesses that make up the largest percentage of our client base, the ability to keep labor cost variable is invaluable. 
Macro trends point to future hiring demand. Financial regulatory reform in the wake of the global financial crisis offers potential revenue sources for Protiviti and our staffing divisions. We also continue to believe the impending retirement of baby boomers from the workforce will heighten the demand for skill workers in the coming years. 
Historically, we have emerged from economic downturns stronger than before. While we cannot predict the future, we hope this cycle is no exception. So far, this is among the fastest recoveries we've ever experienced post-downturn. In 2010, we saw higher demand for our staffing and consulting services across the board. This demand accelerated in the second half of the year. 
We have an experienced team in place, both in the field and corporate services. I recently attended a meeting of our senior field managers in Phoenix, Arizona and was reminded once again what a talented and tenured team we have. They know what it takes to come back strong following the downturn, because they have been there before, and I am confident in their leadership. We kept our domestic and international office network largely intact during the recession, which means we're well positioned to respond to improved hiring demand. As Keith noted earlier in the call, we did begin adding staff in the fourth quarter to support future growth. 
The middle market and professional segments of the market are under penetrated in our view. We work with a fraction of the middle market business we feel we could be working with. We're particularly optimistic about the opportunities we see in the technology staffing sector and are also encouraged by the growth potential in the accounting and finance segment, where we are already recognized leaders. 
We have strong brand names, and we supported them during the downturn with marketing and promotional campaigns to stay visible with clients and candidates. We see business opportunities in the blended service model offered by our staffing divisions and Protiviti. We are able to deliver a full range of staffing and consulting services to our clients at a competitive price. 
Finally, we are in a strong financial position. We had positive operating cash flow of $176 million in 2010, which helped to fund approximately $96 million in RHI stock repurchases, $35 million in capital expenditures and the payment of $77 million in dividends to stockholders. We kept a close watch on accounts receivable in 2010, and as a result, the collection period remained virtually unchanged during the year. This was a strong contributor to our cash flow. We ended the year with $315 million in cash and cash equivalents and essentially no debt. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. We would ask, as usual, that you please limit yourself to one question and a follow up as needed. If you have additional questions, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

The first, as you just alluded to, we do expect the state unemployment rates to increase in 2011 about at the same rate that they did in 2010. 2010, when all is said and done, there was a 75-basis-point increase in state unemployment rates, which we ultimately totally recovered, but it took us some time over the course of the year to do so. We expect that same 75 basis points in 2011, which again, we're cautiously optimistic we'll pass through. It just won't all happen in the first quarter. Our guidance, we're assuming that there will be a 50 to 75 basis points, sequentially, reduction in temp gross margins for that reason alone. The other big margin impact for the first quarter is Protiviti seasonality. If you look back, for the last several years, you'll see that Protiviti revenues decline sequentially on a seasonal basis between 6% and 18%. Our guidance has it declining in the 10% range, which means Protiviti would lose $3 million to $5 million in the first quarter. At the midpoint there, that's half as much as they lost a year ago, coming off what was a very good fourth quarter for Protiviti. So the temp margins, because of state unemployment, Protiviti seasonality, notwithstanding a very positive backdrop, both in the fourth quarter and for 2011 as a full year, are the principal drivers for the lower margins in our guidance."

In the U.S., particularly, we're seeing regulatory-related engagements. You have many thrifts trying to get in front of their new regulator, the OCC, which they expect to be a tougher regulator than they've had in the past. We see a lot of attention by financial services clients around consumer lending, fair lending regulations. So our financial services practice clearly is benefiting from even anticipated regulatory reform, which was a big, big story in the fourth quarter. We don't think that -- or stated positively, we do think that the success we saw in the fourth quarter will continue into 2011 for Protiviti. Just on a seasonal basis, as we've discussed for many years running here, our clients tend to focus on their 10-Ks, getting their books closed, the same buyers that we have in internal audit and SOX [Sarbanes-Oxley Act] also tend to be buyers that are impacted as well on the consulting side of our business. So seasonally, the first quarter is always going to be the lightest for Protiviti. But I can tell you, not only -- in Protiviti and in staffing as well, there's clearly the most positive backdrop of business environment as we speak, as we have seen in several quarters."

We've been systematically backfilling where we got really small for three or four quarters. They got more pronounced during the fourth quarter, and we feel like we pretty much backfilled those really tiny locations where we needed more presence to participate in the upside. We have also made a big investment in technology. Our bias, as you know, is always to build rather than buy when we can. We're very encouraged with the early results in the technology space. If you think about today versus 10 years ago, even our middle market clients have websites that are a integral part of their marketing strategy, which creates web development demand. In addition to that, they're all interested in web analytics as to who's coming to their site, et cetera. And so the combination of those, we think, presents a unique opportunity in the technology space with respect to middle market companies where we can get margins that are close, if not at the levels we've got in accounting and finance. One other footnote on headcount and backfilling, et cetera, if you look back in time, you'll note that in the second half of 2003, just as business was beginning to improve in that recovery, we added disproportionately to our headcount, which positioned us well thereafter. And so, it's not since 2003 that we've added a higher percentage of headcount than was our revenue growth, which was the case in 2010. So what you've seen in the second half of 2010, quite frankly, is very similar to the same thing we did. Now maybe it's more technology related this time versus in the past, but essentially, we staffed up in advance of the last recovery. And it's with that same intent that we did this year, the second half."

We're refreshing our desktops and laptops, both in staffing and in Protiviti. Further, we're making IT, back-office, infrastructure investments, particularly in Europe. So all of those things together, the CapEx looking like $50 million to $55 million. Tax rate, as the business improves, the tax rate should come down. The non-deductible items become a lesser portion of the total. As we do better outside the U.S., particularly in Protiviti, you get a favorable tax impact from that. So I would think over the course of 2011, the tax rate will drift down. I wouldn't have it go down a lot in the first quarter, but it should drift down the rest of the year."

And that over time, we pass that through plus get back our typical margins that we see in a mid to up cycle scenario. So we don't see state unemployment rates as a permanent markdown to our Temp margins. Further, as I alluded to earlier, in the early part of an up cycle, there is always outsized hiring of additional internal staff that gets moderated thereafter. If you look at '04, '05, '06, '07, in none of those years did we add the same percentage of headcount as we had revenue growth, and we would expect to see that again in this up cycle. So long term, we're still very bullish about margins, including Protiviti margins, but first quarter, Protiviti's got its age-old seasonality. We wished it wasn't there, but it is. We've got the seasonal issue of passing through the state unemployment, but long term, we're very bullish on our operating margins."

Clearly, yes, we do go to market together, and we provide a blended service where Protiviti provides the supervision. The deliverables, the arms and legs often come from the staffing side. We are increasingly successful. We've had very nice wins. We have wins where neither Protiviti on its own or staffing on its own would otherwise have won that engagement. While we tend to think very discreetly about consulting versus staffing, trust me, many clients don't, and many clients have a problem. And whether we staff that internally from Protiviti or from staffing, that's kind of our call. The second piece of your question is the extent to which Protiviti uses contractors sourced through our staffing operations on their engagements. That is also somewhere where we're having increasing success. If you look at first quarter of 2010 versus our guidance for first quarter of 2011, you will see when you work through the numbers, we're expecting the cost to flex quite a bit more in '11 than they did in '10 because of the higher contractor mix, which is a variable that they're currently using. And we hope to take that even higher into the future. So long story short, yes, we're going to market together. We think we have a competitive advantage, because nobody under the same roof has the consulting and staffing capabilities that we do. Clients get that, and they're responding favorably to it. And yes, Protiviti is making its cost structure more and more variable. It's now over double digits as a percentage of its workforce, and its sources grew staffing. And versus a year ago, that was a low- to mid-single digits as a percent."

I'll start by reminding everyone that comments made on this call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We have described some of these risks and uncertainties in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on this conference call.
Now let's review our fourth quarter results. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $852 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter of last year. Income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.17, up 89% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter was $74 million, and capital expenditures were $13 million. 
We paid a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders at $0.13 per share for a total of $19 million. We also repurchased 700,000 RHI shares during the fourth quarter at a cost of $20 million. Approximately 11.4 million shares remain available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
During the fourth quarter, demand for our professional staffing and consulting services continued to improve across the board. Each of our lines of business reported sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Our Robert Half Finance & Accounting Permanent Placement division continued to perform well, with revenues up 30% versus one year ago. 
Our technology and office Administration divisions also reported strong revenue growth, as did our international operations. Protiviti reported its best operating results in more than two years. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at our fourth quarter financial results. We'll have time for questions after our remarks."

Fourth quarter revenues were $852 million, an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter of last year and an increase of 4% sequentially. On a constant currency basis, the year-over-year and sequential growth rates were 16% and 3%, respectively. There were 62 billing days in the fourth quarter of 2010, the same as the fourth quarter of the prior year. There will be 63 billing days in the first quarter of 2011. 
Revenues for Accountemps where $319 million, up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 6% sequentially on a same-day basis. Accountemps is our largest staffing division, with 354 offices worldwide. It accounts for 37% of company revenues. 
OfficeTeam had revenues of $174 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 11% sequentially on a same-day basis. OfficeTeam, which was introduced in 1991, is our high-end administrative staffing division. It represents 21% of company revenues. There are 320 OfficeTeam locations worldwide. 
Fourth quarter 2010 revenues for Robert Half Management Resources were $103 million, up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 9% sequentially on a same-day basis. This division was introduced in '97 and places senior-level accounting and finance professionals on a project basis. It has 153 locations worldwide, and it makes up 12% of company revenues.
Revenues for Robert Half Technology were $92 million in the fourth quarter, up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 10% sequentially on a same-day basis. Robert Half Technology was introduced in 1994 and places information technology professionals on a consulting and full-time basis. This business operates in 116 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company revenues.
Robert Half Finance & Accounting, our Permanent Placement division, had revenues of $59 million in the fourth quarter. As Max indicated, this is a 30% increase from the fourth quarter of 2009 and an increase of 8% on a same-day sequential basis. Our Permanent Placement services were established in 1948 and are in 354 locations worldwide. This business accounts for 7% of company-wide revenues.
Fourth quarter revenues for our international staffing operations were $221 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 13% sequentially on a same-day basis. On a constant currency same-day basis, these growth rates were 19% versus one year ago and 8% sequentially. We have staffing operations at 100 locations in 18 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 30% of total staffing revenues. 
Protiviti revenues were $104 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and an internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. It has 60 locations in 16 countries and accounts for 12% of total RHI revenues. Protiviti's International operations represent 29% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting staffing operations was $238 million or 34.5% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 34.1% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010. The fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 included workers' compensation credits of $1.5 million and $4 million, respectively. These were made pursuant to independent actuarial reviews. 
On a sequential and year-over-year basis, we saw improvements in pay bill spreads and temp-to-hire conversions. Overall staffing gross margin was $297 million in the fourth quarter or 39.7% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.1% of staffing revenues in Q4 2009 and 39.3% of revenues in Q3 2010. The mix of Permanent Placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 7.9%, 7.1% and 8% of revenues for Q4 2010, Q4 2009 and Q3 2010, respectively. 
Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $30 million or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 28.7% of Protiviti revenues in Q4 2009 and $27 million or 27% of revenues in the third quarter of 2010. The increases are due primarily to higher utilization rates, both in the United States and internationally. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative cost. Staffing SG&A cost for the fourth quarter were $257 million or 34.4% of staffing revenues. This compares to $229 million or 35.7% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $245 million or 34.2% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010. The increase in the quarter relates primarily to staff compensation cost. We continue to invest aggressively in additional headcount in the technology staffing sector. 
In addition, we backfilled positions in certain locations that had become understaffed during the downturn. We ended 2010 with 8,200 full time employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year. Fourth quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were $27 million or 25.6% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 28.4% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $27 million again or 26.9% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010. We ended the year with 2,500 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, the same number as 2009.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $40 million during the fourth quarter or 5.3% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $36 million of this amount or 5.2% of applicable revenues. Fourth quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $4 million or 6.3% of applicable revenues. 
Operating income for Protiviti was $3.3 million in the fourth quarter or 3.2% of revenues. This compares to $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 or 0.3% of revenues. The year-over-year increases are due to significant improvements in Protiviti's non-U.S. operations during the quarter. 
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $423 million, with implied days outstanding of 45.2 days, which compares to 44.7 days at the end of the fourth quarter one year ago. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We saw the following trends in our business during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first few weeks of January. On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were up in October, up in November and up again in December. On a same-day basis, Permanent Placement revenues were up in October and down in November and December. 
During the first two weeks of January, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 14% compared to the same period last year. For the first three weeks of January, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 38% compared to the same period last year. As we've said many times before, it's very difficult to evaluate Perm Placement trends over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these early trends, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $850 million to $900 million; income per share, $0.13 to $0.18 per share. As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. The estimates we've provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Now I'll turn it back to Max."

As I said at the start of this call, we were pleased to see broad-based improvement throughout our operations during the fourth quarter as many companies that had placed hiring plans on hold began adding staff on both a temporary and full-time basis as a result of better business conditions. U.S. unemployment levels remain high by historical standards, but we characterize the mood among our clients as certainly more optimistic than it has been in quite a while. 
We also were pleased with Protiviti's operating results during the quarter, including those outside the United States. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, Protiviti's financial services industry practice is working with clients to help them understand and comply with the various financial reform measures that have either been enacted or are in process around the world. Protiviti's information technology practice is serving clients in areas such as IT security and privacy, IT applications controls and infrastructure management. 
Reflecting back on the year as a whole, we believe we have positioned the business well to take advantage of improving economic conditions. As we head into 2011, we are optimistic about the growth prospects for our business for a number of reasons. The macroeconomic environment does appear to be improving. The U.S. economy added more than 1.1 million jobs last year. That is the most job growth since 2006. Hiring demand has improved outside the United States as well. As Keith indicated, revenues for our non-U.S. staffing operations were up 19% year-over-year and up 8% from the third quarter of 2010. 
Businesses are benefiting from the use of variable cost of labor. In our experience, one effect of the global recession has been wider adoption by companies of flexible staffing models, including the use of temporary and project professionals. For the small and mid-sized businesses that make up the largest percentage of our client base, the ability to keep labor cost variable is invaluable. 
Macro trends point to future hiring demand. Financial regulatory reform in the wake of the global financial crisis offers potential revenue sources for Protiviti and our staffing divisions. We also continue to believe the impending retirement of baby boomers from the workforce will heighten the demand for skill workers in the coming years. 
Historically, we have emerged from economic downturns stronger than before. While we cannot predict the future, we hope this cycle is no exception. So far, this is among the fastest recoveries we've ever experienced post-downturn. In 2010, we saw higher demand for our staffing and consulting services across the board. This demand accelerated in the second half of the year. 
We have an experienced team in place, both in the field and corporate services. I recently attended a meeting of our senior field managers in Phoenix, Arizona and was reminded once again what a talented and tenured team we have. They know what it takes to come back strong following the downturn, because they have been there before, and I am confident in their leadership. We kept our domestic and international office network largely intact during the recession, which means we're well positioned to respond to improved hiring demand. As Keith noted earlier in the call, we did begin adding staff in the fourth quarter to support future growth. 
The middle market and professional segments of the market are under penetrated in our view. We work with a fraction of the middle market business we feel we could be working with. We're particularly optimistic about the opportunities we see in the technology staffing sector and are also encouraged by the growth potential in the accounting and finance segment, where we are already recognized leaders. 
We have strong brand names, and we supported them during the downturn with marketing and promotional campaigns to stay visible with clients and candidates. We see business opportunities in the blended service model offered by our staffing divisions and Protiviti. We are able to deliver a full range of staffing and consulting services to our clients at a competitive price. 
Finally, we are in a strong financial position. We had positive operating cash flow of $176 million in 2010, which helped to fund approximately $96 million in RHI stock repurchases, $35 million in capital expenditures and the payment of $77 million in dividends to stockholders. We kept a close watch on accounts receivable in 2010, and as a result, the collection period remained virtually unchanged during the year. This was a strong contributor to our cash flow. We ended the year with $315 million in cash and cash equivalents and essentially no debt. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. We would ask, as usual, that you please limit yourself to one question and a follow up as needed. If you have additional questions, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

The first, as you just alluded to, we do expect the state unemployment rates to increase in 2011 about at the same rate that they did in 2010. 2010, when all is said and done, there was a 75-basis-point increase in state unemployment rates, which we ultimately totally recovered, but it took us some time over the course of the year to do so. We expect that same 75 basis points in 2011, which again, we're cautiously optimistic we'll pass through. It just won't all happen in the first quarter. Our guidance, we're assuming that there will be a 50 to 75 basis points, sequentially, reduction in temp gross margins for that reason alone. The other big margin impact for the first quarter is Protiviti seasonality. If you look back, for the last several years, you'll see that Protiviti revenues decline sequentially on a seasonal basis between 6% and 18%. Our guidance has it declining in the 10% range, which means Protiviti would lose $3 million to $5 million in the first quarter. At the midpoint there, that's half as much as they lost a year ago, coming off what was a very good fourth quarter for Protiviti. So the temp margins, because of state unemployment, Protiviti seasonality, notwithstanding a very positive backdrop, both in the fourth quarter and for 2011 as a full year, are the principal drivers for the lower margins in our guidance."

In the U.S., particularly, we're seeing regulatory-related engagements. You have many thrifts trying to get in front of their new regulator, the OCC, which they expect to be a tougher regulator than they've had in the past. We see a lot of attention by financial services clients around consumer lending, fair lending regulations. So our financial services practice clearly is benefiting from even anticipated regulatory reform, which was a big, big story in the fourth quarter. We don't think that -- or stated positively, we do think that the success we saw in the fourth quarter will continue into 2011 for Protiviti. Just on a seasonal basis, as we've discussed for many years running here, our clients tend to focus on their 10-Ks, getting their books closed, the same buyers that we have in internal audit and SOX [Sarbanes-Oxley Act] also tend to be buyers that are impacted as well on the consulting side of our business. So seasonally, the first quarter is always going to be the lightest for Protiviti. But I can tell you, not only -- in Protiviti and in staffing as well, there's clearly the most positive backdrop of business environment as we speak, as we have seen in several quarters."

We've been systematically backfilling where we got really small for three or four quarters. They got more pronounced during the fourth quarter, and we feel like we pretty much backfilled those really tiny locations where we needed more presence to participate in the upside. We have also made a big investment in technology. Our bias, as you know, is always to build rather than buy when we can. We're very encouraged with the early results in the technology space. If you think about today versus 10 years ago, even our middle market clients have websites that are an integral part of their marketing strategy, which creates web development demand. In addition to that, they're all interested in web analytics as to who's coming to their site, et cetera. And so the combination of those, we think, presents a unique opportunity in the technology space with respect to middle market companies where we can get margins that are close, if not at the levels we've got in accounting and finance. One other footnote on headcount and backfilling, et cetera, if you look back in time, you'll note that in the second half of 2003, just as business was beginning to improve in that recovery, we added disproportionately to our headcount, which positioned us well thereafter. And so, it's not since 2003 that we've added a higher percentage of headcount than was our revenue growth, which was the case in 2010. So what you've seen in the second half of 2010, quite frankly, is very similar to the same thing we did. Now maybe it's more technology related this time versus in the past, but essentially, we staffed up in advance of the last recovery. And it's with that same intent that we did this year, the second half."

We're refreshing our desktops and laptops, both in staffing and in Protiviti. Further, we're making IT, back-office, infrastructure investments, particularly in Europe. So all of those things together, the CapEx looking like $50 million to $55 million. Tax rate, as the business improves, the tax rate should come down. The non-deductible items become a lesser portion of the total. As we do better outside the U.S., particularly in Protiviti, you get a favorable tax impact from that. So I would think over the course of 2011, the tax rate will drift down. I wouldn't have it go down a lot in the first quarter, but it should drift down the rest of the year."

Clearly, yes, we do go to market together, and we provide a blended service where Protiviti provides the supervision. The deliverables, the arms and legs often come from the staffing side. We are increasingly successful. We've had very nice wins. We have wins where neither Protiviti on its own nor staffing on its own would otherwise have won that engagement. While we tend to think very discreetly about consulting versus staffing, trust me, many clients don't, and many clients have a problem. And whether we staff that internally from Protiviti or from staffing, that's kind of our call. The second piece of your question is the extent to which Protiviti uses contractors sourced through our staffing operations on their engagements. That is also somewhere where we're having increasing success. If you look at first quarter of 2010 versus our guidance for first quarter of 2011, you will see when you work through the numbers, we're expecting the cost to flex quite a bit more in '11 than they did in '10 because of the higher contractor mix, which is a variable that they're currently using. And we hope to take that even higher into the future. So long story short, yes, we're going to market together. We think we have a competitive advantage because nobody under the same roof has the consulting and staffing capabilities that we do. Clients get that, and they're responding favorably to it. And yes, Protiviti is making its cost structure more and more variable. It's now over double digits as a percentage of its workforce, and its sources through staffing.

We want to grow each of those businesses on their own right. Given the market opportunity in Tech, I think it's reasonable to say it'll be a larger percent. As to organically versus acquisition, we've got almost a 25-year history here now. Clearly, we believe in organic growth and the superior returns it gives on capital to acquisitions. So not that we're negative on acquisitions, but if we can build it ourselves, why in the world would we buy it? Particularly, in the current market, if you've got a technology business, you think you're sitting on a gold mine, and the prices are higher than ever. We're very encouraged to the extent over the last six to 12 months, we've invested in technology on an organic basis. The returns are good. We think there's a unique opportunity where tech development is reaching down in the middle market companies for reasons that we spoke about earlier. So we're very positive on Tech."

We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares during the quarter at a cost of $30 million. Approximately 10.4 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan. We saw continued strong demand for our professional staffing services during the first quarter, particularly in our Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Finance & Accounting divisions. We also saw an improving pricing environment, indicative of further strengthening in our underlying labor market.

Revenues for Accountemps were $331 million. On a same-day basis, this is up 13% from a year ago and up 1%, sequentially. Accountemps is our largest staffing division with 353 offices worldwide and accounts for 37% of companywide revenues.
Revenues for OfficeTeam were $176 million in the first quarter. On an same day basis, this is an increase of 23% from the first quarter of 2010 and a decrease of 1% from the fourth quarter of last year. OfficeTeam is our high end administrative staffing division. It was established in 1991 and represents 20% of companywide revenues. There are 317 OfficeTeam locations worldwide.
Robert Half Management Resources had first quarter revenues of $111 million. On a same day basis, this is up 18% from last year's first quarter, and up 6%, sequentially. Robert Half Management Resources was introduced in 1997 and plays a senior-level accounting finance professionals on a project basis. It has 154 locations worldwide and makes up 13% of companywide revenues.

Robert Half Technology was introduced in 1994, and places information technology professionals on a project and full-time basis. This business operates on 115 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of companywide revenues.

On a same day basis, this is a 37% increase from the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 12%, sequentially. Our Permanent Placement services were established in 1948, and are in 353 locations worldwide. This business accounts for 8% of companywide revenues.
International staffing operation had first quarter revenues of $242 million. On a same-day basis, this is an increase of 25% from the first quarter of 2010, and an increase of 7%, sequentially. On a constant currency same-day basis, these growth rates were 22% versus 1 year ago and up 6%, sequentially. We have staffing operations in 102 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 31% of total staffing revenues.
Protiviti revenues were $99 million in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 5%, sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti and its member firms serve clients through a network of 70 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 28% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $246 million or 34.4% of applicable revenues. This compares with 33.6% of revenues for the first quarter of last year and 34.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. Sequentially, higher pay bills spreads substantially offset the combination of higher state unemployment rates, the absence of prior quarter workers compensation credits, and slightly lower conversion revenues during the quarter. Year-over-year, gross margins widened with higher pay bills spreads and higher conversion revenues, more than offsetting higher state unemployment taxes.
Overall staffing gross margin was $313 million in the first quarter or 40% of staffing revenues. This compares to 38.6% of revenues in Q1 2010, and 39.7% of revenues in Q4 2010. The mix of Permanent Placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represent 8.6%, 7.5% and 7.9% of revenues for Q1 2011, Q1 2010 and Q4 2010, respectively.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $25 million or 25.2% of Protiviti revenues as compared to $18 million or 20.6% of revenues in Q1 2010. A year-over-year improvement is the combination of higher utilization rates and more cost flexibility as a result of using more variable cost labor. 
Sequentially, gross margins declined from 28.8% of revenues in the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower utilization rates. However, the utilization decline was less than in years past, because of a more flexible cost structure just discussed. In addition, Protiviti also saw firming of its bill rates during the quarter.
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs. Staffing SG&A cost for the quarter were $267 million or 34.2% of staffing revenues. This compares to $230 million or 35.5% of revenues for the first quarter 1 year ago, and $257 million or 34.4% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we continue to invest in additional headcount, particularly in our Robert Half Technology division.
First quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million or 26.7% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $26 million or 29% of revenues for the first quarter a year ago, and the same $27 million or 25.6% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. Protiviti SG&A costs are essentially flat for all periods presented.
Operating income from our Staffing divisions was $46 million during the first quarter or 5.9% of staffing revenues. Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $38 million of this amount or 5.3% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $8 million or 11.6% of applicable revenues. The operating loss for Protiviti was $1.5 million in the first quarter or 1.6% of revenue. This compares to an operating loss of $7.6 million in the first quarter a year ago or 8.5% of revenues.
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $467 million with implied days sales outstanding of 48.2 days compared to 46.1 days at the end of the first quarter a year ago. The increase reflects the strong revenue growth at the back end of this year's first quarter.
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and the first few weeks of April: On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were down in January, up in February and up again in March. On a same-day basis, Perm Placement revenues were also down in January, up in February and up again in March. During the first 2 weeks of April, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 20% compared to the same period of last year. For the first 3 weeks of April, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 41% compared to the same period last year. That said, we remind you that Permanent Placement trends are difficult to assess over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following second quarter guidance: Revenues, $880 million to $930 million; income per share, $0.18 to $0.23. As you know, we limit our guidance to 1 quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. The estimates we provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

During the first quarter, we continue to see positive revenue trends on both the year-over-year and sequential basis in nearly all of our lines of business. This would seem consistent with past recovery patterns, in which demand for professional positions has historically recovered later in the cycle. Our Permanent Placement operations also had another strong quarter. From our perspective, this has been among the positive post downturn recoveries we have seen our business. We feel Robert Half is well-positioned to take advantage of improving economic conditions should this trend continue. We're optimistic for several reasons. Demand for our growing stronger for several quarters now. We hope to see wider adoption of flexible staffing models by employers, including the temporary and project professionals at higher skill levels become a legacy of the recession. We are confident in Protiviti's near and long-term growth prospects. Protiviti's information technology practice has successfully expanded its consulting services in areas such as IT, security and privacy, IT application controls and IT infrastructure management. In addition, the global financial crisis has triggered a new round of financial regulatory oversight. And Protiviti's financial services industry practice is well-positioned to assist clients in complying with new reform legislation.
I would add that our staffing divisions also stand to benefit from these developments as well. Once the economy is fully on its feet, demographic trends may present growth opportunities. This includes the exit of some baby boomers in the job market and the potential labor shortages that could result. We believe confidence levels are improving among small and midsized buddies, which represent the majority of our staffing clients. We are optimistic about the opportunities we see in technology staffing, as well as the growth potential in Accounting and Finance segment where we are the recognized leaders.

We're seeing candidates getting counter offers from their existing employers when they announced they are leaving. We see temp candidates leaving the assignment, mid assignment to take full-time positions. All of which indicate a firming on the candidate side. We're seeing higher pay rates in every single division, sequentially. And we are passing on those pay rates with more markup as well. If you look at our pricing, on a sequential basis, our prices this quarter are up 3.4%. And that compares to 0.8% last quarter. Year-over-year, our prices are up 2.4%.

That said, Protiviti has clearly seen a firming of its demand. The second quarter seasonally is typically a lot like the first, maybe a little better. So our thinking is the profitability would be the same or a little bit better, not significantly different. The U.S. did particularly well. But outside the U.S., we didn't do as well during the quarter. Japan is about 5% of Protiviti operations. Japan obviously had its issues, which impacted the quarter. But we are very pleased with Protiviti from the standpoint of its being able to effect higher bill rates, similar to staffing. And in fact, the bill rates are a little firmer in Protiviti than they are in staffing. Protiviti used more variable labor. I think for the quarter, almost 20% of its workforce came from contract resource primarily through our Staffing divisions. And that cost flexibility certainly helped the margin line.

Notwithstanding, Perms had a nice bounce off its bottom. The facts are it's still just over 1/2 of what the peak is. So there's a whole lot of revenue growth for Perm just to get back to where it was. And with that revenue growth, there's a very large leveraging of your operating cost.

We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Now let's review our first quarter results. Revenues for the first quarter were $881 million, up 19% from the first quarter of last year. Income per share for the first quarter was $0.18, up 248% from 1 year ago. Cash flow from operations was $19 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures were $15 million.
We raised our quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share, paying a total of $20 million to stockholders during the quarter. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares during the quarter at a cost of $30 million. Approximately 10.4 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. We saw continued strong demand for our professional staffing services during the first quarter, particularly in our Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Finance & Accounting divisions. We also saw an improving pricing environment, indicative of further strengthening in our underlying labor market.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell. Keith will provide a more detailed review of our first quarter results."

Revenues for OfficeTeam were $176 million in the first quarter. On a same-day basis, this is an increase of 23% from the first quarter of 2010 and a decrease of 1% from the fourth quarter of last year. OfficeTeam is our high-end administrative staffing division. It was established in 1991 and represents 20% of company-wide revenues. There are 317 OfficeTeam locations worldwide.
Robert Half Management Resources had first quarter revenues of $111 million. On a same-day basis, this is up 18% from last year's first quarter and up 6%, sequentially. Robert Half Management Resources was introduced in 1997 and plays a senior-level accounting finance professionals on a project basis. It has 154 locations worldwide and makes up 13% of company-wide revenues. 
Revenues for Robert Half Technology were $97 million in the first quarter. On a same-day basis, this is up 27% from the first quarter of 2010 and up 3%, sequentially. Robert Half Technology was introduced in 1994 and places information technology professionals on a project and full-time basis. This business operates on 115 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company-wide revenues.
Our Permanent Placement division, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, had revenues of $68 million in the first quarter. On a same-day basis, this is a 37% increase from the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 12%, sequentially. Our Permanent Placement services were established in 1948 and are in 353 locations worldwide. This business accounts for 8% of company-wide revenues.
International staffing operation had first quarter revenues of $242 million. On a same-day basis, this is an increase of 25% from the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 7%, sequentially. On a constant currency same-day basis, these growth rates were 22% versus 1 year ago and up 6%, sequentially. We have staffing operations in 102 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 31% of total staffing revenues.
Protiviti revenues were $99 million in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 5%, sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti and its member firms serve clients through a network of 70 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 28% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $246 million or 34.4% of applicable revenues. This compares with 33.6% of revenues for the first quarter of last year and 34.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. Sequentially, higher pay bill spreads substantially offset the combination of higher state unemployment rates, the absence of prior quarter workers compensation credits and slightly lower conversion revenues during the quarter. Year-over-year, gross margins widened with higher pay bill spreads and higher conversion revenues, more than offsetting higher state unemployment taxes.
Overall staffing gross margin was $313 million in the first quarter or 40% of staffing revenues. This compares to 38.6% of revenues in Q1 2010, and 39.7% of revenues in Q4 2010. The mix of Permanent Placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 8.6%, 7.5% and 7.9% of revenues for Q1 2011, Q1 2010 and Q4 2010, respectively.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $25 million or 25.2% of Protiviti revenues as compared to $18 million or 20.6% of revenues in Q1 2010. The year-over-year improvement is the combination of higher utilization rates and more cost flexibility as a result of using more variable cost labor. 
Sequentially, gross margins declined from 28.8% of revenues in the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower utilization rates. However, the utilization decline was less than in years past because of a more flexible cost structure just discussed. In addition, Protiviti also saw firming of its bill rates during the quarter.
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs. Staffing SG&A costs for the quarter were $267 million or 34.2% of staffing revenues. This compares to $230 million or 35.5% of revenues for the first quarter 1 year ago, and $257 million or 34.4% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we continue to invest in additional headcount, particularly in our Robert Half Technology division.
First quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million or 26.7% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $26 million or 29% of revenues for the first quarter a year ago, and the same $27 million or 25.6% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. Protiviti SG&A costs are essentially flat for all periods presented.
Operating income from our Staffing divisions was $46 million during the first quarter or 5.9% of staffing revenues. Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $38 million of this amount or 5.3% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $8 million or 11.6% of applicable revenues. The operating loss for Protiviti was $1.5 million in the first quarter or 1.6% of revenue. This compares to an operating loss of $7.6 million in the first quarter a year ago or 8.5% of revenues.
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $467 million with implied days sales outstanding of 48.2 days compared to 46.1 days at the end of the first quarter a year ago. The increase reflects the strong revenue growth at the back end of this year's first quarter.
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and the first few weeks of April: On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were down in January, up in February and up again in March. On a same-day basis, Perm Placement revenues were also down in January, up in February and up again in March. During the first 2 weeks of April, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 20% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of April, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 41% compared to the same period last year. That said, we'd remind you that Permanent Placement trends are difficult to assess over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following second quarter guidance: Revenues, $880 million to $930 million; income per share, $0.18 to $0.23. As you know, we limit our guidance to 1 quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. The estimates we've provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

During the first quarter, we continue to see positive revenue trends on both the year-over-year and sequential basis in nearly all of our lines of business. This would seem consistent with past recovery patterns, in which demand for professional positions has historically recovered later in the cycle. Our Permanent Placement operations also had another strong quarter. From our perspective, this has been among the fastest, post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. We feel Robert Half is well-positioned to take advantage of improving economic conditions should this trend continue. We're optimistic for several reasons. Demand for our professional services has been growing stronger for several quarters now. We hope to see wider adoption of flexible staffing models by employers, including the use of temporary and project professionals at higher skill levels become a legacy of the recession. We are confident in Protiviti's near and long-term growth prospects. Protiviti's information technology practice has successfully expanded its consulting services in areas such as IT, security and privacy, IT application controls and IT infrastructure management. In addition, the global financial crisis has triggered a new round of financial regulatory oversight. And Protiviti's financial services industry practice is well-positioned to assist clients in complying with new reform legislation.
I would add that our staffing divisions also stand to benefit from these developments as well. Once the economy is fully on its feet, demographic trends may present growth opportunities. This includes the excess of baby boomers in the job market and the potential labor shortages that could result. We believe confidence levels are improving among small and mid-sized companies, which represent the majority of our staffing clients. We are optimistic about the opportunities we see in technology staffing, as well as the growth potential in the Accounting and Finance segment where we are the recognized leaders. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself as usual to 1 question and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you."

We see temp candidates leaving the assignment, mid-assignment to take full-time positions. All of which indicate a firming on the candidate side. We're seeing higher pay rates in every single division, sequentially. And we are passing on those pay rates with more markup as well. If you look at our pricing, on a sequential basis, our prices this quarter are up 3.4%. And that compares to 0.8% last quarter. Year-over-year, our prices are up 2.4%.

That said, Protiviti has clearly seen a firming of its demand. The second quarter seasonally is typically a lot like the first, maybe a little better. So our thinking is the profitability would be the same or a little bit better, not significantly different. The U.S. did particularly well. But outside the U.S., we didn't do as well during the quarter. Japan is about 5% of Protiviti operations. Japan obviously had its issues, which impacted the quarter. But we're very pleased with Protiviti from the standpoint of its being able to affect higher bill rates, similar to staffing. And in fact, the bill rates are actually a little firmer in Protiviti than they are in staffing. Protiviti is using more and more variable labor.

Revenues for Accountemps were $331 million. On a same-day basis, this is up 13% from a year ago and up 1%, sequentially. Accountemps is our largest staffing division with 353 offices worldwide and accounts for 37% of company-wide revenues.
Revenues for OfficeTeam were $176 million in the first quarter. On a same-day basis, this is an increase of 23% from the first quarter of 2010 and a decrease of 1% from the fourth quarter of last year. OfficeTeam is our high-end administrative staffing division. It was established in 1991 and represents 20% of company-wide revenues. There are 317 OfficeTeam locations worldwide.
Robert Half Management Resources had first quarter revenues of $111 million. On a same-day basis, this is up 18% from last year's first quarter and up 6%, sequentially. Robert Half Management Resources was introduced in 1997 and plays a senior-level accounting finance professionals on a project basis.

This business operates on 115 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company-wide revenues.

On a same-day basis, this is a 37% increase from the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 12%, sequentially. Our Permanent Placement services were established in 1948 and are in 353 locations worldwide. This business accounts for 8% of company-wide revenues.
International staffing operation had first quarter revenues of $242 million. On a same-day basis, this is an increase of 25% from the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 7%, sequentially. On a constant currency same-day basis, these growth rates were 22% versus 1 year ago and up 6%, sequentially. We have staffing operations in 102 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 31% of total staffing revenues.
Protiviti revenues were $99 million in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 5%, sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti and its member firms serve clients through a network of 70 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 28% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $246 million or 34.4% of applicable revenues. This compares with 33.6% of revenues for the first quarter of last year and 34.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. Sequentially, higher pay bill spreads substantially offset the combination of higher state unemployment rates, the absence of prior quarter workers compensation credits and slightly lower conversion revenues during the quarter. Year-over-year, gross margins widened with higher pay bill spreads and higher conversion revenues, more than offsetting higher state unemployment taxes.
Overall staffing gross margin was $313 million in the first quarter or 40% of staffing revenues. This compares to 38.6% of revenues in Q1 2010, and 39.7% of revenues in Q4 2010. The mix of Permanent Placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 8.6%, 7.5% and 7.9% of revenues for Q1 2011, Q1 2010 and Q4 2010, respectively.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $25 million or 25.2% of Protiviti revenues as compared to $18 million or 20.6% of revenues in Q1 2010. The year-over-year improvement is the combination of higher utilization rates and more cost flexibility as a result of using more variable cost labor. 
Sequentially, gross margins declined from 28.8% of revenues in the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower utilization rates. However, the utilization decline was less than in years past because of a more flexible cost structure just discussed. In addition, Protiviti also saw firming of its bill rates during the quarter.
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs. Staffing SG&A costs for the quarter were $267 million or 34.2% of staffing revenues. This compares to $230 million or 35.5% of revenues for the first quarter 1 year ago, and $257 million or 34.4% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we continue to invest in additional headcount, particularly in our Robert Half Technology division.
First quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million or 26.7% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $26 million or 29% of revenues for the first quarter a year ago, and the same $27 million or 25.6% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. Protiviti SG&A costs are essentially flat for all periods presented.
Operating income from our Staffing divisions was $46 million during the first quarter or 5.9% of staffing revenues. Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $38 million of this amount or 5.3% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $8 million or 11.6% of applicable revenues. The operating loss for Protiviti was $1.5 million in the first quarter or 1.6% of revenue. This compares to an operating loss of $7.6 million in the first quarter a year ago or 8.5% of revenues.
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $467 million with implied days sales outstanding of 48.2 days compared to 46.1 days at the end of the first quarter a year ago. The increase reflects the strong revenue growth at the back end of this year's first quarter.
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and the first few weeks of April: On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were down in January, up in February and up again in March. On a same-day basis, Perm Placement revenues were also down in January, up in February and up again in March. During the first 2 weeks of April, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 20% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of April, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 41% compared to the same period last year. That said, we'd remind you that Permanent Placement trends are difficult to assess over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following second quarter guidance: Revenues, $880 million to $930 million; income per share, $0.18 to $0.23. As you know, we limit our guidance to 1 quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. The estimates we've provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

During the first quarter, we continue to see positive revenue trends on both the year-over-year and sequential basis in nearly all of our lines of business. This would seem consistent with past recovery patterns, in which demand for professional positions has historically recovered later in the cycle. Our Permanent Placement operations also had another strong quarter. From our perspective, this has been among the fastest, post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. We feel Robert Half is well-positioned to take advantage of improving economic conditions should this trend continue. We're optimistic for several reasons. Demand for our professional services has been growing stronger for several quarters now. We hope to see wider adoption of flexible staffing models by employers, including the use of temporary and project professionals at higher skill levels become a legacy of the recession. We are confident in Protiviti's near and long-term growth prospects. Protiviti's information technology practice has successfully expanded its consulting services in areas such as IT, security and privacy, IT application controls and IT infrastructure management. In addition, the global financial crisis has triggered a new round of financial regulatory oversight. And Protiviti's financial services industry practice is well-positioned to assist clients in complying with new reform legislation.
I would add that our staffing divisions also stand to benefit from these developments as well. Once the economy is fully on its feet, demographic trends may present growth opportunities. This includes the excess of baby boomers in the job market and the potential labor shortages that could result.

We are optimistic about the opportunities we see in technology staffing, as well as the growth potential in the Accounting and Finance segment where we are the recognized leaders.

We were extremely pleased at our ability to essentially offset that additional cost with pricing. There's no question, recruiting is becoming a more important part of the equation in getting people placed on both the perm and the temp side. And for the first time in a long time, we're seeing candidates get multiple offers. We're seeing candidates getting counter offers from their existing employer when they announced they are leaving. We see temp candidates leaving the assignment, mid-assignment to take full-time positions. All of which indicate a firming on the candidate side. We're seeing higher pay rates in every single division, sequentially. And we are passing on those pay rates with more markup as well. If you look at our pricing, on a sequential basis, our prices this quarter are up 3.4%. And that compares to 0.8% last quarter. Year-over-year, our prices are up 2.4%.

That said, Protiviti has clearly seen a firming of its demand. The second quarter seasonally is typically a lot like the first, maybe a little better. So our thinking is the profitability would be the same or a little bit better, not significantly different. The U.S. did particularly well. But outside the U.S., we didn't do as well during the quarter. Japan is about 5% of Protiviti operations. Japan obviously had its issues, which impacted the quarter. But we're very pleased with Protiviti from the standpoint of its being able to affect higher bill rates, similar to staffing. And in fact, the bill rates are actually a little firmer in Protiviti than they are in staffing. Protiviti is using more and more variable labor. I think for the quarter, almost 20% of its workforce came from contract resource, primarily through our Staffing divisions. And that cost flexibility certainly helped the margin line. We've got more and more joint wins between Protiviti and Staffing. And we're feeling good."

So Protiviti has 8 member firm offices that are split between South America and the Middle East. So we don't own those, we get a royalty from them. Those are member firms. You might consider them like franchisees. It's a very typical structure within the Big 4 world. So that's more a different way in how we communicate, how large Protiviti is than any opening of new offices. As to share repurchases, we bought 1 million shares during the past quarter of $30. And relative to my comments before, if all you think that happens so far as we bounced off a low bottom and that the cycle is just now getting started in earnest for full later cycle Finance & Accounting, that would say one thing about what we do with share repurchases as we go forward. I think history would say, we participate virtually every quarter in repurchasing shares. Some quarters, it's heavier than others."

Income per share for the first quarter was $0.18, up 248% from 1 year ago. Cash flow from operations was $19 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures were $15 million.
We raised our quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share, paying a total of $20 million to stockholders during the quarter. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares during the quarter at a cost of $30 million. Approximately 10.4 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. We saw continued strong demand for our professional staffing services during the first quarter, particularly in our Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Finance & Accounting divisions. We also saw an improving pricing environment, indicative of further strengthening in our underlying labor market.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell. Keith will provide a more detailed review of our first quarter results."

There are 63 billing days in the current second quarter. 
Revenues for Accountemps were $331 million. On a same-day basis, this is up 13% from a year ago and up 1%, sequentially. Accountemps is our largest staffing division with 353 offices worldwide and accounts for 37% of company-wide revenues.
Revenues for OfficeTeam were $176 million in the first quarter. On a same-day basis, this is an increase of 23% from the first quarter of 2010 and a decrease of 1% from the fourth quarter of last year. OfficeTeam is our high-end administrative staffing division. It was established in 1991 and represents 20% of company-wide revenues. There are 317 OfficeTeam locations worldwide.
Robert Half Management Resources had first quarter revenues of $111 million. On a same-day basis, this is up 18% from last year's first quarter and up 6%, sequentially. Robert Half Management Resources was introduced in 1997 and plays a senior-level accounting finance professionals on a project basis. It has 154 locations worldwide and makes up 13% of company-wide revenues. 
Revenues for Robert Half Technology were $97 million in the first quarter. On a same-day basis, this is up 27% from the first quarter of 2010 and up 3%, sequentially. Robert Half Technology was introduced in 1994 and places information technology professionals on a project and full-time basis. This business operates on 115 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company-wide revenues.
Our Permanent Placement division, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, had revenues of $68 million in the first quarter. On a same-day basis, this is a 37% increase from the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 12%, sequentially. Our Permanent Placement services were established in 1948 and are in 353 locations worldwide. This business accounts for 8% of company-wide revenues.
International staffing operation had first quarter revenues of $242 million. On a same-day basis, this is an increase of 25% from the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 7%, sequentially. On a constant currency same-day basis, these growth rates were 22% versus 1 year ago and up 6%, sequentially. We have staffing operations in 102 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 31% of total staffing revenues.
Protiviti revenues were $99 million in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 5%, sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti and its member firms serve clients through a network of 70 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 28% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $246 million or 34.4% of applicable revenues. This compares with 33.6% of revenues for the first quarter of last year and 34.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. Sequentially, higher pay bill spreads substantially offset the combination of higher state unemployment rates, the absence of prior quarter workers compensation credits and slightly lower conversion revenues during the quarter. Year-over-year, gross margins widened with higher pay bill spreads and higher conversion revenues, more than offsetting higher state unemployment taxes.
Overall staffing gross margin was $313 million in the first quarter or 40% of staffing revenues. This compares to 38.6% of revenues in Q1 2010, and 39.7% of revenues in Q4 2010. The mix of Permanent Placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 8.6%, 7.5% and 7.9% of revenues for Q1 2011, Q1 2010 and Q4 2010, respectively.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $25 million or 25.2% of Protiviti revenues as compared to $18 million or 20.6% of revenues in Q1 2010. The year-over-year improvement is the combination of higher utilization rates and more cost flexibility as a result of using more variable cost labor. 
Sequentially, gross margins declined from 28.8% of revenues in the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower utilization rates. However, the utilization decline was less than in years past because of a more flexible cost structure just discussed. In addition, Protiviti also saw firming of its bill rates during the quarter.
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs. Staffing SG&A costs for the quarter were $267 million or 34.2% of staffing revenues. This compares to $230 million or 35.5% of revenues for the first quarter 1 year ago, and $257 million or 34.4% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we continue to invest in additional headcount, particularly in our Robert Half Technology division.
First quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million or 26.7% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $26 million or 29% of revenues for the first quarter a year ago, and the same $27 million or 25.6% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. Protiviti SG&A costs are essentially flat for all periods presented.
Operating income from our Staffing divisions was $46 million during the first quarter or 5.9% of staffing revenues. Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $38 million of this amount or 5.3% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $8 million or 11.6% of applicable revenues. The operating loss for Protiviti was $1.5 million in the first quarter or 1.6% of revenue. This compares to an operating loss of $7.6 million in the first quarter a year ago or 8.5% of revenues.
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $467 million with implied days sales outstanding of 48.2 days compared to 46.1 days at the end of the first quarter a year ago. The increase reflects the strong revenue growth at the back end of this year's first quarter.
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and the first few weeks of April: On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were down in January, up in February and up again in March. On a same-day basis, Perm Placement revenues were also down in January, up in February and up again in March. During the first 2 weeks of April, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 20% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of April, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 41% compared to the same period last year. That said, we'd remind you that Permanent Placement trends are difficult to assess over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following second quarter guidance: Revenues, $880 million to $930 million; income per share, $0.18 to $0.23. As you know, we limit our guidance to 1 quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. The estimates we've provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

During the first quarter, we continue to see positive revenue trends on both the year-over-year and sequential basis in nearly all of our lines of business. This would seem consistent with past recovery patterns, in which demand for professional positions has historically recovered later in the cycle. Our Permanent Placement operations also had another strong quarter. From our perspective, this has been among the fastest, post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. We feel Robert Half is well-positioned to take advantage of improving economic conditions should this trend continue. We're optimistic for several reasons. Demand for our professional services has been growing stronger for several quarters now. We hope to see wider adoption of flexible staffing models by employers, including the use of temporary and project professionals at higher skill levels become a legacy of the recession. We are confident in Protiviti's near and long-term growth prospects. Protiviti's information technology practice has successfully expanded its consulting services in areas such as IT, security and privacy, IT application controls and IT infrastructure management. In addition, the global financial crisis has triggered a new round of financial regulatory oversight. And Protiviti's financial services industry practice is well-positioned to assist clients in complying with new reform legislation.
I would add that our staffing divisions also stand to benefit from these developments as well. Once the economy is fully on its feet, demographic trends may present growth opportunities. This includes the excess of baby boomers in the job market and the potential labor shortages that could result. We believe confidence levels are improving among small and mid-sized companies, which represent the majority of our staffing clients. We are optimistic about the opportunities we see in technology staffing, as well as the growth potential in the Accounting and Finance segment where we are the recognized leaders. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself as usual to 1 question and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you."

We were extremely pleased at our ability to essentially offset that additional cost with pricing. There's no question, recruiting is becoming a more important part of the equation in getting people placed on both the perm and the temp side. And for the first time in a long time, we're seeing candidates get multiple offers. We're seeing candidates getting counter offers from their existing employer when they announced they are leaving. We see temp candidates leaving the assignment, mid-assignment to take full-time positions. All of which indicate a firming on the candidate side. We're seeing higher pay rates in every single division, sequentially. And we are passing on those pay rates with more markup as well. If you look at our pricing, on a sequential basis, our prices this quarter are up 3.4%. And that compares to 0.8% last quarter. Year-over-year, our prices are up 2.4%. That compares with negative 2.4% last quarter. So clearly, the candidate side of the market is firming up, and we see it with all of the metrics I just talked about. And that typically is a precursor for good things to come in staffing."

That said, Protiviti has clearly seen a firming of its demand. The second quarter seasonally is typically a lot like the first, maybe a little better. So our thinking is the profitability would be the same or a little bit better, not significantly different. The U.S. did particularly well. But outside the U.S., we didn't do as well during the quarter. Japan is about 5% of Protiviti operations. Japan obviously had its issues, which impacted the quarter. But we're very pleased with Protiviti from the standpoint of its being able to affect higher bill rates, similar to staffing. And in fact, the bill rates are actually a little firmer in Protiviti than they are in staffing. Protiviti is using more and more variable labor. I think for the quarter, almost 20% of its workforce came from contract resource, primarily through our Staffing divisions. And that cost flexibility certainly helped the margin line. We've got more and more joint wins between Protiviti and Staffing. And we're feeling good."

Now let's discuss the second quarter. The second quarter revenues were $938 million, up 22% from 1 year ago. Second quarter income per share of $0.25 is triple that of the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $69 million and capital expenditures were $14 million. 
We paid a cash dividend of $0.14 per share to stockholder during the second quarter for a total of $20 million. We also repurchased $2 million RHI shares during the quarter, spending a total of $56 million for this purpose. Approximately 8.4 million shares remain available under our board approved stock repurchase plan.
This is the fifth consecutive quarter we have reported accelerating year-over-year growth rates for our consolidated revenues. We once again saw a broad-based improving demand for our Professional Staffing services and Protiviti during the second quarter, both in North America and abroad. 
Our Permanent Placement and Technology Staffing divisions were particularly strong. The pricing environment also continued to improve during the quarter, which contributed to higher gross margins. Our CFO, Keith Waddell, will provide you more detailed look at second quarter results."

Our Permanent Placement services were established in 1948 and are 354 locations worldwide. This business accounts for 9% of company-wide revenues.
Second quarter revenues for our International Staffing Operations were $258 million, this is an increase of 37% from last year and an increase of 6% from the first quarter. On a constant-currency basis, these growth rates were 23% versus 1 year ago and 2% sequentially. We have staffing operations in 104 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S., international staffing operations represent 31% of total staffing revenues.
Protiviti revenues were $105 million in the second quarter, up 13% from 1 year ago and up 6% sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and an internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti, including its independently owned member firms serves clients through a network of 71 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 28% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. Second quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consultant staffing operations was $263 million or 35% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.1% of revenues for the second quarter of last year and 34.4% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011.
The year-over-year and sequential improvements are due to the combination of higher pay bill spreads and higher conversion revenues, which were partially offset by higher state on employment taxes. In addition, workers compensation actuarial reviews resulted in credits of $1.3 million for both the second quarter of this year and last year.
Overall staffing gross margin was $344 million in the second quarter or 41.3% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.6% of revenues in Q2 2010 and 40% of revenues last quarter. The mix of Permanent Placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 9.7% of this quarter's staffing revenues compared to 8.3% and 8.6% of revenues for Q2 2010 and Q1 2011, respectively.
Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $28 million or 26.9% of Protiviti revenues, as compared to $22 million or 24% of Protiviti revenues in Q2 2010. Protiviti group gross margin grew 26% year-over-year and 14% sequentially owing to higher utilization rates and firming billing rates.
Turning to SG&A costs. Staffing SG&A costs for the second quarter were $284 million or 34.1% of staffing revenues, this compares to $238 million or 35.3% of revenues for the second quarter 1 year ago and $267 million or 34.2% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011.
Higher SG&A costs were due primarily to increased payroll cost, including higher headcounts and incentive compensation payouts.
Second quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million, [indiscernible] 26% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $29 million or 31.2% of revenues for the second quarter a year ago and a $26 million or 26.7% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011.
The prior year's second quarter included $2.4 million in legal settlement costs, which did not reoccur.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $60 million during the second quarter or 7.2% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consultant revenues contributed $46 million of this amount or 6.1% of applicable revenues. Second quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $14 million or 17.2% of applicable revenues. Operating income for Protiviti was $1 million in the second quarter or 0.9% of revenues. This compares to an operating loss of $6.8 million in the second quarter 1 year ago.
Accounts receivable were $495 million at the end of the second quarter with implied days outstanding of 48.1 days compared to 45.5 days at the end of the second quarter 1 year ago.
Now let's turn to guidance. We saw the following trends in the second quarter and the first few weeks of July. On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consultant revenues were up in April, up in May, and up again in June. On a same-day basis, Permanent Placement revenues were down in April, up in May and up again in June. During the first 2 weeks of July, revenues from our Temporary and Consultant businesses were up 19% compared to the same period last year. For the 3 weeks of July, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 27% compared to the same period last year. That said, we would remind you that Permanent Placement trends are difficult to assess over short periods of time.
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following third quarter guidance. Revenues, $940 million to $990 million. Income per share, $0.24 to $0.29. It is our policy to limit guidance to 1 quarter. Any estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We continue to see broad-based revenue growth and improving demand with our Professional Staffing operations and Protiviti during the second quarter. Our Permanent Placement operations reported a very strong quarter with revenues at their highest levels since the third quarter of 2008. We credit our outstanding field team for these results. 
As I noted on our last conference call, this has been amongst the post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. This last recession was deeper than past ones in our history but revenues have grown faster than in periods following other downturns. 
Notwithstanding the disappointing job report for June, we saw higher demand for our Professional Staffing services in the United States throughout the second quarter. Our staffing operations in Continental Europe also performed particularly well. Revenues from non-U.S. staffing operations have expanded from 11% of the staffing total in 2000 to more than 30% today. We were pleased also to see higher demand for Protiviti's Consulting and Internal Audit services. Demand was strongest for Information Technology-related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industries.
We believe one of the bright spots in the economy has been technology-related spending across companies of all sizes. We are witnessing this in Protiviti's Information Technology consulting practice and in our staffing operations. We have discussed in the past our investment in hiring technology recruiters to take advantage of the demand for skilled IT workers.
We are pleased with the early returns in this investment as indicated by the current quarter revenues for Robert Half Technology, which were 29% higher than 1 year ago and 9% higher than the first quarter of 2011. At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself to 1 question and a single follow-up. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to you later in the call."

First of all, if you look at the June labor report, the brightest portion of that report was Professional Services accounting and IT. So I think it was a bit of an outlier relative to the overall report for starters. And then I'd also say that in our Permanent Placement practice, which is even stronger than temp and stronger than it would have been relative to prior cycles at this point, we are certainly seeing a fair amount of turnover in our clients that's also creating demand. And I'm sure you're familiar with these BLS jolt survey, that actually shows labor turnover. And if you look at the professional segments of that, you'll see that the voluntary quits year-over-year is actually up, I think, it over 20%. So not only is there demand from clients that are restoring their workforce from the very low levels the cut to, you're also seeing more voluntary quits that will require replacement. There are several surveys out there, Mercer has a recent one, Deloitte has a recent one that talk about there is a fair amount of frustration and unrest with the current employee base relative to coming to this long downturn, such that there is a willingness to entertain a new job.

And the low end we back off of that. At the margin line, for reasons I just talked about, we expect lower temp gross margins. For the workers comp we expect a slightly higher SG&A because of the discretionary investment hiring we think it's prudent to do at this time. And therefore, the incremental margins will be a little bit lower. The other comment I would make about the guidance. While we do expect Protiviti profitability to improve in the third quarter, you can't use the prior year as a judge because in the prior year there was a huge utilization lift between the second and third quarters of the last year given the starting point with Protiviti, the utilization is much higher.

I'd say first of all, let's understand that passive candidates, people that already have a job that are in linkedin are not good candidates for temp jobs. So, frankly, linkedin is much more relevant to our perm business than it is our temp business. Our perm recruiters do use linkedin as the one of the many sources for candidates. It still takes a lot of time and effort to convert a passive candidate to a hired employee and our small business clients essentially outsource that functions to us. You still have to contact, engage, interview, screen, test, check references, check backgrounds, do a culture fit, do a soft scale fit, so there is still a lot that has to happen even after you identify a candidate.

We think that's consistent with what we hear and see with the Big 4 generally. Long-term growth, we do think it's a growth business at the moment. We are focused more on profitability than we are at top line growth. I think the more relevant growth statistic for Protiviti is that the gross margin line rather than at the revenue line. You'll notice that Protiviti's gross margin year-over-year grew 26% this quarter, which was double its rate of growth at the revenue line. On the profitability side, we were pleased that Protiviti was profitable this quarter as compared to a pretty sizable loss a year ago. We've said many times, our expectation is that we can get to low double-digit operating margins in the United States. For the third quarter, there's an August impact in Europe, not only in staffing but that's also true in Protiviti as well.

We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We have described some of these risks and uncertainties in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on this conference call. 
Now let's discuss the second quarter. The second quarter revenues were $938 million, up 22% from 1 year ago. Second quarter income per share of $0.25 is triple that of the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $69 million, and capital expenditures were $14 million. 
We paid a cash dividend of $0.14 per share to stockholder during the second quarter for a total of $20 million. We also repurchased 2 million RHI shares during the quarter, spending a total of $56 million for this purpose. Approximately, 8.4 million shares remain available under our board approved stock repurchase plan.
This is the fifth consecutive quarter we have reported accelerating year-over-year growth rates for our consolidated revenues. We once again saw a broad-based improving demand for our professional staffing services and Protiviti during the second quarter, both in North America and abroad. 
Our permanent placement and technology staffing divisions were particularly strong. The pricing environment also continued to improve during the quarter, which contributed to higher gross margins. Our CFO, Keith Waddell, will now provide you with a more detailed look at second quarter results."

OfficeTeam, which was established 20 years ago, is our high-end administrative staffing division. It represents 20% of company-wide revenues. There are 317 OfficeTeam locations worldwide.
Second quarter revenue for Robert Half Management Resources was $113 million, this is an increase of 22% from a year ago and an increase of 2% sequentially.

Protiviti revenues were $105 million in the second quarter, up 13% from 1 year ago and up 6% sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and an internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti, including its independently owned member firms, serves clients through a network of 71 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 28% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. Second quarter gross margin in our temporary consulting staffing operations was $263 million or 35% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.1% of revenues for the second quarter of last year and 34.4% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011.
The year-over-year and sequential improvements are due to the combination of higher pay bill spreads and higher conversion revenues, which were partially offset by higher state on employment taxes. In addition, workers compensation actuarial reviews resulted in credits of $1.3 million for both the second quarter of this year and last year.
Overall staffing gross margin was $344 million in the second quarter or 41.3% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.6% of revenues in Q2 2010 and 40% of revenues last quarter. The mix of permanent placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 9.7% of this quarter's staffing revenues compared to 8.3% and 8.6% of revenues for Q2 2010 and Q1 2011, respectively.
Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $28 million or 26.9% of Protiviti revenues, as compared to $22 million or 24% of Protiviti revenues in Q2 2010. Protiviti group gross margin grew 26% year-over-year and 14% sequentially owing to higher utilization rates and firming billing rates.
Turning to SG&A costs. Staffing SG&A costs for the second quarter were $284 million or 34.1% of staffing revenues, this compares to $238 million or 35.3% of revenues for the second quarter 1 year ago and $267 million or 34.2% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011.
Higher SG&A costs were due primarily to increased payroll cost, including higher headcounts and incentive compensation payouts.
Second quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million, 26% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $29 million or 31.2% of revenues for the second quarter a year ago and $26 million or 26.7% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011.
The prior year's second quarter included $2.4 million in legal settlement costs, which did not reoccur.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $60 million during the second quarter or 7.2% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions contributed $46 million of this amount or 6.1% of applicable revenues. Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $14 million or 17.2% of applicable revenues. Operating income for Protiviti was $1 million in the second quarter or 0.9% of revenues. This compares to an operating loss of $6.8 million in the second quarter 1 year ago.
Accounts receivable were $495 million at the end of the second quarter with implied days outstanding of 48.1 days compared to 45.5 days at the end of the second quarter 1 year ago.
Now let's turn to guidance. We saw the following trends in the second quarter and the first few weeks of July. On a same-day sequential basis, temporary and consulting revenues were up in April, up in May, and up again in June. On a same-day basis, permanent placement revenues were down in April, up in May and up again in June. During the first 2 weeks of July, revenues from our temporary and consulting businesses were up 19% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of July, revenues from our permanent placement division were up 27% compared to the same period last year. That said, we'd remind you that permanent placement trends are difficult to assess over short periods of time.
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following third quarter guidance. Revenues, $940 million to $990 million. Income per share, $0.24 to $0.29. It is our policy to limit guidance to 1 quarter. Any estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We continue to see broad-based revenue growth and improving demand within our professional staffing operations and Protiviti during the second quarter. Our permanent placement operations reported a very strong quarter with revenues at their highest levels since the third quarter of 2008. We credit our outstanding field team for these results. 
As I noted on our last conference call, this has been among the fastest post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. This last recession was deeper than past ones in our history, but revenues have grown faster than in periods following other downturns. 
Notwithstanding the disappointing job report for June, we saw higher demand for our professional staffing services in the United States throughout the second quarter. Our staffing operations in Continental Europe also performed particularly well. Revenues from non-U.S. staffing operations have expanded from 11% of the staffing total in 2,000 to more than 30% today. We were pleased also to see higher demand for Protiviti's consulting and internal audit services. Demand was strongest for information technology-related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industry.
We believe one of the bright spots in the economy has been technology-related spending across companies of all sizes. We are witnessing this in Protiviti's information technology consulting practice and in our staffing operations. We have discussed in the past our investment in hiring technology recruiters to take advantage of the demand for skilled IT workers.
We are pleased with the early returns in this investment as indicated by the current quarter revenues for Robert Half Technology, which were 29% higher than 1 year ago and 9% higher than the first quarter of 2011. At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself to 1 question and a single follow-up as needed.

First of all, if you look at that June labor report, the brightest portion of that report was Professional Services accounting and IT. So I think that was a bit of an outlier relative to the overall report for starters. And then I'd also say that in our permanent placement practice, which is even stronger than temp and stronger than it would have been relative to prior cycles at this point, we're certainly seeing a fair amount of turnover in our clients that's also creating demand. And I'm sure you're familiar with these BLS JOLTS survey, that actually shows labor turnover. And if you look at the professional segments of that, you'll see that the voluntary quits year-over-year is actually up, I think, it's over 20%. So not only is there demand from clients that are restoring their workforce from the very low levels they cut to, you're also seeing more voluntary quits that require replacement. There are severals that is out there, Mercer has a recent one, Deloitte has a recent one that talk about there's a fair amount of frustration and unrest with the current employee base relative to coming to this long downturn, such that there's a willingness to entertain a new job. But again, we're seeing demand in perm not only from replacing prior cuts but increased turnover as well."

But we do expect the momentum to continue. Now, adjusted for the seasonal comments I just made, but essentially the high end of our guidance at the revenue line says the year-over-year growth we've just experienced pretty much continues into the third quarter. And the low end, we back off of that. At the margin line, for reasons I just talked about, we expect lower temp gross margins. For the workers comp, we expect a slightly higher SG&A because of the discretionary investment hiring we think it's prudent to do at this time. And therefore, the incremental margins would be a little lower. The other comment I would make about the guidance. While we do expect Protiviti profitability to improve in the third quarter, you can't use the prior year as a judge because in the prior year, there was a huge utilization lift between the second and third quarters of the last year. Given the starting point with Protiviti, the utilization is much higher. You're not going to get as much incremental lift in the third quarter of this year as you did last.

Now let's discuss the second quarter. The second quarter revenues were $938 million, up 22% from 1 year ago. Second quarter income per share of $0.25 is triple that of the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $69 million, and capital expenditures were $14 million. 
We paid a cash dividend of $0.14 per share to stockholders during the second quarter for a total of $20 million. We also repurchased 2 million RHI shares during the quarter, spending a total of $56 million for this purpose. Approximately, 8.4 million shares remain available under our board approved stock repurchase plan.
This is the fifth consecutive quarter we have reported accelerating year-over-year growth rates for our consolidated revenues. We once again saw a broad-based improving demand for our professional staffing services and Protiviti during the second quarter, both in North America and abroad. 
Our permanent placement and technology staffing divisions were particularly strong. The pricing environment also continued to improve during the quarter, which contributed to higher gross margins. Our CFO, Keith Waddell, will now provide you with a more detailed look at second quarter results."

Protiviti revenues were $105 million in the second quarter, up 13% from 1 year ago and up 6% sequentially. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and an internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti, including its independently owned member firms, serves clients through a network of 71 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 28% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let's review gross margin. Second quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $263 million or 35% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.1% of revenues for the second quarter of last year and 34.4% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011.
The year-over-year and sequential improvements are due to the combination of higher pay bill spreads and higher conversion revenues, which were partially offset by higher state unemployment taxes. In addition, workers compensation actuarial reviews resulted in credits of $1.3 million for both the second quarter of this year and last year.
Overall staffing gross margin was $344 million in the second quarter or 41.3% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.6% of revenues in Q2 2010 and 40% of revenues last quarter. The mix of permanent placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 9.7% of this quarter's staffing revenues compared to 8.3% and 8.6% of revenues for Q2 2010 and Q1 2011, respectively.
Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $28 million or 26.9% of Protiviti revenues, as compared to $22 million or 24% of Protiviti revenues in Q2 2010. Protiviti group gross margin grew 26% year-over-year and 14% sequentially owing to higher utilization rates and firming billing rates.
Turning to SG&A costs. Staffing SG&A costs for the second quarter were $284 million or 34.1% of staffing revenues, this compares to $238 million or 35.3% of revenues for the second quarter 1 year ago and $267 million or 34.2% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011.
Higher SG&A costs were due primarily to increased payroll cost, including higher headcounts and incentive compensation payouts.
Second quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million, 26% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $29 million or 31.2% of revenues for the second quarter a year ago and $26 million or 26.7% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011.
The prior year's second quarter included $2.4 million in legal settlement costs, which did not reoccur.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $60 million during the second quarter or 7.2% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions contributed $46 million of this amount or 6.1% of applicable revenues. Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $14 million or 17.2% of applicable revenues. Operating income for Protiviti was $1 million in the second quarter or 0.9% of revenues. This compares to an operating loss of $6.8 million in the second quarter 1 year ago.
Accounts receivable were $495 million at the end of the second quarter with implied days outstanding of 48.1 days compared to 45.5 days at the end of the second quarter 1 year ago.
Now let's turn to guidance. We saw the following trends in the second quarter and the first few weeks of July. On a same-day sequential basis, temporary and consulting revenues were up in April, up in May, and up again in June. On a same-day basis, permanent placement revenues were down in April, up in May and up again in June. During the first 2 weeks of July, revenues from our temporary and consulting businesses were up 19% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of July, revenues from our permanent placement division were up 27% compared to the same period last year. That said, we'd remind you that permanent placement trends are difficult to assess over short periods of time.
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following third quarter guidance. Revenues, $940 million to $990 million. Income per share, $0.24 to $0.29. It is our policy to limit guidance to 1 quarter. Any estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We continue to see broad-based revenue growth and improving demand within our professional staffing operations and Protiviti during the second quarter. Our permanent placement operations reported a very strong quarter with revenues at their highest levels since the third quarter of 2008. We credit our outstanding field team for these results. 
As I noted on our last conference call, this has been among the fastest post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. This last recession was deeper than past ones in our history, but revenues have grown faster than in periods following other downturns. 
Notwithstanding the disappointing jobs report for June, we saw higher demand for our professional staffing services in the United States throughout the second quarter. Our staffing operations in Continental Europe also performed particularly well. Revenues from non-U.S. staffing operations have expanded from 11% of the staffing total in 2,000 to more than 30% today. We were pleased also to see higher demand for Protiviti's consulting and internal audit services. Demand was strongest for information technology-related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industry.
We believe one of the bright spots in the economy has been technology-related spending across companies of all sizes. We are witnessing this in Protiviti's information technology consulting practice and in our staffing operations. We have discussed in the past our investment in hiring technology recruiters to take advantage of the demand for skilled IT workers.
We are pleased with the early returns in this investment as indicated by the current quarter revenues for Robert Half Technology, which were 29% higher than 1 year ago and 9% higher than the first quarter of 2011. At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself to 1 question and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

First of all, if you look at that June labor report, the brightest portion of that report was Professional Services accounting and IT. So I think that was a bit of an outlier relative to the overall report for starters. And then I'd also say that in our permanent placement practice, which is even stronger than temp and stronger than it would have been relative to prior cycles at this point, we're certainly seeing a fair amount of turnover in our clients that's also creating demand. And I'm sure you're familiar with these BLS JOLTS survey that actually shows labor turnover. And if you look at the professional segments of that, you'll see that the voluntary quits year-over-year is actually up, I think, it's over 20%. So not only is there demand from clients that are restoring their workforce from the very low levels they cut to, you're also seeing more voluntary quits that require replacement. There are several studies out there, Mercer has a recent one, Deloitte has a recent one that talk about there's a fair amount of frustration and unrest with the current employee base relative to coming to this long downturn, such that there's a willingness to entertain a new job.

And the low end, we back off of that. At the margin line, for reasons I just talked about, we expect lower temp gross margins. For the workers comp, we expect a slightly higher SG&A because of the discretionary investment hiring we think it's prudent to do at this time. And therefore, the incremental margins would be a little lower. The other comment I would make about the guidance. While we do expect Protiviti profitability to improve in the third quarter, you can't use the prior year as a judge because in the prior year, there was a huge utilization lift between the second and third quarters of the last year. Given the starting point with Protiviti, the utilization is much higher. You're not going to get as much incremental lift in the third quarter of this year as you did last.

I think the more relevant growth statistic for Protiviti is that the gross margin line rather than at the revenue line, you'll notice that Protiviti's gross margin year-over-year grew 26% this quarter, which was double its rate of growth at the revenue line. On the profitability side, we were pleased that Protiviti was profitable this quarter as compared to a pretty sizable loss a year ago. We've said many times, our expectation is that we can get to low double-digit operating margins in the United States. For the third quarter, there's an August impact in Europe, not only in staffing but that's also true in Protiviti as well.

We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Now let's discuss the third quarter. Company-wide revenues were $985 million, a 20% increase from the third quarter of 2010. Income per share was $0.31, up 121% from last year's third quarter amount of $0.14 per share. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $72 million, capital expenditures were $13 million, we paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.14 per share during the quarter at a cost of $20 million. We also repurchased 2.1 million RHI shares during the third quarter at a total cost of $48 million. Approximately 6.4 million shares remain available under our board approved stock repurchase plan. 
We saw a broad-based demand for our professional services throughout the third quarter resulting in double digit year-over-year revenue growth rates for the fifth consecutive quarter. All of our divisions performed well led by our Technology Staffing division. In addition, we were particularly pleased with the continuing expansion of our gross margins across our Temporary Staffing divisions. 
Keith Waddell will now provide you with a closer look at our third quarter financial results."

Accountemps had third quarter revenues of $367 million, up 17% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially on a same-day basis. Accountemps is our largest Staffing division and has 352 offices worldwide. It accounts for 37% of company revenues. 
Third quarter revenues for OfficeTeam were $196 million, up 20% from the third quarter of last year and up 3% from the second quarter of this year on a same-day basis. Established in 1991, OfficeTeam has our high-end Administrative Staffing division. It has 315 locations worldwide and represents 20% of company-wide revenues. 
Robert Half Management Resources had revenues of $118 million in the third quarter, up 20% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially on a same-day basis. Robert Half Management Resources, which was introduced in 1997 places senior-level accounting finance professionals on a project basis.

This business operates in 113 locations worldwide and accounts for 12% of company-wide revenues. 
Third quarter revenues for Robert Half Finance & Accounting, or Permanent Placement Division, $79 million, up 38% from last year's third quarter and down 3% sequentially on a same-day basis. Our Permanent Placement division was established in 1948. It has 352 locations worldwide. This business accounts for 8% of company-wide revenues.  
Third quarter revenues for our International Staffing operations were $264 million. This is an increase of 29% from last year and an increase of 1% sequentially on a same-day basis. On a constant-currency basis, the growth rates were 19% versus 1 year ago and 2% sequentially on a same-day basis. We have staffing operations in 104 locations and 19 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 30% of total staffing revenues. 
Third quarter revenues for Protiviti were $111 million, this is 12% higher than the third quarter 1 year ago and 6% higher sequentially on a same-day basis. Protiviti was formed in 2002 as a global business consulting and international audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti as an independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 72 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 24% of Protiviti's revenues. 
Now let's look at gross margin. Third quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting Staffing operations was $283 million or 35.5% of applicable revenues. This compares to 34.1% of revenues in the third quarter of last year and 35.0% of revenues in the second quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter improvement is primarily the result of higher pay bill spreads if higher conversions remained constant as a percent of revenue on a sequential basis. 
Overall staffing gross margin was $362 million in the third quarter, or 41.4% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.3% of revenues in last year's third quarter and 41.3% of revenues in this year's second quarter. Protiviti's third quarter gross margin was $30 million or 27.5% of Protiviti revenues, compares to $27 million or 27% of Protiviti revenues in Q3 2010. Protiviti gross margin grew 14% year-over-year, an 8% sequentially owing primarily to higher U.S. utilization rates. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs, in the third quarter our staffing SG&A costs were $293 million, 33.4% of staffing revenues. In last year's third quarter, these costs were $245 million, or 34.2% of revenues. And in the second quarter of this year, they were $284 million or 34.1% of revenues. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million, 24.6% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 26.9% of revenues the third quarter a year ago and $27 million or 26% of revenues for the second quarter of 2011. 
Third quarter operating income for our Staffing divisions was $69 million or 7.9% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $61 million of this amount or 7.7% of applicable revenues. Third quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement divisions is $8 million or 9.8% of applicable revenues. Protiviti operating income was $3 million in the third quarter of 2.9% of revenues compared to just 0.1% of revenues in last year's third quarter. 
Accounts receivable were $516 million at the end of the third quarter with implied days outstanding, DSO, of 47.7 days which compares to 47.6 days at the end of last year's third quarter. 
Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. 
You saw the following trends in the third quarter in the first few weeks of October. On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues are up in July, up in August and up again in September. On a same-day sequential basis, Permanent Placement revenues were down in July, down in August, but up again in September. During the first 2 weeks of October, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 15% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of October, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 66% compared to the same period last year. 
As we've said before, Perm trends are difficult to evaluate over these short time periods. Taking into account these trends, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $950 million to  $1 billion; income per share, $0.28 to  $0.33. It's our policy to limit guidance to 1 quarter and the estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We had another strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth rates across all lines of business on a year-over-year basis. Technology Staffing continued to perform well and we also saw a nice year-over-year and sequential growth in our other Temporary and Consulting Staffing divisions during the quarter. 
Our Permanent Placement business saw some seasonal sequential flattening but remained very strong overall. Revenues for Robert Half Finance & Accounting were up 38% year-over-year in the third quarter. This continues to be among the fastest post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. Company-wide revenues have grown faster following the last recession than in periods following other downturns. In our Staffing divisions, there has been a tightening labor supply in some specialties, particularly for Information Technology positions. Within the professional disciplines we serve, the unemployment rate is much lower than the overall U.S. rate and this has contributed to a stronger pricing environment. Our internal headcount investments in Technology staffing services have been productive, which has demonstrated by our third quarter revenue for Robert Half Technology, as well as its performance over the last several quarters. We see continued opportunities, both in the near and long-term in Technology Staffing and in our core Accounting and Finance Staffing businesses. 
We were pleased to also see higher demand for Protiviti's Consulting and Internal Audit Services during the quarter, particularly in the United States. The need was most pronounced for information technology-related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industry.

So first let's remember that on our guidance, our revenue guidance, fourth quarter has 3 fewer billing days than the quarter that just ended, Protiviti has fewer 5 billing days because of the holiday impact. At the high end of our range, we're assuming that per billing day revenues get a traditional seasonal lift in the fourth quarter, which we see in Accounting, with the budgets in year end, which we see in OfficeTeam with holiday customer service and fill in demand. Our gross margins, as we discussed a bit during our formal remarks, were quite good in the third quarter. We expect that momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. On the SG&A front, we do plan to continue to higher albeit at that somewhat lower rates. On the Temp side, we added low-single digits in terms of number of heads during the third quarter. We plan to continue that into the fourth. On the Perm side, we added in the high single-digit rates and that we'll probably bring back low-single digits. From the guidance for Protiviti, our fourth quarter guidance assumes in the U.S. we continue very strong. We were quite pleased with our performance in Protiviti in the third quarter. We think that rolls into the fourth, adjusted for 5 fewer billing days. In the non-U.S., we assume that that's going to be down modest sequentially. We continue to be challenged particularly in Japan and a couple of the EU countries. In Protiviti, we would expect operating income to be down modestly versus the third quarter and versus last year, a year ago. But generally speaking, overall we've got fewer billing days to overcome, which is not new for the fourth quarter. We've got the December Perm uncertainty, which is not new for the fourth quarter. But given those parameters, we feel pretty good about where we are and our guidance reflects that. On the second part of your question, Rh technology, 30% year-over-year growth. We've seen a nice payback on the investment hiring we've done so far. As to how much runway whether there is a supply limitation in our growth, clearly, technology is in the area that is the tightest in supply as it relates to the candidate side of the business. That said, we remain very optimistic that we can continue to have outsized growth rates in technology, both on the technology development side, as well as on the administrative or the production side of technology."

The trajectory is good. That said, we do expect further unemployment costs increases in 2012 and we're planning for that as we speak. But here again, that's not a phenomenon new to this cycle.

Now let's discuss the third quarter. Company-wide revenues were $985 million, a 20% increase from the third quarter of 2010. Income per share was $0.31, up 121% from last year's third quarter amount of $0.14 per share. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $72 million, capital expenditures were $13 million, we paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.14 per share during the quarter at a cost of $20 million. We also repurchased 2.1 million RHI shares during the third quarter at a total cost of $48 million. Approximately 6.4 million shares remain available under our board approved stock repurchase plan. 
We saw a broad-based demand for our professional services throughout the third quarter resulting in double digit year-over-year revenue growth rates for the fifth consecutive quarter. All of our divisions performed well led by our Technology Staffing division. In addition, we were particularly pleased with the continuing expansion of our gross margins across our Temporary Staffing divisions. 
Keith Waddell will now provide you with a closer look at our third quarter financial results."

Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 72 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 24% of Protiviti's revenues. 
Now let's look at gross margin. Third quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting Staffing operations was $283 million or 35.5% of applicable revenues. This compares to 34.1% of revenues in the third quarter of last year and 35.0% of revenues in the second quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter improvement is primarily the result of higher pay bill spreads temp to higher conversions remained constant as a percent of revenue on a sequential basis. 
Overall staffing gross margin was $362 million in the third quarter, or 41.4% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.3% of revenues in last year's third quarter and 41.3% of revenues in this year's second quarter. Protiviti's third quarter gross margin was $30 million or 27.5% of Protiviti revenues, compares to $27 million or 27% of Protiviti revenues in Q3 2010. Protiviti gross margin grew 14% year-over-year, an 8% sequentially, owing primarily to higher U.S. utilization rates. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs, in the third quarter our staffing SG&A costs were $293 million, or 33.5% of staffing revenues. In last year's third quarter, these costs were $245 million, or 34.2% of revenues. And in the second quarter of this year, they were $284 million or 34.1% of revenues. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million, or 24.6% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 26.9% of revenues in the third quarter a year ago, and $27 million or 26% of revenues for the second quarter of 2011. 
Third quarter operating income for our Staffing divisions was $69 million or 7.9% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $61 million of this amount or 7.7% of applicable revenues. Third quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement divisions was $8 million or 9.8% of applicable revenues. Protiviti operating income was $3 million in the third quarter or 2.9% of revenues compared to just 0.1% of revenues in last year's third quarter. 
Accounts receivable were $516 million at the end of the third quarter with implied days outstanding, DSO, of 47.7 days which compares to 47.6 days at the end of last year's third quarter. 
Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. 
You saw the following trends in the third quarter and the first few weeks of October. On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were up in July, up in August and up again in September. On a same-day sequential basis, Permanent Placement revenues were down in July, down in August, but up again in September. During the first 2 weeks of October, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 15% compared to the same period of last year. For the first 3 weeks of October, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 66% compared to the same period of last year. 
As we've said before, Perm trends are difficult to evaluate over these short time periods. Taking into account these trends, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $950 million to  $1 billion; income per share, $0.28 to $0.33. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter and the estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We had another strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth rates across all lines of business on a year-over-year basis. Technology Staffing continued to perform well and we also saw a nice year-over-year and sequential growth in our other Temporary and Consulting Staffing divisions during the quarter. 
Our Permanent Placement business saw some seasonal sequential flattening but remained very strong overall. Revenues for Robert Half Finance & Accounting were up 38% year-over-year in the third quarter. This continues to be among the fastest post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. Company-wide revenues have grown faster following the last recession than in periods following other downturns. In our Staffing divisions, there has been a tightening labor supply in some specialties, particularly for Information Technology positions. Within the professional disciplines we serve, the unemployment rate is much lower than the overall U.S. rate, and this has contributed to a stronger pricing environment. Our internal headcount investments in Technology Staffing services have been productive, which has demonstrated by our third quarter revenue for Robert Half Technology, as well as its performance over the last several quarters. We see continued opportunities, both in the near and long-term in Technology Staffing and in our core Accounting and Finance Staffing businesses. 
We were pleased to also see higher demand for Protiviti's Consulting and Internal Audit Services during the quarter, particularly in the United States. The need was most pronounced for information technology-related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industry.

So let's first talk about guidance. So first, let's remember that on our guidance, our revenue guidance, the fourth quarter has 3 fewer billing days than the quarter that just ended, Protiviti has 5 fewer billing days because of the holiday impact. At the high end of our range, we're assuming that per billing day revenues get a traditional seasonal lift in the fourth quarter, which we see in Accounting, with budgets in yearend, which we see in OfficeTeam, with holiday customer service and fill in demand. Our gross margins, as we discussed a bit during our formal remarks were quite good in the third quarter. We expect that momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. On the SG&A front, we do plan to continue to hire albeit at somewhat lower rates. On the Temp side, we added low single-digits in terms of number of heads during the third quarter. We plan to continue that into the fourth. On the Perm side, we added in the high single-digit rates and that will probably bring back into the low single-digits. From the guidance for Protiviti, our fourth quarter guidance assumes in the U.S., we continue very strong. We were quite pleased with our performance in Protiviti in the third quarter. We think that rolls into the fourth, adjusted for 5 fewer billing days. In the non-U.S., we assume that, that's going to be down modest sequentially. We continue to be challenged particularly in Japan, and a couple of the EU countries. In Protiviti, we would expect operating income to be down modestly versus the third quarter and versus last year, a year ago. But generally speaking, overall, we've got fewer billing days to overcome, which is not new for the fourth quarter. We've got the December Perm uncertainty, which is not new for the fourth quarter. But given those parameters, we feel pretty good about where we are and our guidance reflects that. On the second part of your question, RH Technology, 30% year-over-year growth. We've seen a nice payback on the investment hiring we've done so far. As to how much runway and whether there is a supply limitation in our growth, clearly, technology is in the area that is the tightest in supply as it relates to the candidate side of the business. That said, we remain very optimistic that we can continue to have outsized growth rates in technology, both on the technology development side, as well as on the administrative or the production side of technology."

So Perm, we started the quarter up 66% which at fate, sounds wonderful. We would caution a bit that the comps a year ago were on the easier side. So while we had a really good start, it wasn't quite that good. On the Temp side, 15% out of the gate versus 20% we just reported, 3 points of that difference frankly, is currency so the differential isn't as great as it might otherwise look. And we remain optimistic there in the United States. Pretty much across the board, divisions and geographies, we feel very good about how we started the quarter. Outside the United States, it's a little more even -- uneven. We're quite strong in Germany and France. We're not quite as strong in Belgium and in the U.K., plus we've got some places like Australia that are coming out against monster comps that make our year-over-year growth rate look lower but still they're doing quite well."

Our pricing did go down during the downturn but it's coming back. The market is clearly stronger and candidate supply is certainly tightening. And for those reasons, we're doing a better job with our pricing.

Income per share was $0.31, up 121% from last year's third quarter amount of $0.14 per share. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $72 million, capital expenditures were $13 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.14 per share during the quarter, at a cost of $20 million. We also repurchased 2.1 million RHI shares during the third quarter, at a total cost of $48 million. Approximately 6.4 million shares remain available under our board approved stock repurchase plan. 
We saw a broad-based demand for our professional services throughout the third quarter resulting in double digit year-over-year revenue growth rates for the fifth consecutive quarter. All of our divisions performed well, led by our Technology Staffing division. In addition, we were particularly pleased with the continuing expansion of our gross margins across our Temporary Staffing divisions.

Third quarter revenues for Protiviti were $111 million, this is 12% higher than the third quarter one year ago and 6% higher sequentially, on a same-day basis. Protiviti was formed in 2002 as a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti, and its independently owned member firms, serve clients through a network of 72 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 24% of Protiviti's revenues. 
Now let's look at gross margin. Third quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting Staffing operations was $283 million or 35.5% of applicable revenues. This compares to 34.1% of revenues in the third quarter of last year and 35.0% of revenues in the second quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter improvement is primarily the result of higher pay bill spreads, temp to higher conversions remained constant as a percent of revenue on a sequential basis. 
Overall staffing gross margin was $362 million in the third quarter, or 41.4% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.3% of revenues in last year's third quarter and 41.3% of revenues in this year's second quarter. Protiviti's third quarter gross margin was $30 million or 27.5% of Protiviti revenues, compares to $27 million or 27% of Protiviti revenues in Q3 2010. Protiviti gross margin grew 14% year-over-year, an 8% sequentially, owing primarily to higher U.S. utilization rates. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs, in the third quarter our staffing SG&A costs were $293 million, or 33.5% of staffing revenues. In last year's third quarter, these costs were $245 million, or 34.2% of revenues. And in the second quarter of this year, they were $284 million or 34.1% of revenue. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million, or 24.6% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 26.9% of revenues in the third quarter a year ago, and $27 million or 26% of revenues for the second quarter of 2011. 
Third quarter operating income for our Staffing divisions was $69 million or 7.9% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $61 million of this amount or 7.7% of applicable revenues. Third quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement divisions was $8 million or 9.8% of applicable revenues. Protiviti operating income was $3 million in the third quarter or 2.9% of revenues, compared to just 0.1% of revenues in last year's third quarter. 
Accounts receivable were $516 million at the end of the third quarter with implied days outstanding, DSO, of 47.7 days which compares to 47.6 days at the end of last year's third quarter. 
Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. 
We saw the following trends in the third quarter and the first few weeks of October. On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were up in July, up in August and up again in September. On a same-day sequential basis, Permanent Placement revenues were down in July, down in August, but up again in September. During the first 2 weeks of October, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 15% compared to the same period of last year. For the first 3 weeks of October, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 66% compared to the same period of last year. 
As we've said before, Perm trends are difficult to evaluate over these short time periods. Taking into account these trends, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $950 million to $1 billion; income per share, $0.28 to $0.33. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter and the estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We had another strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth rates across all lines of business on a year-over-year basis. Technology Staffing continued to perform well and we also saw a nice year-over-year and sequential growth in our other Temporary and Consulting Staffing divisions during the quarter. 
Our Permanent Placement business saw some seasonal sequential flattening but remained very strong overall. Revenues for Robert Half Finance & Accounting were up 38% year-over-year in the third quarter. This continues to be among the fastest post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. Company-wide revenues have grown faster following the last recession than in periods following other downturns. 
In our Staffing divisions, there has been a tightening labor supply in some specialties, particularly for Information Technology positions. Within the professional disciplines we serve, the unemployment rate is much lower than the overall U.S. rate, and this has contributed to a stronger pricing environment. Our internal headcount investments in Technology Staffing services have been productive, which has demonstrated by our third quarter revenue for Robert Half Technology, as well as its performance over the last several quarters. We see continued opportunities, both in the near and long-term in Technology Staffing and in our core Accounting and Finance Staffing businesses. 
We were pleased to also see higher demand for Protiviti's Consulting and Internal Audit Services during the quarter, particularly in the United States.

And specifically, what are you seeing there in terms of how quickly you can ramp your people up. Obviously, it was a strong performance, but just how quickly you can ramp the folks up. How much runway and what is -- is there any constraint that you're seeing from a supply side that would limit the growth?"

So first, let's remember that on our guidance, our revenue guidance, the fourth quarter has 3 fewer billing days than the quarter that just ended. Protiviti has 5 fewer billing days because of the holiday impact.",419,"Okay. So let's first talk about guidance. So first, let's remember that on our guidance, our revenue guidance, the fourth quarter has 3 fewer billing days than the quarter that just ended. Protiviti has 5 fewer billing days because of the holiday impact. At the high end of our range, we're assuming that per billing day revenues get a traditional seasonal lift in the fourth quarter, which we see in Accounting, with budgets in yearend, which we see in OfficeTeam, with holiday customer service and fill in demand. 
Our gross margins, as we discussed a bit during our formal remarks, were quite good in the third quarter. We expect that momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. 
On the SG&A front, we do plan to continue to hire, albeit at somewhat lower rates. On the Temp side, we added low single-digits in terms of number of heads during the third quarter. We plan to continue that into the fourth. On the Perm side, we added in the high single-digit rates and that will probably bring back into the low single-digits. 
From the guidance for Protiviti, our fourth quarter guidance assumes in the U.S., we continue very strong. We were quite pleased with our performance in Protiviti in the third quarter. We think that rolls into the fourth, adjusted for 5 fewer billing days. 
In the non-U.S., we assume that, that's going to be down modest sequentially. We continue to be challenged particularly in Japan, and a couple of the EU countries. In Protiviti, we would expect operating income to be down modestly versus the third quarter and versus last year, a year ago. 
But generally speaking, overall, we've got fewer billing days to overcome, which is not new for the fourth quarter. We've got the December Perm uncertainty, which is not new for the fourth quarter. But given those parameters, we feel pretty good about where we are and our guidance reflects that. 
On the second part of your question, RH Technology, 30% year-over-year growth. We've seen a nice payback on the investment hiring we've done so far. As to how much runway and whether there’s a supply limitation in our growth, clearly, technology is in the area that is the tightest in supply as it relates to the candidate side of the business. That said, we remain very optimistic that we can continue to have outsized growth rates in technology, both on the technology development side, as well as on the administrative or the production side of technology."

So Perm, we started the quarter up 66%, which at fate, sounds wonderful. We would caution a bit that the comps a year ago were on the easier side. So while we had a really good start, it wasn't quite that good. 
On the Temp side, 15% out of the gate versus 20% we just reported, 3 points of that difference frankly, is currency so the differential isn't as great as it might otherwise look. And we remain optimistic there in the United States. Pretty much across the board, divisions and geographies, we feel very good about how we started the quarter. Outside the United States, it's a little more even -- uneven. We're quite strong in Germany and France. We're not quite as strong in Belgium and in the U.K. Plus we've got some places like Australia that are coming out against monster comps that make our year-over-year growth rate look lower but still they're doing quite well."

Our pricing did go down during the downturn but it's coming back. The market is clearly stronger and candidate supply is certainly tightening. And for those reasons, we're doing a better job with our pricing. I thought it was interesting in this most recent JOLTS report that's put out by the BLS, that reports job openings by industry.

All of our divisions performed well, led by our Technology Staffing division. In addition, we were particularly pleased with the continuing expansion of our gross margins across our Temporary Staffing divisions.

Protiviti, and its independently owned member firms, serve clients through a network of 72 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's international operations represent 24% of Protiviti's revenues. 
Now let's look at gross margin. Third quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting Staffing operations was $283 million or 35.5% of applicable revenues. This compares to 34.1% of revenues in the third quarter of last year and 35.0% of revenues in the second quarter of 2011. The quarter-over-quarter improvement is primarily the result of higher pay bill spreads, temp to higher conversions remained constant as a percent of revenue on a sequential basis. 
Overall staffing gross margin was $362 million in the third quarter, or 41.4% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.3% of revenues in last year's third quarter and 41.3% of revenues in this year's second quarter. Protiviti's third quarter gross margin was $30 million or 27.5% of Protiviti revenues, compares to $27 million or 27% of Protiviti revenues in Q3 2010. Protiviti gross margin grew 14% year-over-year, an 8% sequentially, owing primarily to higher U.S. utilization rates. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs, in the third quarter our staffing SG&A costs were $293 million, or 33.5% of staffing revenues. In last year's third quarter, these costs were $245 million, or 34.2% of revenues. And in the second quarter of this year, they were $284 million or 34.1% of revenue. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were $27 million, or 24.6% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to $27 million or 26.9% of revenues in the third quarter a year ago, and $27 million or 26% of revenues for the second quarter of 2011. 
Third quarter operating income for our Staffing divisions was $69 million or 7.9% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $61 million of this amount or 7.7% of applicable revenues. Third quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement divisions was $8 million or 9.8% of applicable revenues. Protiviti operating income was $3 million in the third quarter or 2.9% of revenues, compared to just 0.1% of revenues in last year's third quarter. 
Accounts receivable were $516 million at the end of the third quarter with implied days outstanding, DSO, of 47.7 days which compares to 47.6 days at the end of last year's third quarter. 
Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. 
We saw the following trends in the third quarter and the first few weeks of October. On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were up in July, up in August and up again in September. On a same-day sequential basis, Permanent Placement revenues were down in July, down in August, but up again in September. During the first 2 weeks of October, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 15% compared to the same period of last year. For the first 3 weeks of October, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 66% compared to the same period of last year. 
As we've said before, Perm trends are difficult to evaluate over these short time periods. Taking into account these trends, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $950 million to $1 billion; income per share, $0.28 to $0.33. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter and the estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We had another strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth rates across all lines of business on a year-over-year basis. Technology Staffing continued to perform well and we also saw a nice year-over-year and sequential growth in our other Temporary and Consulting Staffing divisions during the quarter. 
Our Permanent Placement business saw some seasonal sequential flattening but remained very strong overall. Revenues for Robert Half Finance & Accounting were up 38% year-over-year in the third quarter. This continues to be among the fastest post downturn recoveries we have seen in our business. Company-wide revenues have grown faster following the last recession than in periods following other downturns. 
In our Staffing divisions, there has been a tightening labor supply in some specialties, particularly for Information Technology positions. Within the professional disciplines we serve, the unemployment rate is much lower than the overall U.S. rate, and this has contributed to a stronger pricing environment. Our internal headcount investments in Technology Staffing services have been productive, which has demonstrated by our third quarter revenue for Robert Half Technology, as well as its performance over the last several quarters. We see continued opportunities, both in the near and long-term in Technology Staffing and in our core Accounting and Finance Staffing businesses. 
We were pleased to also see higher demand for Protiviti's Consulting and Internal Audit Services during the quarter, particularly in the United States. The need was most pronounced for information technology-related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industry. 
At this time, Keith and I are happy to respond to your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

So first, let's remember that on our guidance, our revenue guidance, the fourth quarter has 3 fewer billing days than the quarter that just ended.

So first, let's remember that on our guidance, our revenue guidance, the fourth quarter has 3 fewer billing days than the quarter that just ended. Protiviti has 5 fewer billing days because of the holiday impact. At the high end of our range, we're assuming that per billing day revenues get a traditional seasonal lift in the fourth quarter, which we see in Accounting, with budgets in yearend, which we see in OfficeTeam, with holiday customer service and fill in demand. 
Our gross margins, as we discussed a bit during our formal remarks, were quite good in the third quarter. We expect that momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. 
On the SG&A front, we do plan to continue to hire, albeit at somewhat lower rates. On the Temp side, we added low single-digits in terms of number of heads during the third quarter. We plan to continue that into the fourth. On the Perm side, we added in the high single-digit rates and that will probably bring back into the low single-digits. 
From the guidance for Protiviti, our fourth quarter guidance assumes in the U.S., we continue very strong. We were quite pleased with our performance in Protiviti in the third quarter. We think that rolls into the fourth, adjusted for 5 fewer billing days. 
In the non-U.S., we assume that, that's going to be down modest sequentially. We continue to be challenged particularly in Japan, and a couple of the EU countries. In Protiviti, we would expect operating income to be down modestly versus the third quarter and versus last year, a year ago. 
But generally speaking, overall, we've got fewer billing days to overcome, which is not new for the fourth quarter. We've got the December Perm uncertainty, which is not new for the fourth quarter. But given those parameters, we feel pretty good about where we are and our guidance reflects that. 
On the second part of your question, RH Technology, 30% year-over-year growth. We've seen a nice payback on the investment hiring we've done so far. As to how much runway and whether there’s a supply limitation in our growth, clearly, technology is in the area that is the tightest in supply as it relates to the candidate side of the business. That said, we remain very optimistic that we can continue to have outsized growth rates in technology, both on the technology development side, as well as on the administrative or the production side of technology."

So Perm, we started the quarter up 66%, which at fate, sounds wonderful. We would caution a bit that the comps a year ago were on the easier side. So while we had a really good start, it wasn't quite that good. 
On the Temp side, 15% out of the gate versus 20% we just reported, 3 points of that difference frankly, is currency so the differential isn't as great as it might otherwise look. And we remain optimistic there in the United States. Pretty much across the board, divisions and geographies, we feel very good about how we started the quarter. Outside the United States, it's a little more even -- uneven. We're quite strong in Germany and France. We're not quite as strong in Belgium and in the U.K. Plus we've got some places like Australia that are coming out against monster comps that make our year-over-year growth rate look lower but still they're doing quite well."

Our pricing did go down during the downturn but it's coming back. The market is clearly stronger and candidate supply is certainly tightening. And for those reasons, we're doing a better job with our pricing. I thought it was interesting in this most recent JOLTS report that's put out by the BLS, that reports job openings by industry.

Share count. We bought 2 million shares during the quarter. You didn't see the full benefit of that to the extent we buy more in the fourth. My guess is, you can take your share count down $0.5 million to $1 million in that category.
