We assume you have read our press release, and we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter. We're very proud of our results, which once again showed strong top and bottom line increases. On a 14%",1499,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We assume you have read our press release, and we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter. We're very proud of our results, which once again showed strong top and bottom line increases. On a 14% increase in sales, we produced: a 15% increase in gross profit, a 26% increase in EBITDA to $234 million, a 59% increase in earnings per share to $0.51, cash flow from operations of $253 million and free cash flow of $162 million.  Our solid execution is generating consistent free cash flow, which we are using to pay off debt, invest in new and existing stores and return cash to shareholders. 
During the quarter, we repaid $100 million of our term loan and invested $91 million in capital expenditures. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid another $200 million and paid $17 million to our shareholders after reinstating our dividend last December. 
The biggest news of the quarter is, despite increasingly tougher comparisons, we maintained our sales momentum and are reporting a fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating ident [identical] store sales growth on both a one- and a two-year basis. Identical store sales increased 9.1%, the highest result in four years and an acceleration of 518 basis points to 11.6% on a two-year stacked basis. 
Average weekly sales per store for all stores increased 9% to $621,000, translating to sales per square foot of approximately $856. We believe our value efforts and differentiation are continuing to gain traction as evidenced by our strong 7% increase in transaction count in identical stores. A 2% increase in basket size was driven primarily by customers putting more items in their baskets. And while there was a lot of discussion about inflationary pressures on product costs, our average price per item showed only a slight increase year-over-year. This is a reversal from slight decreases we have been seeing. We attribute this net overall result to our strategic price investments, offsetting the selected pass-through of some higher product costs. 
Our results underscored signs that consumer confidence continues to improve. Year-over-year, branded product sales growth outpaced our exclusive brand growth, and customers continued to shift towards organic products. We also saw an increase on the percentage of sales and transactions per basket over $50. Identical store sales growth averaged 8.5% over the last four quarters and 8.6% for the first three weeks of Q2. With over a third of the year behind us, our idents had averaged 9% year-to-date. We are proud that we are continuing to gain market share at a much faster rate than most public food retailers and attribute a lot of our success to the progress we have made in our relative price positioning and to continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers. 
Just last week, we announced our deeper commitment to improve the lives of farm animals with the adoption of the Five Step Animal Welfare Rating System. This is big news for our producers, for our shoppers and most importantly, for the farm animals. The rating system is the signature program of the new non-profit global animal partnership and recognizes producers for their efforts improving the welfare of the animals. 
For our shoppers, the rating system offers a new level of transparency about the beef, pork and chicken that we sell. Some step-rated options are now available at all of our stores in the United States and by May 9, all the beef, pork and chicken we carry in the fresh and prepacked cases will be rated. 
In other news, we were extremely pleased to be ranked number 24 on Fortune's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For, to be one of only 13 companies ranked consecutively for 14 years, validates our commitment to our core values supporting Team Member happiness and excellence. For additional information about our new animal welfare rating system, Fortune ranking and more, please visit the newly expanded Investor Relations area of our website titled Beyond The Numbers. We plan to post supplemental information here each quarter to highlight our whole story. The whole story just behind the financials. 
Turning now to new store growth. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Fairview, Texas; Huntington Beach, California and San Jose, California, and are pleased to announce today the signing of six new leases in Danbury, Connecticut, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts; Lynnfield, Massachusetts; Marlboro, New Jersey; San Antonio, Texas; and Ottawa, Canada. We are very excited about our growth opportunities in Canada, where we currently have six stores and another three now in development. Over the next 10 years, we believe our business in Canada has the potential to grow and expand to over $1 billion in sales. I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2011. Please refer to the press release for more detailed information.
Based on the consistently strong top and bottom line results, along with ongoing signs of increasing consumer confidence, we have raised our sales and earnings outlook for the year. We have raised our outlook for identical sales growth in fiscal year 2011 to 7% to 9% from a previous range of 5% to 7%. As we have frequently said, we do not have a crystal ball when it comes to sales. We can only look at our historical performance and current trends and try to make reasonable assumptions. We have reported five consecutive quarters of accelerating two-year ident store sales growth, a trend that has continued thus far in the second quarter. 
For the first three weeks of the second quarter, identical store sales increased 8.6% or 15% on a two-year basis. To put our new identical store sales guidance for the year in context, the low end of the 7% reflects the slight deceleration in growth on a two-year basis to approximately 14% from the 15% two-year idents we produced in the first three weeks of Q2. The high end of the 9% assumes some continued acceleration in two-year idents to approximately 17%, albeit at a more moderate rate of around 200 basis points versus the 518 and 341 increases we saw in Q1 and Q day today, respectively. We believe these ranges appropriately reflect that we have yet to cycle over our toughest comparisons, while also allowing for the possibility that our 9% year-to-date identical store sales growth could be sustainable, especially given the likelihood of some positive impact from inflation. 
Based on our strong first quarter results and updated assumptions, we have raised our diluted EPS range for fiscal 2011 to $1.76 to $1.80 or $1.25 to $1.29 for the remaining three quarters of the year. We have very high year-over-year EPS growth in Q1, driven in large part by lower pre-opening, relocation and net interest expense. While the benefit of a lower net interest expense will continue, for the remainder of the year, pre-opening and relocation expenses are expected to increase approximately $14 million to $17 million versus 2010. We expect a larger negative swing in LIFO of approximately $10 million to $11 million, and we expect to produce lower total sales growth on tough comparisons, which could make it difficult to leverage costs to the extent which we did in the first quarter. In addition, while G&A is still expected to average 3% for the year, we expect costs to be higher in Q2 due mainly to increases in wages and investments and other initiatives. 
Our guidance represents a 23% to 26% year-over-year increase in EPS on an 11% to 13% increase in total sales growth, reflecting steady sales growth on tougher comparisons, as well as our commitment to delivering incremental operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth. Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We have an expanded sense of our ultimate growth potential as our brand has continued to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. 
While it's difficult to put a number on how many stores we can eventually have, we consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of the market opportunity. There's plenty of runway left here in the United States. Canada and United Kingdom also hold great promise. 
From a financial perspective, we are well positioned to re-accelerate our new store growth. Our new stores are performing well. Our strong top and bottom line performance, along with our capital expense discipline, has resulted in consistent cash flow, lower debt and a very healthy balance sheet. We have signed 23 new leases over the last 12 months and expect to open a greater number of new stores beginning in 2012. We will now take your questions but we limit participants to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you."

And we think that we're getting a new customer in that wasn't shopping with us, maybe they shopped with us before, maybe not, we're not quite sure. Because we see other products that we had doing well and then we see these new products selling really well in addition to that, so we think that we're still bringing in new customers that hadn't shopped with us before. As far as the weather goes, we have had a lot of fairly extreme weather over the, let's say for the last month or so. But when we go back and look, we had some pretty significant weather events last year as well. So usually, these things to even off with each other. We did have some disruptions to some of these storms where stores had to close and distribution centers had a hard time getting product out. So we could see a little bit of an effect but my feeling at this point is that if the weather at this point kind of eases off a little bit, it will probably be fairly minimal difference from this year to last year. If we have another month of weather like we just had, then I think it will have some impact on the quarter."

So remember that we're little less exposed to the peer commodity swings than other retailers because of the mix of our business, the higher percentage of organic and natural products. Some of those contractual arrangements are different than on this pure commodity market. But as A.C. said, we are going to continue to develop this value. I think it's pretty clear from the Nielsen studies and so for that customers continue to want those choices. We're going to continue to offer them and develop them. And at the same time, we now have over 400 exclusive brands that we've developed, and we're continuing to develop our differentiation into our seafood standards and our meat standards.

At the same time we're maturing as a company, we're picking up stuff on the buy side that perhaps other more mature companies have picked up already through our distribution contracts, our movement to cost to serve, our buying disciplines that had brought us lots of gross margin on the buy side so it's all playing into our ability to have some pricing power. But ultimately, I think we like our position in the marketplace even in a more inflationary environment, which we think is going to be more tempered. It's not going to be -- even though there are lots of noise out there about all that, there's typically a lag in the retails from the producer index. We've seen that historically. We think it's going temper down, and we're certainly going to watch it, and we're going to be very careful about where we take those increases. But it does look like the marketplace is moving up incrementally and rationally so that will allow that to happen and then we're going to have to manage it very carefully and watch for consumers' reaction to those price increases. I think everyone's going to do that in the months ahead."

We did the first quarter to the same degree that it looks like if you look at the street numbers, because we did beyond our own expectations both in sales and in bottom line slightly but not to the same degree that we did for the street, so we're showing a pretty nice increase in store contribution percentage in the last three quarters compared to our prior guidance, and that reflects what we saw in the first quarter as well as our updated higher sales estimates for the rest of the year."

Whole Foods Market is not locate stores on the basis of income. That's just a myth out there. It's about education. It's about awareness. We have sites that do extremely well in areas that are not of high income. But it does require a certain level of consciousness, and that generally indicates better education and, of course, income correlates with education. But that is the bigger predictor of our success is not income but people's education levels. So if I can rephrase your question, are we going to be looking in areas that maybe are a little bit, don't have quite as high education levels? And it's a great question, and we don't really know the answer but we're going to find out. We are going to be opening some stores in areas that don't have quite the same density of college graduates that we've done previously, and they will probably be smaller stores. So we have tremendous opportunities. We've been kind of surprised. We have opened some stores in markets that have done a lot better than we thought they would do. It turns out that interestingly enough, in some of the markets where education and then income consequently are slightly less, they also tend to have less competition for our kind of products and our types of services provided. So the fact that we've done well in these markets has been very encouraging to us.

We assume you have read our press release, and we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter. We're very proud of our results, which once again showed strong top and bottom line increases. On a 14%",1505,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We assume you have read our press release, and we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter. We're very proud of our results, which once again showed strong top and bottom line increases. On a 14% increase in sales, we produced: a 15% increase in gross profit; a 26% increase in EBITDA to $234 million; a 59% increase in earnings per share to $0.51; cash flow from operations of $253 million; and free cash flow of $162 million.  Our solid execution is generating consistent free cash flow which we are using to pay off debt, invest in new and existing stores and return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repaid $100 million of our term loan and invested $91 million in capital expenditures. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid another $200 million and paid $17 million to our shareholders after reinstating our dividend last December. 
The biggest news of the quarter is, despite increasingly tougher comparisons, we maintained our sales momentum and are reporting our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating ident [identical] store sales growth on both a one- and a two-year basis. Identical store sales increased 9.1%, our highest result in four years, and an acceleration of 518 basis points to 11.6% on a two-year stacked basis. Average weekly sales per store for all stores increased 9% to $621,000, translating to sales per square foot of approximately $856.
We believe our value efforts and differentiation are continuing to gain traction as evidenced by our strong 7% increase in transaction count in identical stores. A 2% increase in basket size was driven primarily by customers putting more items in their baskets, and while there was a lot of discussion about inflationary pressures on product costs, our average price per item showed only a slight increase year-over-year. This is a reversal from slight decreases we have been seeing. We attribute this net overall result to our strategic price investments offsetting the selected pass-through of some higher product costs. 
Our results underscored signs that consumer confidence continues to improve. Year-over-year, branded product sales growth outpaced our exclusive brand growth, and customers continued to shift towards organic products. We also saw an increase on the percentage of sales and transactions for baskets over $50.
Our identical store sales growth averaged 8.5% over the last four quarters and 8.6% for the first three weeks of Q2. With over a third of the year behind us, our idents have averaged 9% year-to-date. We are proud that we are continuing to gain market share at a much faster rate than most public food retailers and attribute a lot of our success to the progress we have made in our relative price positioning and to continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers. 
Just last week, we announced our deeper commitment to improve the lives of farm animals with the adoption of the 5-Step Animal Welfare Rating System. This is big news for our producers, for our shoppers and most importantly, for the farm animals. The rating system is the signature program of the new non-profit Global Animal Partnership and recognizes producers for their efforts in improving the welfare of the animals. 
For our shoppers, the rating system offers a new level of transparency about the beef, pork and chicken that we sell. Some step-rated options are now available at all of our stores in the United States, and by May 9, all the beef, pork and chicken we carry in the fresh and pre-packaged cases will be rated. 
In other news, we were extremely pleased to be ranked number 24 on Fortune's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. To be one of only 13 companies ranked consecutively for 14 years validates our commitment to our core value of ""Supporting Team Member Happiness and Excellence."" For additional information about our new animal welfare rating system, Fortune ranking and more, please visit the newly expanded Investor Relations area of our website titled Beyond The Numbers. We plan to post supplemental information here each quarter to highlight our whole story, the whole story beyond just the financials. 
Turning now to new store growth. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Fairview, Texas; Huntington Beach, California and San Jose, California, and are pleased to announce today the signing of six new leases in Danbury, Connecticut, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts; Lynnfield, Massachusetts; Marlboro, New Jersey; San Antonio, Texas; and Ottawa, Canada. We are very excited about our growth opportunities in Canada, where we currently have six stores and another three now in development. Over the next 10 years, we believe our business in Canada has the potential to grow and expand to over $1 billion in sales.
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2011. Please refer to the press release for more detailed information.
Based on the consistently strong top and bottom line results, along with ongoing signs of increasing consumer confidence, we have raised our sales and earnings outlook for the year. We have raised our outlook for identical sales growth in fiscal year 2011 to 7% to 9% from a previous range of 5% to 7%. As we have frequently said, we do not have a crystal ball when it comes to sales. We can only look at our historical performance and current trends and try to make reasonable assumptions. We have reported five consecutive quarters of accelerating two-year ident store sales growth, a trend that has continued thus far in the second quarter. For the first three weeks of the second quarter, identical store sales increased 8.6%, or 15% on a two-year basis.
To put our new identical store sales guidance for the year in context, the low end of the 7% reflects the slight deceleration in growth on a two-year basis to approximately 14% from the 15% two-year idents we produced in the first three weeks of Q2. The high end of the 9% assumes some continued acceleration in two-year idents to approximately 17%, albeit at a more moderate rate of around 200 basis points versus the 518 and 341 increases we saw in Q1 and Q day [ph] to date, respectively. We believe these ranges appropriately reflect that we have yet to cycle over our toughest comparisons, while also allowing for the possibility that our 9% year-to-date identical store sales growth could be sustainable, especially given the likelihood of some positive impact from inflation. 
Based on our strong first quarter results and updated assumptions, we have raised our diluted EPS range for fiscal 2011 to $1.76 to $1.80, or $1.25 to $1.29 for the remaining three quarters of the year. We have very high year-over-year EPS growth in Q1, driven in large part by lower pre-opening, relocation and net interest expense. While the benefit of a lower net interest expense will continue, for the remainder of the year pre-opening and relocation expenses are expected to increase approximately $14 million to $17 million versus 2010. We expect a larger negative swing in LIFO of approximately $10 million to $11 million, and we expect to produce lower total sales growth on tough comparisons, which could make it difficult to leverage costs to the extent of which we did in the first quarter. In addition, while G&A is still expected to average 3% for the year, we expect costs to be higher in Q2 due mainly to increases in wages and investments in other initiatives. 
Our guidance represents a 23% to 26% year-over-year increase in EPS on an 11% to 13% increase in total sales growth, reflecting steady sales growth on tougher comparisons, as well as our commitment to delivering incremental operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth.
Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We have an expanded sense of our ultimate growth potential as our brand has continued to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. While it's difficult to put a number on how many stores we can eventually have, we consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of the market opportunity. There's plenty of runway left here in the United States. Canada and the United Kingdom also hold great promise. 
From a financial perspective, we are well positioned to reaccelerate our new store growth. Our new stores are performing well. Our strong top and bottom line performance, along with our capital expense discipline, has resulted in consistent cash flow, lower debt and a very healthy balance sheet. We have signed 23 new leases over the last 12 months and expect to open a greater number of new stores beginning in 2012.
We will now take your questions but we limit participants to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you."

So we could see a little bit of an effect, but my feeling at this point is that if the weather at this point kind of eases off a little bit, it will probably be a fairly minimal difference from this year to last year. If we have another month of weather like we just had, then I think it will have some impact on the quarter."

And then also just the fact that we had sales growth of 14% in Q1 and are expecting that to be maybe 9% and 12% in the remainder of the year, so those are the biggest items that make it more difficult for us to deliver the same degree of earnings growth in the back half of the year or the back three quarters of the year."

And certain prices go up considerably could cause a problem there. So we're really aware of that, and we're also -- that's why we're still working very hard on developing new products that we can bring in that are of better value to our customers. During the first quarter, we introduced a line of extreme value wines called Three Wishes that has done extremely well.

I'm going to add a little bit to A.C.'s comments, which is that, first of all, we are not -- we said before last year, we're going to continue to be a competitive retailer and we are not backing down. If anything, we're stepping more into that statement, we're committed to that and we have become a better retailer over the last couple of years with respect to managing those investments and the pricing, and we're going to continue down that road. So remember that we're a little less exposed to the pure commodity swings than other retailers because of the mix of our business, the higher percentage of organic and natural products. Some of those contractual arrangements are different than on this pure commodity market. But as A.C. said, we are going to continue to develop this value. I think it's pretty clear from the Nielsen studies and so forth that customers continue to want those choices. We're going to continue to offer them and develop them. And at the same time, we now have over 400 exclusive brands that we've developed, and we're continuing to develop our differentiation into our seafood standards and our meat standards. So if you were to think of us as running a retail symphony, so to speak, we're going to continue to play the bass note where the value is going to keep thumping. You're going to keep there in that bass note of the value, and we're bringing in the sweet strings of differentiation through these other areas. And it's that particular combination that's unique to us, which does give us some more pricing flexibility and power. At the same time we're maturing as a company, we're picking up stuff on the buy side that perhaps other more mature companies have picked up already through our distribution contracts, our movement to cost to serve, our buying disciplines that had brought us lots of gross margin on the buy side, so it's all playing into our ability to have some pricing power. But ultimately, I think we like our position in the marketplace even in a more inflationary environment, which we think is going to be more tempered. It's not going to be -- even though there are lots of noise out there about all that, there's typically a lag in the retails from the producer index. We've seen that historically. We think it's going to temper down, and we're certainly going to watch it, and we're going to be very careful about where we take those increases. But it does look like the marketplace is moving up incrementally and rationally so that will allow that to happen, and then we're going to have to manage it very carefully and watch for consumers' reaction to those price increases. I think everyone's going to do that in the months ahead."

And I think we're positioned to be the authentic source of information and product for those changes that are coming and then need to come. And it's a nice envelope, it's a big envelope, it's a broad envelope but it's generally moving in a way that makes a lot of sense, and customers are responding extremely well. So like certain things with vegetables, we're seeing ridiculous growth year-over-year as those things are presented with that sort of information. And I think we're moving far ahead of the others out there in the marketplace with their particular initiatives. This is very much more holistic and broader and deeper, and I think it's giving us a real leg up in the marketplace."

Whole Foods Market does not locate stores on the basis of income. That's just a myth out there. It's about education. It's about awareness. We have sites that do extremely well in areas that are not of high income. But it does require a certain level of consciousness, and that generally indicates better education and, of course, income correlates with education. But that is the bigger predictor of our success is not income but people's education levels. So if I can rephrase your question, are we going to be looking in areas that maybe are a little bit and don't have quite as high education levels? And it's a great question, and we don't really know the answer but we're going to find out. We are going to be opening some stores in areas that don't have quite the same density of college graduates that we've done previously, and they will probably be smaller stores. So we have tremendous opportunities. We've been kind of surprised. We have opened some stores in markets that have done a lot better than we thought they would do. It turns out that interestingly enough, in some of the markets where education and then income consequently are slightly less, they also tend to have less competition for our kind of products and our types of services provided. So the fact that we've done well in these markets has been very encouraging to us. And as a result, we're not going to get to our 1,000-store objective if we're not successful doing that but I think we will be. So the answer and a roundabout way to your question is, yes. We think we can and we will."

We're very proud of our results, which once again showed strong top and bottom line increases. On a 14%",1504,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We assume you have read our press release, and we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter. We're very proud of our results, which once again showed strong top and bottom line increases. On a 14% increase in sales, we produced: a 15% increase in gross profit; a 26% increase in EBITDA to $234 million; a 59% increase in earnings per share to $0.51; cash flow from operations of $253 million; and free cash flow of $162 million.  Our solid execution is generating consistent free cash flow which we are using to pay off debt, invest in new and existing stores and return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repaid $100 million of our term loan and invested $91 million in capital expenditures. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid another $200 million and paid $17 million to our shareholders after reinstating our dividend last December. 
The biggest news of the quarter is, despite increasingly tougher comparisons, we maintained our sales momentum and are reporting our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating ident [identical] store sales growth on both a one- and a two-year basis. Identical store sales increased 9.1%, our highest result in four years, and an acceleration of 518 basis points to 11.6% on a two-year stacked basis. Average weekly sales per store for all stores increased 9% to $621,000, translating to sales per square foot of approximately $856.
We believe our value efforts and differentiation are continuing to gain traction as evidenced by our strong 7% increase in transaction count in identical stores. A 2% increase in basket size was driven primarily by customers putting more items in their baskets, and while there was a lot of discussion about inflationary pressures on product costs, our average price per item showed only a slight increase year-over-year. This is a reversal from slight decreases we have been seeing. We attribute this net overall result to our strategic price investments offsetting the selected pass-through of some higher product costs. 
Our results underscored signs that consumer confidence continues to improve. Year-over-year, branded product sales growth outpaced our exclusive brand growth, and customers continued to shift towards organic products. We also saw an increase on the percentage of sales and transactions for baskets over $50.
Our identical store sales growth averaged 8.5% over the last four quarters and 8.6% for the first three weeks of Q2. With over a third of the year behind us, our idents have averaged 9% year-to-date. We are proud that we are continuing to gain market share at a much faster rate than most public food retailers and attribute a lot of our success to the progress we have made in our relative price positioning and to continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers. 
Just last week, we announced our deeper commitment to improve the lives of farm animals with the adoption of the 5-Step Animal Welfare Rating System. This is big news for our producers, for our shoppers and most importantly, for the farm animals. The rating system is the signature program of the new non-profit Global Animal Partnership and recognizes producers for their efforts improving the welfare of the animals. 
For our shoppers, the rating system offers a new level of transparency about the beef, pork and chicken that we sell. Some step-rated options are now available at all of our stores in the United States, and by May 9, all the beef, pork and chicken we carry in the fresh and pre-packaged cases will be rated. 
In other news, we were extremely pleased to be ranked number 24 on Fortune's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. To be one of only 13 companies ranked consecutively for 14 years validates our commitment to our core value of ""Supporting Team Member Happiness and Excellence."" For additional information about our new animal welfare rating system, Fortune ranking and more, please visit the newly expanded Investor Relations area of our website titled Beyond The Numbers. We plan to post supplemental information here each quarter to highlight our whole story, the whole story beyond just the financials. 
Turning now to new store growth. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Fairview, Texas; Huntington Beach, California and San Jose, California, and are pleased to announce today the signing of six new leases in Danbury, Connecticut, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts; Lynnfield, Massachusetts; Marlboro, New Jersey; San Antonio, Texas; and Ottawa, Canada. We are very excited about our growth opportunities in Canada, where we currently have six stores and another three now in development. Over the next 10 years, we believe our business in Canada has the potential to grow and expand to over $1 billion in sales.
I will now give some additional color on our raised outlook for fiscal year 2011. Please refer to the press release for more detailed information.
Based on the consistently strong top and bottom line results, along with ongoing signs of increasing consumer confidence, we have raised our sales and earnings outlook for the year. We have raised our outlook for identical sales growth in fiscal year 2011 to 7% to 9% from a previous range of 5% to 7%. As we have frequently said, we do not have a crystal ball when it comes to sales. We can only look at our historical performance and current trends and try to make reasonable assumptions. We have reported five consecutive quarters of accelerating two-year ident store sales growth, a trend that has continued thus far in the second quarter. For the first three weeks of the second quarter, identical store sales increased 8.6%, or 15% on a two-year basis.
To put our new identical store sales guidance for the year in context, the low end of the 7% reflects the slight deceleration in growth on a two-year basis to approximately 14% from the 15% two-year idents we produced in the first three weeks of Q2. The high end of the 9% assumes some continued acceleration in two-year idents to approximately 17%, albeit at a more moderate rate of around 200 basis points versus the 518 and 341 increases we saw in Q1 and Q day [ph] to date, respectively. We believe these ranges appropriately reflect that we have met to cycle over our toughest comparisons, while also allowing for the possibility that our 9% year-to-date identical store sales growth could be sustainable, especially given the likelihood of some positive impact from inflation. 
Based on our strong first quarter results and updated assumptions, we have raised our diluted EPS range for fiscal 2011 to $1.76 to $1.80, or $1.25 to $1.29 for the remaining three quarters of the year. We have very high year-over-year EPS growth in Q1, driven in large part by lower pre-opening, relocation and net interest expense. While the benefit of a lower net interest expense will continue, for the remainder of the year pre-opening and relocation expenses are expected to increase approximately $14 million to $17 million versus 2010. We expect a larger negative swing in LIFO of approximately $10 million to $11 million, and we expect to produce lower total sales growth on tough comparisons, which could make it difficult to leverage costs to the extent which we did in the first quarter. In addition, while G&A is still expected to average 3% for the year, we expect costs to be higher in Q2 due mainly to increases in wages and investments in other initiatives. 
Our guidance represents a 23% to 26% year-over-year increase in EPS on an 11% to 13% increase in total sales growth, reflecting steady sales growth on tougher comparisons, as well as our commitment to delivering incremental operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth.
Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We have an expanded sense of our ultimate growth potential as our brand has continued to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. While it's difficult to put a number on how many stores we can eventually have, we consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of the market opportunity. There's plenty of runway left here in the United States. Canada and the United Kingdom also hold great promise. 
From a financial perspective, we are well positioned to reaccelerate our new store growth. Our new stores are performing well. Our strong top and bottom line performance, along with our capital expense and discipline, has resulted in consistent cash flow, lower debt and a very healthy balance sheet. We have signed 23 new leases over the last 12 months and expect to open a greater number of new stores beginning in 2012.
We will now take your questions but we limit participants to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you."

And we think that we're getting a new customer in that wasn't shopping with us, maybe they shopped with us before, maybe not, we're not quite sure, because we see other products that we had doing well and then we see these new products selling really well in addition to that, so we think that we're still bringing in new customers that hadn't shopped with us before. As far as the weather goes, we have had a lot of fairly extreme weather over, let's say for the last month or so. But when we go back and look, we had some pretty significant weather events last year as well. So the usually these things even off with each other. We did have some disruptions due to some of these storms where stores had to close and distribution centers had a hard time getting product out. So we could see a little bit of an effect, but my feeling at this point is that if the weather at this point kind of eases off a little bit, it will probably be a fairly minimal difference from this year to last year. If we have another month of weather like we just had, then I think it will have some impact on the quarter."

I'm going to add a little bit to A.C.'s comments, which is that, first of all, we are not -- we said before last year, we're going to continue to be a competitive retailer and we are not backing down. If anything, we're stepping more into that statement, we're committed to that and we have become a better retailer over the last couple of years with respect to managing those investments and the pricing, and we're going to continue down that road. So remember that we're a little less exposed to the pure commodity swings than other retailers because of the mix of our business, the higher percentage of organic and natural products. Some of those contractual arrangements are different than on this pure commodity market. But as A.C. said, we are going to continue to develop this value. I think it's pretty clear from the Nielsen studies and so forth that customers continue to want those choices. We're going to continue to offer them and develop them. And at the same time, we now have over 400 exclusive brands that we've developed, and we're continuing to develop our differentiation into our seafood standards and our meat standards. So if you were to think of us as running a retail symphony, so to speak, we're going to continue to play the bass note where the value is going to keep thumping. You're going to keep hearing that bass note of the value, and we're bringing in the sweet strings of differentiation through these other areas. And it's that particular combination that's unique to us, which does give us some more pricing flexibility and power. At the same time we're maturing as a company, we're picking up stuff on the buy side that perhaps other more mature companies have picked up already through our distribution contracts, our movement to cost to serve, our buying disciplines that had brought us lots of gross margin on the buy side, so it's all playing into our ability to have some pricing power. But ultimately, I think we like our position in the marketplace even in a more inflationary environment, which we think is going to be more tempered. It's not going to be -- even though there are lots of noise out there about all that, there's typically a lag in the retails from the producer index. We've seen that historically. We think it's going to temper down, and we're certainly going to watch it, and we're going to be very careful about where we take those increases. But it does look like the marketplace is moving up incrementally and rationally so that will allow that to happen, and then we're going to have to manage it very carefully and watch for consumers' reaction to those price increases. I think everyone's going to do that in the months ahead."

And most of that comes in from store contribution percentage, although then there's a little bit from a lot of other things that play into it, although a slightly lower tax rate and pre-opening and interest and slightly higher LIFO and share count. But the majority of that is coming in store contribution percentage, and we don't really break that out between gross margin and direct store expenses. But if you just look at past trends, you can probably come to a reasonable estimate there. We did the first quarter to the same degree that it looks like if you look at the Street numbers, because we did beyond our own expectations both in sales and in bottom line slightly but not to the same degree that we did for the Street. So we're showing a pretty nice increase in store contribution percentage in the last three quarters compared to our prior guidance, and that reflects what we saw in the first quarter as well as our updated higher sales estimates for the rest of the year."

And we've got to work out the bugs of that business model but we're pretty excited about it. And assuming those prototypes, of course, do well, then we would look to be opening a lot more wellness clubs in 2012. That could potentially be a good growth initiative for our company. And in any case, we do think it's going to help educate customers about healthy eating. We're still convinced that Whole Foods Market has a big part of the solution to the healthcare crisis in America, which we see is primarily due to unhealthy lifestyles and diet. That the diseases, of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity and even cancer correlate very closely with poor lifestyle choices and eating patterns. And so we're taking upon ourselves to begin to educate people about how to change their lifestyles and how to eat in a more healthy way that will allow them to achieve their highest degree of health potential. So this is -- we've shifted in this direction but as Walter was telling me today, we're only in the first inning of this, and we've got a long way to go and a lot of opportunities.

Whole Foods Market does not locate stores on the basis of income. That's just a myth out there. It's about education. It's about awareness. We have sites that do extremely well in areas that are not of high income. But it does require a certain level of consciousness, and that generally indicates better education and, of course, income correlates with education. But that is the bigger predictor of our success is not income but people's education levels. So if I can rephrase your question, are we going to be looking in areas that maybe are a little bit and don't have quite as high education levels? And it's a great question, and we don't really know the answer but we're going to find out. We are going to be opening some stores in areas that don't have quite the same density of college graduates that we've done previously, and they will probably be smaller stores. So we think we have tremendous opportunities. We've been kind of surprised. We have opened some stores in markets that have done a lot better than we thought they would do. It turns out that interestingly enough, in some of the markets where education and then income consequently are slightly less, they also tend to have less competition for our kind of products and our types of services provided. So the fact that we've done well in these markets has been very encouraging to us. And as a result, we're not going to get to our 1,000-store objective if we're not successful doing that but I think we will be. So the answer and a roundabout way to your question is, yes. We think we can and we will."

We assume you've read our press release, so we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter and our updated guidance for the year. We're very proud of our results, with the strongest we have reported",1301,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We assume you've read our press release, so we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter and our updated guidance for the year. We're very proud of our results, with the strongest we have reported in the past five years. We produced average weekly sales per store of $644,000, translating to $888 in sales per square foot, 9.7% store contribution, 6% operating margin, 8.9% EBITDA margin, 29% increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.51 and a 38% net operating profit after tax return on invested capital for all stores. 
Our solid execution and capital discipline is generating consistent cash flow. Over the last four quarters, we have produced $645 million in cash flow from operations and received a $166 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. We've used our cash to invest $279 million in new and existing stores, pay off $700 million in long-term debt and return $35 million in two quarterly dividends to our shareholders. With our long-term debt now fully repaid, we are considering other uses for our growing cash balance, including increasing the investment in our new and existing stores, raising our dividend and repurchasing stock. 
While we're very proud of our results and healthy balance sheet, the biggest news of the quarter is that we were able to successfully comp the comp. Despite a 520 basis point tougher year ago comparison in Q2 compared to Q1, we are reporting our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating two-year identical store sales growth. Identical store sales increase 8.3% in the second quarter or 16% on a two-year stacked basis, excluding a negative 50 basis point impact from the Easter shift. 
We believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to gain traction as evidenced by the strong 6% increase in our transaction count and identical stores. We believe this slight decline from the 7% increase we saw in Q1 was due to the much tougher year-ago comparison. On a two-year basis, the increase in transaction count accelerated to 10.9% in Q2 from 9.7% in Q1. We did see some product cost increases in the quarter, which we were able to selectively pass-through at retail. This resulted in a 2% increase in our Q2 basket size, driven by increases in both the average price per item and to a lesser extent, items per basket. We have worked very hard over the last couple of years to successfully improve our price image, remain focused on maintaining our relative price positioning in the marketplace. 
Costs have definitely moved up so we are appropriately cautious about the back half of the year. We are hopeful that we can again strike the right balance between rising product cost and our retail based on our contracts, distribution and tools to manage value. We believe this is increasingly important to offer  a range of prices in each category to allow people to make choices and we are focused on continuing to develop new products that are of better value to our customers particularly in the commodity areas.
While we can't say how our customers may react going forward, our quarterly results underscored signs that consumer confidence continued to improve even as gas prices rose. Year-over-year, sales continue to shift to our branded an organic products. We also saw a shift to purchases to higher priced tiers, including shifts in several discretionary categories such as cheese, body care and gift sets. With 31 weeks now behind us, our identical store sales growth has averaged 8.6% year-to-date. We're proud that we are continuing to gain market share in a much faster rate than most public food retailers and attributed a lot of our success to the progress you made in a relative price positioning. And to continuing to reach the bar in areas that matter to our customer. For example, similar to the rating systems we have implemented in other category such as meat and seafood, we recently announced our new Ecoscale weighing system for household cleaning products. This comprehensive color-coded rating system will allow shoppers to easily identify our product's environment and safety based on our red, orange, yellow, green color scale. We have committed to working with our vendors to evaluate and independently audit every product in our cleaning category and all products will be required to meet the baseline orange standard by Earth Day 2012. 
Turning to new store growth, during the quarter, we opened two new stores in San Francisco, California and Raleigh, North Carolina and relocated one store in Salt Lake City, Utah. And the third quarter today, we have relocated our store in Rockville, Maryland, and we expect to open six additional new stores, including two more relocations over the remainder of the quarter. 
For additional information about our new Ecoscale rating system and videos from some of our new stores, please visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page. We will be posting supplemental information they are each quarter to highlight our whole story beyond just the financials. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised EPS outlook for fiscal year 2011. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. Based on our Q2 results, we raised our earnings outlook for the year. Our identical store sales growth guidance for the year implies a range of 7% to 9% growth for the second half of the year. We believe these ranges appropriately reflect that our comparisons get marginally tougher from here, while also allowing for the possibility that our 8.6% year-to-date idents can be stained, especially given the likelihood of some positive impact from higher inflation. We're very proud of our results this quarter, which in many respects are back to peak levels. 
Based on these results and our updated assumptions, we have raised our diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 to $1.87 to $1.90. This is a 31% to 33% year-over-year increase in earnings per share on a 12% to 13% increase in total sales, reflecting steady sales growth on tougher comparisons, as well as our commitment to delivering incremental operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth.  Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We look forward to accelerating our growth in the coming years.
There's plenty of runway left in the United States; in Canada the United Kingdom hold great promise. In fact, we're happy to report that our Paddington, London is now producing positive EBITDA. We consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity, as our brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increased and our flexibility in the new store size opens up additional market opportunities. 
Our new stores are performing well and we are positioned to internally fund the acceleration in our new store growth. Since our first quarter earnings release, we have signed nine new leases in Markham, Ontario, Fulham, England, Tampa, Florida, Des Moines, Iowa, Chicago, Illinois, Riverdale, Maryland, Wellington, North Carolina, Nassau, New Hampshire and Knoxville, Tennessee. We have now signed 30 new leases over the last 12 months and for the first time since 2007, our square footage and development has increased year-over-year. Over the last several quarter, we have been talking accelerating our new store openings and this is a very positive sign that we are on the way to seeing that acceleration materialize. We expect to update our new store opening schedule for 2012 and beyond next quarter.
We'll now take your questions, but we'll limit participants to one question at a time so that everyone can have an opportunity to participate. Our call will be ending at 4:45 Central Time. Thank you."

A lot of the increase you've seen has been primarily through leveraging our occupancy cost with these strong sales. And as long as sales continue, we think we can continue with our good leverage there. We always have to remember that in Q4, we traditionally see our sales, it's our slowest time of year. So that makes it a little more difficult. It's a delicate balance in gross margin for the rest of the year in a time like this, where we are seeing some increase in costs. We have been able to pass some of them through. There's predictions that we're going to see a more inflation in the year. We're not quite sure where the market place is going to react to that. We want to make sure that we maintain our position in the marketplace with good value. We've been working really hard at getting what we can on the buy side and through better distribution channels, especially our own internal distribution, becoming more efficient there. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can maintain our margin performance as we go forward.

Well, good questions and the first question is that we do think there's huge market opportunities for smaller stores. And we've done some experiments where they were really pleased with the results that we're getting. So I do think we're going to see. We've announced a number of smaller stores in the last few quarters and so that's where we are, we're on that program. And regarding your second question, we've always since we've had in our history a lot of small stores, we've dealt with that capacity issuing two ways. One is we've done a lot of relocations to the resource. We continue to do that on a store at kind of doing great volume and it sometimes sets up a discussion internally that we keep that smaller store there that's got tremendous returns on invested capital in a lot of cases over 100% a year. Or we're better off in order to preempt competitive history, go ahead and relocate to a bigger store, which gives us more of a competitive barrier. More often than not, we go ahead and relocate it. Because tends to think long-term and most of our decisions are geared in that direction other than just looking something as long as possible. The other strategy we do besides relocation is in some markets, a good example is say maybe in Los Angeles, Western Los Angeles where we'll group our source closer together because it's hard to find big store real estate in that market. So we've got more smaller stores, more densely located, in densely populated areas, more closely located together. We're doing some of that a little bit, maybe the DC markets, San Francisco is another one. Chicago, definitely Chicago, eventually Manhattan will see that there too.  So we're approaching growth with both of those strategies."

If you think about our earnings 5 years from now from this comp of stories like Des Moines, Iowa and other places that were talking about today that we've been able to enter a very favorable terms. And I think one other wrinkle on that is as we go into the real estate meeting we often talk about a market of one star market, two star market, three star market, we can size does store 1 store market we can sizable but right-sizing to do the business we think it can do might put another 3,000 to 5,000 square beyond them or then we just a little capacity if on the other hand we think of it  two  star market we may take the first or a little bit more conservative and get to second on that one of the ways we think that we have continued to mature and refine our real estate strategy as we've gotten older and wiser as John said.

But also as more competitive barriers, it may produce longer, higher returns over the long term than a smaller store. Smaller stores will produce higher returns because they'll max out and get very strong returns on invested capital quicker. But they're more competitively vulnerable. So they may have a shorter lifespan for producing those returns as well. Basically, our strategy has been and we're even putting great emphasis on it, is what's the right size store for particular market? Sometimes it's a smaller store, sometimes it's a medium size store it's a really big store. So that's when you get into real estate meeting and we've going over the stores we're always asking the question is this the right size store for this particular market? And a lot of our internal discussions and debates are around that question. Can we make this store 10,000 square feet bigger? This stores too bigger, we need to cut 7,000 square feet out of it. So we have if we gain more experience to our stores, our empirical database is getting more and more better developed and so we'll be making their decisions regarding right size stores for the right market."

We assume you've read our press release, so we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter and our updated guidance for the year. We're very proud of our results, with the strongest we have reported in the past five years. We produced average weekly sales per store of $644,000, translating to $888 in sales per square foot, 9.7% store contribution, 6% operating margin, 8.9% EBITDA margin, 29% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.51, and a 38% net operating profit after tax return on invested capital for all stores. 
Our solid execution and capital discipline is generating consistent cash flow. Over the last four quarters, we have produced $645 million in cash flow from operations, and received a $166 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. We've used our cash to invest $279 million in new and existing stores, pay off $700 million in long-term debt, and return $35 million in two quarterly dividends to our shareholders. With our long-term debt now fully repaid, we are considering other uses for our growing cash balance, including increasing the investment in our new and existing stores, raising our dividend and repurchasing stock. 
While we're very proud of our results and healthy balance sheet, the biggest news of the quarter is that we were able to successfully comp the comp. Despite a 520 basis point tougher year-ago comparison in Q2 compared to Q1, we are reporting our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating two-year identical store sales growth. Identical store sales increased 8.3% in the second quarter or 16% on a two-year stacked basis, excluding a negative 50 basis point impact from the Easter shift. 
We believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to gain traction as evidenced by the strong 6% increase in our transaction count and identical stores. We believe the slight decline from the 7% increase we saw in Q1 was due to the much tougher year-ago comparison. On a two-year basis, the increase in transaction count accelerated to 10.9% in Q2 from 9.7% in Q1. We did see some product cost increases in the quarter, which we were able to selectively pass-through at retail. This resulted in a 2% increase in our Q2 basket size, driven by increases in both the average price per item and to a lesser extent, items per basket. We have worked very hard over the last couple of years to successfully improve our price image, remained focused on maintaining our relative price positioning in the marketplace. 
Costs have definitely moved up, so we are appropriately cautious about the back half of the year. We are hopeful that we can again strike the right balance between rising product costs, and our retails based on our contracts, distribution and tools to manage value. We believe that it is increasingly important to offer a range of prices in each category to allow people to make choices, and we are focused on continuing to develop new products that are of better value to our customers, particularly in the commodity areas.
While we can't say how our customers may react, going forward, our quarterly results underscored signs that consumer confidence continued to improve, even as gas prices rose. Year-over-year, sales continue to shift toward branded and organic products. We also saw a shift in purchases to higher-priced tiers, including shifts in several discretionary categories such as cheese, body care and gift sets. 
With 31 weeks now behind us, our identical store sales growth has averaged 8.6% year-to-date. We're proud that we are continuing to gain market share in a much faster rate than most public food retailers, and attribute a lot of our success to the progress we have made in our relative price positioning, and to continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers. For example, similar to the rating systems we have implemented in other category such as meat and seafood, we recently announced our new Eco-Scale rating system for household cleaning products. This comprehensive color-coded rating system will allow shoppers to easily identify our product's environmental impact and safety based on a red, orange, yellow, green color scale. We have committed to working with our vendors to evaluate and independently audit every product in our cleaning category, and all products will be required to meet the baseline orange standard by Earth Day 2012. 
Turning to new store growth, during the quarter, we opened two new stores in San Francisco, California and Raleigh, North Carolina, and relocated one store in Salt Lake City, Utah. And the third quarter to date, we have relocated our store in Rockville, Maryland, and we expect to open six additional new stores, including two more relocations over the remainder of the quarter. 
For additional information about our new Eco-Scale rating system and videos from some of our new stores, please visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations webpage. We will be posting supplemental information there each quarter to highlight our whole story beyond just the financials. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised EPS outlook for fiscal year 2011. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. Based on our Q2 results, we raised our earnings outlook for the year. Our identical store sales growth guidance for the year implies a range of 7% to 9% growth for the second half of the year. We believe these ranges appropriately reflect that our comparisons get marginally tougher from here, while also allowing for the possibility that our 8.6% year-to-date idents could be sustained, especially given the likelihood of some positive impact from higher inflation. We're very proud of our results this quarter, which in many respects, are back to peak levels. 
Based on these results and our updated assumptions, we have raised our diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 to $1.87 to $1.90. This is a 31% to 33% year-over-year increase in earnings per share on a 12% to 13% increase in total sales, reflecting steady sales growth on tougher comparisons, as well as our commitment to delivering incremental operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth.  Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We look forward to accelerating our growth in the coming years.
There's plenty of runway left in the United States, and Canada and the United Kingdom hold great promise. In fact, we're happy to report that our Kensington in London is now producing positive EBITDA. We consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity. As our brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increased, and our flexibility on new store size opens up additional market opportunities. 
Our new stores are performing well, and we're positioned to internally fund the acceleration in our new store growth. Since our first quarter earnings release, we have signed nine new leases in Markham, Ontario; Fulham, England; Tampa, Florida; Des Moines, Iowa; Chicago, Illinois; Riverdale, Maryland; Wellington, North Carolina; Nassau, New Hampshire; and Knoxville, Tennessee. We have now signed 30 new leases over the last 12 months. And for the first time since 2007, our square footage and development has increased year-over-year. For the last several quarter, we have been talking accelerating our new store openings, and this is a very positive sign that we are on the way to seeing that acceleration materialize. We expect to update our new store opening schedule for 2012 and beyond next quarter.
We'll now take your questions, but we'll limit participants to one question at a time, so that everyone can has an opportunity to participate. Our call will be ending at 4:45 Central Time. Thank you."

A lot of the increase you've seen has been primarily through leveraging our occupancy cost with these strong sales. And as long as sales continue, we think we can continue with our good leverage there. Though we always have to remember that in Q4, we traditionally see our sales. It's our slowest time of year. So that makes it a little more difficult. It's a delicate balance with gross margin for the rest of the year. And in a time like this, where we are seeing some increase in costs, we are able -- we have been able to pass some of them through. There's predictions that we're going to see a more inflation in the year, and we're not quite sure where the market place is going to react to that. We want to make sure that we maintain our position in the marketplace, our good value. We've been working really hard at getting what we can on the buy side and through better distribution channels, especially our own internal distribution, becoming more efficient there. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can maintain our margin performance as we go forward. But there is some uncertainty based on not quite understanding how, what kind of inflation we're feeling in our costs and what we'll be able to pass through."

And every -- at the compares out there, I don't know about their tone, but you can read the reports, but they're all raising prices. And it looks to me like from 1% to 2% in the last quarter, pretty much across-the-board, and might be the odd one here. So I think every retailer realizing there's no way of dodging this, and they're going to have to get after and raise them in. And they have a greater exposure to commodities than we do as we've discussed in the past. So ours are lagging a bit. But I like our position. I like our ability to pass through. We'll do it in the context of the market. It seems to be pretty rational so far. We may get tested at the end of the year. But right now, that's where it is. But things that we're excited about on this end, I mean, again, we saw a nice lift in Easter on our perishable programs. They continue to lead the way for us, and staying very strong. We think the quality of our perishables continues to improve, and as we continue to build differentiated standards, particularly in our meat and our seafood, and we're working on produce. I think we're setting a higher bar. Health Starts Here, all the healthy eating initiatives are just in the first inning as we've talked about, catching on prior. And we are going to continue to pound on value, and it's worked. It's continuing to work. They're our Nielsen buzz study that we do every three quarters has shown that our positive notes on value is up 12% last quarter, and the negatives were down 1%. I think that's one of the reasons our customers are staying in place, and continuing to shop with us, because they feel good about the values that we're offering. So I think it's a combination of all those things, but we're pretty excited over here. A.C.'s got some color."

And we've done some experiments, where they were really pleased with the results that we're getting. So I do think we're going to see -- we've announced a number of smaller stores in the last few quarters, and so we are -- we're on that program. And regarding your second question, I mean, we've always, since we've had in our history, a lot of small stores, we've dealt with that capacity issue in two ways. One is we've done a lot of relocations to bigger stores, and we continue to do that when a store just kind of doing great volume, and it sometimes sets up a discussion internally that we just keep that smaller store there that's got tremendous returns on invested capital. In a lot of cases, over 100% a year, or are we better off in order to preempt the competitive industry, to go ahead and relocate it to a bigger store, which gives us more competitive barrier. More often than not, we go ahead and relocate it. Because we -- our company tends to think long-term, and most of our decisions are geared in that direction other than just milking something as long as possible. The other strategy we do besides relocation is in some markets, a good example is, say, maybe in Los Angeles, Western Los Angeles, where we'll group our stores closer together, because it's hard to find big store real estate in that market. So we've got more smaller stores, more densely located, in densely populated areas, more closely located together. So we're doing some of that a little bit, and maybe the D.C. [Washington D.C.] markets, San Francisco is another one. Chicago, definitely Chicago, eventually, Manhattan we'll see that there too. So we're approaching it and relative to those -- with both of those strategies."

We see potential pretty much across the map besides U.K. and Canada. But you mentioned about profitability and when we go into some of these newer market areas, they're smaller market areas or mid-market areas, the thing is we're kind of -- we're leaving that, and sort of the economics of those areas are very favorable, and you combine that with our ability to build it for less, and our kind of our refinement of the business model in terms of cost, and you have a very nice result. And you have result that's going to produce well for many years. If you think about our earnings 5 years from now, it's going to come from this crop of stores like Des Moines, Iowa, and sort of the other places that we're talking about today that we've been able to enter in very favorable terms. And I think one other wrinkle on that, as we go into the real estate meeting, we often talk about a market and say, ""Is this a one-star market, a two-star market, a three-star market. We can size the store appropriately. If we think it's ultimately a one-star market, we can size it up a little bit, right size it to do the business we think it can do. We might put another 3,000 to 5,000 square feet on them, more than we -- just to give a little capacity. If on the other hand, we think it's a two-star market, we may take the first store a little bit more conservatively, and leave our room to come back and do the second. So that's one of the ways, I think, that we have continued to mature and refine our real estate strategy as we've gotten older and wiser as John said. And so A.C. was going to add on that as well."

Well, smaller stores will produce higher returns, because they'll max out and get very strong returns on invested capital quicker. But they're more competitively vulnerable. And so they may have a shorter lifespan for producing those returns as well. Basically, our strategy has been -- and we're even putting great emphasis on it, is what's the right size store for a particular market? And sometimes, it's a smaller store, and sometimes, it's a medium-sized store and sometimes, it's a really big store. So that's -- when you get into real estate meeting and we're going over these stores, we're always asking the question, is this the right-size store for this particular market? And a lot of our internal discussions and debates are around that question. Can we make this store 10,000 square feet bigger? This stores is too big. We need to cut 7,000 square feet out of it. So it's -- we have a -- if we gain more experience, and open our stores, our empirical database is getting more and more better developed, and so we'll be able to make better decisions regarding right-size stores for the right market."

Probably, I thought, maybe in sort of the 250 range, and maybe a little bit lower, 240 range, and I don't see any reason that needs to go back up. Even if we accelerate the growth, our processes should be improved to where we were able to do that, and still hold costs in a reasonable level."

We assume you've read our press release, so we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter and our updated guidance for the year. We're very proud of our results, with the strongest we have reported",1300,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We assume you've read our press release, so we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter and our updated guidance for the year. We're very proud of our results, with the strongest we have reported in the past five years. We produced average weekly sales per store of $644,000, translating to $888 in sales per square foot, 9.7% store contribution, 6% operating margin, 8.9% EBITDA margin, 29% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.51, and a 38% net operating profit after tax return on invested capital for all stores. 
Our solid execution and capital discipline is generating consistent cash flow. Over the last four quarters, we have produced $645 million in cash flow from operations, and received a $166 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. We've used our cash to invest $279 million in new and existing stores, pay off $700 million in long-term debt, and return $35 million in two quarterly dividends to our shareholders. With our long-term debt now fully repaid, we are considering other uses for our growing cash balance, including increasing the investment in our new and existing stores, raising our dividend and repurchasing stock. 
While we're very proud of our results and healthy balance sheet, the biggest news of the quarter is that we were able to successfully comp the comp. Despite a 520 basis point tougher year-ago comparison in Q2 compared to Q1, we are reporting our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating two-year identical store sales growth. Identical store sales increased 8.3% in the second quarter or 16% on a two-year stacked basis, excluding a negative 50 basis point impact from the Easter shift. 
We believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to gain traction as evidenced by the strong 6% increase in our transaction count and identical stores. We believe the slight decline from the 7% increase we saw in Q1 was due to the much tougher year-ago comparison. On a two-year basis, the increase in transaction count accelerated to 10.9% in Q2 from 9.7% in Q1. We did see some product cost increases in the quarter, which we were able to selectively pass-through at retail. This resulted in a 2% increase in our Q2 basket size, driven by increases in both the average price per item and to a lesser extent, items per basket. We have worked very hard over the last couple of years to successfully improve our price image, remained focused on maintaining our relative price positioning in the marketplace. 
Costs have definitely moved up, so we are appropriately cautious about the back half of the year. We are hopeful that we can again strike the right balance between rising product costs, and our retails based on our contracts, distribution and tools to manage value. We believe that it is increasingly important to offer a range of prices in each category to allow people to make choices, and we are focused on continuing to develop new products that are of better value to our customers, particularly in the commodity areas.
While we can't say how our customers may react going forward, our quarterly results underscore signs that consumer confidence continued to improve, even as gas prices rose. Year-over-year, sales continue to shift toward branded and organic products. We also saw a shift in purchases to higher-priced tiers, including shifts in several discretionary categories such as cheese, body care and gift sets. 
With 31 weeks now behind us, our identical store sales growth has averaged 8.6% year-to-date. We're proud that we are continuing to gain market share in a much faster rate than most public food retailers, and attribute a lot of our success to the progress we have made in our relative price positioning, and to continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers. For example, similar to the rating systems we have implemented in other categories such as meat and seafood, we recently announced our new Eco-Scale rating system for household cleaning products. This comprehensive color-coded rating system will allow shoppers to easily identify a product's environmental impact and safety based on a red, orange, yellow, green color scale. We have committed to working with our vendors to evaluate and independently audit every product in our cleaning category, and all products will be required to meet the baseline orange standard by Earth Day 2012. 
Turning to new store growth, during the quarter, we opened two new stores in San Francisco, California and Raleigh, North Carolina, and relocated one store in Salt Lake City, Utah. In the third quarter to date, we have relocated our store in Rockville, Maryland, and we expect to open six additional new stores, including two more relocations over the remainder of the quarter. 
For additional information about our new Eco-Scale rating system and videos from some of our new stores, please visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations webpage. We will be posting supplemental information there each quarter to highlight our whole story beyond just the financials. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised EPS outlook for fiscal year 2011. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. Based on our Q2 results, we raised our earnings outlook for the year. Our identical store sales growth guidance for the year implies a range of 7% to 9% growth for the second half of the year. We believe these ranges appropriately reflect that our comparisons get marginally tougher from here, while also allowing for the possibility that our 8.6% year-to-date idents could be sustained, especially given the likelihood of some positive impact from higher inflation. We're very proud of our results this quarter, which in many respects, are back to peak levels. 
Based on these results and our updated assumptions, we have raised our diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 to $1.87 to $1.90. This is a 31% to 33% year-over-year increase in earnings per share on a 12% to 13% increase in total sales, reflecting steady sales growth on tougher comparisons, as well as our commitment to delivering incremental operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth.  Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We look forward to accelerating our growth in the coming years.
There's plenty of runway left in the United States, and Canada and the United Kingdom hold great promise. In fact, we're happy to report that our Kensington store in London is now producing positive EBITDA. We consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity. As our brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and our flexibility on new store size opens up additional market opportunities. 
Our new stores are performing well, and we're positioned to internally fund the acceleration in our new store growth. Since our first quarter earnings release, we have signed nine new leases in Markham, Ontario; Fulham, England; Tampa, Florida; Des Moines, Iowa; Chicago, Illinois; Riverdale, Maryland; Wilmington, North Carolina; Nassau, New Hampshire; and Knoxville, Tennessee. We have now signed 30 new leases over the last 12 months. And for the first time since 2007, our square footage and development has increased year-over-year. For the last several quarters, we have been talking accelerating our new store openings, and this is a very positive sign that we are on the way to seeing that acceleration materialize. We expect to update our new store opening schedule for 2012 and beyond next quarter.
We'll now take your questions, but we'll limit participants to one question at a time, so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will be ending at 4:45 Central Time. Thank you."

A lot of the increase you've seen has been primarily through leveraging our occupancy costs with these strong sales. And as long as sales continue, we think we can continue with our good leverage there. Though we always have to remember that in Q4, we traditionally see our sales--it's our slowest time of year. So that makes it a little more difficult. It's a delicate balance with gross margin for the rest of the year. And in a time like this, where we are seeing some increase in costs, we are able -- we have been able to pass some of them through. There's predictions that we're going to see more inflation in the year, and we're not quite sure how the market place is going to react to that. We want to make sure that we maintain our position in the marketplace, our good value. We've been working really hard at getting what we can on the buy side and through better distribution channels, especially our own internal distribution, becoming more efficient there. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can maintain our margin performance as we go forward. But there is some uncertainty based on not quite understanding how, what kind of inflation we're feeling [ph]  in our costs and what we'll be able to pass through."

We will give you probably definitive numbers towards for 2012 at the time. I think it can pretty much be locked in at that point. So we have to wait another quarter for you to see the results on that one. Regarding the growth paradox, it's still always there, but what's a little different now is that our base of stores is so great that we have to accelerate our growth rate considerably. Remember, five, six, seven years ago, we were growing our square footage growth of a 15% cliff, and now we're at 5%, 6%, even if we get it up to 7% or 8%. That is not going to have as big an impact on us for new stores. It used to have, simply because the percentage of new stores to the overall base of new stores is lessened to how it used to be. So the growth paradox, it's still there, only I don't think we're going to feel it too much even as we accelerate the pipeline, because I don't think we're going to accelerate it so much that we'll see it really kick in."

And I mean, as long as the cost -- as long as these interest rates remain so low, it's accretive almost to do almost anything in terms of share repurchases at almost virtually any price. I'm not saying, therefore, that we'll be repurchasing stock at any price, but all of these will look good. And I suspect Whole Foods will be trying to utilize all three strategies. Also, I might add, we'll probably want to pile up some cash. The company does not want to get into a situation that it had back in 2008 ever again, where we feel like we have to go back to the market, and we sold equity at unfavorable terms. And we don't ever want to do that again. So a fourth use of cash is to hold some more cash than we used to hold.

So I think every retailer realizing there's no way of dodging this, and they're going to have to get out there and raise them in. And they have a greater exposure to commodities than we do as we've discussed in the past. So ours are lagging a bit. But I like our position. I like our ability to pass through. We'll do it in the context of the marketplace. It seems to be pretty rational so far. We may get tested on it at the end of the year. But right now, that's where it is. But things that we're excited about on this end, I mean, again, we saw a nice lift in Easter on our perishable programs. They continued to lead the way for us, and staying very strong. We think the quality of our perishables continues to improve, and as we continue to build differentiated standards, particularly in our meat and our seafood, and we're working on produce. I think we're setting a higher bar. Health Starts Here, all the healthy eating initiatives are just in the first inning as we've talked about, catching on fire. And we are going to continue to pound on value, and it's worked. It's continuing to work. That our Nielsen buzz study that we do every three quarters has shown that our positive notes on value is up 12% last quarter, and the negatives were down 1%. I think that's one of the reasons our customers are staying in place, and continuing to shop with us, because they feel good about the values that we're offering.

And regarding your second question, I mean, we've always, since we've had in our history a lot of small stores, we've dealt with that capacity issue in two ways. One is we've done a lot of relocations to bigger stores, and we continue to do that when a store is just kind of doing great volume, and it sometimes sets up a discussion internally that we just keep that smaller store there that's got tremendous returns on invested capital. In a lot of cases, over 100% a year, or are we better off in order to preempt the competitive industry, to go ahead and relocate it to a bigger store, which gives us more of a competitive barrier. More often than not, we go ahead and relocate it. Because we -- our company tends to think long-term, and most of our decisions are geared in that direction other than just milking something as long as possible. The other strategy we do besides relocation is, in some markets, a good example is, say, maybe in Los Angeles, Western Los Angeles, where we'll group our stores closer together, because it's hard to find big store real estate in that market. So we've got more smaller stores, more densely located--in densely populated areas, more closely located together. So we're doing some of that a little bit, in maybe the D.C. [Washington D.C.] market, San Francisco is another one. Chicago, definitely Chicago, eventually, Manhattan, we'll see that there too.

And I think one other wrinkle on that, as we go into the real estate meeting, we often talk about a market and say, ""Is this a one-star market, a two-star market, a three-star market?"". We can size the store appropriately. If we think it's ultimately only a one-star market, we can size it up a little bit, right size it to do the business we think it can do. We might put another 3,000 to 5,000 square feet on them, more than we -- just to give a little capacity. If on the other hand, we think it's a two-star market, we may take the first store a little more conservatively, and leave our room to come back and do the second. So that's one of the ways, I think, that we have continued to mature and refine our real estate strategy as we've gotten older and wiser as John said. And so A.C. was going to add on that as well."

But it also has more competitive barriers. It may produce some longer, higher returns over the long term than a smaller store. Well, smaller stores will produce higher returns, because they'll max out and get very strong returns on invested capital quicker. But they're more competitively vulnerable. And so they may have a shorter lifespan for producing those returns as well. Basically, our strategy has been -- and we're even putting great emphasis on it, is what's the right size store for a particular market? And sometimes, it's a smaller store, and sometimes, it's a medium-sized store and sometimes, it's a really big store. So that's -- when you get into our real estate meeting and we're going over these stores, we're always asking the question, ""Is this the right-size store for this particular market?""  And a lot of our internal discussions and debates are around that question. ""Can we make this store 10,000 square feet bigger? This stores is too big. We need to cut 7,000 square feet out of it"". So it's -- we have a -- if we gain more experience, and open more stores, our empirical database is getting more and more better developed, and so we'll be able to make better decisions regarding right-size store for the right market."

So there is further to go, but it's probably more incremental in nature. Probably, I thought, maybe in sort of the 250 range, and maybe a little bit lower, 240 range, and I don't see any reason that needs to go back up.

We assume you've read our press release, so we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter and our updated guidance for the year. We're very proud of our results, with the strongest we have reported",1300,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. We assume you've read our press release, so we'll use this time to focus on highlights from the quarter and our updated guidance for the year. We're very proud of our results, with the strongest we have reported in the past five years. We produced average weekly sales per store of $644,000, translating to $888 in sales per square foot, 9.7% store contribution, 6% operating margin, 8.9% EBITDA margin, 29% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.51, and a 38% net operating profit after tax return on invested capital for all stores. 
Our solid execution and capital discipline is generating consistent cash flow. Over the last four quarters, we have produced $645 million in cash flow from operations, and received a $166 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. We've used our cash to invest $279 million in new and existing stores, pay off $700 million in long-term debt, and return $35 million in two quarterly dividends to our shareholders. With our long-term debt now fully repaid, we are considering other uses for our growing cash balance, including increasing the investment in our new and existing stores, raising our dividend and repurchasing stock. 
While we're very proud of our results and healthy balance sheet, the biggest news of the quarter is that we were able to successfully comp the comp. Despite a 520 basis point tougher year-ago comparison in Q2 compared to Q1, we are reporting our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating two-year identical store sales growth. Identical store sales increased 8.3% in the second quarter or 16% on a two-year stacked basis, excluding a negative 50 basis point impact from the Easter shift. 
We believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to gain traction as evidenced by the strong 6% increase in our transaction count and identical stores. We believe the slight decline from the 7% increase we saw in Q1 was due to the much tougher year-ago comparison. On a two-year basis, the increase in transaction count accelerated to 10.9% in Q2 from 9.7% in Q1. We did see some product cost increases in the quarter, which we were able to selectively pass-through at retail. This resulted in a 2% increase in our Q2 basket size, driven by increases in both the average price per item and to a lesser extent, items per basket. We have worked very hard over the last couple of years to successfully improve our price image, remained focused on maintaining our relative price positioning in the marketplace. 
Costs have definitely moved up, so we are appropriately cautious about the back half of the year. We are hopeful that we can again strike the right balance between rising product costs, and our retails based on our contracts, distribution and tools to manage value. We believe that it is increasingly important to offer a range of prices in each category to allow people to make choices, and we are focused on continuing to develop new products that are of better value to our customers, particularly in the commodity areas.
While we can't say how our customers may react going forward, our quarterly results underscore signs that consumer confidence continued to improve, even as gas prices rose. Year-over-year, sales continue to shift toward branded and organic products. We also saw a shift in purchases to higher-priced tiers, including shifts in several discretionary categories such as cheese, body care and gift sets. 
With 31 weeks now behind us, our identical store sales growth has averaged 8.6% year-to-date. We're proud that we are continuing to gain market share in a much faster rate than most public food retailers, and attribute a lot of our success to the progress we have made in our relative price positioning, and to continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers. For example, similar to the rating systems we have implemented in other categories such as meat and seafood, we recently announced our new Eco-Scale rating system for household cleaning products. This comprehensive color-coded rating system will allow shoppers to easily identify a product's environmental impact and safety based on a red, orange, yellow, green color scale. We have committed to working with our vendors to evaluate and independently audit every product in our cleaning category, and all products will be required to meet the baseline orange standard by Earth Day 2012. 
Turning to new store growth, during the quarter, we opened two new stores in San Francisco, California and Raleigh, North Carolina, and relocated one store in Salt Lake City, Utah. In the third quarter to date, we have relocated our store in Rockville, Maryland, and we expect to open six additional new stores, including two more relocations over the remainder of the quarter. 
For additional information about our new Eco-Scale rating system and videos from some of our new stores, please visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations webpage. We will be posting supplemental information there each quarter to highlight our whole story beyond just the financials. 
I will now give some additional color on our raised EPS outlook for fiscal year 2011. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information. Based on our Q2 results, we raised our earnings outlook for the year. Our identical store sales growth guidance for the year implies a range of 7% to 9% growth for the second half of the year. We believe these ranges appropriately reflect that our comparisons get marginally tougher from here, while also allowing for the possibility that our 8.6% year-to-date idents could be sustained, especially given the likelihood of some positive impact from higher inflation. We're very proud of our results this quarter, which in many respects, are back to peak levels. 
Based on these results and our updated assumptions, we have raised our diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 to $1.87 to $1.90. This is a 31% to 33% year-over-year increase in earnings per share on a 12% to 13% increase in total sales, reflecting steady sales growth on tougher comparisons, as well as our commitment to delivering incremental operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth.  Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We look forward to accelerating our growth in the coming years.
There's plenty of runway left in the United States, and Canada and the United Kingdom hold great promise. In fact, we're happy to report that our Kensington store in London is now producing positive EBITDA. We consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity. As our brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and our flexibility on new store size opens up additional market opportunities. 
Our new stores are performing well, and we're positioned to internally fund the acceleration in our new store growth. Since our first quarter earnings release, we have signed nine new leases in Markham, Ontario; Fulham, England; Tampa, Florida; Des Moines, Iowa; Chicago, Illinois; Riverdale, Maryland; Wilmington, North Carolina; Nassau, New Hampshire; and Knoxville, Tennessee. We have now signed 30 new leases over the last 12 months. And for the first time since 2007, our square footage and development has increased year-over-year. For the last several quarters, we have been talking accelerating our new store openings, and this is a very positive sign that we are on the way to seeing that acceleration materialize. We expect to update our new store opening schedule for 2012 and beyond next quarter.
We'll now take your questions, but we'll limit participants to one question at a time, so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will be ending at 4:45 Central Time. Thank you."

A lot of the increase you've seen has been primarily through leveraging our occupancy costs with these strong sales. And as long as sales continue, we think we can continue with our good leverage there. Though we always have to remember that in Q4, we traditionally see our sales--it's our slowest time of year. So that makes it a little more difficult. It's a delicate balance with gross margin for the rest of the year. And in a time like this, where we are seeing some increase in costs, we are able -- we have been able to pass some of them through. There's predictions that we're going to see more inflation in the year, and we're not quite sure how the market place is going to react to that. We want to make sure that we maintain our position in the marketplace, our good value. We've been working really hard at getting what we can on the buy side and through better distribution channels, especially our own internal distribution, becoming more efficient there.

And diving into our -- diving into the numbers on a couple of levels, one in the basket, doing the quintile analysis, we've seen that, that customers' holding steady in the $10 basket, $20, $30, $40 basket, and even in the $50 basket, we're seeing actually nice growth year-over-year, suggesting that our core consumer continues to hold and stay with us and grow. And that's being led too by the perishables, which is a very positive sign for us. So I don't know if I have exactly answered your question, but maybe that shed some color on it."

Remember, five, six, seven years ago, we were growing our square footage growth of a 15% cliff, and now we're at 5%, 6%, even if we get it up to 7% or 8%. That is not going to have as big an impact on us for new stores. It used to have, simply because the percentage of new stores to the overall base of new stores is lessened to how it used to be.

I'm not saying, therefore, that we'll be repurchasing stock at any price, but all of these will look good. And I suspect Whole Foods will be trying to utilize all three strategies. Also, I might add, we'll probably want to pile up some cash. The company does not want to get into a situation that it had back in 2008 ever again, where we feel like we have to go back to the market, and we sold equity at unfavorable terms.

But things that we're excited about on this end, I mean, again, we saw a nice lift in Easter on our perishable programs. They continued to lead the way for us, and staying very strong. We think the quality of our perishables continues to improve, and as we continue to build differentiated standards, particularly in our meat and our seafood, and we're working on produce. I think we're setting a higher bar. Health Starts Here, all the healthy eating initiatives are just in the first inning as we've talked about, catching on fire. And we are going to continue to pound on value, and it's worked. It's continuing to work. That our Nielsen buzz study that we do every three quarters has shown that our positive notes on value is up 12% last quarter, and the negatives were down 1%. I think that's one of the reasons our customers are staying in place, and continuing to shop with us, because they feel good about the values that we're offering.

Well, good questions and the first question is, is that we do think there's huge market opportunities for smaller stores. And we've done some experiments, where they were really pleased with the results that we're getting. So I do think we're going to see -- we've announced a number of smaller stores in the last few quarters, and so we are -- we're on that program. And regarding your second question, I mean, we've always, since we've had in our history a lot of small stores, we've dealt with that capacity issue in two ways. One is we've done a lot of relocations to bigger stores, and we continue to do that when a store is just kind of doing great volume, and it sometimes sets up a discussion internally that we just keep that smaller store there that's got tremendous returns on invested capital. In a lot of cases, over 100% a year, or are we better off in order to preempt the competitive industry, to go ahead and relocate it to a bigger store, which gives us more of a competitive barrier. More often than not, we go ahead and relocate it. Because we -- our company tends to think long-term, and most of our decisions are geared in that direction other than just milking something as long as possible. The other strategy we do besides relocation is, in some markets, a good example is, say, maybe in Los Angeles, Western Los Angeles, where we'll group our stores closer together, because it's hard to find big store real estate in that market. So we've got more smaller stores, more densely located--in densely populated areas, more closely located together. So we're doing some of that a little bit, in maybe the D.C. [Washington D.C.] market, San Francisco is another one. Chicago, definitely Chicago, eventually, Manhattan, we'll see that there too. So we're approaching it with both of those -- with both of those strategies."

But I want to add first of all, I want to tell you that to get to our 1,000 store goal, we're going to continue to move in urban areas, as well as suburban, or green field areas as well to get -- and we think there's lots -- we looked at this, we had charted it out. We see potential pretty much across the map besides U.K. and Canada. But you mentioned about profitability and when we go into some of these newer market areas, they're smaller market areas or mid-market areas, the thing is we're kind of -- we're leaving that, and sort of the economics of those areas are very favorable, and you combine that with our ability to build it for less, and our kind of our refinement of the business model in terms of cost, and you have a very nice result. And you have a result that's going to produce well for many years. If you think about our earnings 5 years from now, it's going to come from this crop of stores like Des Moines, Iowa, and sort of the other places that we're talking about today that we've been able to enter in very favorable terms. And I think one other wrinkle on that, as we go into the real estate meeting, we often talk about a market and say, ""Is this a one-star market, a two-star market, a three-star market?"". We can size the store appropriately. If we think it's ultimately only a one-star market, we can size it up a little bit, right size it to do the business we think it can do. We might put another 3,000 to 5,000 square feet on them, more than we -- just to give a little capacity. If on the other hand, we think it's a two-star market, we may take the first store a little more conservatively, and leave our room to come back and do the second. So that's one of the ways, I think, that we have continued to mature and refine our real estate strategy as we've gotten older and wiser as John said. And so A.C. was going to add on that as well."

But it also has more competitive barriers. It may produce some longer, higher returns over the long term than a smaller store. Well, smaller stores will produce higher returns, because they'll max out and get very strong returns on invested capital quicker. But they're more competitively vulnerable. And so they may have a shorter lifespan for producing those returns as well. Basically, our strategy has been -- and we're even putting great emphasis on it, is what's the right size store for a particular market? And sometimes, it's a smaller store, and sometimes, it's a medium-sized store and sometimes, it's a really big store. So that's -- when you get into our real estate meeting and we're going over these stores, we're always asking the question, ""Is this the right-size store for this particular market?"" And a lot of our internal discussions and debates are around that question. ""Can we make this store 10,000 square feet bigger? This stores is too big. We need to cut 7,000 square feet out of it"". So it's -- we have a -- if we gain more experience, and open more stores, our empirical database is getting more and more better developed, and so we'll be able to make better decisions regarding right-size store for the right market."

Are very proud that he would either quarter results which were once again near peak levels. We produced 8.4% comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales per store of $653,000 translating to $996 of sales per square foot, 9.5% store contribution, 5.9% operating margin, which we're proud to say is our ninth consecutive quarter of year to year operating margin improvement, 8.6% EBITDA margin, a 30% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.50 and 38% of NOPAT ROIC for all stores. 
Our solid execution, combined with our capital discipline, is generating strong, consistent cash flow. Over the last 4 quarters, we have produced $720 million in cash flow from operations and received $214 million of proceeds from stock option exercises. We have used our cash to invest $329 million in new and existing stores, pay off the remaining $490 million of our term loan, and to date, returned $53 million of quarterly dividends to our shareholders. 
We are pleased to be in a position where we can maintain a healthy cash balance and still have the capacity to internally fund our accelerated growth plans, increase our dividend and repurchase stock. We expect we will be using all 3 of these strategies over time. 
Turning to sales, we're very pleased to be reporting 8.4% comps or 7.8% excluding the positive impact of the Easter shift. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of comp growth of 7.8% or higher. We believe our efforts are on value continue to be a significant contributor to our momentum, helping drive a 5% increase in our transaction counts. We have worked very hard over the last couple of years to successfully improve our price image, particularly in perishables, and we remain focused on maintaining our relative price positioning in the marketplace. 
With the return of inflation, we are seeing our comp breakout move towards our historical pattern of 60% transaction count and 40% basket size. In Q3, our basket size increased 3% slightly higher than the 2% increase in Q2. This is driven entirely by a higher average price per item as we selectively pass through some product price increases and customers continue trading up. 
Year-over-year, sales continued to shift toward branded and organic products, higher-priced tiers and to several discretionary categories. We also saw strong increases in the $50 plus sized baskets. We're hopefully we'll continue to strike the right balance between rising product cost in our retails based on our contracts, our distribution network and our tools to manage value. We anticipate incremental increases in inflation in Q4, but our pricing studies show that our competitors have been passing through product cost increases, and we don't have any reason to believe that's going to change.
Our comparable store sales increased 8.5% year-to-date through Q3 and 9.5% for the first 3 weeks of Q4. We are proud that we are continuing to gain market share at a faster rate than most public food retailers and attribute much of our success to our visible value efforts, which have been positively impacted our price image and continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers, particularly quality standards and health and wellness. For example, we recently announced our new Whole Kids Foundation, a charitable organization that will provide children with access to healthy food choices through partnerships with schools, educators and organizations. We believe our new foundation is a natural extension of our role as America's Healthiest Grocery Store and hope that through collaborating with schools and parents, we can increase fruit and vegetable consumption, both at schools and at home and make a significant contribution in the fight against childhood obesity.  The Foundation's first major initiative is the Whole Kids Garden Route Project, a program designed for schools to help build healthy relationships between children and food through the power of gardening. 
Turning to new store growth, during the quarter, we opened 4 new stores in Lafayette California, Encinitas, California, Fairfield, Connecticut and Houston, Texas, as well as relocated 3 stores in Rockville, Maryland, Franklin, Tennessee and Charlottesville, Virginia. In the fourth quarter to date, we opened 1 new store actually today in Marietta, Georgia, temporary relocated our store in Upper Arlington, Ohio, and we expect to open 3 new additional stores, including 1 relocation over the remainder of the fiscal year.
We'd encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about newest Houston Texas store, our Whole Kids Foundation, our Wellness Club website and more including the Whole Foods Parking Lot rap.
I will now give you some additional color on our updated outlook for fiscal year 2011 and the initial outlook for 2012. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information.  Based on our Q3 results, recent comp trends and updated assumptions for Q4, we have raised our diluted EPS range for fiscal 2011 to $1.91 to $1.92, which implies a range of $0.40 to $0.41 in diluted EPS for Q4. Please note that our fourth quarter, seasonally our weakest quarter of the year in terms of average weekly sales and store contribution. 
For fiscal 2012, which is a 53-week year, our initial outlook is for diluted EPS of $2.21 to $2.26, a year-over-year increase of 16% to 18% on the 13% to 15% total sales growth. On a 52 week to 52 week basis, this translates the diluted EPS growth of 13% to 15%, and total sales growth of 11% to 13%. 
Since our second quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases averaging 30,000 square feet in size in Tucson, Arizona, Fremont, California, Newport Beach, California, Desalt, Colorado, Detroit, Michigan, Columbia, South Carolina, Virginia Beach, Virginia and Chilton, United Kingdom. We have signed 30 new leases is over the last 12 months and believe we are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal '12 and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013.
As reflected in our outlook, even though we are projecting to open a record number of new stores, we are not expecting a meaningful impact on our earnings growth from this acceleration of new store openings. While new stores produced lower store contribution in mature stores, we estimate new stores will account for only 5% of our total sales in fiscal 2012, and thus should not have a material negative impact on our results. In addition, our new stores are performing well. On average, they are smaller, less expensive to build and are expected to achieve higher returns on invested capital than the larger stores we opened in the recent past. 
From a cash and infrastructure perspective are well-positioned to internally fund and execute acceleration in our new store growth. Our fiscal 2012 guidance reflects strong comparable store sales growth, a record number of new store openings, EBITDA approaching $1 billion, significant operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth. We are very pleased to be producing consistently strong results that are in line with our stork operating ranges and expect the lessons we learned during the Great Recession will drive even higher levels of both operating performance and returns on invested capital over time. 
Our business has been highly successful, producing industry leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We see a new era of possibility for Whole Foods Market as customers increasingly embrace healthier lifestyles and we look forward to accelerating our growth in the coming years. 
Over the longer-term we consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity in the United States. Our brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural organic products continues to increase, America's health-care crisis is creating a new frontier for health and wellness and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. We believe Canada and the U.K. hold great promise as well. 
We will now take your questions. Please limit your questions to 1 at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will be ending today at 4:45 Central Time. Thanks so much."

But generally, even in up times or bad times or just average times, we sort of seen strong same store sales growth.

When we acquired Wild Oats of the we had to go through the lengthy process to make that acquisition and that acted as a drag because the stores had far less favorable operating metrics when we first acquired them. Now we brought those stores way up, as we promised that we would. We're saying -- in fact on average we doubled the sales of the Wild Oats store since we acquired them 4 years ago. So that should give you an indication of how much we increased productivity in those source. Secondly, we saw the economy collapsed and our sales collapsed right along with it. That brought down our operating metrics. But our costs are now for a couple of years consult below integrated self in some ways, we're returning or have returned to near the top of the range we're producing. But I don't think we'll necessarily stop there. A single continue assuming same-store sales of you to increase, we expect to see Wild Oats continue to improve. We're opening again new stores, we're having higher productivity numbers than we used to in the past, and we're continuing to with the strong same sales growth we expect our operating margins to continue to improve. So we're hopeful we can do better than we've done historically in the past, although we're not promising that. We're certainly shooting for that internally."

Good afternoon, everybody. We are very proud of the consistency of our third quarter results, which were once again near peak levels. We produced 8.4% comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales per store of $653,000, translating",1372,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everybody. We are very proud of the consistency of our third quarter results, which were once again near peak levels. We produced 8.4% comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales per store of $653,000, translating to $896 of sales per square foot, 9.5% store contribution, 5.9% operating margin, which we're proud to say is our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement, 8.6% EBITDA margin, a 30% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.50, and 38% NOPAT ROIC for all stores.  
Our solid execution, combined with our capital discipline, is generating strong, consistent cash flow. Over the last 4 quarters, we have produced $720 million in cash flow from operations and received $214 million of proceeds from stock option exercises. We have used our cash to invest $329 million in new and existing stores, pay off the remaining $490 million of our term loan, and to date, returned $53 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. 
We are pleased to be in a position where we can maintain a healthy cash balance and still have the capacity to internally fund our accelerated growth plans, increase our dividend and repurchase stock. We expect we will be using all 3 of these strategies over time. 
Turning to sales, we're very pleased to be reporting 8.4% comps or 7.8% excluding the positive impact of the Easter shift. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of comp growth of 7.8% or higher. We believe our efforts around value continue to be a significant contributor to our momentum, helping drive a 5% increase in our transaction counts. We have worked very hard over the last couple of years to successfully improve our price image, particularly in perishables, and we remain focused on maintaining our relative price positioning in the marketplace. 
With the return of inflation, we are seeing our comp breakout move towards our historical pattern of 60% transaction count and 40% basket size. In Q3, our basket size increased 3%, slightly higher than the 2% increase in Q2. This is driven entirely by an entire -- higher average price per item as we selectively passed through some product cost increases and customers continue trading up. 
Year over year, sales continued to shift toward branded and organic products, higher-priced tiers and to several discretionary categories. We also saw strong increases in the $50-plus sized baskets. We're hopeful we can continue to strike the right balance between rising product costs and our retails based on our contracts, our distribution network and our tools to manage value. We anticipate incremental increases in inflation in Q4, but our pricing studies show that our competitors have been passing through product cost increases, and we don't have any reason to believe that's going to change.
Our comparable store sales increased 8.5% year-to-date through Q3, and 9.5% for the first 3 weeks of Q4. We are proud that we are continuing to gain market share at a faster rate than most public food retailers, and attribute much of our success to our visible value efforts, which have positively impacted our price image and then continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers, particularly quality standards and health and wellness. For example, we recently announced our new Whole Kids Foundation, a charitable organization that will provide children with access to healthy food choices through partnerships with schools, educators and organizations. We believe our new foundation is a natural extension of our role as America's Healthiest Grocery Store, and hope that through collaborating with schools and parents, we can increase fruit and vegetable consumption, both at schools and at home, and make a significant contribution in the fight against childhood obesity.  The Foundation's first major initiative is the Whole Kids Garden Grant Project, a program designed for schools to help build healthy relationships between children and food through the power of gardening. 
Turning to new store growth, during the quarter, we opened 4 new stores in Lafayette, California; Encinitas, California; Fairfield, Connecticut and Houston, Texas. As well as relocated 3 stores in Rockville, Maryland; Franklin, Tennessee and Charlottesville, Virginia. In the fourth quarter to date, we have opened one new store, actually today, in Marietta, Georgia, temporarily relocated our store in Upper Arlington, Ohio, and we expect to open 3 new additional stores, including one relocation over the remainder of the fiscal year.
We'd encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our newest Houston, Texas store, our Whole Kids Foundation, our Wellness Club website and more, including the now infamous Whole Foods Parking Lot rap.
I will now give you some additional color on our updated outlook for fiscal year 2011 and the initial outlook for 2012. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information.  Based on our Q3 results, recent comp trends and updated assumptions for Q4, we have raised our diluted EPS range for fiscal 2011 to $1.91 to $1.92, which implies a range of $0.40 to $0.41 in diluted EPS for Q4. Please note that our fourth quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year in terms of average weekly sales and store contribution. 
For fiscal 2012, which is a 53-week year, our initial outlook is for diluted EPS of $2.21 to $2.26, a year-over-year increase of 16% to 18% on the 13% to 15% total sales growth. On a 52-week to a 52-week basis, this translates the diluted EPS growth of 13% to 15%, and total sales growth of 11% to 13%. 
Since our second quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases, averaging 30,000 square feet in size in Tucson, Arizona; Fremont, California; Newport Beach, California; Basalt, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Columbia, South Carolina; Virginia Beach, Virginia and Cheltenham, United Kingdom. We have now signed 31 new leases over the last 12 months, and believe we are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal '12 and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013.
As reflected in our outlook, even though we are projecting to open a record number of new stores, we are not expecting a meaningful impact on our earnings growth from this acceleration of new store openings. While new stores produce lower store contribution than mature stores, we estimate new stores will account for only 5% of our total sales in fiscal 2012, and thus, should not have a material negative impact on our results. In addition, our new stores are performing well. On average, they are smaller, less expensive to build and are expected to achieve higher returns on invested capital than the larger stores we opened in the recent past. 
From a cash and infrastructure perspective, we are well positioned to internally fund and execute the acceleration in our new store growth. Our fiscal 2012 guidance reflects strong comparable store sales growth, a record number of new store openings, EBITDA approaching $1 billion, significant operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth. We are very pleased to be producing consistently strong results that are in line with our historical operating ranges and expect the lessons we learned during the great recession will drive even higher levels of both operating performance and returns on invested capital over time. 
Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We see a new era of possibility for Whole Foods Market as customers increasingly embrace healthier lifestyles. And we look forward to accelerating our growth in the coming years. 
Over the longer-term, we consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity in the United States. Our brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural organic products continues to increase, America's healthcare crisis is creating a new frontier for health and wellness, and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. We believe Canada and the U.K. hold great promise as well. 
We will now take your questions. Please limit your questions to one at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will be ending today at 4:45 Central Time. Thanks so much."

So both of those things are showing up pretty strongly in the research that we're doing. With respect to year inflation, look, it's incremental, it's manageable, everything I see is that -- and from all the other reports that the elasticity is there to continue to pass on as long as it stays incremental and manageable.

In the medium term, it's neutral because it starts to catch up. In the long term, it's bad because it's -- once inflationary expectations get built-in, you don't have a stable environment anymore when you go in and negotiate rents or your wages are constantly in flux. And the uncertainties that is there affects both of your employees and your customers. So -- but in the short run, it feels kind of good.

We see branded product actually outpacing -- the greater growth in branded product actually outpacing private-label growth, which as you remember during the downturn, that thing got 3:1 on the grocery. It was kind of a proxy for value. We see the branded products growing nicely right now. We see people making incremental trade-ups from sort of $3 to $4, $4 to $5, 5$ to $6. We've seen that in several areas like they might trade a private label shampoo for a branded shampoo or a cheese, and we've seen that in several areas across. And we also see in this -- we're doing the quintile, we're breaking our basket, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. And we saw, obviously as we mentioned in the script, the greatest growth in the $50-plus basket. That grew both in dollars and units. But we didn't see any degradation in the other baskets either. So it's kind of this -- it's a new time with a new set of things happening here that we haven't seen before. And that basket is definitely result of both of those."

Good afternoon, everybody. We are very proud of the consistency of our third quarter results, which were once again near peak levels. We produced 8.4% comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales per store of $653,000, translating",1370,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everybody. We are very proud of the consistency of our third quarter results, which were once again near peak levels. We produced 8.4% comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales per store of $653,000, translating to $896 of sales per square foot, 9.5% store contribution, 5.9% operating margin, which we're proud to say is our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement, 8.6% EBITDA margin, a 30% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.50 and 38% NOPAT ROIC for all stores.  
Our solid execution, combined with our capital discipline, is generating strong, consistent cash flow. Over the last 4 quarters, we have produced $720 million in cash flow from operations and received $214 million of proceeds from stock option exercises. We have used our cash to invest $329 million in new and existing stores, pay off the remaining $490 million of our term loan, and to date, return $53 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. 
We are pleased to be in a position where we can maintain a healthy cash balance and still have the capacity to internally fund our accelerated growth plans, increase our dividend and repurchase stock. We expect we will be using all 3 of these strategies over time. 
Turning to sales.  We're very pleased to be reporting 8.4% comps or 7.8% excluding the positive impact of the Easter shift. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of comp growth of 7.8% or higher. We believe our efforts around value continue to be a significant contributor to our momentum, helping drive a 5% increase in our transaction counts. We have worked very hard over the last couple of years to successfully improve our price image, particularly in perishables, and we remain focused on maintaining our relative price positioning in the marketplace. 
With the return of inflation, we are seeing our comp breakout move towards our historical pattern of 60% transaction count and 40% basket size. In Q3, our basket size increased 3%, slightly higher than the 2% increase in Q2. This is driven entirely by an entire -- higher average price per item as we selectively passed through some product cost increases and customers continue trading up. 
Year-over-year sales continued to shift toward branded and organic products, higher-priced tiers and to several discretionary categories. We also saw strong increases in the $50-plus sized baskets. We're hopeful we can continue to strike the right balance between rising product costs in our retails based on our contracts, our distribution network and our tools to manage value. We anticipate incremental increases in inflation in Q4, but our pricing studies show that our competitors have been passing through product cost increases, and we don't have any reason to believe that's going to change.
Our comparable store sales increased 8.5% year-to-date through Q3, and 9.5% for the first 3 weeks of Q4. We are proud that we are continuing to gain market share at a faster rate than most public food retailers, and attribute much of our success to our visible value efforts, which have positively impacted our price image and then continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers, particularly quality standards and health and wellness. 
For example, we recently announced our new Whole Kids Foundation, a charitable organization that will provide children with access to healthy food choices through partnerships with schools, educators and organizations. We believe our new foundation is a natural extension of our role as America's Healthiest Grocery Store, and hope that through collaborating with schools and parents, we can increase fruit and vegetable consumption, both at schools and at home, and make a significant contribution in the fight against childhood obesity.  The Foundation's first major initiative is the Whole Kids Garden Grant Project, a program designed for schools to help build healthy relationships between children and food through the power of gardening. 
Turning to new store growth. During the quarter, we opened 4 new stores in Lafayette, California; Encinitas, California; Fairfield, Connecticut and Houston, Texas. As well as relocated 3 stores in Rockville, Maryland; Franklin, Tennessee and Charlottesville, Virginia. In the fourth quarter to date, we have opened one new store, actually today, in Marietta, Georgia, temporarily relocated our store in Upper Arlington, Ohio, and we expect to open 3 new additional stores, including one relocation over the remainder of the fiscal year.
We'd encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our newest Houston, Texas, store, our Whole Kids Foundation, our Wellness Club website and more, including the now infamous Whole Foods Parking Lot rap.
I will now give you some additional color on our updated outlook for fiscal year 2011 and the initial outlook for 2012. Please refer to our press release for more detailed information.  Based on our Q3 results, recent comp trends and updated assumptions for Q4, we have raised our diluted EPS range for fiscal 2011 to $1.91 to $1.92, which implies a range of $0.40 to $0.41 in diluted EPS for Q4. Please note that our fourth quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year in terms of average weekly sales and store contribution. 
For fiscal 2012, which is a 53-week year, our initial outlook is for diluted EPS of $2.21 to $2.26, a year-over-year increase of 16% to 18% on the 13% to 15% total sales growth. On a 52-week to  52-week basis, this translates to diluted EPS growth of 13% to 15%, and total sales growth of 11% to 13%. 
Since our second quarter earnings release, we have signed 8 new leases, averaging 30,000 square feet in size, in Tucson, Arizona; Fremont, California; Newport Beach, California; Basalt, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Columbia, South Carolina; Virginia Beach, Virginia and Cheltenham, United Kingdom. We have now signed 31 new leases over the last 12 months, and believe we are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal '12 and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013.
As reflected in our outlook, even though we are projecting to open a record number of new stores, we are not expecting a meaningful impact on our earnings growth from this acceleration of new store openings. While new stores produce lower store contribution than mature stores, we estimate new stores will account for only 5% of our total sales in fiscal 2012, and thus should not have a material negative impact on our results. In addition, our new stores are performing well. On average, they are smaller, less expensive to build and are expected to achieve higher returns on invested capital than the larger stores we opened in the recent past. 
From a cash and infrastructure perspective, we are well positioned to internally fund and execute the acceleration in our new store growth. Our fiscal 2012 guidance reflects strong comparable store sales growth, a record number of new store openings, EBITDA approaching $1 billion, significant operating margin improvement and earnings growth in excess of sales growth. We are very pleased to be producing consistently strong results that are in line with our historical operating ranges and expect the lessons we learned during the Great Recession will drive even higher levels of both operating performance and returns on invested capital over time. 
Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We see a new era of possibility for Whole Foods Market as customers increasingly embrace healthier lifestyles. And we look forward to accelerating our growth in the coming years. 
Over the longer term, we consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity in the United States. Our brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural organic products continues to increase, America's healthcare crisis is creating a new frontier for health and wellness, and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. We believe Canada and the U.K. hold great promise as well. 
We will now take your questions. Please limit your questions to one at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will be ending today at 4:45 Central Time. Thanks so much."

And I also might indicate that wages tend to be a lagger as well. So a little bit of inflation, initially, is probably good for a retailer. In the medium term, it's neutral because the stuff starts to catch up. In the long term, it's bad because it's -- once inflationary expectations get built in, you don't have a stable environment anymore when you go in and negotiate rents or your wages are constantly in flux. And the uncertainty that is there affects both your employees and your customers. So -- but in the short run, it feels kind of good.

And at a time when healthcare costs have been higher, people are realizing that this is a way they can move forward in the healthy lifestyle and -- I think all of those things have combined to give us a nice bit of what feels like on this and a whole new generation of momentum for what we're doing so..."

In the United States, it's 4,000 stores without having to add additional distribution centers. So there's tremendous leverage that we can realize through distribution alone. And as our purchasing continues to increase on the buy side, there's tremendous -- part of the -- probably the biggest reason our gross margins are stronger is even though we've been more competitive on our pricing, we've been able to pass through on the buy side a lot of the savings our scale is giving us. And that's resulted in better prices for our customers as well as higher gross margins for our investors. And we think that, again, we think we're in the early innings of that. As we continue to grow and to accelerate our growth, we think there's going to be continued scale that we're going to gain and we're going to probably do the same thing.

We are very proud of the consistency of our third quarter results which were once again near peak levels.

We are very proud of the consistency of our third quarter results which were once again near peak levels. We produced 8.4% comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales per store of $653,000 translated into $896 of sales per square foot. 9.5% store contribution, 5.9% operating margin which we are proud to say is our ninth consequent quarter of the year-over-year operating margin improvement. 8.6% EBITDA margin and 30% increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.50 and 38% NOPAT ROIC for all stores.
Our solid execution combined with our capital discipline is generating strong consistent cash flow. Over the last four quarters we have produced 720 million in cash flow from operations and received 214 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. We have used our cash to invest 329 million in new and existing stores. Payoff the remaining 490 million of our term loan and to-date return $53 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders.
We are pleased to be in a position where we can maintain a healthy cash balance and still have the capacity to internally fund our accelerated growth plans, increase our dividend and repurchase stock. We expect we will be using all three of these strategies overtime.
Turning to sales, we are very pleased to be reporting 8.4% comps or 7.8% excluding the positive impact of the Easter shift. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of comp growth of 7.8% or higher, we believe our efforts around value continue to be a significant contributor to our momentum helping drive a 5% increase in our transaction counts. We worked very hard over the last couple of years to successfully improve our price image, particularly in perishables and we remain focused on maintaining our relative price positioning in the marketplace.
With the return of inflation we are seeing our comp breakout move towards our historical pattern of 60% transaction count and 40% basket size. In Q3, our basket size increased 3% slightly higher than the 2% increase in Q2. This is driven entirely by higher average price per item as we selectively pass through some product cost increases and customers continue trading up. 
Year-over-year sales continue to shift toward branded and organic products, higher priced tiers and to several discretionary categories. We also saw strong increases in the $50 plus size baskets. We are hopeful we can continue to strike the right balance between rising product costs in our retails based on our distribution network and our tools to manage value. We anticipate incremental increases in inflation in Q4, but our pricing study show that our competitors have been passing through product cost increases and we don’t have any reason to believe that’s going to change.
Our comparable store sales increased 8.5% year-to-date through Q3 and 9.5% for the first three weeks of Q4. We are proud that we are continuing to gain market share at a faster rate than most public retailers and attribute much of our success to our visible value efforts which could positively impacted our price image and then continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers particularly quality standards and health and wellness. 
For example, we recently announced our new Whole Kids Foundation, a charitable organization that will provide children with access to healthy food choices through partnerships with schools, educators and organizations. We believe our new foundation is a natural extension of our role as America’s healthiest grocery store and hope that through collaborating with schools and parents, we can increase food and vegetable consumption both at schools and at home and make a significant contribution in the fight against childhood obesity. The foundation is first major initiative is the Whole Kids Garden Grant Project, a program designed for schools to help build healthy relationships between children and food for the power of gardening. 
Turning to new store growth. During the quarter we opened four new stores in Lafayette, California, Encinitas, California, Fairfield, Connecticut and Houston, Texas. As well as relocated three stores in Rockville, Maryland, Franklin, Tennessee, and Charlottesville, Virginia. In the fourth quarter to-date we have opened one new stores actually today in Marietta, Georgia, temporarily relocated our store in upper Arlington Ohio, and we expect to open three new additional stores including one relocation over the remainder of the fiscal year. We would encourage you to visit the Beyond the Number section of our Investor Relations webpage for more information about newest a Houston, Texas store, our Whole Kids Foundation, our wellness club website and more including the now infamous Whole Foods Parking Lot Wrap. 
I will now give you some additional color on our updated outlook for fiscal year 2011 and the initial outlook for 2012. 
Please refer to our press release for more detailed information.
Based on our Q3 results, recent comp trends and updated assumptions for Q4, we have raised our diluted EPS range for fiscal 2011 to $1.91 to $1.92, which implies a range of $0.40 to $0.41 in diluted EPS for Q4. Please note that our fourth quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year in terms of average weekly sales and store contribution.
For fiscal 2012, which is a 53-week year, our initial outlook is for diluted EPS of $2.21 to $2.26, a year-over-year increase of 16 to 18% on 13 to 15% total sales growth. On a 52-week to 52-week basis, this translates to diluted EPS growth of 13 to 15% and total sales growth of 11 to 13%.
Since our second quarter earnings release, we have signed eight new leases averaging 30,000 square feet in size in Tucson, Arizona; Fremont, California; Newport Beach, California ; Basalt, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Columbia, South Carolina; Virginia Beach, Virginia and Cheltenham, United Kingdom. We have now signed 31 new leases over the last 12 months and believe we are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal ‘12 and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013.
As reflected in our outlook, even though we are projecting to open a record number of new stores, we are not expecting a meaningful impact on our earnings growth from this acceleration in new store openings. While new stores produce lower store contribution than mature stores, we estimate new stores will account for only 5% of our total sales in fiscal 2012 and thus should not have a material negative impact on our results. In addition, our new stores are performing well. On average, they are smaller, less expensive to build, and are expected to achieve higher returns on invested capital than the larger stores we opened in the recent past.
From a cash and infrastructure perspective, we are well positioned to internally fund and execute the acceleration in our new store growth. Our fiscal 2012 guidance reflects strong comparable store sales growth, a record number of new store openings, EBITDA approaching $1 billion, significant operating margin improvement, and earnings growth in excess of sales growth. We are very pleased to be producing consistently strong results that are in line with our historical operating ranges and expect the lessons we learned during the great recession will drive even higher levels of both operating performance and returns on invested capital over time.
Our business has been highly successful, producing industry-leading comparable store sales growth, average weekly sales and sales per square foot. We see a new era of possibility for Whole Foods Market as customers increasingly embrace healthier lifestyles, and we look forward to accelerating our growth in the coming years. Over the longer term, we consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity in the United States. Our brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, America’s healthcare crisis is creating a new frontier for health and wellness, and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. We believe Canada and the UK hold great promise as well.
We will now take your questions. Please limit your questions to one at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will be ending today at 4:45 Central Time. Thank you so much.

We got it to our historical high and the two things happened, one we acquired Wild Oats although we have to go through a lengthy process to make that acquisition. And that acted as a drag because those stores have far or less favorable operating metrics when first acquired them. Now we brought those stores way up as we promised that we would. We are seeing in fact, on average we doubled the sales of the Wild Oats stores since we acquired them four years ago. So, that should give you an indication of how much we have increased the productivity of those stores. Secondly, we saw the economy collapsed and our sales collapsed quite along with it. That down our operating metrics, but our comps have been strong now for a couple of years and Wild Oats has been well integrated. SO, in some ways we are returning or have returned to near the top of the range. But I don’t think we necessarily will stop there. I think we will continue to assuming our same-store sales continue to increase. We expect to see Wild Oats continue to improve, we are opening again new stores or having higher productivity numbers than they used to in the past. And we are continuing to with the strong same sales growth we expect our operating margins to continue to improve.

That’s how we have become so successful and that’s what’s driven our growth. But what we are getting much better right now is we are getting better at being more efficient. We are becoming a more efficient retailer. And as Walter said we are kind of in the early innings on that. I think that’s Whole Foods market assuming we don’t therefore, dilute our service levels or the store experience for our customer. We have got a lot of efficiency gains ahead of us and I think that’s going to help drive direct store expenses down as a percentage and increase the operating margins. So, that’s I think the good news is that we still got a long way to go before we are generating Walmart type efficiencies in our company. We will probably never generate Walmart type efficiencies but we still got a lot of progress and improvement we can realize over the next several years that will benefit our shareholders.

The cost of build additionally the cost per square foot, you start watching this cost to actually build the stores coming down, it's come down from 15 million and so 10 million range now. It's huge progress and when you put capital upfront to get a nice store experience you return it's going to continue to grow. If we have more progress we can make in that area as well. So, that’s a long winded answer, but hopefully you got to feel for our enthusiasm for that topic.

I'm very proud to end what has already been a great year on such a high note. In the fourth quarter, we produced 8.7% comparable store sales growth; average weekly sales per store of $630,000, translating to $86",1298,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very proud to end what has already been a great year on such a high note. In the fourth quarter, we produced 8.7% comparable store sales growth; average weekly sales per store of $630,000, translating to $863 in sales per square foot; 8.7% store contribution and our seasonally softest quarter of the year; 5% operating margin and our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement; 7.9% EBITDA margin; a 26% increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.42; and 36% NOPAT ROIC for all stores. 
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $1 billion of cash during the year through a combination of $755 million in cash flow from operations and $297 million in proceeds from Team Member stock option exercises. We invested $365 million in new and existing stores, paid off the remaining $490 million of our term loan and returned $53 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and increased our total cash and investments during the year by $154 million to $799 million. 
Today, we announced a 40% increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.14 per share and a $200 million share repurchase program. We are well positioned to internally fund our accelerated new store growth, maintain a healthy cash balance, increase our dividend and seek additional value creation for our shareholders through selective share repurchases. 
Turning to sales. We're excited to be reporting 8.7% comparable store sales growth, our seventh consecutive quarter of COPS of 7.8% or higher. We believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to be significant contributor to our momentum, helping drive a 5% increase in our transaction counts during the quarter. 
The basket size increased 4%, once again driven entirely by higher average price per item as we selectively pass through product cost increases and as customers traded up. As we have been reporting throughout the year, on a year-over-year basis, our customers have shifted their buying toward branded and organic products, higher-priced tiers to several discretionary categories. 
We also continue to see strong increases in $50-plus size baskets. As demonstrated by our healthy sales and gross margin, we have successfully balanced rising product costs and maintained our relative value positioning. We are hopeful, however, that as many are forecasting, inflation peaked in Q4 and will moderate in Q1. 
In the face of increasingly tougher comparisons, we are pleased that we maintained a 17% 2-year ID for Q4 for the first 5 weeks of the first quarter. We are not aware of any public food retailer putting up these kinds of numbers. We attribute much of our market share gains for our well-executed value efforts, which have positively impacted our price image while continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers, particularly our quality standards, health and wellness. 
To update you on one of our wellness initiatives, we have now opened 4 in-store wellness clubs in Chicago, Oakland, New York City, Denton, Massachusetts. The Wellness Club offerings include nutrition courses, culinary classes, supper clubs, coaching and support, wellness assessment tool and access to benefits from a growing local network of community businesses. 
Members also received a 10% discount on thousands of designated healthy foods when they shop at our stores with Wellness Clubs. We are learning and evolving with each club we open and have one more pilot scheduled in Princeton, New Jersey in January. While still very early, we're pleased with the initial results we are seeing. We hope customers will continue to embrace the concept and that we can expand our offering to more customers in the future. 
Turning to new store growth. During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Marietta, Georgia; Mississauga, Canada; Washington D.C. and relocated 2 stores in Holliston, Massachusetts and Upper Arlington, Ohio, resulting in a total of 18 new stores for the year. 
Our new store results showed strong year-over-year improvements in both operating performance and NOPAT return on invested capital in the fourth quarter. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 11% smaller in size, averaging 40,000 square fleet and produced average weekly sales per store of $565,000, translating to 23% higher sales per square foot to $747. These new stores produced over 400 basis points higher store contribution and 325 basis points higher NOPAT ROIC as a percentage of sales versus last year's class. I encourage you to visit Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations webpage for more information about our Wellness Clubs, videos from our newest stores and more. 
Since our third quarter earnings release, we have signed 9 new leases averaging 32,000 square feet in size in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, Davis, California; Littleton, Colorado; Tallahassee, Florida; Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mattison and Katie, Texas; and London, England. We have signed 32 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal 2012 and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013. 
From a cash and infrastructure perspective, we remain well positioned to internally fund and execute this acceleration in our new store growth. Given our Q4 results, we're in line with our expectations, and we are just 5 weeks into fiscal year 2012. We are maintaining our outlook, which reflects consistent comparable store sales growth, a record number of new store openings, EBITDA of close to $1 billion, a significant operating margin improvement. We do not expect a meaningful impact on our earnings growth from our acceleration in new store openings as we estimate new stores will account for only 5% of our total sales. 
As I mentioned earlier, fiscal 2011 has been a great year. Our sales topped $10 billion, total sales growth is now accelerating. We improved operating margin 55 basis points to 5.4%, substantially exceeded our initial EPS guidance to $1.59 to $1.64, growing EPS 35% year-over-year to $1.93. We opened 18 new stores that are off to excellent starts and signed 32 new leases, including 2 in Canada and 3 in the U.K. We created close to 6,000 new jobs, Team Member morale is very high. 
While our relative value positioning remains a top priority, we continue to raise the bar with our 5-Step Animal Welfare Rating, the eco scale rating systems, in addition to launching our Whole Kids Foundation and Wellness Clubs. Our pleasurable store experience, outstanding service, high-quality standards and differentiated product mix have been the primary drivers of our growth and success. We are committed to maintaining our unique positioning in these areas, now have the benefit of our more visible value efforts to gain additional customers. 
We're also in early innings of becoming a more efficient retailer and have a lot of improvement opportunities ahead of us that should help drive higher levels of operating performance and returns on invested capital over time. We consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity in the United States. People are increasingly embracing healthier lifestyles as life-threatening diseases are on the rise and healthcare costs are high and going higher. 
As America's Healthiest Grocery Store, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this major demographic evolution. We are not yet saturated in any major metro area, and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. 
In addition, through acquisitions and our own store development, we have learned that select secondary markets are ready and waiting for Whole Foods Market to come. 
Looking beyond the United States, we believe Canada, the United Kingdom hold great promise as well. We will now take your questions. Please limit your questions to one at a time so everyone has an opportunity to participate. The call will end at 4:45 central time. Thank you. Operator?"

We sort of moderated in produce a little bit, some packaged goods which we had contracts on and held the price on for most of the year. As the contracts expired, we had to take some price increases there. So I don't think we saw any surprises. We definitely are very sensitive to where customers start to react to certain pricing, and we have noticed that in a few areas, particularly in meat and in dairy, we've realized that we've got to be really careful, probably have come up against as far as we'd want to push those at this point, hoping that inflation in those areas really moderate because we don't feel like we want to push those very much farther."

I was in Oklahoma City yesterday and toured our store for a couple of hours. And it's a 35,000 square-foot store, and the store is doing amazingly high volume. Sales per square foot are phenomenal. And interesting thing about going into some of these slightly smaller markets is that in some sense, there's less competition. There's less differentiation in the marketplace, and so Whole Foods stands out more than it does in some of the other larger markets. So we're so excited because as we've entered in these -- when we think of the secondary markets, our stores have performed at very high levels both in -- I mean, rents are lower, labor costs are lower and yet we performed at very high levels so the stores are very profitable for us. I really do think this is going to be a strong vehicle for growth for us for the next several years. And I'm not sure how far it can go but obviously, if we're going to get 1,000 store goal, the secondary and tertiary markets are going to be very important.

We know that the coastal regions, East Coast, West Coast are going to have more expensive development costs than the Southwest or the Midwest. So it kind of depends on upon which stores get opened up. We just hate for the investment community to read too much into it. But I do want to reiterate that the company is very dedicated. Our management's very dedicated to taking unnecessary costs on our development process, and we think we're doing a pretty good job of doing so. Stores are less glitzy, and we're getting -- we're cutting out things that we don't believe really add value to our customers. And ideally, all things being equal, we'd like to see that trend line go down, adjusted for inflation. We don't want to guide for it because, as I mentioned, it's so complex and we don't want the market investment community to think we're not doing a good job if costs go up because we opened some expensive stores in the U.K. on a per square foot basis, which is what we're going to end up doing in 2012. We think they really think people should focus on is the return on invested capital. The ROIC is really important, and some projects will cost more money on a per square foot basis but they might have superior ROIC. A great example of that when we opened our relocated or our Lincoln Park store, very expensive project, didn't look good on a cost per square foot to develop it. But the store's been an amazing performer and has outperformed our expectations. So anyway, that's kind of a long way of telling you that we're going to report this number but we're not going to guide for it."

I mean, one of the things that, gosh, way back when you guys went to bigger stores, I guess, and kind of starting in 2002 or '03 or whenever it was, part of the reason you did that is that the stores you were opening, which is opening up so strong because the economy was a heck of a lot better back then.

If you look at the returns on these classes of stores now, Scott, they're really terrific. And so even if we do get to that where you described it, that would be a nice problem to have and it's not going to happen right away. But I just think we're doing a lot better job at sizing these stores. And also, Jim I talked about this a little bit but sizing markets so that we think ahead about how many stores in a particular market could have. So you might say the elasticity of our market is built in through the numbers of stores that we have in the market rather than just an individual store. So the more will be a good example of that where we chose to go in with 2 rather than one right off the bat and we've got a lot more expand elasticity there than we would have typically just gone on with one big store. We're still going to open some big stores. The chances are good there will be relocations of smaller stores that are really performing at extremely high levels. And that's just lower the risk for our investors. And so as Walter said, it's the right size store for the right market, that's going to mean some big stores occasionally but since we're going into a lot of secondary markets, as we've already mentioned, that's going to -- those store -- most of those stores in secondary markets are going to be in that sweet spot 30,000, 35,000, 40,000 square fleet."

We're very proud to end what has already been a great year on such a high note. For the fourth quarter, we produced 8.7% comparable store sales growth; average weekly sales per store of $630,000, translating to $863 in sales per square foot; 8.7% store contribution and our seasonally softest quarter of the year; 5% operating margin and our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement; 7.9% EBITDA margin; a 26% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.42; and 36% NOPAT ROIC for all stores. 
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $1 billion of cash during the year through a combination of $755 million in cash flow from operations and $297 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $365 million in new and existing stores, paid off the remaining $490 million of our term loan, returned $53 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and increased our total cash and investments during the year by $154 million to $799 million. 
Today, we announced a 40% increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.14 per share and a $200 million share repurchase program. We are well positioned to internally fund our accelerated new store growth, maintain a healthy cash balance, increase our dividend and seek additional value creation for our shareholders through selective share repurchases. 
Turning to sales. We're excited to be reporting 8.7% comparable store sales growth, our seventh consecutive quarter of comps of 7.8% or higher. We believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to be a significant contributor to our momentum, helping drive a 5% increase in our transaction counts during the quarter. 
Our basket size increased 4%, once again driven entirely by higher average price per item as we selectively passed through product cost increases and as customers traded up. As we have been reporting throughout the year, on a year-over-year basis, our customers have shifted their buying toward branded and organic products, higher-priced tiers and to several discretionary categories. We also continue to see strong increases in $50-plus size baskets. 
As demonstrated by our healthy sales and gross margin, we have successfully balanced rising product costs and maintained our relative value positioning. We are hopeful, however, that as many are forecasting, inflation peaked in Q4 and will moderate in Q1. 
In the face of increasingly tougher comparisons, we are pleased that we maintained a 17% 2-year ID for Q4 and for the first 5 weeks of the first quarter. We are not aware of any public food retailer putting up these kinds of numbers. We attribute much of our market share gains for our well-executed value efforts, which have positively impacted our price image while continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers, particularly our quality standards and health and wellness. 
To update you on one of our wellness initiatives, we have now opened 4 in-store Wellness Clubs in Chicago, Oakland, New York City, and Dedham, Massachusetts. Our Wellness Club offerings include nutrition courses, culinary classes, supper clubs, coaching and support, a wellness assessment tool and access to benefits from a growing local network of community businesses. Members also received a 10% discount on thousands of designated healthy foods when they shop at our stores with Wellness Clubs. We are learning and evolving with each club we open and have one more pilot scheduled in Princeton, New Jersey in January. While still very early, we are pleased with the initial results we are seeing. We hope customers will continue to embrace the concept and that we can expand our offering to more customers in the future. 
Turning to new store growth. During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Marietta, Georgia; Mississauga, Canada; Washington D.C. and relocated 2 stores in Wellington, Massachusetts and Upper Arlington, Ohio, resulting in a total of 18 new stores for the year. 
Our new store results showed strong year-over-year improvements in both operating performance and NOPAT return on invested capital in the fourth quarter. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 11% smaller in size, averaging 40,000 square feet and produced average weekly sales per store of $565,000, translating to 23% higher sales per square foot of $747. These new stores produced over 400 basis points higher store contribution and 325 basis points higher NOPAT ROIC as a percentage of sales versus last year's class. We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our Wellness Clubs, videos from our newest stores and more. 
Since our third quarter earnings release, we have signed 9 new leases averaging 32,000 square feet in size in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, Davis, California; Littleton, Colorado; Tallahassee, Florida; Tulsa, Oklahoma, Addison and Katy, Texas; and London, England. We have signed 32 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal 2012, and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013. From a cash and infrastructure perspective, we remain well-positioned to internally fund and execute this acceleration in our new store growth. 
Given our Q4 results, we're in line with our expectations and we are just 5 weeks into fiscal year 2012. We are maintaining our outlook, which reflects consistent comparable store sales growth, a record number of new store openings, EBITDA of close to $1 billion and significant operating margin improvement. We do not expect a meaningful impact on our earnings growth from our acceleration in new store openings as we estimate new stores will account for only 5% of our total sales. 
As I mentioned earlier, fiscal 2011 has been a great year. Our sales topped $10 billion and total sales growth is now accelerating. We improved operating margin 55 basis points to 5.4% and substantially exceeded our initial EPS guidance of $1.59 to $1.64, growing EPS 35% year-over-year to $1.93. We opened 18 new stores that are off to excellent start and signed 32 new leases, including 2 in Canada and 3 in the U.K. We created close to 6,000 new jobs and team member morale is very high. While our relative value positioning remains a top priority, we continue to raise the bar with our 5-Step Animal Welfare Rating and Eco-Scale rating systems, in addition to launching our Whole Kids Foundation and Wellness Clubs. 
Our pleasurable store experience, outstanding service, high-quality standards and differentiated product mix have been the primary drivers of our growth and success. We are committed to maintaining our unique positioning in these areas, and now have the benefit of our more visible value efforts to gain additional customers. We also are in the early innings of becoming a more efficient retailer and have a lot of improvement opportunities ahead of us that should help drive higher levels of operating performance and returns on invested capital over time. 
We consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity in the United States. People are increasingly embracing healthier lifestyles as life-threatening diseases are on the rise and healthcare costs are high and going higher. As America's healthiest grocery store, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this major demographic evolution. We are not yet saturated in any major metro area, and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. 
In addition, through acquisitions and our own store development, we have learned that select secondary markets are ready and waiting for Whole Foods Market to come to town. Looking beyond the United States, we believe Canada and United Kingdom hold great promise as well. 
We will now take your questions. Please limit your questions to one at a time so everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time. Thank you. Operator?"

And it's a 35,000 square-foot store, and the store is doing amazingly high volume. Sales per square foot are phenomenal. And interesting thing about going into some of these slightly smaller markets is that in some sense, there's less competition. There's less differentiation in the marketplace, and so Whole Foods stands out more than it does in some of the other larger markets. So we're so excited because as we've entered into these what we think of the secondary markets, our stores have performed at very high levels both in -- I mean, rents are lower, labor costs are lower and yet we performed at very high level, so the stores are very profitable for us. I really do think this is going to be a strong vehicle for growth for us for the next several years. And I'm not sure how far it can go but obviously, if we're going to get to our 1,000 store goal, the secondary and tertiary markets are going to be very important. The returns on invested capital are extraordinary high in these markets because of the lower rents and the lower general direct store expenses.

Scott, we're really hesitant to give guidance in this area just because as you see from the footnote we have in the press release and I'll just quote it, ""Costs will vary depending on the size of the store, the geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord, complexity of site development issues. To a significant degree, they also depend on how the project is structured, including costs for elements that often increase or decrease rent, lease acquisition costs, shell or garage costs and landlord's allowances."" Bottom line is every deal is complex and unique, then every any one year, you could have some more expensive deals. It also varies a lot geographically. We know that the coastal regions, East Coast, West Coast are going to have more expensive development costs than the Southwest or the Midwest. So it kind of depends on upon which stores get opened up. We just hate for the investment community to read too much into it. But I do want to reiterate that the company is very dedicated. Our management's very dedicated to taking unnecessary costs out of our development process, and we think we're doing a pretty good job of doing so. Stores are less glitzy, and we're getting -- we're cutting out things that we don't believe really add value to our customers. And ideally, all things being equal, we'd like to see that trend line go down, adjusted for inflation. We don't want to guide for it because, as I mentioned, it's so complex and we don't want the market investment community to think we're not doing a good job if costs go up because we opened some expensive stores in the U.K. on a per square foot basis, which is what we're going to end up doing in 2012. We think the really thing people should focus on is the return on invested capital. ROIC is just really important. And some projects will cost more money on a per square foot basis but they might have superior ROIC. A great example of that when we opened our -- relocated our Lincoln Park store, very expensive project, didn't look good on a cost per square foot to develop it. But the store's been an amazing performer and has outperformed our expectations. So anyway, that's kind of a long way of telling you that we're going to report this number but we're not going to guide for it."

I mean, one of the things that, gosh, way back when you guys went to bigger stores, I guess, and kind of starting in 2002 or '03 or whenever it was, part of the reason you did that is that the stores you were opening, which is opening up so strong because the economy was a heck of a lot better back then.

So I think we're getting the right-sized store for the right community, and that includes putting some stretch in there but not so much stretch that we're paying for square footage that's not producing. If you look at the returns on these classes of stores now, Scott, they're really terrific. And so even if we do get to that where you described it, that would be a nice problem to have, and it's not going to happen right away. But I just think we're doing a whole lot better job at sizing these stores. And also, Jim like talked about this a little bit, but sizing markets so that we think ahead about how many stores in a particular market could have. So you might say the elasticity of our market is built in through the numbers of stores that we have in the market rather than just any individual store, so Des Moines being a good example of that where we chose to go in with 2 rather than 1 right off the bat, so and we've got a lot more expand elasticity there than we would have typically just gone on with one big store. We're still going to open some big stores. The chances are good there will be relocations of smaller stores that are really performing at extremely high levels. And that's just lower the risk for our investors. So as Walter said, it's the right size store for the right market. That's going to mean some big stores occasionally but since we're going into a lot of secondary markets, as we've already mentioned, that's going to -- those store -- most of those stores in secondary markets are going to be in that sweet spot 30,000, 35,000, 40,000 square feet."

We're very proud to end what has already been a great year on such a high note. For the fourth quarter, we produced 8.7% comparable store sales growth; average weekly sales per store of $630,000, translating to $863 in sales per square foot; 8.7% store contribution and our seasonally softest quarter of the year; 5% operating margin and our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement; 7.9% EBITDA margin; a 26% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.42; and 36% NOPAT ROIC for all stores. 
Our solid execution, capital discipline and increasing stock price generated over $1 billion of cash during the year through a combination of $755 million in cash flow from operations and $297 million in proceeds from team member stock option exercises. We invested $365 million in new and existing stores, paid off the remaining $490 million of our term loan, returned $53 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders, and increased our total cash and investments during the year by $154 million to $799 million. 
Today, we announced a 40% increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.14 per share and a $200 million share repurchase program. We are well positioned to internally fund our accelerated new store growth, maintain a healthy cash balance, increase our dividend and seek additional value creation for our shareholders through selective share repurchases. 
Turning to sales. We're excited to be reporting 8.7% comparable store sales growth, our seventh consecutive quarter of comps of 7.8% or higher. We believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to be a significant contributor to our momentum, helping drive a 5% increase in our transaction count during the quarter. 
Our basket size increased 4%, once again driven entirely by higher average price per item as we selectively pass through product cost increases and as customers traded up. As we have been reporting throughout the year, on a year-over-year basis, our customers have shifted their buying toward branded and organic products, higher-priced tiers and to several discretionary categories. We also continue to see strong increases in $50-plus size baskets. 
As demonstrated by our healthy sales and gross margin, we have successfully balanced rising product costs and maintained our relative value positioning. We are hopeful, however, that as many are forecasting, inflation peaked in Q4 and will moderate in Q1. 
In the face of increasingly tougher comparisons, we are pleased that we maintained a 17% 2-year ID for Q4 and for the first 5 weeks of the first quarter. We are not aware of any public food retailer putting up these kinds of numbers. We attribute much of our market share gains to our well-executed value efforts, which have positively impacted our price image while continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers, particularly our quality standards and health and wellness. 
To update you on one of our wellness initiatives, we have now opened 4 in-store Wellness Clubs in Chicago, Oakland, New York City, and Dedham, Massachusetts. Our Wellness Club offerings include nutrition courses, culinary classes, supper clubs, coaching and support, a wellness assessment tool and access to benefits from a growing local network of community businesses. Members also receive a 10% discount on thousands of designated healthy foods when they shop at our stores with Wellness Clubs. We are learning and evolving with each club we open and have one more pilot scheduled in Princeton, New Jersey in January. While still very early, we are pleased with the initial results we are seeing. We hope customers will continue to embrace the concept and that we can expand our offering to more customers in the future. 
Turning to new store growth. During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Marietta, Georgia; Mississauga, Canada; Washington D.C. and relocated 2 stores in Wellesley, Massachusetts and Upper Arlington, Ohio, resulting in a total of 18 new stores for the year. 
Our new store results showed strong year-over-year improvements in both operating performance and NOPAT return on invested capital in the fourth quarter. Compared to last year's class of new stores, this year's class was 11% smaller in size, averaging 40,000 square feet and produced average weekly sales per store of $565,000, translating to 23% higher sales per square foot of $747. These new stores produced over 400 basis points higher store contribution and 325 basis points higher NOPAT ROIC as a percentage of sales versus last year's class. We encourage you to visit the Beyond the Numbers section of our Investor Relations web page for more information about our Wellness Clubs, videos from our newest stores and more. 
Since our third quarter earnings release, we have signed 9 new leases averaging 32,000 square feet in size, in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, Davis, California; Littleton, Colorado; Tallahassee, Florida; Tulsa, Oklahoma, Addison and Katy, Texas; and London, England. We have signed 32 new leases over the last 12 months and are on track to open between 24 and 27 new stores in fiscal 2012, and 28 to 32 new stores in fiscal 2013. From a cash and infrastructure perspective, we remain well-positioned to internally fund and execute this acceleration in our new store growth. 
Given our Q4 results, we're in line with our expectations and we are just 5 weeks into fiscal year 2012. We are maintaining our outlook, which reflects consistent comparable store sales growth, a record number of new store openings, EBITDA of close to $1 billion and significant operating margin improvement. We do not expect a meaningful impact on our earnings growth from our acceleration in new store openings as we estimate new stores will account for only 5% of our total sales. 
As I mentioned earlier, fiscal 2011 has been a great year. Our sales topped $10 billion and total sales growth is now accelerating. We improved operating margin 55 basis points to 5.4% and substantially exceeded our initial EPS guidance of $1.59 to $1.64, growing EPS 35% year-over-year to $1.93. We opened 18 new stores that are off to excellent start and signed 32 new leases, including 2 in Canada and 3 in the U.K. We created close to 6,000 new jobs and team member morale is very high. While our relative value positioning remains a top priority, we continue to raise the bar with our 5-Step Animal Welfare Rating and Eco-Scale rating systems, in addition to launching our Whole Kids Foundation and Wellness Clubs. 
Our pleasurable store experience, outstanding service, high-quality standards and differentiated product mix have been the primary drivers of our growth and success. We are committed to maintaining our unique positioning in these areas, and now have the benefit of our more visible value efforts to gain additional customers. We also are in the early innings of becoming a more efficient retailer and have a lot of improvement opportunities ahead of us that should help drive higher levels of operating performance and returns on invested capital over time. 
We consider 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of our market opportunity in the United States. People are increasingly embracing healthier lifestyles as life-threatening diseases are on the rise and healthcare costs are high and going higher. As America's healthiest grocery store, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this major demographic evolution. We are not yet saturated in any major metro area, and our flexibility on new store size has opened up additional market opportunities. 
In addition, through acquisitions and our own store development, we have learned that select secondary markets are ready and waiting for Whole Foods Market to come to town. Looking beyond the United States, we believe Canada and United Kingdom hold great promise as well. 
We will now take your questions. Please limit your questions to one at a time so everyone has an opportunity to participate. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time. Thank you. Operator?"

The store's off to an incredibly strong start, which is -- I just toured it yesterday because it was fresh in my mind. I was in Oklahoma City yesterday and toured our store for a couple of hours. And it's a 35,000 square-foot store, and the store is doing amazingly high volume. Sales per square foot are phenomenal. And interesting thing about going into some of these slightly smaller markets is that in some sense, there's less competition. There's less differentiation in the marketplace, and so Whole Foods stands out more than it does in some of the other larger markets. So we're so excited because as we've entered into these, what we think of as secondary markets, our stores have performed at very high levels both in -- I mean, rents are lower, labor costs are lower and yet we performed at very high levels, so the stores are very profitable for us. I really do think this is going to be a strong vehicle for growth for us for the next several years. And I'm not sure how far it can go but obviously, if we're going to get to our 1,000 store goal, the secondary and tertiary markets are going to be very important. The returns on invested capital are extraordinary high in these markets because of the lower rents and the lower general direct store expenses.

That actually pulled level this quarter, and we saw Private Label growth -- the rate of growth is similar to the branded growth, and I think that reflects a couple of things. One, we upped the SKU from 2,200 to 2,600. And we did some very nice visible repackaging in categories like household cleaning, some others, these sales are really jumping. So I think to the extent that it's a proxy for the economy and how people are feeling -- you may remember during the downturn, it jumped up to 3x faster than branded. What's interesting at this time it's pulled level. I think some of that's because of the efforts of the team here to put that momentum there. But I think it does reflect that people turn to Private Label when they're looking for value. And so I think we've got a nice balance going on right now."

Scott, we're really hesitant to give guidance in this area just because as you see from the footnote we have in the press release and I'll just quote it, ""Costs will vary depending on the size of the store, the geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord, complexity of site development issues. To a significant degree, they also depend on how the project is structured, including costs for elements that often increase or decrease rent, lease acquisition costs, shell or garage costs and landlord's allowances."" Bottom line is every deal is complex and unique. In any one year, you could have some more expensive deals. It also varies a lot geographically. We know that the coastal regions, East Coast, West Coast are going to have more expensive development costs than the Southwest or the Midwest. So it kind of depends on upon which stores get opened up. We just hate for the investment community to read too much into it. But I do want to reiterate that the company is very dedicated. Our management's very dedicated to taking unnecessary costs out of our development process, and we think we're doing a pretty good job of doing so. Stores are less glitzy, and we're getting -- we're cutting out things that we don't believe really add value to our customers. And ideally, all things being equal, we'd like to see that trend line go down, adjusted for inflation. We don't want to guide for it because, as I mentioned, it's so complex and we don't want the market investment community to think we're not doing a good job if costs go up because we opened some expensive stores in the U.K. on a per square foot basis, which is what we're going to end up doing in 2012. We think the really thing people should focus on is the return on invested capital. ROIC is just really important. And some projects will cost more money on a per square foot basis but they might have superior ROIC. A great example of that when we opened our -- relocated our Lincoln Park store, very expensive project, didn't look good on a cost per square foot to develop it. But the store's been an amazing performer and has outperformed our expectations. So anyway, that's kind of a long way of telling you that we're going to report this number but we're not going to guide for it."

I mean, one of the things that, gosh, way back when you guys went to bigger stores, I guess, and kind of starting in 2002 or '03 or whenever it was. Part of the reason you did that is that the stores you were opening, were just opening up so strong because the economy was a heck of a lot better back then. As you look out in the next 2 to 3 years, I mean, if we turn this economy, I mean, do you think we're going to have that kind of problem again where these stores that you're opening that are a lot smaller could end up being too small?"

So I think we're getting the right-sized store for the right community, and that includes putting some stretch in there, but not so much stretch that we're paying for square footage that's not producing. If you look at the returns on these classes of stores now, Scott, they're really terrific. And so even if we do get to that where you described it, that would be a nice problem to have, and it's not going to happen right away. But I just think we're doing a whole lot better job at sizing these stores. And also, Jim might talk about this a little bit, but sizing markets so that we think ahead about how many stores a particular market could have. So you might say the elasticity of a market is built in through the numbers of stores that we have in the market rather than just any individual store. So Des Moines being a good example of that where we chose to go in with 2 rather than 1 right off the bat, so we've got a lot more expand -- elasticity there than we would if we would have typically just gone in with one big store. We're still going to open some big stores. The chances are good there will be relocations of smaller stores that are really performing at extremely high levels. And that just lowered the risk for our investors. So as Walter said, it's the right size store for the right market. That's going to mean some big stores occasionally but since we're going into a lot of secondary markets, as we've already mentioned, that's going to -- those store -- most of those stores in secondary markets are going to be in that sweet spot 30,000, 35,000, 40,000 square feet."
