Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, I will talk about some significant developments that occurred during the fourth quarter and provide details around certain business operations that I believe are of interest to many of you. I will also briefly describe our overall financial results for the quarter, followed by a more comprehensive discussion of our annual results of each of our businesses and our expectations for 2011.
Let me begin with our recent system electric rate case. The Texas PUC announced its decision in early February, but has yet to render a written order, so our description is somewhat limited. Although the cash flow impact from this case should be minimal, we anticipate that the decision will have an estimated $25 million to $30 million annualized negative impact on Houston Electrics operating income. We are obviously disappointed in this result. Let me give you a few of the details of the decision as we understand them today.
Rates will be based on a capital structure reflecting 45% equity, up from the current level of 40%. The return on equity was set at 10%. This is an 8% 0.25% lower than the rates most recently authorized for other Texas utilities and reduced a positive effects of the higher equity ratio. We are very disappointed in this aspect of the PUC's decision. The commission reduced Houston Electrics revenue requirement by about $10 million to reflect tax savings in other CenterPoint businesses. This is commonly referred to as the consolidated tax savings adjustment. While it had been previously been the practice of the commission to make this type of an adjustment, it did not do so in the recent Encore case and we were hopeful that commission would follow the precedent set in that case. The commission lengthy discussion about the calculation and indicated that would initiate a workshop to consider whether this issue should be the subject of a rulemaking.
Rate base was reduced to reflect the PUC's assumptions regarding the company's liability for uncertain tax positions. This change in rate base resulted in a revenue requirement reduction of approximately $17 million. However, a tractor was established to capture the revenue requirement difference between the assumed and actual tax outcome.
I might also add that our AMS investment of approximately $121 million was moved from a surcharge into base rates. This change has no effect on operating income since we were already recognizing a return on this investment under the smart meter surcharge.
Now let me update you on our advanced technology deployments. The implementation of an advanced metering system in our Houston Electric service territory is progressing well. We are currently installing over 80,000 smart meters per month, and we celebrated the installation of our 1 millionth smart meter last week. We have invested approximately $240 million through December, excluding $100 million we have requested under our DOE grant.
Houston Electric will use $50 million of the DOE grant to support our Intelligent Grid Initiative which is also progressing well. Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory. These devices will initially allow us to automate natural gas meter readings, and in the future, will enable other functionality. We expect to invest approximately $85 million on this project, which should be completed within 36 months.
Now let me turn to our Field Services business. This has been our fastest growing business segment and we expect significant growth to continue for the next few years. As you recall, we are building two major systems together and three production for Shell and in Encana in the Haynesville Shale. The first 700 million cubic foot per day phase of the Magnolia system is complete except for well-connects. Construction of the Olympia system in the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia system are progressing on schedule and on budget. By the end of the first quarter of this year, we expect to have both of these projects substantially completed except for pipeline interconnections scheduled for later this year and well-connects. This will bring the total capacity of these two systems to 1.5 BCF per day.
The Shell and EnCana contracts provide for annual throughput guarantees upon completion of various milestones that have been or will be achieved throughout 2011. The initial phase of the Magnolia system is flowing at close to contracted volume capacity. We expect throughput on the Olympia system and the Magnolia expansion to increase over the course of the year and be at system capacity by early 2012.
Once we complete construction of the current phases of the Magnolia and Olympia systems, our total investment will be approximately $800 million. Shell and and EnCana have expansion rights for another 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of capacity, which would cause up to an additional $450 million to construct. For planning purposes, we are assuming that about half the expansion rights will be executed over the next five years.
I would also add that we continued to expect mid teen unlevered return from these investments once production is ramped up to near the contracted capacity.
Now let me review the company's overall operating results for the fourth quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $124 million for the fourth quarter or $0.29 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $105 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the same period of 2009. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $302 million compared to $299 million for the same period of 2009. Houston Electrics operating income declined by $5 million primarily related to increased expenses for our reliability programs, the timing of energy efficiency expenditures and unplanned environmental remediation costs.
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment reported a $13 million decline in operating income. This decline was driven by lower system throughput due to milder weather, higher expenses and improved rate designs that shifted base revenues into the second and third quarters. Operating income for our Interstate Pipelines segment was essentially the same as 2009 as higher revenues primarily from firm contracts associated with Phase 4 of the Carthage to Perryville pipeline were offset by lower revenues from ancillary services.
Increased operating income of $35 million in our Field Services segment included a $21 million gain related to the sale of a small nonstrategic gathering system in the Texas Panhandle. The additional increase in operating income was primarily related to new facilities in the Haynesville Shale constructed since the previous year.
Operating income at our Energy Services business declined $21 million due to increased mark to market losses on derivative contracts and a contraction in seasonal price differentials. Finally, net income for the quarter benefited from a $24 million reduction in deferred tax expense due to the conversion of certain subsidiaries of cert to LLCs.
Now let me turn to our full year 2010 performance. Our reported net income for 2010 was $442 million, a $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $372 million, a $1.01 per diluted share for 2009. Operating income was $1.25 billion in 2010, an increase of more than $125 million or 11% from 2009. Houston Electric reported operating income of $427 million for 2010 compared to $414 million for 2009. This increase was primarily the result of customer growth, increased usage, in part due to favorable weather, and increased earnings associated with our smart meter investment.
Partially offsetting these increases was a $21 million reduction in revenues associated with the credit to customers bills reflecting the benefit of deferred taxes associated with Hurricane Ike storm restoration cost. We also experienced increased operating expenses due primarily to system reliability programs, increased employee-related expenses and environmental remediation cost. It is worth noting that even in a relatively weak economy, we added nearly 28,000 customers in 2010, a growth rate of about 1.3%.
As we look to 2011, we expect customer growth will be at or a little better than what we experienced in 2010, which has helped to offset the estimated $20 million partially year impact from the rate case decision and expected expense increases. The bottom line is, I expect Houston Electric to be down some from 2010, absent increased usage from weather or other developments.
2010 was an exceptional year for our Natural Gas Distribution business, which reported operating income of $231 million compared to $204 million in 2009. Operating income benefited from rate changes, lower pension and benefit costs, and lower bad debt expense. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher operating expenses, including an increase in depreciation. Over the last several years, this business has worked diligently on reducing customer delinquencies and bad debt expense and has also focused on obtaining necessary rate increases and improving rate design. I'm pleased to say that we continued to see the benefits of those efforts in 2010.
As we move into 2011, we believe this unit is poised for another good year. We expect to finalize one small rate case this year, which, together with a number of annual rate adjustments, should provide some revenue uplift, our focus will also continue to be on operational improvements and expense control.
Our competitive natural gas sales and services business reported operating income of $16 million for 2010 compared to $21 million for 2009. Excluding mark to market gains and losses in natural gas inventory write-downs, our Energy Services business would have reported operating income of $18 million compared to $50 million for 2009. This decline was principally the result of reduced wholesale opportunities because of significantly tighter locational price differentials and an absence of seasonal storage freights. Last year, our retail sales were stable and we added more than 1,000 customers to our total customer base.
We expect our retail business to see improvement this year. We believe we have stabilized our wholesale business and expect some marginal improvement. Absent the effects of mark-to-market impacts and inventory adjustments, we expect 2011 to be a better year than 2010 for Energy Services.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services. Our Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $270 million for 2010 compared to $256 million for 2009. Our core business continues to perform well, building on its strong fee-based foundation with increased margins from our Carthage to pipeline, as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve power generation facilities on our system. Our fee-based margin grew by 4%, but this growth was partially offset by reduced revenues from ancillary services and off-system sales.
Our equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $19 million. This compares to equity income of $7 million in 2009, which was reduced by a $16 million noncash charge due to the discontinued use of regulatory accounting. As I mentioned last quarter, we have a backhaul agreement that terminates in the middle of 2011, which will reduce revenues and will also impact the fuel efficiency of lien CP. Offsetting this decline is the addition of about 100 million cubic feet of lien CP capacity available on a forward haul basis. The overall impact is expected to be about $20 million. To date, we have not secured sufficient new contract revenues to fully offset this impact.
We also have some expense pressures stemming from EPA regulations. So without the benefit of higher ancillary revenues this year, which would be driven primarily by the change in market conditions, it will be difficult for our pipeline business to match the operating income we earned in 2010.
Our Field Services unit reported operating income of $151 million for 2010 compared to $94 million for 2009. Operating income for 2010 included the $21 million gained associated with the small gathering system we sold in the fourth quarter. The remaining $36 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of the new long-term agreements with subsidiaries of Shell and Encana. Gathering volumes were up significantly in 2010 compared to 2009. Average gathering volumes in 2010 were 1.8 BCF per day, an increase of more than 50% from 2009.
For the month of December 2010, gathering volumes average a little over two BCF per day. As we reported last quarter, gathering volumes from our traditional basins have leveled off. Fourth quarter volumes were flat to the fourth quarter of 2009. For the year, traditional volumes were down about 8%. In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $10 million from our jointly owned Watson facilities compared to $8 million the previous year. As we look to 2011, we expect Haynesville production to increase steadily over the year, and we also expect some increased volumes in the Fayetteville and Woodford shales. We are assuming flat volumes from our traditional fields. Our fee-based revenues will increase as we achieve the milestones for the Olympia system and the Magnolia expansion.
Overall, we expect Field Services to achieve significant increases in operating income.
Taking into account the performance of all of our business units, I believe that our company performed very well in 2010. I would like to acknowledge the dedication of our employees as they worked hard not only to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, but to strengthen business relationships and capture new business opportunities. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our overall financial flexibility and strength. As the result of these collective efforts, I believe the company is well positioned to capture opportunities this year and beyond.
Looking to the future, we expect to benefit from our balanced portfolio of Electric and Natural Gas businesses. Near term, Field Services will continue to enjoy the benefits of capital investment opportunities in the shale plays. Longer-term, growing service territory should provide good investment opportunities for our regulated businesses. In his remarks, Gary will provide our overall earnings guidance for 2011.
In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $0.1975 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 20. This marks the sixth consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continued to demonstrate a strong commitment our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary"

Today, I'd like to discuss a few items with you. First, we are very pleased with the steps we have taken during the year to strengthen our balance sheet and to enhance our credit metrics to ensure we maintain the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. Excluding securitization debt, we reduced our corporate consolidated debt from $7 billion to $6.7 billion at year-end 2010 while funding a capital program of $1.46 billion. Our debt to total capitalization improved from approximately 73% to 67%.
In 2010, we raised $416 million of additional equity with the issuance of 33 million shares of common stock. Of this amount, $315 million was associated with the underwritten equity offering executed in conjunction with the announcement of our Field Services business signing excellent long-term agreements with Shell and Encana. The remaining shares were issued as part of our savings plan, Dividend Reinvestment Plan and various benefit programs. At this time, based on the significant steps we've taken to pass past two years to strengthen our balance sheet and a significant cash we generate from our operation, we have suspended the use of original issue shares for the savings plan and the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Instead, shares will be purchased on the open market to sign these plants.
Now let me discuss our capital spending plan for 2011 in total and by segment. We estimate our 2011 CapEx to be $1.34 billion, a decrease of $125 million in 2010. About 77% or a little more than $1 billion of CapEx this year will be spend by our regulated businesses compared to 52% in 2010.
Let me give you a break down by business. We expect to spend $605 million in our Electric business, an increase of $142 million from 2009, primarily related to our advanced metering and intelligent grid deployments. We expect to spend $263 million in our Natural Gas Distribution business, reflecting an increase of $61 million from 2010 primarily for the remote electronic transmitters that David referred to in his comments, as well as increased spending on improvements related to safety and system reliability. Our pipeline's capital budget is $157 million, which is above the 2010 level of $102 million due primarily to increased maintenance capital and additional spending to ensure compliance with certain EPA rules.
Our capital budget for Field Services is $262 million, which is a reduction of $406 million from 2010, as we have completed a significant portion of this spending on the buildout of the Shell and Encana projects. This estimate does not include any new capital which may be required if we were to have a new significant opportunity either in or outside of our current footprint. Along these lines, we have been asked about our financing strategy for any new significant investment in our midstream businesses, specifically, whether we are considering the formation of an MLP as a financing option. We think the formation of an MLP could be an efficient way to finance new growth as compared to selling common equity. However, our focus has been and will continue to be on executing the optimum financing plan for the company based on our particular circumstances.
For example, before forming an MLP, we would need to be confident that there would not be a material negative impact to the credit ratings of the parent company or utilities subsidiaries.
Now let me discuss our current financing activities and financing plan. Thus far in 2011, we have taken two important steps to refinance the debt maturities at served. First, in early January, circuit should $250 million of 10-year 4.5% senior notes and $300 million of 30-year 5.85% senior notes. The offering was very well received by the market and we were able to price both series of notes well below the indicative secondary levels. Proceeds from the sale of the notes were used for the repayment of the $550 million of 7.75% certain notes that matured in February. Obviously, we are very pleased to have the opportunity to replace the 7.75% coupon insert with debt having a much lower rate.
Also, in January, circuit issued an additional $343 million of 10-year 4.5% senior notes and provided cash consideration of $114 million in exchange for 52% of the outstanding $762 million of 7.875% notes due in 2013. We are very pleased with the results of this exchange offer. It has allowed us to significantly reduce the size of the cert maturity that we would otherwise facing in 2013 and to do so by locking in a refinancing rate on the new certain debt that is very attractive on a historical basis. So we have both lowered the weighted average coupon on debt bit portfolio and extended the average maturity of the debt portfolio. I would also note that we have no material maturities until 2013 as either the parent or its two operating subsidiaries.
Let me mention that our various revolving credit facilities terminate in late June of 2012. Consequently, we expect to syndicate new revolving credit facilities later this year. The bank market continues to improve and we will be seeking to put in place new revolving credit facilities with the appropriate size and tenor with the optimum pricing.
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2011 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. I would like to highlight a few of our more important economic and commodity price assumptions behind the business unit performance expectations as David discussed in his comments.
Our expectation is that the overall U.S. economy will continue to recover in line with consensus economic forecast. But the economy in much of our service territories, in particular, Texas, is expected to improve a little more quickly than the broader U.S. economy. As for our assumption relative to natural gas prices, we have assumed a forecast in line with the industry consensus, which is approximately $4 per MMBtu. Our forecast does not reflect a material change in natural gas liquids pricing from 2010 levels.
We expect the interest expense to decline in 2011 compared to 2010 based on our recent completed refinancing, and we expect the overall tax rate to be 38% for the year. The share count for the EPS calculation will reflect the full impact of the shares issued in 2010. Our year-end share count was approximately 428 million shares compared to the average share count of 413 million in 2010. This increase in share count impacts diluted EPS by approximately $0.04.
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne"

Can you give me a better sense of perhaps why we should expect to see an increase in the competitive sales and services in 2011? And if you could also give us some more color, if we look back on prior years, again, pre-mark-to-market, there has been a pretty robust earnings range prior, and so when you say you expected you better in 2011, is that nominally or are you thinking that it's going to get back to something like 2009, for instance?"

As you know, I've told in the past that we believe our retail business produces operating income in the $30 million to $35 million range.

As you know, I've told in the past that we believe our retail business produces operating income in the $30 million to $35 million range. And our wholesale business in the past has added operating income above that. We clearly didn't make any money. We, in fact, lost some money in the wholesale business in 2010. Now part of the reason, I believe we're going to better is, some of the pipeline capacity that we have under contract terminates this year. And so we're not going to have to try to find ways to offset that fixed expense. It's just going to go away, but we're also taking a much different approach to that business. Our goal is to make sure we fully realized the retail businesses profitability in our CenterPoint earnings and not have the Wholesale business at least in the near term for basis and seasonal and price differentials are really small, impact the overall profitability of the company. So we're working hard to make the Wholesale business at least break even, but hopefully we'll be able to produce a profit and then be able to fully realized our retail business which is really why we're in this business. We're in it to sell gas to commercial and industrial customers. We have a lot of pipeline capacity, about a BCF scattered across the country and 10, 11 BCF of storage which we used primarily to serve our retail customers. But we are able to optimize around that and in the past, in some years, we made $30 million, $40 million, $50 million on that. Those days are probably gone at least for the foreseeable future with all the pipeline capacity that's been built, the new reserves and all the storage that's coming in. You never know, there's always disruptions, as you know, weather, hurricanes, something happens that you stand ready to be opportunistic, but our base plan is not based on that. It's, let's make sure we get the full retail business reflected in earnings and then make sure wholesale is at least break even."

So from a financing perspective, I think it really has and we've been consistent for saying that it's an optimum financing in other words to the extent we have the opportunity originate new business that David described earlier, that would require additional capital, we think the MLP certainly could be the optimum way to finance that. So we continue to work diligently to be prepared if that is the best interest of the company."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, I will talk about some significant developments that occurred during the fourth quarter and provide details around certain business operations that I believe are of interest to many of you. I will also briefly describe our overall financial results for the quarter, followed by a more comprehensive discussion of our annual results of each of our businesses and our expectations for 2011.
Let me begin with our Houston electric rate case. The Texas PUC [Public Utility Commission] announced its decision in early February, but has yet to render a written order, so our description is somewhat limited. Although the cash flow impact in this case should be minimal, we anticipate that the decision will have an estimated $25 million to $30 million annualized negative impact on Houston Electric's operating income. We are obviously disappointed in this result. Let me give you a few of the details of the decision as we understand them today.
Rates will be based on a capital structure reflecting 45% equity, up from the current level of 40%. The return on equity was set at 10%. This is an 8% to 0.25% lower than the rates most recently authorized for other Texas utilities and reduced the positive effects of the higher equity ratio. We are very disappointed in this aspect of the PUC's decision. The commission reduced Houston Electric's revenue requirement by about $10 million to reflect tax savings in other CenterPoint businesses. This is commonly referred to as the consolidated tax savings adjustment. While it had previously been the practice of the commission to make this type of an adjustment, it did not do so in the recent Oncor case, and we were hopeful the commission would follow the precedent set in that case. The commission had a lengthy discussion about the calculation and indicated that it would initiate a workshop to consider whether this issue should be the subject of a rule making.
 
Rate base was reduced to reflect the PUC's assumptions regarding the company's liability for uncertain tax positions. This change in rate base resulted in a revenue requirement reduction of approximately $17 million. However, a tractor was established to capture the revenue requirement difference between the assumed and actual tax outcome.
I might also add that our AMS investment of approximately $121 million was moved from a surcharge into base rates. This change has no effect on operating income since we were already recognizing a return on this investment under the smart meter surcharge.
Now let me update you on our advanced technology deployments. The implementation of an advanced metering system in our Houston Electric service territory is progressing well. We are currently installing over 80,000 smart meters per month, and we celebrated the installation of our 1 millionth smart meter last week. We have invested approximately $240 million through December, excluding $100 million we have requested under our DOE grant.
Houston Electric will use $50 million of the DOE grant to support our Intelligent Grid Initiative, which is also progressing well. Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory. These devices will initially allow us to automate natural gas meter readings and in the future, will enable other functionality. We expect to invest approximately $85 million on this project, which should be completed within 36 months.
Now let me turn to our Field Services business. This has been our fastest growing business segment, and we expect significant growth to continue for the next few years. As you recall, we are building two major systems to gather and create production for Shell and in Encana in the Haynesville Shale. The first 700 million cubic foot per day phase of the Magnolia System is complete except for well connects. Construction of the Olympia System and the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia System are progressing on schedule and on budget. By the end of the first quarter of this year, we expect to have both of these projects substantially completed except for pipeline interconnections scheduled for later this year and well connects. This will bring the total capacity of these two systems to 1.5 BCF per day.
The Shell and Encana contracts provide for annual throughput guarantees upon completion of various milestones that have been or will be achieved throughout 2011. The initial phase of the Magnolia System is flowing at close to contracted volume capacity. We expect throughput on the Olympia System and the Magnolia expansion to increase over the course of the year and be at system capacity by early 2012.
Once we complete construction of the current phases of the Magnolia and Olympia Systems, our total investment will be approximately $800 million. Shell and and Encana have expansion rights for another 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of capacity, which would cost up to an additional $450 million to construct. For planning purposes, we are assuming that about half the expansion rights will be executed over the next five years.
I would also add that we continued to expect mid-teen unlevered return from these investments once production is ramped up to near the contracted capacity.
Now let me review the company's overall operating results for the fourth quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $124 million for the fourth quarter or $0.29 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $105 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the same period of 2009. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $302 million compared to $299 million for the same period of 2009. Houston Electric's operating income declined by $5 million primarily related to increased expenses for our reliability programs, the timing of energy efficiency expenditures and unplanned environmental remediation costs.
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment reported a $13 million decline in operating income. This decline was driven by lower system throughput due to milder weather, higher expenses and improved rate designs that shifted base revenues into the second and third quarters. 
Operating income for our Interstate Pipelines segment was essentially the same as 2009 as higher revenues primarily from firm contracts associated with phase 4 of the Carthage to Perryville pipeline were offset by lower revenues from ancillary services.
Increased operating income of $35 million in our Field Services segment included a $21 million gain related to the sale of a small nonstrategic gathering system in the Texas Panhandle. The additional increase in operating income was primarily related to new facilities in the Haynesville Shale constructed since the previous year.
Operating income at our Energy Services business declined $21 million due to increased mark-to-market losses on derivative contracts and a contraction in seasonal price differentials. 
Finally, net income for the quarter benefited from a $24 million reduction in deferred tax expense due to the conversion of certain subsidiaries of cert to LLCs.
Now let me turn to our full year 2010 performance. Our reported net income for 2010 was $442 million, a $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $372 million, a $1.01 per diluted share for 2009. Operating income was $1.25 billion in 2010, an increase of more than $125 million or 11% from 2009. Houston Electric reported operating income of $427 million for 2010 compared to $414 million for 2009. This increase was primarily the result of customer growth, increased usage in part due to favorable weather and increased earnings associated with our smart meter investment. Partially offsetting these increases was a $21 million reduction in revenues associated with the credit to customers' bills reflecting the benefit of deferred taxes associated with Hurricane Ike storm restoration cost. We also experienced increased operating expenses due primarily to system reliability programs, increased employee-related expenses and environmental remediation cost. It is worth noting that even in a relatively weak economy, we added nearly 28,000 customers in 2010, a growth rate of about 1.3%.
As we look to 2011, we expect customer growth will be at or a little better than what we experienced in 2010, which has helped to offset the estimated $20 million partial year impact from the rate case decision and expected expense increases. The bottom line is I expect Houston Electric to be down some from 2010, absent increased usage from weather or other developments.
2010 was an exceptional year for our Natural Gas Distribution business, which reported operating income of $231 million compared to $204 million in 2009. Operating income benefited from rate changes, lower pension and benefit costs and lower bad debt expense. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher operating expenses, including an increase in depreciation. 
Over the last several years, this business has worked diligently on reducing customer delinquencies and bad debt expense and is also focused on obtaining necessary rate increases and improving rate design. I'm pleased to say that we continued to see the benefits of those efforts in 2010.
As we move into 2011, we believe this unit is poised for another good year. We expect to finalize one small rate case this year, which together with a number of annual rate adjustments, should provide some revenue uplift. Our focus will also continue to be on operational improvements and expense control.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported operating income of $16 million for 2010 compared to $21 million for 2009. 
Excluding mark-to-market gains and losses and natural gas inventory write-downs, our Energy Services business would have reported operating income of $18 million compared to $50 million for 2009. This decline was principally the result of reduced wholesale opportunities because of significantly tighter locational price differentials and an absence of seasonal storage freights. Last year, our retail sales were stable and we added more than 1,000 customers to our total customer base.
We expect our Retail business to see improvement this year. We believe we have stabilized our Wholesale business and expect some marginal improvement. Absent the effects of mark-to-market impacts and inventory adjustments, we expect 2011 to be a better year than 2010 for Energy Services.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services. Our Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $270 million for 2010 compared to $256 million for 2009. Our core business continues to perform well, building on its strong fee-based foundation with increased margins from our Carthage to Perryville pipeline as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve power generation facilities on our system. Our fee-based margin grew by 4%, but this growth was partially offset by reduced revenues from ancillary services and off-system sales.
Our equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $19 million. This compares to equity income of $7 million in 2009, which was reduced by a a $16 million noncash charge due to the discontinued use of regulatory accounting. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we have a backhaul agreement that terminates in the middle of 2011, which will reduce revenues and will also impact the fuel efficiency of Line CP. Offsetting this decline is the addition of about 100 million cubic feet of Line CP capacity available on a forward-haul basis. The overall impact is expected to be about $20 million. To date, we have not secured sufficient new contract revenues to fully offset this impact.
We also have some expense pressures stemming from EPA regulations. So without the benefit of higher ancillary revenues this year, which would be driven primarily by change in market conditions, it will be difficult for our Pipeline business to match the operating income we earned in 2010.
Our Field Services unit reported operating income of $151 million for 2010 compared to $94 million for 2009. Operating income for 2010 included the $21 million gain associated with the small gathering system we sold in the fourth quarter. The remaining $36 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of the new long-term agreements with subsidiaries of Shell and Encana. Gathering volumes were up significantly in 2010 compared to 2009. Average gathering volumes in 2010 were 1.8 BCF per day, an increase of more than 50% from 2009.
For the month of December 2010, gathering volumes average a little over 2 BCF per day. As we reported last quarter, gathering volumes from our traditional basins have leveled off. Fourth quarter volumes were flat till the fourth quarter of 2009. For the year, traditional volumes were down about 8%. 
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $10 million from our jointly owned Waskom facilities compared to $8 million the previous year. As we look to 2011, we expect Haynesville production to increase steadily over the year, and we also expect some increased volumes in the Fayetteville and Woodford shales. We are assuming flat volumes from our traditional fields. Our fee-based revenues will increase as we achieve the milestones for the Olympia System and the Magnolia expansion. Overall, we expect Field Services to achieve significant increases in operating income.
Taking into account the performance of all of our business units, I believe that our company performed very well in 2010. I would like to acknowledge the dedication of our employees as theyed work hard not only to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, but to strengthen business relationships and capture new business opportunities. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our overall financial flexibility and strength. As a result of these collective efforts, I believe the company is well positioned to capture opportunities this year and beyond.
Looking to the future, we expect to benefit from our balanced portfolio of Electric and Natural Gas businesses. Near term, Field Services will continue to enjoy the benefits of capital investment opportunities in the shale plays. Longer term, growing service territory should provide good investment opportunities for our regulated businesses. In his remarks, Gary will provide our overall earnings guidance for 2011.
In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $0.1975 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 20. This marks the sixth consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continued to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I'd like to discuss a few items with you. First, we are very pleased with the steps we have taken during the year to strengthen our balance sheet and to enhance our credit metrics to ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. Excluding securitization debt, we reduced our corporate consolidated debt from $7 billion to $6.7 billion at year-end 2010 while funding a capital program of $1.46 billion. Our debt to total capitalization improved from approximately 73% to 67%.
In 2010, we raised $416 million of additional equity with the issuance of 33 million shares of common stock. Of this amount, $315 million was associated with an underwritten equity offering executed in conjunction with the announcement of our Field Services business signing excellent long-term agreements with Shell and Encana. The remaining shares were issued as part of our savings plan, dividend reinvestment plan and various benefit programs. At this time, based on the significant steps we have taken the past two years to strengthen our balance sheet and the significant cash we generate from our operations, we have suspended the use of original issue shares for the savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan. Instead, shares will be purchased on the open market to fund these plans.
Now let me discuss our capital spending plan for 2011 in total and by segment. We estimate our 2011 CapEx to be $1.34 billion, a decrease of $125 million from 2010. About 77% or a little more than $1 billion of CapEx this year will be spent by our regulated businesses compared to 52% in 2010.
Let me give you a breakdown by business. We expect to spend $605 million in our Electric business, an increase of $142 million from 2009, primarily related to our advanced metering and intelligent grid deployments. We expect to spend $263 million in our Natural Gas Distribution business, reflecting an increase of $61 million from 2010 primarily for the remote electronic transmitters that David referred to in his comments, as well as increased spending on improvements related to safety and system reliability. Our pipeline's capital budget is $157 million, which is above the 2010 level of $102 million due primarily to increased maintenance capital and additional spending to ensure compliance with certain EPA rules.
Our capital budget for Field Services is $262 million, which is a reduction of $406 million from 2010 as we have completed a significant portion of the spending on the buildout of the Shell and Encana projects. This estimate does not include any new capital, which may be required if we were to have a new significant opportunity either in or outside of our current footprint. Along these lines, we have been asked about our financing strategy for any new significant investment in our midstream businesses. Specifically, whether we are considering the formation of an MLP as a financing option. We think the formation of an MLP could be an efficient way to finance new growth as compared to selling common equity. However, our focus has been and will continue to be on executing the optimum financing plan for the company based on our particular circumstances.
For example, before forming an MLP, we would need to be confident that there would not be a material negative impact to the credit ratings of the parent company or our utilities subsidiaries.
Now let me discuss our current financing activities and financing plan. Thus far in 2011, we have taken two important steps to refinance debt maturities historic. First, in early January, CERC should $250 million of 10-year 4.5% senior notes and $300 million of 30-year 5.85% senior notes. The offering was very well received by the market, and we were able to price both series of notes well below the indicative secondary levels. Proceeds from the sale of the notes were used for the repayment of the $550 million of 7.75% CERC notes that matured in February. Obviously, we are very pleased to have the opportunity to replace this 7.75% coupon insert with debt having a much lower rate.
Also in January, CERC issued an additional $343 million of 10-year 4.5% senior notes and provided cash consideration of $114 million in exchange for 52% of the outstanding $762 million of 7.875% notes due in 2013. We are very pleased with the results of this exchange offer. It has allowed us to significantly reduce the size of the CERC maturity that we were otherwise facing in 2013 and to do so by locking in a refinancing rate on the new CERC debt that is very attractive on a historical basis. So we have both lowered the weighted average coupon on CERC's debt portfolio and extended the average maturity of the debt portfolio. I would also note that we have no material maturities until 2013 as either the parent or its two operating subsidiaries.
Let me mention that our various revolving credit facilities terminate in late June of 2012. Consequently, we expect to syndicate new revolving credit facilities later this year. The bank market continues to improve, and we will be seeking to put in place new revolving credit facilities with the appropriate size and tenor with the optimum pricing.
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2011 earnings guidance. This morning, in our earnings release, we announced 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. I would like to highlight a few of our more important economic and commodity price assumptions behind the business unit performance expectations David discussed in his comment.
Our expectation is that the overall U.S. economy will continue to recover in line with consensus economic forecast. But the economy in much of our service territories in particular, Texas, is expected to improve a little more quickly than the broader U.S. economy. As for our assumption relative to natural gas prices, we have assumed a forecast in line with the industry consensus, which is approximately $4 per MMBtu. Our forecast does not reflect a material change in natural gas liquids pricing from 2010 levels.
We expect the interest expense to decline in 2011 compared to 2010 based on our recent completed refinancing, and we expect the overall tax rate to be 38% for the year. The share count for the EPS calculation will reflect the full impact of the shares issued in 2010. Our year-end share count was approximately 428 million shares compared to the average share count of 413 million in 2010. This increase in share count impacts diluted EPS by approximately $0.04.
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

As you know, I've told you in the past that we believe our Retail business produces operating income in the $30 million to $35 million range. And our Wholesale business in the past has added operating income above that. We clearly didn't make any money. We, in fact, lost some money in the Wholesale business in 2010. Now part of the reason, I believe we're going to better is, some of the pipeline capacity that we have under contract terminates this year. And so we're not going to have to try to find ways to offset that fixed expense. It's just going to go away, but we're also taking a much different approach to that business. Our goal is to make sure we fully realize the Retail businesses' profitability in our CenterPoint earnings and not have the Wholesale business, at least in the near term where bases and seasonal price differentials are really small, impact the overall profitability of the company. So we're working hard to make the Wholesale business at least breakeven, but hopefully we'll be able to produce a profit and then we'll be able to fully realized our retail business, which is really why we're in this business. We're in it to sell gas to commercial and industrial customers. We have a lot of pipeline capacity, about a Bcf scattered across the country in 10 or 11 Bcf a storage, which we use primarily to serve our retail customers. But we are able to optimize around that. And in the past, some years, we made $30 million, $40 million, $50 million on that. Those days are probably gone at least for the foreseeable future with all the pipeline capacity that's been built, the new reserves and all the storage that's coming in. You never know, there's always disruptions, as you know, weather, hurricanes, something happens that you stand ready to be opportunistic. But our base plan is not based on that. It's let's make sure we get the full Retail business reflected in earnings and then make sure Wholesale is at least breakeven."

Take this regulatory lag out from all the capital we're spending and absent the AMS investment, we're still spending $400-plus million a year. And that has a regulatory impact. So our focus is to try to get this distribution cost recovery factor, give the commission the authority to do it.

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, I will talk about some significant developments that occurred during the fourth quarter and provide details around certain business operations that I believe are of interest to many of you. I will also briefly describe our overall financial results for the quarter, followed by a more comprehensive discussion of our annual results of each of our businesses and our expectations for 2011.
Let me begin with our recent Houston electric rate case. The Texas PUC [Public Utility Commission] announced its decision in early February, but has yet to render a written order, so our description is somewhat limited. Although the cash flow impact from this case should be minimal, we anticipate that the decision will have an estimated $25 million to $30 million annualized negative impact on Houston Electric's operating income. We are obviously disappointed in this result. Let me give you a few of the details of the decision, as we understand them today.
Rates will be based on a capital structure reflecting 45% equity, up from the current level of 40%. The return on equity was set at 10%. This is an 0.125% to 0.25% lower than the rates most recently authorized for other Texas utilities and reduced the positive effects of the higher equity ratio. We are very disappointed in this aspect of the PUC's decision. The commission reduced Houston Electric's revenue requirement by about $10 million to reflect tax savings in other CenterPoint businesses. This is commonly referred to as the consolidated tax savings adjustment. While it had been -- previously been the practice of the commission to make this type of an adjustment, it did not do so in the recent Oncor case, and we were hopeful the commission would follow the precedent set in that case. The commission had a lengthy discussion about the calculation and indicated that it would initiate a workshop to consider whether this issue should be the subject of a rule making.
 
Rate base was reduced to reflect the PUC's assumptions regarding the company's liability for uncertain tax positions. This change in rate base resulted in a revenue requirement reduction of approximately $17 million. However, a tractor was established to capture the revenue requirement difference between the assumed and actual tax outcome.
I might also add that our AMS investment of approximately $121 million was moved from a surcharge into base rates. This change has no effect on operating income since we were already recognizing a return on this investment under the smart meter surcharge.
Now let me update you on our advanced technology deployments. The implementation of an advanced metering system in our Houston Electric service territory is progressing well. We are currently installing over 80,000 smart meters per month, and we celebrated the installation of our 1 millionth smart meter last week. We have invested approximately $240 million through December, excluding $100 million we have requested under our DOE grant.
Houston Electric will use $50 million of the DOE grant to support our Intelligent Grid Initiative, which is also progressing well. Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory. These devices will initially allow us to automate natural gas meter readings and in the future, will enable other functionality. We expect to invest approximately $85 million on this project, which should be completed within 36 months.
Now let me turn to our Field Services business. This has been our fastest growing business segment, and we expect significant growth to continue for the next few years. As you recall, we are building two major systems to gather and create production for Shell and in Encana in the Haynesville Shale. The first 700 million cubic foot per day phase of the Magnolia System is complete except for well connects. Construction of the Olympia System and the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia System are progressing on schedule and on budget. By the end of the first quarter of this year, we expect to have both of these projects substantially completed except for pipeline interconnections scheduled for later this year and well connects. This will bring the total capacity of these two systems to 1.5 Bcf per day.
The Shell and Encana contracts provide for annual throughput guarantees upon completion of various milestones that have been or will be achieved throughout 2011. The initial phase of the Magnolia System is flowing at close to contracted volume capacity. We expect throughput on the Olympia System and the Magnolia expansion to increase over the course of the year and be at system capacity by early 2012.
Once we complete construction of the current phases of the Magnolia and Olympia Systems, our total investment will be approximately $800 million. Shell and and Encana have expansion rights for another 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of capacity, which would cost up to an additional $450 million to construct. For planning purposes, we are assuming that about half the expansion rights will be executed over the next five years.
I would also add that we continued to expect mid-teen unlevered return from these investments once production is ramped up to near the contracted capacity.
Now let me review the company's overall operating results for the fourth quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $124 million for the fourth quarter or $0.29 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $105 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the same period of 2009. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $302 million compared to $299 million for the same period of 2009. Houston Electric's operating income declined by $5 million primarily related to increased expenses for our reliability programs, the timing of energy efficiency expenditures and unplanned environmental remediation costs.
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment reported a $13 million decline in operating income. This decline was driven by lower system throughput due to milder weather, higher expenses and improved rate designs that shifted base revenues into the second and third quarters. 
Operating income for our Interstate Pipelines segment was essentially the same as 2009 as higher revenues, primarily from firm contracts associated with Phase 4 of the Carthage to Perryville pipeline, were offset by lower revenues from ancillary services.
Increased operating income of $35 million in our Field Services segment included a $21 million gain related to the sale of a small nonstrategic gathering system in the Texas panhandle. The additional increase in operating income was primarily related to new facilities in the Haynesville Shale constructed since the previous year.
Operating income at our Energy Services business declined $21 million due to increased mark-to-market losses on derivative contracts and a contraction in seasonal price differentials. 
Finally, net income for the quarter benefited from a $24 million reduction in deferred tax expense due to the conversion of certain subsidiaries of cert to LLCs.
Now let me turn to our full year 2010 performance. Our reported net income for 2010 was $442 million, a $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $372 million, a $1.01 per diluted share for 2009. Operating income was $1.25 billion in 2010, an increase of more than $125 million or 11% from 2009. Houston Electric reported operating income of $427 million for 2010 compared to $414 million for 2009. This increase was primarily the result of customer growth, increased usage in part due to favorable weather and increased earnings associated with our smart meter investment. Partially offsetting these increases was a $21 million reduction in revenues associated with the credit to customers' bills reflecting the benefit of deferred taxes associated with Hurricane Ike storm restoration cost. We also experienced increased operating expenses due primarily to system reliability programs, increased employee-related expenses and environmental remediation cost. It is worth noting that even in a relatively weak economy, we added nearly 28,000 customers in 2010, a growth rate of about 1.3%.
As we look to 2011, we expect customer growth will be at or a little better than what we experienced in 2010, which has helped to offset the estimated $20 million partial year impact from the rate case decision and expected expense increases. The bottom line is I expect Houston Electric to be down some from 2010, absent increased usage from weather or other developments.
2010 was an exceptional year for our Natural Gas Distribution business, which reported operating income of $231 million compared to $204 million in 2009. Operating income benefited from rate changes, lower pension and benefit costs and lower bad debt expense. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher operating expenses, including an increase in depreciation. 
Over the last several years, this business has worked diligently on reducing customer delinquencies and bad debt expense and is also focused on obtaining necessary rate increases and improving rate design. I'm pleased to say that we continued to see the benefits of those efforts in 2010.
As we move into 2011, we believe this unit is poised for another good year. We expect to finalize one small rate case this year, which together with a number of annual rate adjustments, should provide some revenue uplift. Our focus will also continue to be on operational improvements and expense control.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported operating income of $16 million for 2010 compared to $21 million for 2009. 
Excluding mark-to-market gains and losses and natural gas inventory write-downs, our Energy Services business would have reported operating income of $18 million compared to $50 million for 2009. This decline was principally the result of reduced wholesale opportunities because of significantly tighter locational price differentials and an absence of seasonal storage spreads. Last year, our retail sales were stable and we added more than 1,000 customers to our total customer base.
We expect our retail business to see improvement this year. We believe we have stabilized our wholesale business and expect some marginal improvement. Absent the effects of mark-to-market impacts and inventory adjustments, we expect 2011 to be a better year than 2010 for Energy Services.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services. Our Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $270 million for 2010 compared to $256 million for 2009. Our core business continues to perform well, building on its strong fee-based foundation with increased margins from our Carthage to Perryville pipeline as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve power generation facilities on our system. Our fee-based margin grew by 4%, but this growth was partially offset by reduced revenues from ancillary services and off-system sales.
Our equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $19 million. This compares to equity income of $7 million in 2009, which was reduced by a $16 million noncash charge due to the discontinued use of regulatory accounting. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we have a backhaul agreement that terminates in the middle of 2011, which will reduce revenues and will also impact the fuel efficiency of Line CP. Offsetting this decline is the addition of about 100 million cubic feet of Line CP capacity available on a forward-haul basis. The overall impact is expected to be about $20 million. To date, we have not secured sufficient new contract revenues to fully offset this impact.
We also have some expense pressures stemming from EPA regulations. So without the benefit of higher ancillary revenues this year, which would be driven primarily by change in market conditions, it will be difficult for our Pipeline business to match the operating income we earned in 2010.
Our Field Services unit reported operating income of $151 million for 2010 compared to $94 million for 2009. Operating income for 2010 included the $21 million gain associated with the small gathering system we sold in the fourth quarter. The remaining $36 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of the new long-term agreements with subsidiaries of Shell and Encana. Gathering volumes were up significantly in 2010 compared to 2009. Average gathering volumes in 2010 were 1.8 Bcf per day, an increase of more than 50% from 2009.
For the month of December 2010, gathering volumes averaged a little over 2 Bcf per day. As we reported last quarter, gathering volumes from our traditional basins have leveled off. Fourth quarter volumes were flat to the fourth quarter of 2009. For the year, traditional volumes were down about 8%. 
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $10 million from our jointly owned Waskom facilities compared to $8 million the previous year. As we look to 2011, we expect Haynesville production to increase steadily over the year, and we also expect some increased volumes in the Fayetteville and Woodford shales. We are assuming flat volumes from our traditional fields. Our fee-based revenues will increase as we achieve the milestones for the Olympia System and the Magnolia expansion. Overall, we expect Field Services to achieve significant increases in operating income.
Taking into account the performance of all of our business units, I believe that our company performed very well in 2010. I would like to acknowledge the dedication of our employees as they work hard not only to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, but to strengthen business relationships and capture new business opportunities. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our overall financial flexibility and strength. As a result of these collective efforts, I believe the company is well positioned to capture opportunities this year and beyond.
Looking to the future, we expect to benefit from our balanced portfolio of Electric and Natural Gas businesses. Near term, Field Services will continue to enjoy the benefits of capital investment opportunities in the shale plays. Longer term, growing service territory should provide good investment opportunities for our regulated businesses. In his remarks, Gary will provide our overall earnings guidance for 2011.
In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $0.1975 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 20. This marks the sixth consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I'd like to discuss a few items with you. First, we are very pleased with the steps we have taken during the year to strengthen our balance sheet and to enhance our credit metrics to ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. Excluding securitization debt, we reduced our corporate consolidated debt from $7 billion to $6.7 billion at year-end 2010 while funding a capital program of $1.46 billion. Our debt to total capitalization improved from approximately 73% to 67%.
In 2010, we raised $416 million of additional equity with the issuance of 33 million shares of common stock. Of this amount, $315 million was associated with an underwritten equity offering executed in conjunction with the announcement of our Field Services business signing excellent long-term agreements with Shell and Encana. The remaining shares were issued as part of our savings plan, dividend reinvestment plan and various benefit programs. At this time, based on the significant steps we have taken the past two years to strengthen our balance sheet and the significant cash we generate from our operations, we have suspended the use of original issue shares for the savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan. Instead, shares will be purchased on the open market to fund these plans.
Now let me discuss our capital spending plan for 2011 in total and by segment. We estimate our 2011 CapEx to be $1.34 billion, a decrease of $125 million from 2010. About 77% or a little more than $1 billion of CapEx this year will be spent by our regulated businesses compared to 52% in 2010.
Let me give you a breakdown by business. We expect to spend $605 million in our Electric business, an increase of $142 million from 2009, primarily related to our advanced metering and intelligent grid deployments. We expect to spend $263 million in our Natural Gas Distribution business, reflecting an increase of $61 million from 2010 primarily for the remote electronic transmitters that David referred to in his comments, as well as increased spending on improvements related to safety and system reliability. Our pipeline's capital budget is $157 million, which is above the 2010 level of $102 million due primarily to increased maintenance capital and additional spending to ensure compliance with certain EPA rules.
Our capital budget for Field Services is $262 million, which is a reduction of $406 million from 2010 as we have completed a significant portion of the spending on the build out of the Shell and Encana projects. This estimate does not include any new capital, which may be required if we were to have a new significant opportunity either in or outside of our current footprint. Along these lines, we have been asked about our financing strategy for any new significant investment in our midstream businesses. Specifically, whether we are considering the formation of an MLP as a financing option. We think the formation of an MLP could be an efficient way to finance new growth as compared to selling common equity. However, our focus has been and will continue to be on executing the optimum financing plan for the company based on our particular circumstances.
For example, before forming an MLP, we would need to be confident that there would not be a material negative impact to the credit ratings of the parent company or our utilities subsidiaries.
Now let me discuss our current financing activities and financing plan. Thus far in 2011, we have taken two important steps to refinance debt maturities at CERC. First, in early January, CERC should $250 million of 10-year 4.5% senior notes and $300 million of 30-year 5.85% senior notes. The offering was very well received by the market, and we were able to price both series of notes well below the indicative secondary levels. Proceeds from the sale of the notes were used for the repayment of the $550 million of 7.75% CERC notes that matured in February. Obviously, we are very pleased to have the opportunity to replace this 7.75% coupon in CERC with debt having a much lower rate.
Also in January, CERC issued an additional $343 million of 10-year 4.5% senior notes and provided cash consideration of $114 million in exchange for 52% of the outstanding $762 million of 7.875% notes due in 2013. We are very pleased with the results of this exchange offer. It has allowed us to significantly reduce the size of the CERC maturity that we were otherwise facing in 2013 and to do so by locking in a refinancing rate on the new CERC debt that is very attractive on an historical basis. So we have both lowered the weighted average coupon on CERC's debt portfolio and extended the average maturity of the debt portfolio. I would also note that we have no material maturities until 2013 at either the parent or its two operating subsidiaries.
Let me mention that our various revolving credit facilities terminate in late June of 2012. Consequently, we expect to syndicate new revolving credit facilities later this year. The bank market continues to improve, and we will be seeking to put in place new revolving credit facilities with the appropriate size and tenor with the optimum pricing.
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2011 earnings guidance. This morning, in our earnings release, we announced 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. I would like to highlight a few of our more important economic and commodity price assumptions behind the business unit performance expectations David discussed in his comment.
Our expectation is that the overall U.S. economy will continue to recover in line with consensus economic forecast. But the economy in much of our service territories in particular, Texas, is expected to improve a little more quickly than the broader U.S. economy. As for our assumption relative to natural gas prices, we have assumed a forecast in line with the industry consensus, which is approximately $4 per MMBTU. Our forecast does not reflect a material change in natural gas liquids pricing from 2010 levels.
We expect the interest expense to decline in 2011 compared to 2010 based on our recent completed refinancing, and we expect the overall tax rate to be 38% for the year. The share count for the EPS calculation will reflect the full impact of the shares issued in 2010. Our year-end share count was approximately 428 million shares compared to the average share count of 413 million in 2010. This increase in share count impacts diluted EPS by approximately $0.04.
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

As you know, I've told you in the past that we believe our retail business produces operating income in the $30 million to $35 million range. And our wholesale business, in the past, has added operating income above that. We clearly didn't make any money. We, in fact, lost some money in the wholesale business in 2010. Now part of the reason, I believe we're going to do better is, some of the pipeline capacity that we have under contract terminates this year. And so we're not going to have to try to find ways to offset that fixed expense. It's just going to go away, but we're also taking a much different approach to that business. Our goal is to make sure we fully realize the retail businesses' profitability in our CenterPoint earnings and not have the wholesale business, at least in the near term where basis and seasonal price differentials are really small, impact the overall profitability of the company. So we're working hard to make the wholesale business at least breakeven, but hopefully we'll be able to produce a profit and then we'll be able to fully realized our retail business, which is really why we're in this business. We're in it to sell gas to commercial and industrial customers. We have a lot of pipeline capacity, about a Bcf scattered across the country and 10 or 11 Bcf at storage, which we use primarily to serve our retail customers. But we are able to optimize around that. And in the past, some years, we made $30 million, $40 million, $50 million on that. Those days are probably gone at least for the foreseeable future with all the pipeline capacity that's been built, the new reserves and all the storage that's coming in. You never know, there's always disruptions, as you know, weather, hurricanes, something happens that you stand ready to be opportunistic. But our base plan is not based on that. It's to, let's make sure we get the full retail business reflected in earnings and then make sure wholesale is at least breakeven."

What we're really working on with both the commission and the legislature is a distribution cost recovery factor, which would allow us to make periodic rate changes without a full rate case. Take this regulatory lag out from all the capital we're spending and absent the AMS investment, we're still spending $400-plus million a year. And that has a regulatory impact. So our focus is to try to get this distribution cost recovery factor, give the commission the authority to do it. They took this rule up late last year and decided to not go forward with it until the legislature took a look at it. But that's our focus today as opposed to filing a full rate case to see if we can't get that done in this legislative session."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, I will talk about some significant developments that occurred during the fourth quarter and provide details around certain business operations that I believe are of interest to many of you. I will also briefly describe our overall financial results for the quarter, followed by a more comprehensive discussion of our annual results of each of our businesses and our expectations for 2011.
Let me begin with our recent Houston electric rate case. The Texas PUC [Public Utility Commission] announced its decision in early February, but has yet to render a written order, so our description is somewhat limited. Although the cash flow impact from this case should be minimal, we anticipate that the decision will have an estimated $25 million to $30 million annualized negative impact on Houston Electric's operating income. We are obviously disappointed in this result. Let me give you a few of the details of the decision, as we understand them today.
Rates will be based on a capital structure reflecting 45% equity, up from the current level of 40%. The return on equity was set at 10%. This is an 0.125% to 0.25% lower than the rates most recently authorized for other Texas utilities and reduced the positive effects of the higher equity ratio. We are very disappointed in this aspect of the PUC's decision. The commission reduced Houston Electric's revenue requirement by about $10 million to reflect tax savings in other CenterPoint businesses. This is commonly referred to as the consolidated tax savings adjustment. While it had been -- previously been the practice of the commission to make this type of an adjustment, it did not do so in the recent Oncor case, and we were hopeful the commission would follow the precedent set in that case. The commission had a lengthy discussion about the calculation and indicated that it would initiate a workshop to consider whether this issue should be the subject of a rule making.
 
Rate base was reduced to reflect the PUC's assumptions regarding the company's liability for uncertain tax positions. This change in rate base resulted in a revenue requirement reduction of approximately $17 million. However, a tractor was established to capture the revenue requirement difference between the assumed and actual tax outcome.
I might also add that our AMS investment of approximately $121 million was moved from a surcharge into base rates. This change has no effect on operating income since we were already recognizing a return on this investment under the smart meter surcharge.
Now let me update you on our advanced technology deployments. The implementation of an advanced metering system in our Houston Electric service territory is progressing well. We are currently installing over 80,000 smart meters per month, and we celebrated the installation of our 1 millionth smart meter last week. We have invested approximately $240 million through December, excluding $100 million we have requested under our DOE grant.
Houston Electric will use $50 million of the DOE grant to support our Intelligent Grid Initiative, which is also progressing well. Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory. These devices will initially allow us to automate natural gas meter readings and in the future, will enable other functionality. We expect to invest approximately $85 million on this project, which should be completed within 36 months.
Now let me turn to our Field Services business. This has been our fastest growing business segment, and we expect significant growth to continue for the next few years. As you recall, we are building two major systems to gather and create production for Shell and in Encana in the Haynesville Shale. The first 700 million cubic foot per day phase of the Magnolia System is complete except for well connects. Construction of the Olympia System and the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia System are progressing on schedule and on budget. By the end of the first quarter of this year, we expect to have both of these projects substantially completed except for pipeline interconnections scheduled for later this year and well connects. This will bring the total capacity of these two systems to 1.5 Bcf per day.
The Shell and Encana contracts provide for annual throughput guarantees upon completion of various milestones that have been or will be achieved throughout 2011. The initial phase of the Magnolia System is flowing at close to contracted volume capacity. We expect throughput on the Olympia System and the Magnolia expansion to increase over the course of the year and be at system capacity by early 2012.
Once we complete construction of the current phases of the Magnolia and Olympia Systems, our total investment will be approximately $800 million. Shell and Encana have expansion rights for another 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of capacity, which would cost up to an additional $450 million to construct. For planning purposes, we are assuming that about half the expansion rights will be executed over the next five years.
I would also add that we continued to expect mid-teen unlevered return from these investments once production is ramped up to near the contracted capacity.
Now let me review the company's overall operating results for the fourth quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $124 million for the fourth quarter or $0.29 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $105 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the same period of 2009. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $302 million compared to $299 million for the same period of 2009. Houston Electric's operating income declined by $5 million primarily related to increased expenses for our reliability programs, the timing of energy efficiency expenditures and unplanned environmental remediation costs.
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment reported a $13 million decline in operating income. This decline was driven by lower system throughput due to milder weather, higher expenses and improved rate designs that shifted base revenues into the second and third quarters. 
Operating income for our Interstate Pipelines segment was essentially the same as 2009 as higher revenues, primarily from firm contracts associated with Phase 4 of the Carthage to Perryville pipeline, were offset by lower revenues from ancillary services.
Increased operating income of $35 million in our Field Services segment included a $21 million gain related to the sale of a small nonstrategic gathering system in the Texas panhandle. The additional increase in operating income was primarily related to new facilities in the Haynesville Shale constructed since the previous year.
Operating income at our Energy Services business declined $21 million due to increased mark-to-market losses on derivative contracts and a contraction in seasonal price differentials. 
Finally, net income for the quarter benefited from a $24 million reduction in deferred tax expense due to the conversion of certain subsidiaries of cert to LLCs.
Now let me turn to our full year 2010 performance. Our reported net income for 2010 was $442 million, a $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $372 million, a $1.01 per diluted share for 2009. Operating income was $1.25 billion in 2010, an increase of more than $125 million or 11% from 2009. Houston Electric reported operating income of $427 million for 2010 compared to $414 million for 2009. This increase was primarily the result of customer growth, increased usage in part due to favorable weather and increased earnings associated with our smart meter investment. Partially offsetting these increases was a $21 million reduction in revenues associated with the credit to customers' bills reflecting the benefit of deferred taxes associated with Hurricane Ike storm restoration cost. We also experienced increased operating expenses due primarily to system reliability programs, increased employee-related expenses and environmental remediation cost. It is worth noting that even in a relatively weak economy, we added nearly 28,000 customers in 2010, a growth rate of about 1.3%.
As we look to 2011, we expect customer growth will be at or a little better than what we experienced in 2010, which has helped to offset the estimated $20 million partial year impact from the rate case decision and expected expense increases. The bottom line is I expect Houston Electric to be down some from 2010, absent increased usage from weather or other developments.
2010 was an exceptional year for our Natural Gas Distribution business, which reported operating income of $231 million compared to $204 million in 2009. Operating income benefited from rate changes, lower pension and benefit costs and lower bad debt expense. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher operating expenses, including an increase in depreciation. 
Over the last several years, this business has worked diligently on reducing customer delinquencies and bad debt expense and is also focused on obtaining necessary rate increases and improving rate design. I'm pleased to say that we continued to see the benefits of those efforts in 2010.
As we move into 2011, we believe this unit is poised for another good year. We expect to finalize one small rate case this year, which together with a number of annual rate adjustments, should provide some revenue uplift. Our focus will also continue to be on operational improvements and expense control.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported operating income of $16 million for 2010 compared to $21 million for 2009. 
Excluding mark-to-market gains and losses and natural gas inventory write-downs, our Energy Services business would have reported operating income of $18 million compared to $50 million for 2009. This decline was principally the result of reduced wholesale opportunities because of significantly tighter locational price differentials and an absence of seasonal storage spreads. Last year, our retail sales were stable and we added more than 1,000 customers to our total customer base.
We expect our retail business to see improvement this year. We believe we have stabilized our wholesale business and expect some marginal improvement. Absent the effects of mark-to-market impacts and inventory adjustments, we expect 2011 to be a better year than 2010 for Energy Services.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services. Our Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $270 million for 2010 compared to $256 million for 2009. Our core business continues to perform well, building on its strong fee-based foundation with increased margins from our Carthage to Perryville pipeline as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve power generation facilities on our system. Our fee-based margin grew by 4%, but this growth was partially offset by reduced revenues from ancillary services and off-system sales.
Our equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $19 million. This compares to equity income of $7 million in 2009, which was reduced by a $16 million noncash charge due to the discontinued use of regulatory accounting. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we have a backhaul agreement that terminates in the middle of 2011, which will reduce revenues and will also impact the fuel efficiency of Line CP. Offsetting this decline is the addition of about 100 million cubic feet of Line CP capacity available on a forward-haul basis. The overall impact is expected to be about $20 million. To date, we have not secured sufficient new contract revenues to fully offset this impact.
We also have some expense pressures stemming from EPA regulations. So without the benefit of higher ancillary revenues this year, which would be driven primarily by change in market conditions, it will be difficult for our Pipeline business to match the operating income we earned in 2010.
Our Field Services unit reported operating income of $151 million for 2010 compared to $94 million for 2009. Operating income for 2010 included the $21 million gain associated with the small gathering system we sold in the fourth quarter. The remaining $36 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of the new long-term agreements with subsidiaries of Shell and Encana. Gathering volumes were up significantly in 2010 compared to 2009. Average gathering volumes in 2010 were 1.8 Bcf per day, an increase of more than 50% from 2009.
For the month of December 2010, gathering volumes averaged a little over 2 Bcf per day. As we reported last quarter, gathering volumes from our traditional basins have leveled off. Fourth quarter volumes were flat to the fourth quarter of 2009. For the year, traditional volumes were down about 8%. 
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $10 million from our jointly owned Waskom facilities compared to $8 million the previous year. As we look to 2011, we expect Haynesville production to increase steadily over the year, and we also expect some increased volumes in the Fayetteville and Woodford shales. We are assuming flat volumes from our traditional fields. Our fee-based revenues will increase as we achieve the milestones for the Olympia System and the Magnolia expansion. Overall, we expect Field Services to achieve significant increases in operating income.
Taking into account the performance of all of our business units, I believe that our company performed very well in 2010. I would like to acknowledge the dedication of our employees as they work hard not only to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, but to strengthen business relationships and capture new business opportunities. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our overall financial flexibility and strength. As a result of these collective efforts, I believe the company is well positioned to capture opportunities this year and beyond.
Looking to the future, we expect to benefit from our balanced portfolio of Electric and Natural Gas businesses. Near term, Field Services will continue to enjoy the benefits of capital investment opportunities in the shale plays. Longer term, growing service territory should provide good investment opportunities for our regulated businesses. In his remarks, Gary will provide our overall earnings guidance for 2011.
In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $0.1975 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 20. This marks the sixth consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I'd like to discuss a few items with you. First, we are very pleased with the steps we have taken during the year to strengthen our balance sheet and to enhance our credit metrics to ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. Excluding securitization debt, we reduced our corporate consolidated debt from $7 billion to $6.7 billion at year-end 2010 while funding a capital program of $1.46 billion. Our debt to total capitalization improved from approximately 73% to 67%.
In 2010, we raised $416 million of additional equity with the issuance of 33 million shares of common stock. Of this amount, $315 million was associated with an underwritten equity offering executed in conjunction with the announcement of our Field Services business signing excellent long-term agreements with Shell and Encana. The remaining shares were issued as part of our savings plan, dividend reinvestment plan and various benefit programs. At this time, based on the significant steps we have taken the past two years to strengthen our balance sheet and the significant cash we generate from our operations, we have suspended the use of original issue shares for the savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan. Instead, shares will be purchased on the open market to fund these plans.
Now let me discuss our capital spending plan for 2011 in total and by segment. We estimate our 2011 CapEx to be $1.34 billion, a decrease of $125 million from 2010. About 77% or a little more than $1 billion of CapEx this year will be spent by our regulated businesses compared to 52% in 2010.
Let me give you a breakdown by business. We expect to spend $605 million in our Electric business, an increase of $142 million from 2009, primarily related to our advanced metering and intelligent grid deployments. We expect to spend $263 million in our Natural Gas Distribution business, reflecting an increase of $61 million from 2010 primarily for the remote electronic transmitters that David referred to in his comments, as well as increased spending on improvements related to safety and system reliability. Our pipeline's capital budget is $157 million, which is above the 2010 level of $102 million due primarily to increased maintenance capital and additional spending to ensure compliance with certain EPA rules.
Our capital budget for Field Services is $262 million, which is a reduction of $406 million from 2010 as we have completed a significant portion of the spending on the build out of the Shell and Encana projects. This estimate does not include any new capital, which may be required if we were to have a new significant opportunity either in or outside of our current footprint. Along these lines, we have been asked about our financing strategy for any new significant investment in our midstream businesses. Specifically, whether we are considering the formation of an MLP as a financing option. We think the formation of an MLP could be an efficient way to finance new growth as compared to selling common equity. However, our focus has been and will continue to be on executing the optimum financing plan for the company based on our particular circumstances.
For example, before forming an MLP, we would need to be confident that there would not be a material negative impact to the credit ratings of the parent company or our utilities subsidiaries.
Now let me discuss our current financing activities and financing plan. Thus far in 2011, we have taken two important steps to refinance debt maturities at CERC. First, in early January, CERC should $250 million of 10-year 4.5% senior notes and $300 million of 30-year 5.85% senior notes. The offering was very well received by the market, and we were able to price both series of notes well below the indicative secondary levels. Proceeds from the sale of the notes were used for the repayment of the $550 million of 7.75% CERC notes that matured in February. Obviously, we are very pleased to have the opportunity to replace this 7.75% coupon in CERC with debt having a much lower rate.
Also in January, CERC issued an additional $343 million of 10-year 4.5% senior notes and provided cash consideration of $114 million in exchange for 52% of the outstanding $762 million of 7.875% notes due in 2013. We are very pleased with the results of this exchange offer. It has allowed us to significantly reduce the size of the CERC maturity that we were otherwise facing in 2013 and to do so by locking in a refinancing rate on the new CERC debt that is very attractive on an historical basis. So we have both lowered the weighted average coupon on CERC's debt portfolio and extended the average maturity of the debt portfolio. I would also note that we have no material maturities until 2013 at either the parent or its two operating subsidiaries.
Let me mention that our various revolving credit facilities terminate in late June of 2012. Consequently, we expect to syndicate new revolving credit facilities later this year. The bank market continues to improve, and we will be seeking to put in place new revolving credit facilities with the appropriate size and tenor with the optimum pricing.
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2011 earnings guidance. This morning, in our earnings release, we announced 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. I would like to highlight a few of our more important economic and commodity price assumptions behind the business unit performance expectations David discussed in his comment.
Our expectation is that the overall U.S. economy will continue to recover in line with consensus economic forecast. But the economy in much of our service territories in particular, Texas, is expected to improve a little more quickly than the broader U.S. economy. As for our assumption relative to natural gas prices, we have assumed a forecast in line with the industry consensus, which is approximately $4 per MMBTU. Our forecast does not reflect a material change in natural gas liquids pricing from 2010 levels.
We expect the interest expense to decline in 2011 compared to 2010 based on our recent completed refinancing, and we expect the overall tax rate to be 38% for the year. The share count for the EPS calculation will reflect the full impact of the shares issued in 2010. Our year-end share count was approximately 428 million shares compared to the average share count of 413 million in 2010. This increase in share count impacts diluted EPS by approximately $0.04.
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

And if you could also give us some more color -- if we look back on prior years, again pre-mark-to-market, there's been a pretty robust earnings range prior and so when you say you expect to do better in 2011, is that nominally or are you thinking that it's going to get back to something like 2009, for instance?"

As you know, I've told you in the past that we believe our retail business produces operating income in the $30 million to $35 million range. And our wholesale business, in the past, has added operating income above that. We clearly didn't make any money. We, in fact, lost some money in the wholesale business in 2010. Now part of the reason, I believe we're going to do better is, some of the pipeline capacity that we have under contract terminates this year. And so we're not going to have to try to find ways to offset that fixed expense. It's just going to go away, but we're also taking a much different approach to that business. Our goal is to make sure we fully realize the retail businesses' profitability in our CenterPoint earnings and not have the wholesale business, at least in the near term where basis and seasonal price differentials are really small, impact the overall profitability of the company. So we're working hard to make the wholesale business at least breakeven, but hopefully we'll be able to produce a profit and then we'll be able to fully realized our retail business, which is really why we're in this business. We're in it to sell gas to commercial and industrial customers. We have a lot of pipeline capacity, about a Bcf scattered across the country and 10 or 11 Bcf at storage, which we use primarily to serve our retail customers. But we are able to optimize around that. And in the past, some years, we made $30 million, $40 million, $50 million on that. Those days are probably gone at least for the foreseeable future with all the pipeline capacity that's been built, the new reserves and all the storage that's coming in. You never know, there's always disruptions, as you know, weather, hurricanes, something happens that you stand ready to be opportunistic. But our base plan is not based on that. It's to, let's make sure we get the full retail business reflected in earnings and then make sure wholesale is at least breakeven."

But that's our focus today as opposed to filing a full rate case to see if we can't get that done in this legislative session."

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, I will talk about significant development that occurred during the first quarter and discuss our first quarter financial results and provide the operating results for each of our business segments.
Let me begin with the discussion of our true-up appeal. As most of you probably know, the 1999 law, which restructured the electric industry in Texas allowed electric utilities to recover stranded costs and certain another transition expenses in what is known as a true-up receiving. In 2005, the Texas PUC issued the disposition that fail to allow us to recover some of the costs to which we believe we are entitled. 
As a result, we took a $947 million after-tax extraordinary loss and appealed the PEC decision. The appeal was heard in the district court, followed by the Court of Appeals and finally the Texas Supreme Court. On March 18, the Supreme Court issued its decision in our true-up appeal. The court the PC and a number of points and demanded the case back to the commission for implementation. As a result of the decision of the Supreme Court, enough the earlier decision by the Court of Appeals, we will be able to seek and demand preceding recovery of the following: $210 million of excess litigation credits paid to retail electric providers, $146 million of deferred federal income taxes that had reduced stranded costs, $378 million in depreciation and $414 million from the capacity auction true-up.
The Supreme Court also determined that the PEC should have valued our generation assets for stranded costs purposes, by using the subsequent sales price of those assets. This decision reduced the amount we can seek to recover by $252 million. The net result of the court's decision is approximately $922 million in additional stranded cost and transition expenses. 
A number of parties have asked for a rehearing of the Supreme Court's decision. The court has 180 days to act on those motions or they are denied.
Based on the court's decision, we believe we are entitled to seek recovery of approximately $1.85 billion in the proceedings. We conclude the calculation of interest through the third quarter of this year. We will also seek a financing order from the PUC to allow us to issue transition bonds to recover the allowed amounts. While there is no statutory deadline for the PUC to act on the remand, interest on the unrecovered true-up balance will continue to accrue at a rate of about 8% until the transition bonds are issued. In his remarks, Gary will discuss the expected accounting treatment and cash flow impact of the true-up decision.
Now let me review the company's overall results for the first quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $148 million or $0.35 per diluted share, this compares to net income of $114 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010. Operating income for the first quarter was $364 million, compared to $357 million last year. We also reported lower interest expense in federal income taxes this year compared to the first quarter of 2010.
Houston Electric had a solid quarter reporting operating income of $68 million, about $3 million below the first quarter of 2010. Operating income benefited from growth of more than 29,000 customers since the first quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of about 1.4%, and an indication that our service territory continues to rebound.
Outplaying the benefit of customer growth were higher operating expenses, due primarily to system reliability programs. The first quarter results do not reflect the impact of our recent Houston Electric rate case. The Texas PUC approved the final order in its open meeting last week, but the signed order has yet to be issued. We do not expect new to be implemented during before the third quarter. 
As I indicated earlier this year, the cash flow impact from this case should be minimal, but we anticipate Houston Electric's operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately $30 million on an annualized basis.
Our Natural Gas Distribution business had another good quarter, reporting operating income of $142 million or about $3 million above the first quarter of last year. This increase resulted primarily from lower bad debt expense, partially offset by increases in other operating expenses. Last month, the Texas Railroad Commission approved the rate settlement that is expected to result in increased annual revenues of approximately $4.6 million in our South Texas service territory. 
We had requested an increase of a little over $6 million. The new rates were implemented this month. We are progressing well in the implementation of advanced metering technology in both our Electric and Natural Gas Distribution utilities in Houston. Houston Electric is now a little over halfway through the deployment of its advanced metering system, having installed approximately 1.2 million smart meters. 
We expect this deployment to be completed in the middle of 2012. Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territories, and expect to be completed in the first half of 2013. This new technology is expected to enhance the information available to our customers, and significantly improve the operating efficiency of these business units.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reporting operating income of $10 million compared to $15 million for the first quarter of 2010. After adjusting from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives, both quarters' operating income would have been approximately $12 million. Our Retail division had a good quarter, experiencing increases in both the number of customers it serves and sales volumes. Although our Wholesale division continues to face a challenging business environment, we expect to see some improvement over last year. 
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services. Both of these units reported results ahead of last year. Our Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $76 million compared to $72 million for the first quarter of 2010. Our core business continues to perform well with increased margin from our Carthage to Perryville pipeline, as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve the power generation facilities on our system. Ancillary services revenues however were below levels of last year. 
Operating expenses were lower than the first quarter of last year, principally the result of an interim settlement recorded in the first quarter of this year. Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $4 million compared to $3 million in the first quarter of 2010. Our Field Services unit reported operating income of $36 million compared to $23 million for the first quarter of 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of long-term agreements with subsidiaries of shale and in Canada. 
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $2 million for both the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 from our jointly owned Waskom facilities.
our gathering volumes were up significantly this quarter. Average gathering volumes were a little over 2 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of about 43% from the first quarter of last year. Gathering volumes related to shale reserves accounted for about 60% of our total volume this year compared to 32% last year. Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were down about 15% from the first quarter of last year and about 5% from the most recent quarter. Drilling activity in these areas continues to be modest.
The major systems together and create production in the Haynesville shale continue to progress well. The first 700 million cubic feet per day face of the Magnolia System is now complete, except for well connects. In the first quarter this year, we substantially completed construction of the 600 million cubic feet per day Olympia System, and the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia System, both on schedule and on budget. There are still several pipeline interconnections and additional well connects remaining to be completed.
During the first quarter, throughput on the Magnolia System averaged approximately 550 million cubic feet per day, and the Olympia System average over 300 million cubic feet per day. We expect throughput on these 2 systems to increase over the course of the year and meet systems capacity by early 2012.
As you may recall, the Shell and Encana contracts provide for a step-up of annual throughput guarantees as certain milestones are reached. Various milestones are expected to be achieved during 2011, and by early next year, the annual throughput guarantees will be contracted capacities.
For planning purposes, we are assuming that about half of the remaining 1.3 billion cubic feet per day in expansion rights will be elected over the next 5 years. In addition to the Haynesville shale area, we also realized throughput growth of about 34% in areas that include the Fayetteville and Woodford shales, driven principally by projects we are developing for XPO Energy, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil. Over the last 2 years, we deployed over $140 million for scalable projects in the Woodford and Fayetteville shales, and are positioned to build additional  facilities over time to meet our customers needs. 
Overall, our company performed well this quarter. In his remarks, Gary will discuss our earnings guidance for 2011.
In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $19.75 per share quarterly dividend declared by our board of directors on April 21. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the company and the board of directors as to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."
279513,129483947,122727,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone.  Today I would like to discuss the accounting impact and the Supreme Court's decision on the true-up case.

Today I would like to discuss the accounting impact and the Supreme Court's decision on the true-up case. As Dave mentioned in his remarks, on the basis of the Supreme Court's March 18 decision, we plan to seek to recover approximately $1.85 billion, to authorize securitization bond. The $1.85 billion includes interests through September 30, certain cost associated with the sale of our generating assets in an adjustment associated with the benefit of the access. This entire amount will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the rate of approximately 36%. Although we will receive the cash when the securitization bonds are issued, these taxes will be paid over the line for the bonds, as we collect this amount from customers. 
As you know, we cannot be certain when the Supreme Court will dispose of the motions for rehearing, or when do PUC will issue its order on the re- man in the necessary financing order. However, for purposes of this discussion, I assume that the $1.85 billion of bonds are issued on September 30. If the bonds are issued later than September 30, interest will continue to accrue at approximately 8%. 
Let me explain how the $1.85 billion will be recorded. Assuming a 36% tax rate, we expect to recognize just under $1.2 billion in after-tax earnings and this and amount will be recognized in 2 different time frames. Once the decision is finalized, the company will immediately recognize after-tax earnings of approximately $830 million to reflect the recovery of additional strength in cost and transition expenses, plus the debt component of the interest amount, offset by the benefit of deferred taxes. 
The equity component of the interest demand, which we estimate to be approximately $365 million after taxes, would not be recognized upfront, but will be recognized over the life of the securitization bonds. Regarding the use of the proceeds from the sale of the securitization bonds, our fundamental objectives have not changed. We will continue to seek opportunities to invest on accretive projects, and in the balance sheet. Depending upon the timing and availability of these opportunities, we may also consider a modest stock buyback.
Now let me adjust to reset positive credit rating developments. Following the Texas Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, placed under review for possible upgrade the ratings of CenterPoint Energy and our subsidiary, CEN. During the course of his review with you for his next few months, we will assess the financial impact and the Supreme Court ruling, including our plans for the securitization proceeds.
Last month, SEP announced corporate credit rating of BBB, but also revised the ratings outlook on Centerpoint Energy, CE and Cirque to positive from stable. In the release, the company announced the SEP's stated rating action results from improvements in Centerpoint business and financial risk profile, that may support higher rating, and certification as Centerpoint will realize the proceeds expected to result from the Texas Supreme Court's decision in the true-up case. 
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance, we were pleased by our overall business performance in the first quarter. And this morning, we reaffirmed 2011 earnings guidance in a range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. This guidance does not include the earnings impact of the Texas decision in our true-up case, which I discussed earlier. 
In providing earnings guidance, we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as the economic, operational and regulatory assumptions. 
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, I will talk about a significant development that occurred during the first quarter, then describe our first quarter financial results, and provide the operating results for each of our business segments. Let me begin with the discussion of our true-up appeal.
As most of you probably know, the 1999 law, which restructured the electric industry in Texas, allowed electric utilities to recover stranded costs and certain other transition expenses in what is known as a ""true-up proceeding."" In 2005, the Texas PUC issued the decision that failed to allow us to recover some of the costs to which we believe we were entitled. As a result, we took a $947 million after-tax extraordinary loss, and appealed the PUC decision. The appeal was heard in the district court, followed by the Court of Appeals and finally the Texas Supreme Court. On March 18, the Supreme Court issued its decision in our true-up appeal.
The court reversed the PUC on a number of points and remanded the case back to the commission for implementation. As a result of the decision of the Supreme Court and of the earlier decision by the Court of Appeals, we will be able to seek in the remand proceeding recovery of the following: $210 million of excess mitigation credits paid to retail electric providers; $146 million of deferred federal income taxes that had reduced stranded costs; $378 million in depreciation; and $414 million from the capacity auction true-up. The Supreme Court also determined that the PUC should have valued our generation assets for stranded cost purposes by using the subsequent sales price of those assets. This decision reduced the amount we can seek to recover by $252 million. The net result of the court's decision is approximately $922 million in additional stranded costs and transition expenses. 
A number of parties have asked for a rehearing of the Supreme Court's decision. The court has 180 days to act on those motions, or they are denied.
Based on the court's decision, we believe we are entitled to seek recovery of approximately $1.85 billion in the remand proceedings. We conclude the calculation of interest through the third quarter of this year. We will also seek a financing order from the PUC to allow us to issue transition bonds to recover the allowed amounts. While there is no statutory deadline for the PUC to act on the remand, interest on the unrecovered true-up balance will continue to accrue at a rate of about 8% until the transition bonds are issued. In his remarks, Gary will discuss the expected accounting treatment and cash flow impacts of the true-up decision.
Now let me review the company's overall results for the first quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $148 million or $0.35 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $114 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010. Operating income for the first quarter was $364 million, compared to $357 million last year. We also reported lower interest expense and federal income taxes this year compared to the first quarter of 2010.
Houston Electric had a solid quarter, reporting operating income of $68 million, about $3 million below the first quarter of 2010. Operating income benefited from growth of more than 29,000 customers since the first quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of about 1.4%, and is an indication that our service territory continues to rebound. Offsetting the benefit of customer growth were higher operating expenses, due primarily to system reliability programs.
The first quarter results do not reflect the impact of our recent Houston Electric rate case. The Texas PUC approved the final order at its open meeting last week, but the signed order has yet to be issued. We do not expect new tariffs to be implemented before the third quarter. 
As I indicated earlier this year, the cash flow impact from this case should be minimal, but we anticipate Houston Electric's operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately $30 million on an annualized basis.
Our Natural Gas Distribution business had another good quarter, reporting operating income of $142 million or about $3 million above the first quarter of last year. This increase resulted primarily from lower bad debt expense, partially offset by increases in other operating expenses. 
Last month, the Texas Railroad Commission approved the rate settlement that is expected to result in increased annual revenues of approximately $4.6 million in our South Texas service territory. We had requested an increase of a little over $6 million. The new rates were implemented this month.
We are progressing well in the implementation of advanced metering technology in both our Electric and Natural Gas Distribution utilities in Houston. Houston Electric is now a little over halfway through the deployment of its advanced metering system, having installed approximately 1.2 million smart meters. We expect this deployment to be completed in the middle of 2012. Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory, and expect to be completed in the first half of 2013. This new technology is expected to enhance the information available to our customers and significantly improve the operating efficiency of these business units.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported operating income of $10 million compared to $15 million for the first quarter of 2010. After adjusting from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives, both quarters' operating income would have been approximately $12 million. Our Retail division had a good quarter, experiencing increases in both the number of customers it serves and sales volumes. Although our Wholesale division continues to face a challenging business environment, we expect to see some improvement over last year. 
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services. Both of these units reported results ahead of last year. Our Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $76 million compared to $72 million for the first quarter of 2010. Our core business continues to perform well with increased margin from our Carthage to Perryville pipeline, as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve the power generation facilities on our system. Ancillary services revenues, however, were below levels of last year. 
Operating expenses were lower than the first quarter of last year, principally the result of an interim settlement recorded in the first quarter of this year. Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $4 million compared to $3 million in the first quarter of 2010. Our Field Services unit reported operating income of $36 million compared to $23 million for the first quarter of 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of the long-term agreements with subsidiaries of Shell and Encana. In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $2 million for both the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 from our jointly owned Waskom facilities.
Our gathering volumes were up significantly this quarter. Average gathering volumes were a little over 2 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of about 43% from the first quarter of last year. Gathering volumes related to shale reserves accounted for about 60% of our total volume this year, compared to 32% last year. Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were down about 15% from the first quarter of last year, and about 5% from the most recent quarter. Drilling activity in these areas continues to be modest.
The few major systems to gather and treat production in the Haynesville shale continue to progress well. The first 700 million cubic feet per day phase of the Magnolia System is now complete, except for well connects. In the first quarter of this year, we substantially completed construction of the 600 million cubic feet per day Olympia System, and the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia System, both on schedule and on budget. There are still several pipeline interconnections and additional well connects remaining to be completed. During the first quarter, throughput on the Magnolia System averaged approximately 550 million cubic feet per day, and the Olympia System averaged over 300 million cubic feet per day. We expect throughput on these 2 systems to increase over the course of the year and be at system capacity by early 2012.
As you may recall, the Shell and Encana contracts provide for a step-up of annual throughput guarantees as certain milestones are reached. Various milestones are expected to be achieved during 2011, and by early next year, the annual throughput guarantees will be at the contracted capacities.
For planning purposes, we are assuming that about half of the remaining 1.3 billion cubic feet per day in expansion rights will be elected over the next 5 years. In addition to the Haynesville shale area, we also realized throughput growth of about 34% in the areas that include the Fayetteville and Woodford shales, driven principally by projects we are developing for XTO Energy, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil. Over the last 3 [ph] years, we have deployed over $140 million for scalable projects in the Woodford and Fayetteville shales, and are positioned to build additional facilities over time to meet our customers' needs. 
Overall, I believe our company performed well this quarter. In his remarks, Gary will discuss our earnings guidance for 2011.
In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $19.75 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on April 21. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today I would like to discuss the accounting treatment and cash flow impacts of the Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, recent credit rating agency actions, and our earnings guidance. As David men",639,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone.  Today I would like to discuss the accounting treatment and cash flow impacts of the Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, recent credit rating agency actions, and our earnings guidance. As David mentioned in his remarks, on the basis of the Supreme Court's March 18 decision, we plan to seek to recover approximately $1.85 billion through the sale of non-recourse securitization bonds. The $1.85 billion includes interest through September 30, certain costs associated with the sale of our generation assets, and an adjustment associated with the benefit of deferred taxes. This entire amount will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the rate of approximately 36%. Although we will receive the cash when the securitization bonds are issued, these taxes will be paid over the life of the bonds as we collect this amount from customers. 
As you know, we cannot be certain when the Supreme Court will dispose of the motions for rehearing, or when the PUC will issue its order on remand and the necessary financing order. However, for purposes of this discussion, I have assumed [ph] that $1.85 billion of bonds are issued on September 30. If the bonds are issued later than September 30, interest will continue to accrue at approximately 8%. 
Let me explain how the $1.85 billion would be recorded. Assuming a 36% tax rate, we expect to recognize just under $1.2 billion in after-tax earnings. This amount will be recognized in 2 different time frames. Once the decision is finalized, the company would immediately recognize after-tax earnings of approximately $830 million to reflect the recovery of additional stranded costs and transition expenses, plus the debt component of the interest amount, offset by the benefit of deferred taxes. 
The equity component of the interest amount, which we estimate to be approximately $365 million after taxes, would not be recognized upfront, but will be recognized over the life of the securitization bonds. Regarding the use of the proceeds from the sale of the securitization bonds, our fundamental objectives have not changed. We will continue to seek opportunities to invest in accretive projects and to strengthen the balance sheet. Depending upon the timing and availability of these opportunities, we may also consider a modest stock buyback.
Now let me address 2 recent positive credit rating developments. Following the Texas Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, Moody's placed under review for possible upgrade the ratings of CenterPoint Energy and our subsidiaries CE and [ph] CERC. Moody's said that during the course of this review over the next few months, it will assess the financial impact from the Supreme Court ruling, including our plans for the securitization proceeds.
Last month, S&P announced that it has affirmed CenterPoint's corporate credit rating of BBB, but also revised the ratings outlook on CenterPoint Energy, CE and [ph] CERC to positive from stable. In the release accompanying the announcement, S&P said that the rating action results from improvements in CenterPoint's business and financial risk profile that may support a higher rating, and reflects S&P's expectations that CenterPoint will prudently utilize the proceeds expected to result from the Texas Supreme Court's decision in the true-up case. 
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance. We were pleased with our overall business performance in the first quarter, and this morning, we reaffirmed our 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. This guidance does not include the earnings impact of the Texas Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case which I described earlier. In providing earnings guidance, we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as various economic, operational and regulatory assumptions. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, I will talk about a significant development that occurred during the first quarter, then describe our first quarter financial results and provide the operating results for each of our business segments. Let me begin with the discussion of our true-up appeal.
As most of you probably know, the 1999 law, which restructured the electric industry in Texas, allowed electric utilities to recover stranded costs and certain other transition expenses in what is known as a ""true-up proceeding."" In 2005, the Texas PUC issued a decision that failed to allow us to recover some of the costs to which we believe we were entitled. As a result, we took a $947 million after-tax extraordinary loss, and appealed the PUC decision. The appeal was heard in the district court, followed by the Court of Appeals and finally the Texas Supreme Court. On March 18, the Supreme Court issued its decision in our true-up appeal.
The court reversed the PUC on a number of points and remanded the case back to the commission for implementation. As a result of the decision of the Supreme Court and of the earlier decision by the Court of Appeals, we will be able to seek in the remand proceeding recovery of the following: $210 million of excess mitigation credits paid to retail electric providers; $146 million of deferred federal income taxes that had reduced stranded costs; $378 million in depreciation; and $440 million from the capacity auction true-up. The Supreme Court also determined that the PUC should have valued our generation assets for stranded cost purposes by using the subsequent sales price of those assets. This decision reduced the amount we can seek to recover by $252 million. The net result of the court's decision is approximately $922 million in additional stranded costs and transition expenses. 
A number of parties have asked for a rehearing of the Supreme Court's decision. The court has 180 days to act on those motions, or they are denied.
Based on the court's decision, we believe we are entitled to seek recovery of approximately $1.85 billion in the remand proceedings. We conclude the calculation of interest through the third quarter of this year. We will also seek a financing order from the PUC to allow us to issue transition bonds to recover the allowed amounts. While there is no statutory deadline for the PUC to act on the remand, interest on the unrecovered true-up balance will continue to accrue at a rate of about 8% until the transition bonds are issued. In his remarks, Gary will discuss the expected accounting treatment and cash flow impacts of the true-up decision.
Now let me review the company's overall results for the first quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $148 million or $0.35 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $114 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010. Operating income for the first quarter was $364 million, compared to $357 million last year. We also reported lower interest expense and federal income taxes this year compared to the first quarter of 2010.
Houston Electric had a solid quarter, reporting operating income of $68 million, about $3 million below the first quarter of 2010. Operating income benefited from growth of more than 29,000 customers since the first quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of about 1.4%, and is an indication that our service territory continues to rebound. Offsetting the benefit of customer growth were higher operating expenses, due primarily to system reliability programs.
The first quarter results do not reflect the impact of our recent Houston Electric rate case. The Texas PUC approved the final order at its open meeting last week, but the signed order has yet to be issued. We do not expect new tariffs to be implemented before the third quarter. 
As I indicated earlier this year, the cash flow impact from this case should be minimal, but we anticipate Houston Electric's operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately $30 million on an annualized basis.
Our Natural Gas Distribution business had another good quarter, reporting operating income of $142 million or about $3 million above the first quarter of last year. This increase resulted primarily from lower bad debt expense, partially offset by increases in other operating expenses. 
Last month, the Texas Railroad Commission approved a rate settlement that is expected to result in increased annual revenues of approximately $4.6 million in our South Texas service territory. We had requested an increase of a little over $6 million. The new rates were implemented this month.
We are progressing well in the implementation of advanced metering technology in both our Electric and Natural Gas Distribution utilities in Houston. Houston Electric is now a little over halfway through the deployment of its advanced metering system, having installed approximately 1.2 million smart meters. We expect this deployment to be completed in the middle of 2012. Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory and expect to be completed in the first half of 2013. This new technology is expected to enhance the information available to our customers and significantly improve the operating efficiency of these business units.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported operating income of $10 million compared to $15 million for the first quarter of 2010. After adjusting from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives, both quarters' operating income would have been approximately $12 million. Our Retail division had a good quarter, experiencing increases in both the number of customers it serves and sales volumes. Although our Wholesale division continues to face a challenging business environment, we expect to see some improvement over last year. 
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services. Both of these units reported results ahead of last year. Our Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $76 million compared to $72 million for the first quarter of 2010. Our core business continues to perform well with increased margin from our Carthage to Perryville pipeline, as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve the power generation facilities on our system. Ancillary services revenues, however, were below levels of last year. 
Operating expenses were lower than the first quarter of last year, principally the result of an insurance settlement recorded in the first quarter of this year. Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $4 million compared to $3 million in the first quarter of 2010. Our Field Services unit reported operating income of $36 million compared to $23 million for the first quarter of 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of the long-term agreements with subsidiaries of Shell and Encana. In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $2 million for both the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 from our jointly owned Waskom facilities.
Our gathering volumes were up significantly this quarter. Average gathering volumes were a little over 2 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of about 43% from the first quarter of last year. Gathering volumes related to shale reserves accounted for about 60% of our total volume this year, compared to 32% last year. Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were down about 15% from the first quarter of last year, and about 5% from the most recent quarter. Drilling activity in these areas continues to be modest.
The few major systems to gather and treat production in the Haynesville shale continue to progress well. The first 700 million cubic feet per day phase of the Magnolia System is now complete, except for well connects. In the first quarter of this year, we substantially completed construction of the 600 million cubic feet per day Olympia System, and the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia System, both on schedule and on budget. There are still several pipeline interconnections and additional well connects remaining to be completed. During the first quarter, throughput on the Magnolia System averaged approximately 550 million cubic feet per day, and the Olympia System averaged over 300 million cubic feet per day. We expect throughput on these 2 systems to increase over the course of the year and be at system capacity by early 2012.
As you may recall, the Shell and Encana contracts provide for a step-up of annual throughput guarantees as certain milestones are reached. Various milestones are expected to be achieved during 2011, and by early next year, the annual throughput guarantees will be at the contracted capacities.
For planning purposes, we are assuming that about half of the remaining 1.3 billion cubic feet per day in expansion rights will be elected over the next 5 years. In addition to the Haynesville shale area, we also realized throughput growth of about 34% in the areas that include the Fayetteville and Woodford shales, driven principally by projects we are developing for XTO Energy, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil. Over the last 3 years, we have deployed over $140 million for scalable projects in the Woodford and Fayetteville shales, and are positioned to build additional facilities over time to meet our customers' needs. 
Overall, I believe our company performed well this quarter. In his remarks, Gary will discuss our earnings guidance for 2011.
In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $19.75 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on April 21. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."
279513,129483947,123040,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 05, 2011",2011-05-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone.  Today I would like to discuss the accounting treatment and cash flow impacts of the Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, recent credit rating agency actions, and our earnings guidance. As David men",636,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone.  Today I would like to discuss the accounting treatment and cash flow impacts of the Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, recent credit rating agency actions, and our earnings guidance. As David mentioned in his remarks, on the basis of the Supreme Court's March 18 decision, we plan to seek to recover approximately $1.85 billion through the sale of non-recourse securitization bonds. The $1.85 billion includes interest through September 30, certain costs associated with the sale of our generation assets, and an adjustment associated with the benefit of deferred taxes. This entire amount will be subject to federal and state income taxes at a rate of approximately 36%. Although we will receive the cash when the securitization bonds are issued, these taxes will be paid over the life of the bonds as we collect this amount from customers. 
As you know, we cannot be certain when the Supreme Court will dispose of the motions for rehearing, or when the PUC will issue its order on remand and the necessary financing order. However, for purposes of this discussion, I have assumed that $1.85 billion of bonds are issued on September 30. If the bonds are issued later than September 30, interest will continue to accrue at approximately 8%. 
Let me explain how the $1.85 billion would be recorded. Assuming a 36% tax rate, we expect to recognize just under $1.2 billion in after-tax earnings. This amount will be recognized in 2 different time frames. Once the decision is finalized, the company would immediately recognize after-tax earnings of approximately $830 million to reflect the recovery of additional stranded costs and transition expenses, plus the debt component of the interest amount, offset by the benefit of deferred taxes. 
The equity component of the interest amount, which we estimate to be approximately $365 million after taxes, would not be recognized upfront, but will be recognized over the life of the securitization bonds. Regarding the use of the proceeds from the sale of the securitization bonds, our fundamental objectives have not changed. We will continue to seek opportunities to invest in accretive projects and to strengthen the balance sheet. Depending upon the timing and availability of these opportunities, we may also consider a modest stock buyback.
Now let me address 2 recent positive credit rating developments. Following the Texas Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, Moody's placed under review for possible upgrade the ratings of CenterPoint Energy and our subsidiaries CE and CERC. Moody's said that during the course of this review over the next few months, it will assess the financial impact from the Supreme Court ruling, including our plans for the securitization proceeds.
Last month, S&P announced that it has affirmed CenterPoint's corporate credit rating at BBB, but also revised the ratings outlook on CenterPoint Energy, CE and CERC to positive from stable. In the release accompanying the announcement, S&P said that the rating action results from improvements in CenterPoint's business and financial risk profile that may support a higher rating, and reflects S&P's expectations that CenterPoint will prudently utilize the proceeds expected to result from the Texas Supreme Court's decision in the true-up case. 
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance. We were pleased with our overall business performance in the first quarter, and this morning, we reaffirmed our 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. This guidance does not include the earnings impact of the Texas Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case which I described earlier. In providing earnings guidance, we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as various economic, operational and regulatory assumptions. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in the company.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in the company. This morning I will update you on our true-up appeal, then discuss our second quarter financial results, and provide the operating results for each of our business segments.
Let me begin with our true-up appeal. As most of you probably know, the 1999 law, which restructured the electric industry in Texas, allowed electric utilities to recover certain costs and certain other transition expenses in what is known as a true-up proceedings. 
In 2005, the Texas PUC issued a decision that tails to allow us to recover some of the amounts, which we have requested in our application. As a result, we took a $1.5 billion pretax charge to earnings and appeal the PUC decision. The appeal was heard in the District Court, followed by the Court of Appeals and finally, the Texas Supreme Court.
In March of this year, the Supreme Court issued a favorable decision in our appeal and reversed the  PUC in a number of points. Several parties subsequently filed motions for rehearing, which have been denied by the court. The case has now been remanded to the commission for implementation.
Based on the court's decision, we will be seeking recovery of approximately $1.9 billion in the re-man proceeding. An amount which includes interest through October of this year. In the of asset condition and to hold hearings to review several issues, including the tax normalization issue that arose from the PUC's original decision, the interest rates to be applied to the true-up balance and certain tax benefits and the recoverablity of transaction costs associated to the sale of Texas Genco and rate case expenses.
We believe the commission can properly complete any necessary reviews of these issues. And while there has not been a procedural schedule established, we hope these proceedings can be concluded by early Fall.
Now let me review the company's overall results for the second quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $119 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $81 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011.
Operating income for the second quarter was $303 million compared to $263 million last year. We also reported $10 million in lower interest expense this year compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Houston Electric had a strong quarter, reporting operating income of $153 million, about $31 million above the second quarter of 2010. Operating income benefited from increased usage, primarily related to warmer weather.
Higher transmission revenues received from other providers partly offset by higher transmission costs and lower depreciation expense. We also benefited from growth of more than 32,000 customers since the second quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of over 1.5%, and it's an indication that our service territory continues to rebound. Offsetting these benefits were higher operating expenses. 
The second quarter results do not reflect the impact of our recent Houston Electric rate case. Although there are pending motions for rehearing, we now expect new to be implemented in early September. As I indicated earlier this year, the cash flow impact from this case should be minimal, but we anticipate Houston Electric's operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately $30 million on an annualized basis once the new rates are in effect.
Assuming rates are implemented on September 1, we expect the negative impact on operating income this year to be approximately $10 million.
Our Natural Gas Distribution business had a solid quarter, reporting operating income of $13 million or about $3 million above the second quarter of last year. This increase resulted primarily from rate changes, increased usage due in part to weather and growth of over 27,000 customers, partially offset by increases in operating expenses.
We are progressing well in the implementation of advanced metering technology in both our electric and Natural Gas Distribution utilities in Houston. Houston Electric is now more than 2/3 through the deployment of an advanced metering system by having installed approximately 1.5 million smart meters. We expect this deployment to be completed by the middle of next year.
Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory. We have completed installation of over 250,000 transmitters, which is a bit ahead of schedule and expect to be completed in the first half of 2013. This new technology is expected to not only provide customer benefits, but to improve the operating efficiencies of these 2 business units.
Our competitive natural gas sales and services businesses reported operating income of $3 million compared to an operating loss of $6 million for the second quarter of 2010. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting for derivatives, the second quarter of 2011 would have reflected an operating loss of $1 million compared to an operating income of $2 million from last year.
Our retail business continued to perform well. We saw an increase in both retail customers and sales volumes. Overall, however, throughput down and we continue to face a challenging market environment, mainly as a result of reduced basis spreads.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, interstate pipelines and field services. Our interstate pipelines reported operating income of $60 million compared to $67 million for the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, we received lower revenues due to an expiring backhaul contract, as well as restructured long-term contracts with our Natural Gas Distribution affiliates. 
We also experienced lower of system sales and higher operating expenses. However, this was offset somewhat by increased revenues from ancillary services, including new services available to our Power Generation customers.
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $5 million compared to $4 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Our field services unit, reported operating income of $39 million compared to $31 million for the second quarter of 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of long-term agreements in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shale place. This was somewhat offset by lower prices that we received from sailing retained gas, as well as higher expenses primarily related to facility expansions and a onetime $2.7 million sales tax adjustment.
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $3 million for both the second quarter of 2011 and 2010 from our jointly-owned Watson facilities.
Our gathering volumes were up significantly this quarter, average gathering volumes were approximately 2.2 billion  cubic feet per day, an increase of about 26% from the second quarter of last year and up more than 6% from last quarter.
Gathering volumes related to shale reserves accounted for approximately 63% of our total volume this quarter, compared to about 46% for the second quarter of last year. Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were at levels comparable to the first quarter of this year, but were down approximately 16% from the second quarter of last year.
We have completed the major construction milestones on our Magnolia and Olympia Gathering Systems in the Haynesville Shale. The Magnolia System was completed last year, the Olympia System, as well as a 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia System were substantially completed earlier this year. Our remaining expenditures relate primarily to the connection of additional wells to the system. 
We are also investing in additional compression and aiming facilities in the area that will provide opportunities to gather volumes for other producers.
During the second quarter, Throughput on the Magnolia System average approximately 535 million cubic feet per day, which is slightly below the first quarter of this year due to continuing gas quality issues, which are being addressed by our customers, as well as delays in well completions.
The Olympia System average about 430 million cubic feet per day during the second quarter, an increase of more than 30% over last year -- last quarter I should say. We expect throughput on these 2 systems to increase over the course of the year and be at or near system capacity in early 2012.
In addition to the Haynesville Shale area, we have also realized throughput growth of about 9% since last quarter and over 40% compared to the second quarter of last year in the areas that include the Fayetteville and Woodford shales, primarily driven by projects we are developing for Exxon Mobile.
As we have discussed in the past, our principal contracts in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales provide for Throughput or rate of return guarantees, which produces our sensitivity to Throughput volumes.
While a number of producers are shifting their emphasis from linear shale plays to more liquid rich plays, our principal customers have maintained a consistent level of drilling in the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Woodford shales since the beginning of the year.
While we anticipate continued growth in the development of these areas, the current low gas price environment may slow the pace of expansion. However, as mentioned on previous calls, we are interested in expanding our business to the more liquid rich plays and continue to pursue projects in the Eagle Ford, Granite Boss and Marcella space.
In closing I would like to remind you of the $0.1975 per share quarter dividend declared by our Board of Directors on July 19. We believe our dividend actions continued to demonstrators a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence that our Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver strong earnings and cash flow.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I would like to discuss the recent positive actions taken by the credit rating agencies, provide an update on the status of our revolving credit facilities and discuss our earnings guidance.
Let me start with our credit ratings. You may recall that during our first quarter investor call, I noted that S&P had a firm definitive point family corporate credit ratings and revised their ratings outlook to positive from stable. I'm very pleased to note that we have experienced w favorable developments since our last investor call.
Following the Texas Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, Moody's, place under review for a possible upgrade to ratings to CMP and our operating subsidiaries. On June 29, Moody's announced that it had concluded its review and upgraded the long and short-term ratings of both CMP and CERC. The senior unsecured ratings of CMP were upgraded to BAA 3 from BA1 and the senior unsecured ratings of CERC were upgraded to BAA 2 from BAA 3. In addition, the ratings of CE were confirmed and the outlook for all 3 companies is stable.
This means that the senior unsecured ratings of our parent company are now Investment Grade in all 3 of the agencies. As you know had been one of the key objectives for our company since its inception.
In addition on June Fitch revised the ratings outlook on CMP and CE deposited from stable. We are very pleased of the actions of these agencies.
Now let me describe the status of our revolving credit facilities. We are in the process of working with our banks to replace our various revolving credit facilities, which are scheduled to expire in June of 2012. We have begun the general indication of these facilities and expect to close them in the third quarter.
Each of the replacement facilities should be approximately the same size as the ones expiring, and we are proposing 5-year maturities for each. We expect the economic terms to be in line with the terms of other similar facilities that have been syndicated in the market recently.
In common we've experience with most borrowers, drawn and undrawn calls and the new facilities will be higher than the costs under the facilities we negotiated in 2007.
We are taking this action now to take advantage of what looks to be a very receptive market in order to lock in our short-term liquidity sources for the next 5 years.
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance. As David mentioned, we are pleased with the overall financial performance of our businesses so far this year. And this morning, we reaffirmed our 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.13 per diluted share. As a reminder, this guidance does not include the earnings impact of the true-up case. 
In addition, in providing earnings guidance, we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as various economic, operational and regulatory assumptions.
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in the company. This morning, I will update you on our true-up appeal, then describe our second quarter financial results, and provide the operating results for each of our business segments.
Let me begin with our true-up appeal. As most of you probably know, the 1999 law, which restructured the electric industry in Texas, allowed electric utilities to recover certain costs and certain other transition expenses in what is known as a true-up proceeding. 
In 2005, the Texas PUC issued a decision that tailed to allow us to recover some of the amounts, which we had requested in our application. As a result, we took a $1.5 billion pretax charge to earnings and appeal the PUC decision. The appeal was heard in the District Court, followed by the Court of Appeals and finally, the Texas Supreme Court.
In March of this year, the Supreme Court issued a favorable decision in our appeal and reversed the  PUC on a number of points. Several parties subsequently filed motions for rehearing, which have been denied by the court. The case has now been remanded to the commission for implementation.
Based on the court's decision, we will be seeking recovery of approximately $1.9 billion in the remand proceeding, an amount which includes interest through October of this year. Intravenous [ph] of asset condition to hold hearings to review several issues, including the tax normalization issue that arose from the PUC's original decision, the interest rates to be applied to the true-up balance and certain tax benefits and the recoverability of transaction costs associated with the sale of Texas Genco and rate case expenses.
We believe the commission can properly complete any necessary reviews of these issues. And while there has not been a procedural schedule established, we hope these proceedings can be concluded by early fall.
Now let me review the company's overall results for the second quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $119 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $81 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011.
Operating income for the second quarter was $303 million compared to $263 million last year. We also reported $10 million in lower interest expense this year compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Houston Electric had a strong quarter, reporting operating income of $153 million, about $31 million above the second quarter of 2010. Operating income benefited from increased usage, primarily related to warmer weather.
Higher transmission revenues received from other providers partially offset by higher transmission cost and lower depreciation expense. We also benefited from growth of more than 32,000 customers since the second quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of over 1.5%, and is an indication that our service territory continues to rebound. Offsetting these benefits were higher operating expenses. 
The second quarter results do not reflect the impact of our recent Houston Electric rate case. Although there are pending motions for rehearing, we now expect new tariffs to be implemented in early September. As I indicated earlier this year, the cash flow impact from this case should be minimal, but we anticipate Houston Electric's operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately $30 million on an annualized basis once the new rates are in effect.
Assuming rates are implemented on September 1, we expect the negative impact on operating income this year to be approximately $10 million.
Our natural gas distribution business had a solid quarter, reporting operating income of $13 million or about $3 million above the second quarter of last year. This increase resulted primarily from rate changes, increased usage due in part to weather and growth of over 27,000 customers, partially offset by increases in operating expenses.
We are progressing well in the implementation of advanced metering technology in both our electric and natural gas distribution utilities in Houston. Houston Electric is now more than 2/3 through the deployment of an advanced metering system by having installed approximately 1.5 million smart meters. We expect this deployment to be completed by the middle of next year.
Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory. We have completed an installation of over 250,000 transmitters, which is a bit ahead of schedule and expect to be completed in the first half of 2013. This new technology is expected to not only provide customer benefits, but to improve the operating efficiencies of these 2 business units.
Our competitive natural gas sales and services businesses reported operating income of $3 million compared to an operating loss of $6 million for the second quarter of 2010. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting for derivatives, the second quarter of 2011 would have reflected an operating loss of $1 million compared to an operating income of $2 million for last year.
Our retail business continued to perform well. We saw an increase in both retail customers and sales volumes. Overall, however, throughput was down and we continue to face a challenging market environment, mainly as a result of reduced basis spreads.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, interstate pipelines and field services. Our interstate pipelines recorded operating income of $60 million compared to $67 million for the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, we received lower revenues due to an expiring backhaul contract, as well as restructured long-term contracts with our natural gas distribution affiliates. 
We also experienced lower off-system sales and higher operating expenses. However, this was offset somewhat by increased revenues from ancillary services, including new services available to our power generation customers.
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $5 million compared to $4 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Our field services unit, reported operating income of $39 million compared to $31 million for the second quarter of 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of long-term agreements in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shale place. This was somewhat offset by lower prices that we received from selling retained gas, as well as higher expenses primarily related to facility expansions and a onetime $2.7 million sales tax adjustment.
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $3 million for both the second quarter of 2011 and 2010 from our jointly-owned Waskom facilities.
Our gathering volumes were up significantly this quarter. Average gathering volumes were approximately 2.2 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of about 26% from the second quarter of last year and up more than 6% from last quarter.
Gathering volumes related to shale reserves accounted for approximately 63% of our total volume this quarter, compared to about 46% for the second quarter of last year. Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were at levels comparable to the first quarter of this year, but were down approximately 16% from the second quarter of last year.
We have completed the major construction milestones on our Magnolia and Olympia Gathering Systems in the Haynesville Shale. The Magnolia System was completed last year, the Olympia System, as well as a 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia System were substantially completed earlier this year. Our remaining expenditures relate primarily to the connection of additional wells to the system. 
We are also investing in additional compression and aiming facilities in the area that will provide opportunities to gather volumes for other producers.
During the second quarter, throughput on the Magnolia System averaged approximately 535 million cubic feet per day, which is slightly below the first quarter of this year due to continuing gas quality issues, which are being addressed by our customers, as well as delays in well completions.
The Olympia System averaged about 430 million cubic feet per day during the second quarter, an increase of more than 30% over last year -- last quarter, I should say. We expect throughput on these 2 systems to increase over the course of the year and be at or near system capacity in early 2012.
In addition to the Haynesville Shale area, we have also realized throughput growth of about 9% since last quarter and over 40% compared to the second quarter of last year in the areas that include the Fayetteville and Woodford shales, primarily driven by projects we are developing for Exxon Mobil.
As we have discussed in the past, our principal contracts in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales provide for throughput or rate of return guarantees, which reduces our sensitivity to throughput volumes.
While a number of producers are shifting their emphasis from linear shale plays to more liquid-rich plays, our principal customers has maintained a consistent level of drilling in the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Woodford shales since the beginning of the year.
While we anticipate continued growth in the development of these areas, the current low gas price environment may slow the pace of expansion. However, as mentioned on previous calls, we are interested in expanding our business to the more liquid-rich plays and continue to pursue projects in the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash and Marcellus place.
In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $0.1975 per share quarter dividend declared by our Board of Directors on July 19. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I would like to discuss the recent positive actions taken by the credit rating agencies, provide an update on the status of our revolving credit facilities and discuss our earnings guidance.
Let me start with our credit ratings. You may recall that during our first quarter investor call, I noted that S&P had a firm, definitive point family corporate credit ratings and revised their ratings outlook to positive from stable. I'm very pleased to note that we have experienced 2 favorable developments since our last investor call.
Following the Texas Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, Moody's placed under review for a possible upgrade the ratings to CNP and our operating subsidiaries. On June 29, Moody's announced that it had concluded its review and upgraded the long- and short-term ratings of both CNP and CERC. The senior unsecured ratings of CNP were upgraded to Baa3 from Ba1 and the senior unsecured ratings of CERC were upgraded to Baa2 from Baa3. In addition, the ratings of CE were confirmed and the outlook for all 3 companies is stable.
This means that the senior unsecured ratings of our parent company are now investment grade with all 3 of the agencies. This, as you know, had been one of the key objectives for our company since its inception.
In addition, on June 22, Fitch revised the ratings outlook on CNP and CE to positive from stable. We are very pleased with the actions of these agencies.
Now let me describe the status of our revolving credit facilities. We are in the process of working with our banks to replace our various revolving credit facilities, which are scheduled to expire in June of 2012. We have begun the general syndication of these facilities and expect to close them in the third quarter.
Each of the replacement facilities should be approximately the same size as the ones expiring, and we are proposing 5-year maturities for each. We expect the economic terms to be in line with the terms of other similar facilities that have been syndicated in the market recently.
In coming with the experience of most borrowers, drawn and undrawn calls under the new facilities will be higher than the costs under the facilities we negotiated in 2007.
We are taking this action now to take advantage of what looks to be a very receptive market in order to lock in our short-term liquidity sources for the next 5 years.
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance. As David mentioned, we are pleased with the overall financial performance of our businesses so far this year. And this morning, we reaffirmed our 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. As a reminder, this guidance does not include the earnings impact of the true-up case. 
In addition, in providing earnings guidance, we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as various economic, operational and regulatory assumptions.
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in the company. This morning, I will update you on our true-up appeal, then describe our second quarter financial results, and provide",1607,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in the company. This morning, I will update you on our true-up appeal, then describe our second quarter financial results, and provide the operating results for each of our business segments.
Let me begin with our true-up appeal. As most of you probably know, the 1999 law, which restructured the electric industry in Texas, allowed electric utilities to recover certain costs and certain other transition expenses in what is known as a true-up proceeding. 
In 2005, the Texas PUC issued a decision that tailed to allow us to recover some of the amounts, which we had requested in our application. As a result, we took a $1.5 billion pretax charge to earnings and appealed the PUC decision. The appeal was heard in the District Court, followed by the Court of Appeals and finally, the Texas Supreme Court.
In March of this year, the Supreme Court issued a favorable decision in our appeal and reversed the  PUC on a number of points. Several parties subsequently filed motions for rehearing, which have been denied by the court. The case has now been remanded to the commission for implementation.
Based on the court's decision, we will be seeking recovery of approximately $1.9 billion in the remand proceeding, an amount which includes interest through October of this year. Intravenous [ph] of asset condition to hold hearings to review several issues, including the tax normalization issue that arose from the PUC's original decision, the interest rates to be applied to the true-up balance and certain tax benefits and the recoverability of transaction costs associated with the sale of Texas Genco and rate case expenses.
We believe the commission can properly complete any necessary reviews of these issues. And while there has not been a procedural schedule established, we hope these proceedings can be concluded by early fall.
Now let me review the company's overall results for the second quarter. This morning, we reported net income of $119 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $81 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2010.
Operating income for the second quarter was $303 million compared to $263 million last year. We also reported $10 million in lower interest expense this year compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Houston Electric had a strong quarter, reporting operating income of $153 million, about $31 million above the second quarter of 2010. Operating income benefited from increased usage, primarily related to warmer weather.
Higher transmission revenues received from other providers partially offset by higher transmission cost and lower depreciation expense. We also benefited from growth of more than 32,000 customers since the second quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of over 1.5%, and is an indication that our service territory continues to rebound. Offsetting these benefits were higher operating expenses. 
The second quarter results do not reflect the impact of our recent Houston Electric rate case. Although there are pending motions for rehearing, we now expect new tariffs to be implemented in early September. As I indicated earlier this year, the cash flow impact from this case should be minimal, but we anticipate Houston Electric's operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately $30 million on an annualized basis, once the new rates are in effect.
Assuming rates are implemented on September 1, we expect the negative impact on operating income this year to be approximately $10 million.
Our natural gas distribution business had a solid quarter, reporting operating income of $13 million or about $3 million above the second quarter of last year. This increase resulted primarily from rate changes, increased usage due in part to weather and growth of over 27,000 customers, partially offset by increases in operating expenses.
We are progressing well in the implementation of advanced metering technology in both our electric and natural gas distribution utilities in Houston. Houston Electric is now more than 2/3 through the deployment of an advanced metering system by having installed approximately 1.5 million smart meters. We expect this deployment to be completed by the middle of next year.
Earlier this year, we began installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory. We have completed an installation of over 250,000 transmitters, which is a bit ahead of schedule, and expect to be completed in the first half of 2013. This new technology is expected to not only provide customer benefits, but to improve the operating efficiencies of these 2 business units.
Our competitive natural gas sales and services businesses reported operating income of $3 million compared to an operating loss of $6 million for the second quarter of 2010. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting for derivatives, the second quarter of 2011 would have reflected an operating loss of $1 million compared to an operating income of $2 million for last year.
Our retail business continued to perform well. We saw an increase in both retail customers and sales volumes. Overall, however, throughput was down and we continue to face a challenging market environment, mainly as a result of reduced basis spreads.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses, interstate pipelines and field services. Our interstate pipelines recorded operating income of $60 million compared to $67 million for the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, we received lower revenues due to an expiring backhaul contract, as well as restructured long-term contracts with our natural gas distribution affiliates. 
We also experienced lower off-system sales and higher operating expenses. However, this was offset somewhat by increased revenues from ancillary services, including new services available to our power generation customers.
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $5 million compared to $4 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Our field services unit reported operating income of $39 million compared to $31 million for the second quarter of 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of long-term agreements in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shale place. This was somewhat offset by lower prices that we received from selling retained gas, as well as higher expenses primarily related to facility expansions and a one time $2.7 million sales tax adjustment.
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $3 million for both the second quarter of 2011 and 2010 from our jointly-owned Waskom facilities.
Our gathering volumes were up significantly this quarter. Average gathering volumes were approximately 2.2 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of about 26% from the second quarter of last year and up more than 6% from last quarter.
Gathering volumes related to shale reserves accounted for approximately 63% of our total volume this quarter, compared to about 46% for the second quarter of last year. Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were at levels comparable to the first quarter of this year, but were down approximately 16% from the second quarter of last year.
We have completed the major construction milestones on our Magnolia and Olympia Gathering Systems in the Haynesville Shale. The Magnolia System was completed last year, the Olympia System, as well as a 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Magnolia System were substantially completed earlier this year. Our remaining expenditures relate primarily to the connection of additional wells to the system. 
We are also investing in additional compression and aiming facilities in the area that will provide opportunities to gather volumes for other producers.
During the second quarter, throughput on the Magnolia System averaged approximately 535 million cubic feet per day, which is slightly below the first quarter of this year due to continuing gas quality issues, which are being addressed by our customers, as well as delays in well completions.
The Olympia System averaged about 430 million cubic feet per day during the second quarter, an increase of more than 30% over last year -- last quarter, I should say. We expect throughput on these 2 systems to increase over the course of the year and be at or near system capacity in early 2012.
In addition to the Haynesville Shale area, we have also realized throughput growth of about 9% since last quarter and over 40% compared to the second quarter of last year in the areas that include the Fayetteville and Woodford shales, primarily driven by projects we are developing for Exxon Mobil.
As we have discussed in the past, our principal contracts in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shales provide for throughput or rate of return guarantees, which reduces our sensitivity to throughput volumes.
While a number of producers are shifting their emphasis from linear shale plays to more liquid-rich plays, our principal customers have maintained a consistent level of drilling in the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Woodford shales since the beginning of the year.
While we anticipate continued growth in the development of these areas, the current low gas price environment may slow the pace of expansion. However, as mentioned on previous calls, we are interested in expanding our business to the more liquid-rich plays and continue to pursue projects in the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash and Marcellus plays.
In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $0.1975 per share quarter dividend declared by our Board of Directors on July 19. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I would like to discuss the recent positive actions taken by the credit rating agencies, provide an update on the status of our revolving credit facilities and discuss our earnings guidance.
Let me start with our credit ratings. You may recall that during our first quarter investor call, I noted that S&P had a firm, definitive point family corporate credit ratings and revised their ratings outlook to positive from stable. I'm very pleased to note that we have experienced 2 favorable developments since our last investor call.
Following the Texas Supreme Court's decision in our true-up case, Moody's placed under review for a possible upgrade the ratings to CNP and our operating subsidiaries. On June 29, Moody's announced that it had concluded its review and upgraded the long- and short-term ratings of both CNP and CERC. The senior unsecured ratings of CNP were upgraded to Baa3 from Ba1 and the senior unsecured ratings of CERC were upgraded to Baa2 from Baa3. In addition, the ratings of CE were confirmed and the outlook for all 3 companies is stable.
This means that the senior unsecured ratings of our parent company are now investment grade with all 3 of the agencies. This, as you know, had been one of the key objectives for our company since its inception.
In addition, on June 22, Fitch revised the ratings outlook on CNP and CE to positive from stable. We are very pleased with the actions of these agencies.
Now let me describe the status of our revolving credit facilities. We are in the process of working with our banks to replace our various revolving credit facilities, which are scheduled to expire in June of 2012. We have begun the general syndication of these facilities and expect to close on them in the third quarter.
Each of the replacement facilities should be approximately the same size as the ones expiring, and we are proposing 5-year maturities for each. We expect the economic terms to be in line with the terms of other similar facilities that have been syndicated in the market recently.
In common with the experience of most borrowers, drawn and undrawn calls under the new facilities will be higher than the costs under the facilities we negotiated in 2007.
We are taking this action now to take advantage of what looks to be a very receptive market in order to lock in our short-term liquidity sources for the next 5 years.
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance. As David mentioned, we are pleased with the overall financial performance of our businesses so far this year. And this morning, we reaffirmed our 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.14 per diluted share. As a reminder, this guidance does not include the earnings impact of the true-up case. 
In addition, in providing earnings guidance, we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as various economic, operational and regulatory assumptions.
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

We had a strong quarter from an earnings standpoint, and",1304,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
This past quarter was a very good one for the company. We had a strong quarter from an earnings standpoint, and after 7 years, we resolved the long-standing issues associated with our true-up proceeding.
Our press release and 10-Q provided details around our business unit's financial performance this past quarter, so I won't repeat the specifics. But let me summarize the performance of each business unit and talk a little bit about their prospects.
Houston Electric had an outstanding quarter, and it's having a really good year. This past summer was the hottest summer on record for Texas. This drove the largest part of Houston Electric's earnings gains. I was really pleased at how well our systems performed when faced with a stressed that the extreme heat placed on it. We've also taken the opportunity to invest more in system hardening and reliability, which benefits not only this year but the years ahead as well. The future looks bright for this unit. While do we can't count on repeating the weather-driven earnings we experienced this year, we can count on a solid and growing service territory. We have added more than 35,000 customers since this time last year, and believe we'll see a continuation of that pace of growth next year. 
Very few areas around the country are experiencing this type of economic activity and growth.  Capital expenditures should approximate between $500 million and $600 million annually, as we build infrastructures to serve new loads and automate the grid. The primary earnings headwind this unit faces comes from the rate changes implemented this past September. This will have a negative operating income impact of approximately $35 million next year when the effect of the change in depreciation rates is also taken into account.
Our gas distribution unit is having another outstanding year attributable primarily to our business model and expense control. Annual rate adjustments in the number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recover increased investments, as well as reductions in gas usage without the necessity of a major rate proceeding. This significantly reduces the amount of regulatory lag we would typically experience. Like most of the industry, we are very focused on pipeline safety and integrity. As a result, we are planning to accelerate the replacement of some aging infrastructure and increase our system improvement expenditures. We expect rate base will grow at a much faster pace, as overall capital expenditures are likely to increase to between $300 million and $400 million annually compared to a historical level of about $200 million.
Our midstream businesses are also doing well. As expected, our field services unit, demonstrated from infrastructure investments we've made into Haynesville and Fayetteville shale areas. Our gathering volume increased by almost 5% over the previous quarter, and averaged almost 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. About 1 billion cubic feet per day was gathered out of the Haynesville shale.
Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were down about 2% from the previous quarter, in line with our expectations.
Next year, we expect the volumes at Haynesville ability reach 1.5 billion cubic feet per day by the second quarter. We expect volumes out of the Fayetteville and Woodford to increase as well. While a number of producers are shifting their emphasis from leaner shale plays to more liquid rich plays, our principal customers have maintained a consistent level of drilling in these shales.
Natural gas prices, however, have weakened, which could potentially impact our customers' future drilling programs, and will impact the value of our retained natural gas volumes as well. While we continue to see gathering opportunities in the Mid-Continent, we are also focused on diversifying and expanding our gathering footprint into more liquid-rich areas like the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash and Marcellus.
Our Interstate Pipelines earnings were down from last year, primarily due to the exploration of an above market backhaul contract earlier this year, and the impacts of a restructured long-term contract with our natural gas distribution affiliate. Reduced basis has also resulted in a decline in our off system sales. However, we were able to offset some of these revenue lost with the new contracts, primarily electric generation customers, as well as increases in some ancillary revenues or services, I should say.
Going forward, we expect considerable competition for new businesses in contract renewals from other pipelines in or near our footprint. We anticipate basis will remain compressed, and all system revenues will be adversely impacted. However, we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipeline with special focus on power generation customers. We currently serve 22 natural gas-fired power plants. There are over 40 coal plants within 50 miles of our system and we anticipate that retirements in more stringent regulations will lead to increased use of natural gas.
Our competitive natural gas sales units financial results were down this quarter. Our retail business continues to perform well. However, reduced gas price volatility and the lack of geographic and seasonal basis spreads have reduced wholesale optimization opportunities. Some of the pipeline in storage capacities we contracted for in the past no longer provide value, and in some cases are underwater. Much of the uneconomic capacity will terminate over the next 18 months. We are also releasing some of this capacity early, and expect to recognize the economic loss in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our focus is on expanding our commercial and industrial base and increasing our product and service offerings.
Now let me turn to our true-up appeal. As most of you know, in September, we reached a settlement with the PUC staff and other intervenors, resolving all matters in our true-up appeal. The settlement allows us to recover approximately $1.7 billion, out of which we must pay the legal fees associated with this preceding, and the financing costs to issue transition bonds to securitize this amount. Last month, the commission approved the settlement and the financing orders for the issuance of the bonds. We expect to issue the bonds later this year or early next year. Gary will give you a little more color around this process in a few minutes.
As you would expect, we are pleased that this issue is finally resolved, and we can now look to the future. The obvious question, what will we do with the securitization proceeds? Our first priority is to invest this money in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. We will be disciplined in our approach. Our portfolio of energy delivery businesses provides us with significant opportunities for investment. Of course, we'll have to be patient and diligent in evaluating these opportunities.
We have talked in the past about reducing outstanding debt and a modest stock buyback program with a portion of the proceeds. While these alternatives are still viable, our first priority will be to invest the money in our businesses.
Let me conclude by expressing how excited and confident we are in the future of CenterPoint Energy. With the receipt of the true-up proceeds, we have a unique opportunity to build a stronger company, which will benefit both our shareholders and customers. Our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses have served us well since are formation 9 years ago. We recognize the energy markets are changing. Lower prices and ample supplies of natural gas will benefit both our electric and gas distribution utilities. At the same time, it will present both challenges and opportunities for our midstream and energy services businesses.

Today, I will update you on the expected timelines we issued on the transition bonds, the replacement of our revolving credit facility and our revised earnings guidance.
I'll start with the transition bond. As David mentioned, the Texas PUC issued a financing order on October 27. We have been working with the PUC staff, as well as with our financial advisor on various aspects of the issuance, and we feel we have made excellent progress. There are 2 key guiding items in preparing to go to market. First, the credit rating agencies have established a rating for the bond. And second, we need to register the sale of the transition bond with the SEC. We will issue the bond as soon as reasonably possible in order to take advantage of the historical low interest rates for the benefit of our customers. We are making solid progress on all aspects of the preparatory work, and at this point, we anticipate we will be able to market the bonds either late this year or very early in the new year.
In September, we had a very successful syndication of our new revolving credit facility and closed on three 5-year senior unsecured facilities totaling $2.45 billion. The economic terms and covenants are in line with other recently syndicated facilities. The drawn cost under these facilities are approximately 100 basis points higher than the cost of the previous facility. We are very pleased that we have locked in our short-term a liquidity sources for the next 5 years.
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance for the year. As David discussed, we are very pleased with the overall financial performance of our businesses this year, and this morning, we said that we expect 2011 earnings to be at the high-end of our guidance range of $1.4 to $1.14 per fully diluted share.
On a guidance basis, which excludes the earnings impact of recordings of the true-up settlement, the change in the value of Time Warner stock and the related securities, as well as the timing effects of mark-to-market in inventory accounting, we are in $0.95 per fully diluted through the third quarter. In providing earnings guidance, we have assumed normal weather for the balance of the year. And we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as various economic operational and regulatory assumptions.
Now, I would like to turn the call back to Marianne."

It's a little bit more difficult to do M&A there, but it's not impossible, certainly, and there are assets to come on market from time to time. You're right, I think the midstream businesses, some of the multiples that have been paid lately are pretty rich. And we're not going to do anything that is not going to create value for us. So you have to have some real growth potential in those -- for those assets to pay that kind of multiple, I would think. So we have seen some opportunities. We've looked at them.

We've already posted that some of that for release. We're going to take some losses early in the fourth quarter. So that's a little bit of headwind there that you noted. I would also remind you that we do have the rate case, the full impact of the Houston Electric rate case will be felt in the fourth quarter. That's probably $10 million, give or take, impact in the fourth quarter of this year. And there is a little bit of timing issue around Field Services. We have these guaranteed throughput agreement. We booked some commitments in the third quarter because we know that our suppliers are not going to make -- or our customers are not going to make their full volume commitment. So that kind of moves between quarters. And we probably took a little bit more in the third quarter because they were just not going to make it than we had earlier anticipated.

Now it may take longer to execute it, but we have to decide how long do we want to hold the money to try to invest it as opposed to looking at some of the alternatives. But I'd say by midyear next year, we ought to have a pretty good idea and hopefully we'll be able to spend some of this money before then. You might have picked up in my comments, we do think our CapEx in both our Gas Distribution, as well as our Electric Utility, is going to pick up from this year. So we'll spend a little bit more in those areas, but obviously we're not going to spend all our money in just that area. So we're going to have to find some new investments, but we're not going to do anything that doesn't create value for our shareholders. If it's not a good deal, we're not going to spend the money just to spend it."

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
This past quarter was a very good one for the company. We had a strong quarter from an earnings standpoint, and after 7 years, we resolved the long-standing issues associated with our true-up proceeding.
Our press release and 10-Q provided details around our business unit's financial performance this past quarter, so I won't repeat the specifics. But let me summarize the performance of each business unit and talk a little bit about their prospects.
Houston Electric had an outstanding quarter, and it's having a really good year. This past summer was the hottest summer on record for Texas. This drove the largest part of Houston Electric's earnings gains. I was really pleased at how well our systems performed when faced with a stressed that the extreme heat placed on it. We've also taken the opportunity to invest more in system hardening and reliability, which benefits not only this year, but the years ahead as well. The future looks bright for this unit. While we can't count on repeating the weather-driven earnings we experienced this year, we can count on a solid and growing service territory. We have added more than 35,000 customers since this time last year, and believe we'll see a continuation of that pace of growth next year. 
Very few areas around the country are experiencing this type of economic activity and growth. Capital expenditures should approximate between $500 million and $600 million annually, as we build infrastructure to serve new loads and automate the grid. The primary earnings headwind this unit faces comes from the rate changes implemented this past September. This will have a negative operating income impact of approximately $35 million next year when the effect of the change in depreciation rates is also taken into account.
Our gas distribution unit is having another outstanding year attributable primarily to our business model and expense control. Annual rate adjustments in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recover increased investments, as well as reductions in gas usage without the necessity of a major rate proceeding. This significantly reduces the amount of regulatory lag we would typically experience. Like most of the industry, we are very focused on pipeline safety and integrity. As a result, we are planning to accelerate the replacement of some aging infrastructure and increase our system improvement expenditures. We expect rate base will grow at a much faster pace, as overall capital expenditures are likely to increase to between $300 million and $400 million annually compared to a historical level of about $200 million.
Our midstream businesses are also doing well. As expected, our field services unit, demonstrated from infrastructure investments we've made into Haynesville and Fayetteville shale areas. Our gathering volume increased by almost 5% over the previous quarter, and averaged over 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. About 1 billion cubic feet per day was gathered out of the Haynesville shale.
Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were down about 2% from the previous quarter, in line with our expectations.
Next year, we expect the volumes out of Haynesville will reach 1.5 billion cubic feet per day by the second quarter. We expect volumes out of the Fayetteville and Woodford to increase as well. While a number of producers are shifting their emphasis from leaner shale plays to more liquid-rich plays, our principal customers have maintained a consistent level of drilling in these shales.
Natural gas prices, however, have weakened, which could potentially impact our customers' future drilling programs, and will impact the value of our retained natural gas volumes as well. While we continue to see gathering opportunities in the Mid-Continent, we are also focused on diversifying and expanding our gathering footprint into more liquid-rich areas like the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash and Marcellus.
Our Interstate Pipelines earnings were down from last year, primarily due to the exploration of an above-market backhaul contract earlier this year, and the impacts of a restructured long-term contract with our natural gas distribution affiliate. Reduced basis has also resulted in a decline in our off system sales. However, we were able to offset some of this revenue loss with new contracts, primarily electric generation customers, as well as increases in some ancillary revenues or services, I should say.
Going forward, we expect considerable competition for new businesses in contract renewals from other pipelines in or near our footprint. We anticipate basis will remain compressed, and all system revenues will be adversely impacted. However, we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipeline with special focus on power generation customers. We currently serve 22 natural gas-fired power plants. There are over 40 coal plants within 50 miles of our system and we anticipate that retirements in more stringent regulations will lead to increased use of natural gas.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales unit's financial results were down this quarter. Our retail business continues to perform well. However, reduced gas price volatility and the lack of geographic and seasonal basis spreads have reduced wholesale optimization opportunities. Some of the pipeline in storage capacity we contracted for in the past, no longer provide value, and in some cases are underwater. Much of the uneconomic capacity will terminate over the next 18 months. We are also releasing some of this capacity early, and expect to recognize the economic loss in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our focus is on expanding our commercial and industrial base and increasing our product and service offerings.
Now let me turn to our true-up appeal. As most of you know, in September, we reached a settlement with the PUC staff and other intervenors, resolving all matters in our true-up appeal. The settlement allows us to recover approximately $1.7 billion, out of which, we must pay the legal fees associated with this preceding, and the financing costs to issue transition bonds to securitize this amount. Last month, the commission approved the settlement and a financing order for the issuance of the bonds. We expect to issue the bonds later this year or early next year. Gary will give you a little more color around this process in a few minutes.
As you would expect, we are pleased that this issue is finally resolved, and we can now look to the future. The obvious question, what will we do with the securitization proceeds? Our first priority is to invest this money in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. We will be disciplined in our approach. Our portfolio have -- of energy delivery businesses provides us with significant opportunities for investment. Of course, we'll have to be patient and diligent in evaluating these opportunities.
We have talked in the past about reducing outstanding debt and a modest stock buyback program with a portion of the proceeds. While these alternatives are still viable, our first priority will be to invest the money in our businesses.
Let me conclude by expressing how excited and confident we are in the future of CenterPoint Energy. With the receipt of the true-up proceeds, we have a unique opportunity to build a stronger company, which will benefit both our shareholders and customers. Our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses have served us well since our formation 9 years ago. We recognize the energy markets are changing. Lower prices and ample supplies of natural gas will benefit both our electric and gas distribution utilities. At the same time, it will present both challenges and opportunities for our midstream and energy services businesses.
We look forward to building from our strong base and continuing our track record of strong performance for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I will update you on the expected timelines to issue the new transition bonds, the replacement of our revolving credit facilities and our revised earnings guidance.
I'll start with the transition bond. As David mentioned, the Texas PUC issued a financing order on October 27. We have been working with the PUC staff, as well as our financial advisor on various aspects of the issuance, and we feel we have made excellent progress. There are 2 key gaining items in preparing to go to market. First, the credit rating agencies have to establish a rating for the bond. And second, we need to register the sale of the transition bonds with the SEC. We will issue the bonds as soon as reasonably possible in order to take advantage of historical low interest rates for the benefit of our customers. We are making solid progress on all aspects of the preparatory work, and at this point, we anticipate we will be able to market the bonds either late this year or very early in the new year.
In September, we had a very successful syndication of our new revolving credit facilities and closed on 3 5-year senior unsecured facilities totaling $2.45 billion. The economic terms and covenants are in line with other recently syndicated facilities. The drawing cost under these facilities are approximately 100 basis points higher than the cost of the previous facility. We are very pleased that we have locked in our short-term liquidity sources for the next 5 years.
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance for the year. As David discussed, we are very pleased with the overall financial performance of our businesses this year, and this morning, we said that we expect 2011 earnings to be at the high-end of our guidance range of $1.04 to $1.14 per fully diluted share.
On a guidance basis, which excludes the earnings impact of recording the true-up settlement, the change in the value of Time Warner stocks and the related ZENS securities, as well as the timing effects of mark-to-market in inventory accounting, we earned $0.95 per fully diluted share through the third quarter. In providing earnings guidance, we have assumed normal weather for the balance of the year. And we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as various economic operational and regulatory assumptions.
Now, I would like to turn the call back to Marianne."

You're right, I think the midstream businesses, some of the multiples that have been paid lately are pretty rich. And we're not going to do anything that is not going to create value for us. So you have to have some real growth potential in those -- for those assets to pay that kind of multiple, I would think. So we have seen some opportunities.

We're going to take some losses early in the fourth quarter. So that's a little bit of headwind there that you noted. I would also remind you that we do have the rate case. The full impact of the Houston Electric rate case will be felt in the fourth quarter. That's probably $10 million, give or take, impact in the fourth quarter of this year. And there is a little bit of timing issue around Field Services. We have these guaranteed throughput agreements. We booked some commitments in the third quarter because we know that our suppliers are not going to make their full -- or our customers are not going to make their full volume commitment. So that kind of moves between quarters. And we probably took a little bit more in the third quarter because they were just not going to make it than we had earlier anticipated.

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
This past quarter was a very good one for the company. We had a strong quarter from an earnings standpoint, and after 7 years, we resolved the long-standing issues associated with our true-up proceeding.
Our press release and 10-Q provide details around our business unit's financial performance this past quarter, so I won't repeat the specifics. But let me summarize the performance of each business unit and talk a little bit about their prospects.
Houston Electric had an outstanding quarter, and is having a really good year. This past summer was the hottest summer on record for Texas. This drove the largest part of Houston Electric's earnings gains. I was really pleased at how well our system performed when faced with a stressed that the extreme heat placed on it. We've also taken the opportunity to invest more in system hardening and reliability, which benefits not only this year, but the years ahead as well. 
The future looks bright for this unit. While we can't count on repeating the weather-driven earnings we experienced this year, we can count on a solid and growing service territory. We have added more than 35,000 customers since this time last year, and believe we'll see a continuation of that pace of growth next year. 
Very few areas around the country are experiencing this type of economic activity and growth. Capital expenditures should approximate between $500 million and $600 million annually, as we build infrastructure to serve new loads and automate the grid. The primary earnings headwind this unit faces comes from the rate changes implemented this past September. This will have a negative operating income impact of approximately $35 million next year, when the effect of the change in depreciation rates is also taken into account.
Our gas distribution unit is having another outstanding year, attributable primarily to our business model and expense control. Annual rate adjustments in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recover increased investments, as well as reductions in gas usage without the necessity of a major rate proceeding. This significantly reduces the amount of regulatory lag we would typically experience. Like most of the industry, we are very focused on pipeline safety and integrity. As a result, we are planning to accelerate the replacement of some aging infrastructure and increase our system improvement expenditures. We expect rate base will grow at a much faster pace, as overall capital expenditures are likely to increase to between $300 million and $400 million annually, compared to a historical level of about $200 million.
Our midstream businesses are also doing well. As expected, our field services unit demonstrated from infrastructure investments we've made into Haynesville and Fayetteville shale areas. Our gathering volume increased by almost 5% over the previous quarter, and averaged over 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. About 1 billion cubic feet per day was gathered out of the Haynesville shale.
Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were down about 2% from the previous quarter, in line with our expectations.
Next year, we expect the volumes out of Haynesville will reach 1.5 billion cubic feet per day by the second quarter. We expect volumes out of the Fayetteville and Woodford to increase as well. While a number of producers are shifting their emphasis from leaner shale plays to more liquid-rich plays, our principal customers have maintained a consistent level of drilling in these shales.
Natural gas prices, however, have weakened, which could potentially impact our customers' future drilling programs, and will impact the value of our retained natural gas volumes as well. While we continue to see gathering opportunities in the Mid-Continent, we are also focused on diversifying and expanding our gathering footprint into more liquids-rich areas like the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash and Marcellus.
Our Interstate Pipelines earnings were down from last year, primarily due to the exploration of an above-market backhaul contract earlier this year, and the impacts of a restructured long-term contract with our natural gas distribution affiliate. Reduced basis has also resulted in a decline in our off system sales. However, we were able to offset some of this revenue loss with new contracts, primarily electric generation customers, as well as increases in some ancillary revenues, or services, I should say.
Going forward, we expect considerable competition for new businesses in contract renewals from other pipelines in or near our footprint. We anticipate basis will remain compressed, and all system revenues will be adversely impacted. However, we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipeline with special focus on power generation customers. We currently serve 22 natural gas-fired power plants. There are over 40 coal plants within 50 miles of our system and we anticipate that retirements in more stringent regulations will lead to increased use of natural gas.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales unit's financial results were down this quarter. Our retail business continues to perform well. However, reduced gas price volatility and the lack of geographic and seasonal basis spreads have reduced wholesale optimization opportunities. Some of the pipeline in storage capacity we contracted for in the past, no longer provide value, and in some cases are underwater. Much of the uneconomic capacity will terminate over the next 18 months. We are also releasing some of this capacity early, and expect to recognize the economic loss in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our focus is on expanding our commercial and industrial base and increasing our product and service offerings.
Now let me turn to our true-up appeal. As most of you know, in September, we reached a settlement with the PUC staff and other intervenors, resolving all matters in our true-up appeal. The settlement allows us to recover approximately $1.7 billion, out of which, we must pay the legal fees associated with this preceding, and the financing costs to issue transition bonds to securitize this amount. Last month, the commission approved the settlement and a financing order for the issuance of the bonds. We expect to issue the bonds later this year or early next year. Gary will give you a little more color around this process in a few minutes.
As you would expect, we are pleased that this issue is finally resolved, and we can now look to the future. The obvious question, what will we do with the securitization proceeds? Our first priority is to invest this money in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. We will be disciplined in our approach. Our portfolio have -- of energy delivery businesses provides us with significant opportunities for investment. Of course, we'll have to be patient and diligent in evaluating these opportunities.
We have talked in the past about reducing outstanding debt and a modest stock buyback program with a portion of the proceeds. While these alternatives are still viable, our first priority will be to invest the money in our businesses.
Let me conclude by expressing how excited and confident we are in the future of CenterPoint Energy. With the receipt of the true-up proceeds, we have a unique opportunity to build a stronger company, which will benefit both our shareholders and customers. Our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses have served us well since our formation 9 years ago. We recognize the energy markets are changing. Lower prices and ample supplies of natural gas will benefit both our electric and gas distribution utilities. At the same time, it will present both challenges and opportunities for our midstream and energy services businesses.
We look forward to building from our strong base and continuing our track record of strong performance for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I will update you on the expected timeline to issue the new transition bonds, the replacement of our revolving credit facilities and our revised earnings guidance.
I'll start with the transition bond. As David mentioned, the Texas PUC issued a financing order on October 27. We have been working with the PUC staff, as well as our financial advisor on various aspects of the issuance, and we feel we have made excellent progress. There are 2 key gaining items in preparing to go to market. First, the credit rating agencies have to establish a rating for the bond. And second, we need to register the sale of the transition bonds with the SEC.
We will issue the bonds as soon as reasonably possible in order to take advantage of historical low interest rates for the benefit of our customers. We are making solid progress on all aspects of the preparatory work, and at this point, we anticipate we will be able to market the bonds either late this year or very early in the new year.
In September, we had a very successful syndication of our new revolving credit facilities and closed on 3 5-year senior unsecured facilities totaling $2.45 billion. The economic terms and covenants are in line with other recently syndicated facilities. The drawing cost under the newfacilities are approximately 100 basis points higher than the cost of the previous facility. We are very pleased that we have locked in our short-term liquidity sources for the next 5 years.
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance for the year. As David discussed, we are very pleased with the overall financial performance of our businesses this year, and this morning, we said that we expect 2011 earnings to be at the high-end of our guidance range of $1.04 to $1.14 per fully diluted share.
On a guidance basis, which excludes the earnings impact of recording the true-up settlement, the change in the value of Time Warner stocks and the related ZENS securities, as well as the timing effects of mark-to-market in inventory accounting, we earned $0.95 per fully diluted share through the third quarter. In providing earnings guidance, we have assumed normal weather for the balance of the year. And we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as various economic, operational and regulatory assumptions.
Now, I would like to turn the call back to Marianne."

You're right, I think the midstream businesses, some of the multiples that have been paid lately are pretty rich. And we're not going to do anything that is not going to create value for us. So you have to have some real growth potential in those -- for those assets to pay that kind of multiple, I would think. So we have seen some opportunities. We've looked at them, and we continued to look at them. And we're really getting -- we're going to spend some time in the next 3 to 6 months to really decide where the opportunities are and if there are any real opportunities in one sector or the other."

But we're still having losses in our wholesale business. We're going to try to get out from under some of the capacity that we're not using today. We've already posted some of that for release. We're going to take some losses early in the fourth quarter. So that's a little bit of headwind there that you noted. I would also remind you that we do have the rate case. The full impact of the Houston Electric rate case will be felt in the fourth quarter. That's probably $10 million, give or take, impact in the fourth quarter of this year. And there is a little bit of timing issue around Field Services. We have these guaranteed throughput agreements. We booked some commitments in the third quarter because we know that our suppliers are not going to make their full -- or our customers are not going to make their full volume commitment. So that kind of moves between quarters. And we probably took a little bit more in the third quarter because they were just not going to make it than we had earlier anticipated. But overall, for the year, we're right where we thought we would be. There's just a little bit of movement between quarters."

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
This past quarter was a very good one for the company. We had a strong quarter from an earnings standpoint, and after 7 years, we resolved the long-standing issues associated with our true-up proceeding.
Our press release and 10-Q provide details around our business unit's financial performance this past quarter, so I won't repeat the specifics. But let me summarize the performance of each business unit and talk a little bit about their prospects.
Houston Electric had an outstanding quarter, and is having a really good year. This past summer was the hottest summer on record for Texas. This drove the largest part of Houston Electric's earnings gains. I was really pleased at how well our system performed when faced with a stressed that the extreme heat placed on it. We've also taken the opportunity to invest more in system hardening and reliability, which benefits not only this year, but the years ahead as well. 
The future looks bright for this unit. While we can't count on repeating the weather-driven earnings we experienced this year, we can count on a solid and growing service territory. We have added more than 35,000 customers since this time last year, and believe we'll see a continuation of that pace of growth next year. 
Very few areas around the country are experiencing this type of economic activity and growth. Capital expenditures should approximate between $500 million and $600 million annually, as we build infrastructure to serve new loads and automate the grid. The primary earnings headwind this unit faces comes from the rate changes implemented this past September. This will have a negative operating income impact of approximately $35 million next year, when the effect of the change in depreciation rates is also taken into account.
Our gas distribution unit is having another outstanding year, attributable primarily to our business model and expense control. Annual rate adjustments in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recover increased investments, as well as reductions in gas usage without the necessity of a major rate proceeding. This significantly reduces the amount of regulatory lag we would typically experience. Like most of the industry, we are very focused on pipeline safety and integrity. As a result, we are planning to accelerate the replacement of some aging infrastructure and increase our system improvement expenditures. We expect rate base will grow at a much faster pace, as overall capital expenditures are likely to increase to between $300 million and $400 million annually, compared to a historical level of about $200 million.
Our midstream businesses are also doing well. As expected, our field services unit demonstrated from infrastructure investments we've made into Haynesville and Fayetteville shale areas. Our gathering volume increased by almost 5% over the previous quarter, and averaged over 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. About 1 billion cubic feet per day was gathered out of the Haynesville shale.
Gathering volumes from our traditional basins were down about 2% from the previous quarter, in line with our expectations.
Next year, we expect the volumes out of Haynesville will reach 1.5 billion cubic feet per day by the second quarter. We expect volumes out of the Fayetteville and Woodford to increase as well. While a number of producers are shifting their emphasis from leaner shale plays to more liquid-rich plays, our principal customers have maintained a consistent level of drilling in these shales.
Natural gas prices, however, have weakened, which could potentially impact our customers' future drilling programs, and will impact the value of our retained natural gas volumes as well. While we continue to see gathering opportunities in the Mid-Continent, we are also focused on diversifying and expanding our gathering footprint into more liquids-rich areas like the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash and Marcellus.
Our Interstate Pipelines earnings were down from last year, primarily due to the exploration of an above-market backhaul contract earlier this year, and the impacts of a restructured long-term contract with our natural gas distribution affiliate. Reduced basis has also resulted in a decline in our off system sales. However, we were able to offset some of this revenue loss with new contracts, primarily electric generation customers, as well as increases in some ancillary revenues, or services, I should say.
Going forward, we expect considerable competition for new businesses in contract renewals from other pipelines in or near our footprint. We anticipate basis will remain compressed, and all system revenues will be adversely impacted. However, we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipeline with special focus on power generation customers. We currently serve 22 natural gas-fired power plants. There are over 40 coal plants within 50 miles of our system and we anticipate that retirements in more stringent regulations will lead to increased use of natural gas.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales unit's financial results were down this quarter. Our retail business continues to perform well. However, reduced gas price volatility and the lack of geographic and seasonal basis spreads have reduced wholesale optimization opportunities. Some of the pipeline in storage capacity we contracted for in the past, no longer provide value, and in some cases are underwater. Much of the uneconomic capacity will terminate over the next 18 months. We are also releasing some of this capacity early, and expect to recognize the economic loss in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our focus is on expanding our commercial and industrial base and increasing our product and service offerings.
Now let me turn to our true-up appeal. As most of you know, in September, we reached a settlement with the PUC staff and other intervenors, resolving all matters in our true-up appeal. The settlement allows us to recover approximately $1.7 billion, out of which, we must pay the legal fees associated with this preceding, and the financing costs to issue transition bonds to securitize this amount. Last month, the commission approved the settlement and a financing order for the issuance of the bonds. We expect to issue the bonds later this year or early next year. Gary will give you a little more color around this process in a few minutes.
As you would expect, we are pleased that this issue is finally resolved, and we can now look to the future. The obvious question, what will we do with the securitization proceeds? Our first priority is to invest this money in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. We will be disciplined in our approach. Our portfolio have -- of energy delivery businesses provides us with significant opportunities for investment. Of course, we'll have to be patient and diligent in evaluating these opportunities.
We have talked in the past about reducing outstanding debt and a modest stock buyback program with a portion of the proceeds. While these alternatives are still viable, our first priority will be to invest the money in our businesses.
Let me conclude by expressing how excited and confident we are in the future of CenterPoint Energy. With the receipt of the true-up proceeds, we have a unique opportunity to build a stronger company, which will benefit both our shareholders and customers. Our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses have served us well since our formation 9 years ago. We recognize the energy markets are changing. Lower prices and ample supplies of natural gas will benefit both our electric and gas distribution utilities. At the same time, it will present both challenges and opportunities for our midstream and energy services businesses.
We look forward to building from our strong base and continuing our track record of strong performance for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I will update you on the expected timeline to issue the new transition bonds, the replacement of our revolving credit facilities and our revised earnings guidance.
I'll start with the transition bond. As David mentioned, the Texas PUC issued a financing order on October 27. We have been working with the PUC staff, as well as our financial advisor on various aspects of the issuance, and we feel we have made excellent progress. There are 2 key gaining items in preparing to go to market. First, the credit rating agencies have to establish a rating for the bond. And second, we need to register the sale of the transition bonds with the SEC.
We will issue the bonds as soon as reasonably possible in order to take advantage of historical low interest rates for the benefit of our customers. We are making solid progress on all aspects of the preparatory work, and at this point, we anticipate we will be able to market the bonds either late this year or very early in the new year.
In September, we had a very successful syndication of our new revolving credit facilities and closed on 3 5-year senior unsecured facilities totaling $2.45 billion. The economic terms and covenants are in line with other recently syndicated facilities. The drawing cost under the new facilities are approximately 100 basis points higher than the cost of the previous facility. We are very pleased that we have locked in our short-term liquidity sources for the next 5 years.
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance for the year. As David discussed, we are very pleased with the overall financial performance of our businesses this year, and this morning, we said that we expect 2011 earnings to be at the high-end of our guidance range of $1.04 to $1.14 per fully diluted share.
On a guidance basis, which excludes the earnings impact of recording the true-up settlement, the change in the value of Time Warner stocks and the related ZENS securities, as well as the timing effects of mark-to-market in inventory accounting, we earned $0.95 per fully diluted share through the third quarter. In providing earnings guidance, we have assumed normal weather for the balance of the year. And we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance, as well as various economic, operational and regulatory assumptions.
Now, I would like to turn the call back to Marianne."

You're right, I think the midstream businesses, some of the multiples that have been paid lately are pretty rich. And we're not going to do anything that is not going to create value for us. So you have to have some real growth potential in those -- for those assets to pay that kind of multiple, I would think. So we have seen some opportunities. We've looked at them, and we continued to look at them. And we're really getting -- we're going to spend some time in the next 3 to 6 months to really decide where the opportunities are and if there are any real opportunities in one sector or the other."

We're going to take some losses early in the fourth quarter. So that's a little bit of headwind there that you noted. I would also remind you that we do have the rate case. The full impact of the Houston Electric rate case will be felt in the fourth quarter. That's probably $10 million, give or take, impact in the fourth quarter of this year. And there is a little bit of timing issue around Field Services. We have these guaranteed throughput agreements. We booked some commitments in the third quarter because we know that our suppliers are not going to make their full -- or our customers are not going to make their full volume commitment. So that kind of moves between quarters. And we probably took a little bit more in the third quarter because they were just not going to make it than we had earlier anticipated.
