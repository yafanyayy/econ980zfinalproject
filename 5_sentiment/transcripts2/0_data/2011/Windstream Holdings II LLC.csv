Appreciate you joining us this morning. Today's conference call, which preceded by our fourth quarter 2010 earnings release, which has been distributed on the news wires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describes factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.
Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization, and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes non-cash pension expense, stock compensation expense and restructuring charges. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger integration expense less cash interest, cash taxes and capital expenditures and cash pension contributions as presented on an actual basis to reflect all acquisitions from the date in which we acquired those businesses
Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures. During the fourth quarter, Windstream completed the acquisitions of Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions. To assist investors, we revised our pro forma results from current businesses to include the results of both companies from periods shown. These results also include DNA, Lexcom, NuVox in Iowa and exclude our former Supply business from periods. We will make references to these pro forma results from current businesses, including the year-over-year comparisons, during our call.
While we provided updated pro forma historical results in January, these were preliminary estimates and we subsequently received our initial valuation of the assets required and we've updated the pro adjusted depreciation and amortization accordingly.
Participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and CEO; Brent Whittington, Windstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer.
At the end of the call, we will take a few questions. And with that, here is Jeff Gardner."

Today, I will make a few comments about our accomplishments during the fourth quarter and full year and provide an update on our 2011 initiatives. Brent will then discuss the operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance and 2011 guidance.
Windstream delivered another solid quarter, both operationally and financially, in the fourth quarter, and our team continues to execute very well on all fronts. In addition to the solid performance, we closed the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions transactions in the fourth quarter, and we are very excited to have these businesses as part of the Windstream team. Q-Comm provides a highly complementary and robust long-haul fiber network, which more than doubled our existing fiber, providing both network efficiencies and very attractive growth opportunities, particularly with wireless backhaul services. Hosted Solutions adds five best in class data centers, offering managed services, cloud computing and co-location, which will further broaden our business portfolio. Both companies are a great strategic fit and bring a very experienced, talented team to the Windstream organization.
Looking back, 2010 was an incredible year for Windstream, and I am very pleased with all that we accomplished. Our transformation is not complete, but we are well on our way. Strategically, we completed four targeted acquisitions, which added well running businesses to our portfolio and better positioned Windstream for the future. With the acquisitions, we now operate in 29 states with an annual revenue and adjusted OIBDA of $4.1 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Collectively, these deals improve our strategic position by further shifting our revenue mix to business and broadband, expanding our business portfolio of services and generating over $90 million in synergies. Prior to the transactions we completed in 2010, our revenue and OIBA declines were in the mid- to low single-digits. The acquisitions, combined with our strategic focus and solid execution, are transforming the underlying growth characteristics of our business, as evidenced by our 2010 pro forma performance.
Operationally, our team did a fantastic job executing on our organic business plan, while also completing several integrations, resulting in industry leading performance. We continue to make great strides in our business channel, which is reflected in business service revenues growing year-over-year. Additionally, our solid execution, innovative pricing plans and expanded distribution are driving improved results in the consumer channel.
Financially, we continued to improve our top line trends and did a great job managing overall expenses. We achieved our revenue, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow goals that we set forth earlier in 2010. During 2010, on a GAAP basis, we generated $818 million in adjusted free cash flow, and our payout ratio was 57%.
Turning to the regulatory front. The FCC is moving forward with plans to modernize and streamline its intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. Windstream has long supported reform and is pleased that the commission recognizes the importance of adopting forward-looking reforms with sensible transitions and reasonable opportunities to recover revenues. Further, we are pleased by the FCC's intent to better target universal service funds so that existing networks continue to receive the necessary support while new broadband facilities can be deployed in areas that otherwise would be uneconomic to serve. Windstream continues to be less reliant on federal subsidies. With just 2.5% of our total revenues coming from federal U.S. while Switched Access is down to 7% of total revenues.
As a result of the broadband stimulus funding, Windstream will invest approximately $240 million over a couple of years in our broadband network, enabling us to expand broadband availability to roughly 93% of our customers, upgrade our network and enhance broadband speeds in underserved areas, which should result in attractive growth opportunities, given the pent-up demands in these areas. We have finalized the RUS agreement and begin working at these projects as we enter 2011. We are very pleased that the RUS and Windstream share a common goal, to build this new broadband capacity in rural America as quickly as possible.
In 2011, we will focus on completing the integrations of Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions. We plan to invest capital for growth to very promising success based initiatives, such as wireless backhaul and data center expansion. Also, with the stimulus reward I just mentioned, we will expand and enhance our broadband capabilities. These investments, along with our recent acquisitions and improving legacy performance, will further improve the long-term financial characteristics of your business and create a path to realize revenue growth in the future. No one would've predicted this that we have this opportunity back in 2006, but that has always been our goal in both of our management team and our Board. Going forward, we will be mindful of strategic opportunities with the continued bias for towards well run companies that advance our strategy to grow revenue and free cash flow. Any strategic opportunities will also be assessed against our plan to reduce total leverage from current levels of 3.55 to our historic range of 3.2x to 3.4x. I'm very proud of the transformation Windstream has made and I'm confident in the strategic path we have pursued, one that is focused both on improving the revenue trajectory and optimizing the cost structure. This strategy has positioned Windstream to grow into the future to improve the long-term sustainability of our cash flow and most importantly, to create shareholder value. Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results."

We've made great strides within our business channel, which now represents roughly half of Windstream's total revenues. And importantly, these revenues are growing. The acquisitions we made in 2010, combined with our internal focus and initiatives, significantly enhance our business capabilities.
From a residential perspective, we continue to see growth in broadband units and complementary broadband features. This, combined with our innovative pricing strategy and expanded distribution, is stabilizing the consumer channel, which is an important component of our strategy to improve our top line trends.
Turning to our fourth quarter pro forma results, in total, we added over 12,000 new broadband customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.3 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 43% of total voice lines. We ended the year with approximately 434,000 video customers, representing 8% growth over last year and 23% penetration of our primary residential customers. Total access lines declined by approximately 36,000 during the quarter, resulting in a decline in total access lines of 3.6% year-over-year. In the business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew by 4% year-over-year. Advanced Data and Integrated Solutions increased 6% year-over-year, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data services, ethernet Internet access and managed services.
Special Access circuits increased 5% year-over-year, due to increased wireless backhaul demand. And we remain focused on providing outstanding service to the wireless carriers and positioning ourselves to capture share as needs expand. In total, business access lines declined 1.9% year-over-year, an improvement of 70 basis points sequentially. We remain as the business channel by focusing on revenue and profitability, and importantly, business revenues grew 2% during the fourth quarter.
We have made significant improvements in the business channel. And with our recent acquisitions, investments in our network and increased organizational focus, we are in a much stronger competitive position today.
In the consumer channel, residential high-speed Internet customers grew 7% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 61% of primary residential lines. Despite a slowdown in subscriber growth due to our higher penetration, consumer broadband revenues grew 10% year-over-year, due to the focus and related success we are having selling complementary broadband features, such as a Security Suite, techhelp and online backup. This quarter, video customers were essentially flat, driven in part by very strong DISH growth adds during our third quarter related to the Price For Life commotion and fewer migrations of existing DISH customers to the Windstream bundle given our higher video penetration.
Consumer access lines declined 4.5% year-over-year, an increase of 50 basis points sequentially. While losses in primary residential lines improve, less profitable products, including green stream and higher secondary LAN loss, resulted in greater total consumer losses. Importantly, consumer revenues are only down 3%, a result of the successor seen with our pricing strategy and increased sales of broadband features.
From an integration perspective, we completed the integrations of D&E, Lexcom, NuVox and Iowa Telecom and the businesses are performing in line with our expectations and tracking toward a free cash flow synergies targeted when we announced each deal. We closed the economic news that solutions in December and are well underway on our integration plans and remain excited about the opportunities these businesses will bring to Windstream. Our team is focused on the integration of both companies, which should be straightforward, given the nature of the businesses and limited conversion efforts.
Looking forward, our key operational focus will remain on improving the top line trends. In the business channel, we will leverage our expanded service capabilities, including IT services, managed services, data center co-location and fiber transport across a broader footprint to increase sales opportunities, and we'll continue to grow our alternative distribution channels. In addition, we plan to invest for further growth in certain key areas, such as success-based fiber initiatives, data center expansion and business market expansion.
From a residential perspective, we plan to maintain the Price For Life pricing strategy and a modestly increased pricing for certain plants, such as green stream and secondary lines, which will likely impact units, but importantly, should be positive from a revenue perspective. Additionally, with the help of the stimulus brands, we are investing a significant amount to expand both the reach and the speeds of our broadband network, which should provide incremental revenue opportunities, given that we are likely going to be the only wire provider in the areas and we'll have the ability to reach tens of thousands of new customers.
In summary, I'd like to thank the Windstream team for all that we have accomplished in 2010. I'm optimistic about our plans for 2011, and believe we're well-positioned for future success. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who will discuss our financial results."
25090458,118431306,104534,"Windstream Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2011",2011-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $981 million, operating income of $259 million and $0.15 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $16 million in",1371,"Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $981 million, operating income of $259 million and $0.15 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $16 million in after-tax merger and integration costs and $4 million in after-tax restructuring charges, which lowered EPS of roughly $0.04 and affect the year-over-year comparisons.
Turning to our pro forma results for the fourth quarter, Windstream delivered total revenues of $1.03 billion, a decrease of 2.2% to year-over-year. Specifically, consumer service revenue declined $11 million or 3% year-over-year, driven by fewer voice customers, offset partially by growth in price select bundles, broadband features and Long Distance packages. Business service revenue increased $9 million or 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in Integrated solutions, Special Access, next-generation IP data and data center services, which outpaced pressures from voice and Long Distance revenues. These improved revenue trends validate our strategy to position the business to focus on the growth areas of our industry. Wholesale service revenue declined $22 million or 12% year-over-year, primarily the result of fewer access lines. Total product sales were flat year-over-year. Specifically, by category, Voice and Long Distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining à la carte feature packages. Data and Integrated Solutions increased $24 million or 8%, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data offerings and advanced data services to business customers, combined with growth in consumer Internet and broadband features. Special Access revenues increased $4 million or 3% due to circuit growth resulting primarily from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switch access and USF revenues declined $19 million year-over-year or 12%, partially a result of fewer minutes of use and margin neutral risk cost initiative and unfavorable year-over-year comparisons due to a positive nonrecurring item recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both miscellaneous revenues and product sales were flat year-over-year.
Sequentially, total service revenue was roughly flat due to growth in data and Integrated Solutions and Special Access, which offset lower voice and Switched Access revenues. Product sales decreased by $3 million sequentially to $24 million. Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $24 million or 4% year-over-year. Excluding the non-cash pension X cost, expenses were lower by $16 million or 3% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $13 million due primarily to lower Internet connection expense related to our lease cost initiatives and reduced pension and benefits expense. Cost of products sold decrease by $2 year-over-year due to fewer product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $15 million or 10% year-over-year, due to deal synergies and lower advertising expense. Restructuring charges were up $5 million due to a voluntary workforce reduction during the fourth quarter of 2010, which we expect to result in annual pretax savings of roughly $10 million.
Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $10 million due to seasonal declines in over time, a decrease in advertising spend, incremental acquisitions synergies and lower product expenses resulting from lower sequential sales. For the quarter, OIBA was $496 million, which was flat year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $523 million, a decrease of less than 1% year-over-year and our adjusted EBITDA margin improved 83 basis points year-over-year to 50.8%. Operating income was $288 million, up 4% to year-over-year.
Let me turn to our pro forma results for the full year. Windstream generated revenue of $4.1 billion, a decrease of 2.2% year-over-year. This is a significant improvement from our heritage 2009 results, where we saw declines of roughly 5% and reflects the success of our strategy to expand our focus on growth areas of the business while stabilizing the consumer channel. Adjusted OIBDA totaled $2.1 billion, which was flat year-over-year as a result of the improving revenue trends, the realization of roughly 55% in deal synergies and solid cost management efforts throughout our entire organization. Finally, for the year, capital expenditures totaled $490 million.
On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $818 million for the year, a decrease of less than 1% year-over-year, even with a $41 million cash contribution to our pension plan, and our dividend payout ratio for the year was 57%.
I'm very pleased to report that we met the guidance ranges for revenue, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow, and we are slightly above the CapEx range based on success based fiber investments we made in the fourth quarter.
From a balance sheet perspective during the fourth quarter, we increased revolver capacity from $500 million to $750 million to provide additional borrowing capacity and possibility. Furthermore, we extended all remaining revolver commitments, such that all $750 million now matures in 2013. In early December, we funded the Hosted Solutions and Q-Comm transactions with cash on hand, revolver borrowings and proceeds were $500 million we completed in October. We ended the year with $42 million in cash and an outstanding revolver balance of $150 million. Our pro forma leverage was 3.55x. 2010 was a pivotal year for Windstream, and the strategic path we are following has positioned the business to improve revenue trends and sustain cash flows well into the future. With the recent transactions, the overall leverage has increased slightly and we plan to deleverage the business back to historical levels of 3.2x to 3.4x. As of January 1, our pension plan access was approximately $870 million, and we expect to make a $60 million contribution to our pension plan in February in the form of company stock to manage net leverage. In January, we completed a $200 million note offering with the proceeds being used to retire the $400 million of notes from the of 2015. We also plan to use your revolver borrowings to complete the redemptions of our notes.
Let me turn to our views for 2011, which continue to show improvement in both the top line and adjusted OIBDA trends compared to the prior year. First, we continue to expect declines in voice and Switched Access revenues, but expect some improvement due to higher bundle penetration and mature competitive environment. These revenue declines should be mostly offset by continued growth in advanced data and integrated solutions and special access revenues.
Turning to expenses, we expect a decrease in non-cash pension expense from $62 million to $41 million. And we expect total cost to decline year-over-year due to additional deal synergies and continued aggressive cost management. Like in 2010, we expect to show improved year-over-year performance in the back half of the year once we completed our integration efforts, realize additional synergies and we see some of the expected benefits from our success-based capital investments.
Based on those assumptions, we expect 2011 revenue to be within the range of $4.015 billion to $4.14 billion, which is a decline of 3% to flat compared to our 2010 pro forma results. We expect adjusted OIBDA to be within a range of $2.045 billion to $2.105 billion, which is a decline of 1% to an increase of 2%. We expect OIBDA, which includes the non-cash pension and non-cash compensation expense, to be within a range of $1.985 billion to $2.045 billion, which is flat to an increase of 4%. We expect to spend between $520 million to $580 million of capital expenditures. This range includes roughly $40 million in Windstream matching funds for stimulus projects that we expect to complete in 2011. It excludes capital expenditures funded by the RUS brands. Our CapEx guidance also includes investments with success-based fiber and data center initiatives. Our guidance assumes net cash interest of $552 million and cash taxes of $50 million and $6 million, which reflects the benefit of 100% accelerated depreciation for capital investments. With all of these variables, we expect to generate $863 million to $973 million of free cash flow, resulting in an expected dividend payout ratio of 52% to 59%. In summary, we are very pleased with our results for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2010 and are looking forward to the opportunities 2011 will bring. With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Operator, will you please review the instructions and open the call to questions."

But you really need to think about that excluding the broadband stimulus funding, which was we expect to be $40 million in 2011. So if you think about this guidance range excluding broadband stimulus, you're $480 million to $540 million. So you can really see how prior year capital really still fits within that range. And ultimately, success based capital investments were looking at have long-term contracts associated with them as well as very positive returns. That's what we're looking. We make these capital investments on fiber side as well as in the data center space. In terms of capital distribution to shareholders, obviously we continue to provide the dollar dividend in 2010 expect to do that in 2011 again, which is obviously a significant return of capital to our shareholders and we show that to be $509 million in 2011. In 2011, as I indicated, we're going to be focused on bringing leverage back to our historical levels. That's 3.2x to 3.4x.

Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.
Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization, and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes non-cash pension expense, stock compensation expense and restructuring charges. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger integration expense less cash interest, cash taxes and capital expenditures and cash pension contributions as presented on actual basis to reflect all acquisitions from the date in which we acquired those businesses.
Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website where we posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures. 
During the fourth quarter, Windstream completed the acquisitions of Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions. To assist investors, we revised our pro-forma results from current businesses to include the results of both companies from periods shown. These results also include D&E, Lexcom, NuVox in Iowa and exclude our former Supply business for all periods. We will make references to these pro-forma results from current businesses, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call.
While we provided updated pro-forma historical results in January, these were preliminary estimates and we subsequently received our initial valuation of the assets required and we've updated the pro-forma adjusted depreciation and amortization accordingly.
Participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and CEO; Brent Whittington, Windstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer.

Today, I will make a few comments about our accomplishments during the fourth quarter and full year and provide an update on our 2011 initiatives. Brent will then discuss the operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance and 2011 guidance.
Windstream delivered another solid quarter, both operationally and financially, in the fourth quarter, and our team continues to execute very well on all fronts. In addition to the solid performance, we closed the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions transactions in the fourth quarter, and we are very excited to have these businesses as part of the Windstream team. 
Q-Comm provides a highly complementary and robust long-haul fiber network, which more than doubled our existing fiber, providing both network efficiencies and very attractive growth opportunities, particularly with wireless backhaul services. 
Hosted Solutions adds five best-in-class data centers, offering managed services, cloud computing and co-location, which will further broaden our business portfolio. Both companies are a great strategic fit and bring a very experienced, talented team to the Windstream organization.
Looking back, 2010 was an incredible year for Windstream, and I am very pleased with all that we accomplished. Our transformation is not complete, but we are well on our way. Strategically, we completed four targeted acquisitions, which added well-running businesses to our portfolio and better positioned Windstream for the future. 
With the acquisitions, we now operate in 29 states with an annual revenue and adjusted OIBDA of $4.1 billion and $2.1 billion respectively. Collectively, these deals improve our strategic position by further shifting our revenue mix to business in broadband, expanding our business portfolio of services and generating over $90 million in synergies. 
Prior to the transactions we completed in 2010, our revenue and OIBA declines were in the mid- to low-single digits. The acquisitions, combined with our strategic focus and solid execution, are transforming the underlying growth characteristics of our business, as evidenced by our 2010 pro-forma performance.
Operationally, our team did a fantastic job executing on our organic business plan, while also completing several integrations, resulting in industry-leading performance. We continue to make great strides in our business channel, which is reflected in business service revenues growing year-over-year. Additionally, our solid execution, innovative pricing plans and expanded distribution are driving improved results in the consumer channel.
Financially, we continued to improve our top line trends and did a great job managing overall expenses. We achieved our revenue, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow goals that we set forth earlier in 2010. During 2010, on a GAAP basis, we generated $818 million in adjusted free cash flow, and our payout ratio was 57%.
Turning to the regulatory front. The FCC is moving forward with plans to modernize and streamline its intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. Windstream has long supported reform and is pleased that the commission recognizes the importance of adopting forward-looking reforms with sensible transitions and reasonable opportunities to recover revenues. 
Further, we are pleased by the FCC's intent to better target universal service funds so that existing networks continue to receive the necessary support while new broadband facilities can be deployed in areas that otherwise would be uneconomic to serve. Windstream continues to be less reliant on federal subsidies, with just 2.5% of our total revenues coming from federal USF, while Switched Access is down to 7% of total revenues.
As a result of the broadband stimulus funding, Windstream will invest approximately $240 million over a couple of years in our broadband network, enabling us to expand broadband availability to roughly 93% of our customers, upgrade our network and enhance broadband speeds in underserved areas, which should result in attractive growth opportunities, given the pent-up demands in these areas. 
We have finalized the RUS agreements and begin working on these projects as we enter 2011. We are very pleased that the RUS and Windstream share a common goal, to build this new broadband capacity in rural America as quickly as possible.
In 2011, we will focus on completing the integrations of Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions. We plan to invest capital for growth to very promising success-based initiatives, such as wireless backhaul and data center expansion. Also, with the stimulus awards I just mentioned, we will expand and enhance our broadband capabilities. These investments, along with our recent acquisitions and improving legacy performance, will further improve the long-term financial characteristics of our business and create a path to realize revenue growth in the future. No one would've predicted this, that we have this opportunity back in 2006, but that has always been our goal in both of our management team and our board. 
Going forward, we will be mindful of strategic opportunities with the continued bias towards well-run companies that advance our strategy to grow revenue and free cash flow. Any strategic opportunities will also be assessed against our plan to reduce total leverage from current levels of 3.55x to our historic range of 3.2x to 3.4x. 
I'm very proud of the transformation Windstream has made, and I'm confident in the strategic path we have pursued, one that is focused both on improving the revenue trajectory and optimizing the cost structure. This strategy has positioned Windstream to grow into the future to improve the long-term sustainability of our cash flows and most importantly, to create shareholder value. 
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results."

And importantly, these",809,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Operationally, I'm really proud of our team's accomplishments in 2010. We've made great strides within our business channel, which now represents roughly half of Windstream's total revenues. And importantly, these revenues are growing. The acquisitions we made in 2010, combined with our internal focus and initiatives, significantly enhance our business capabilities.
From a residential perspective, we continue to see growth in broadband units and complementary broadband features. This, combined with our innovative pricing strategy and expanded distribution, is stabilizing the consumer channel, which is an important component of our strategy to improve our top line trends.
Turning to our fourth quarter pro-forma results, in total, we added over 12,000 new broadband customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.3 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 43% of total voice lines. We ended the year with approximately 434,000 video customers, representing 8% growth over last year and 23% penetration of our primary residential customers. 
Total access lines declined by approximately 36,000 during the quarter, resulting in a decline in total access lines of 3.6% year-over-year. In the business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew by 4% year-over-year. Advanced data and integrated solutions increased 6% year-over-year, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data services, Internet access and managed services. Special access circuits increased 5% year-over-year, due to increased wireless backhaul demand. And we remain focused on providing outstanding service to the wireless carriers and positioning ourselves to capture share as needs expand. 
In total, business access lines declined 1.9% year-over-year, an improvement of 70 basis points sequentially. We managed the business channel by focusing on revenue and profitability, and importantly, business revenues grew 2% during the fourth quarter. We have made significant improvements in the business channel. And with our recent acquisitions, investments in our network and increased organizational focus, we are in a much stronger competitive position today.
In the consumer channel, residential high-speed Internet customers grew 7% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 61% of primary residential lines. Despite a slowdown in subscriber growth due to our higher penetration, consumer broadband revenues grew 10% year-over-year due to the focus and related success we are having selling complementary broadband features, such as a security suite, tech help and online backup. 
This quarter, video customers were essentially flat, driven in part by very strong DISH gross adds during our third quarter related to the Price For Life promotion and a fewer migrations of existing DISH customers to the Windstream bundle given our higher video penetration.
Consumer access lines declined 4.5% year-over-year, an increase of 50 basis points sequentially. While office and primary residential lines improved, less profitable products, including Greenstreak and higher secondary line loss, resulted in greater total consumer losses. Importantly, consumer revenues were only down 3%, a result of the success we are seeing with our pricing strategy and increased sales of broadband features.
From an integration perspective, we completed the integrations of D&E, Lexcom, NuVox and Iowa Telecom and the businesses are performing in line with our expectations and tracking toward the free cash flow synergies targeted when we announced each deal. We closed the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions transactions in December and are well underway on our integration plans and remain excited about the opportunities these businesses will bring to Windstream. Our team is focused on the integration of both companies, which should be straightforward, given the nature of the businesses and limited conversion efforts.
Looking forward, our key operational focus will remain on improving the top line trends. In the business channel, we will leverage our expanded service capabilities, including IT services, managed services, data center co-location and fiber transport across a broader footprint to increase sales opportunities, and we'll continue to grow our alternative distribution channels. In addition, we plan to invest for further growth in certain key areas, such as success-based fiber initiatives, data center expansion and business market expansion.
From a residential perspective, we plan to maintain the Price For Life pricing strategy and modestly increase pricing for certain plants, such as Greenstreak and secondary lines, which will likely impact units, but importantly, should be positive from a revenue perspective. Additionally, with the help of the stimulus grants, we are investing a significant amount to expand both the reach and the speeds of our broadband network, which should provide incremental revenue opportunities, given that we are likely going to be the only wire provider in the areas and we'll have the ability to reach tens of thousands of new customers.
In summary, I'd like to thank the Windstream team for all that we accomplished in 2010. I'm optimistic about our plans for 2011, and believe we're well positioned for future success. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who's going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,118431306,104638,"Windstream Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2011",2011-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $981 million, operating income of $259 million and $0.15 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $16 million in",1379,"Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $981 million, operating income of $259 million and $0.15 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $16 million in after-tax merger and integration costs and $4 million in after-tax restructuring charges, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.04 and affect the year-over-year comparisons.
Turning to our pro-forma results for the fourth quarter, Windstream delivered total revenues of $1.03 billion, a decrease of 2.2% year-over-year. Specifically, consumer service revenue declined $11 million or 3% year-over-year, driven by fewer Voice customers, offset partially by growth in Price for Life bundles, broadband features and Long Distance packages. Business service revenue increased $9 million or 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in integrated solutions, special access, next-generation IP data and data center services, which outpaced pressures from Voice and Long Distance revenues. These improved revenue trends that validate our strategies to position the business to focus on the growth areas of our industry. Wholesale service revenue declined $22 million or 12% year-over-year, primarily the result of fewer access lines. Total product sales were flat year-over-year. 
Specifically, by category, Voice and Long Distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining à la carte feature packages. Data and integrated solutions increased $24 million or 8%, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data offerings and advanced data services to business customers, combined with growth in consumer Internet and broadband features. 
Special access revenues increased $4 million or 3% due to circuit growth resulting primarily from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switch access and USF revenues declined $19 million year-over-year or 12%, partially a result of the fewer minutes of use on margin-neutral lease cost routing initiative and unfavorable year-over-year comparisons due to a positive non-recurring item recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both miscellaneous revenues and product sales were flat year-over-year.
Sequentially, total service revenue was roughly flat due to growth in data and integrated solutions and special access, which offset lower voice and Switched Access revenues. Product sales decreased by $3 million sequentially to $24 million. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $24 million or 4% year-over-year. Excluding the non-cash pension costs, expenses were lower by $16 million or 3% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $13 million due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to our lease cost routing initiatives and reduced pension and benefits expense. Cost of products sold decrease by $2 year-over-year due to fewer product sales. 
Within SG&A, expenses decreased $15 million or 10% year-over-year due to deal synergies and a lower advertising expense. Restructuring charges were up $5 million due to a voluntary workforce reduction during the fourth quarter of 2010, which we expect to result in annual pretax savings of roughly $10 million.
Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $10 million due to seasonal declines in over time, a decrease in advertising spend, incremental acquisitions synergies and lower product expenses resulting from lower sequential sales. For the quarter, OIBA was $496 million, which was flat year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $523 million, a decrease of less than 1% year-over-year and our adjusted EBITDA margin improved 83 basis points year-over-year to 50.8%. Operating income was $288 million, up 4% to year-over-year.
Let me turn to our pro-forma results for the full year. Windstream generated revenue of $4.1 billion, a decrease of 2.2% year-over-year. This is a significant improvement from our heritage 2009 results, where we saw declines of roughly 5% and reflects the success of our strategy to expand our focus on growth areas of the business while stabilizing the consumer channel. Adjusted OIBDA totaled $2.1 billion, which was flat year-over-year as a result of the improving revenue trends, the realization of roughly 55% in deal synergies and solid cost management efforts throughout our entire organization. 
Finally, for the year, capital expenditures totaled $490 million. On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $818 million for the year, a decrease of less than 1% year-over-year, even with a $41 million cash contribution to our pension plan, and our dividend payout ratio for the year was 57%.
I'm very pleased to report that we met the guidance ranges for revenue, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow, and we are slightly above the CapEx range based on success-based fiber investments we made in the fourth quarter.
From a balance sheet perspective during the fourth quarter, we increased the revolver capacity from $500 million to $750 million to provide additional borrowing capacity a possibility. Furthermore, we extended all remaining revolver commitments, such that all $750 million now matures in 2013. 
In early December, we funded the Hosted Solutions and Q-Comm transactions with cash on hand, revolver borrowings and proceeds with a $500 million note offering we completed in October. We ended the year with $42 million in cash and an outstanding revolver balance of $150 million. Our pro-forma leverage was 3.55x. 
2010 was a pivotal year for Windstream, and the strategic path we are following has positioned the business to improve revenue trends and sustain cash flows well into the future. With the recent transactions, the overall leverage has increased slightly and we plan to deleverage the business back to our historical levels of 3.2x to 3.4x. 
As of January 1, our pension plan assets was approximately $870 million, and we expect to make a $60 million contribution to our pension plan in February in the form of company stock to manage net leverage. In January, we completed a $200 million note offering with the proceeds being used to retire the $400 million of Valor notes that mature in 2015. We also plan to use revolver borrowings to complete the redemptions of the Valor notes.
Let me turn to our views for 2011, which continue to show improvement in both the top line and adjusted OIBDA trends compared to the prior year. First, we continue to expect declines in Voice and Switched Access revenues, but expect some improvement due to higher bundle penetration and mature competitive environment. These revenue declines should be mostly offset by continued growth in advanced data and integrated solutions and special access revenues.
Turning to expenses, we expect a decrease in non-cash pension expense from $62 million to $41 million. And we expect total cost to decline year-over-year due to additional deal synergies and continued aggressive cost management. Like in 2010, we expect to show improved year-over-year performance in the back half of the year once we have completed our integration efforts, realize additional synergies and we see some of the expected benefits from our success-based capital investments.
Based on those assumptions, we expect 2011 revenue to be within the range of $4.015 billion to $4.14 billion, which is a decline of 3% to flat compared to our 2010 pro-forma results. We expect adjusted OIBDA to be within a range of $2.045 billion to $2.105 billion, which is a decline of 1% to an increase of 2%. We expect OIBDA, which includes the non-cash pension and non-cash compensation expense, to be within a range of $1.985 billion to $2.045 billion, which is flat to an increase of 4%. We expect to spend between $520 million to $580 million on capital expenditures. This range includes roughly $40 million in Windstream matching funds for stimulus projects that we expect to complete in 2011. It excludes capital expenditures funded by the RUS grants. Our CapEx guidance also includes investments to success-based fiber and data center initiatives. Our guidance assumes net cash interest of $552 million and cash taxes of $50 million to $60 million, which reflects the benefit of 100% of accelerated depreciation for its capital investments. With all of these variables, we expect to generate $863 million to $973 million in free cash flow, resulting in an expected dividend payout ratio of 52% to 59%. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results from both the fourth quarter and the full year 2010 and are looking forward to the opportunities 2011 will bring. With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Operator, will you please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

That's really our baseline capital for 2010. And we've guided to $520 million to $580 million in 2011. But you really need to think about that excluding the broadband stimulus funding, which we expect to be $40 million in 2011. So if you think about this guidance range excluding broadband stimulus, you're $480 million to $540 million. So you can really see how prior-year capital really still even sits within that range. And ultimately, the success-based capital investments we're looking at have long-term contracts associated with them as well as very positive returns. That's what we're looking when we make these capital investments on the fiber side as well as in the data center space. And in terms of capital distribution to shareholders, obviously, we continue to provide the dollar dividend in 2010 and expect to do that in 2011, again, which is obviously a significant return of capital to our shareholders and we show it to be $509 million in 2011. In 2011, as I indicated, we're going to be focused on bringing leverage back to our historical levels, that's 3.2x to 3.4x. I think because of that, any increase to the dividend or a share repurchase program is unlikely in 2011, but as we always do, what we assess at the beginning of next year."

But we still view wireless broadband as more of a complementary product. And so as their speeds get better, Michael, I think our challenge in the way that our engineers are looking at this business and the way we're making investments is we've got to get better every year as well, and so continue to keep that gap on the wireless side. With the cable side, we're very competitive in most of our markets today. I think that we're doing very well in terms of share. And it's really the same story.

For number one, Hosted was much larger in the data center services than we were. So what we are asking that team to do is we integrate that business, and former COO's a direct report of mine, is to take over ownership of the assets we already had in place. And really our biggest area of focus, and we're working on that in terms of integration in Q1, is trying to determine where across the Windstream footprint should our sales team that exists today, which is pretty significant, focus on selling those products and services. You mentioned in terms of cloud, I mean, Hosted had a cloud platform, they're continuing to invest in. We think that's got future growth opportunity, specifically as it pertains to our business customer base and the small-business side. Whereas, Hosted may not have been able to execute that on their own, we fell pretty good about the relationships we've got with our small-business customers and really rolling out some cloud service offerings to that base later in 2011. But it's not a big component in terms of revenue expectations in 2011. It's something we'll be working to build and be focused on in 2012 certainly. In terms of Q-Comm, they've seen nice growth in 2010 versus 2009, had a lot of success on winning some tower businesses in the range of around 500-or-so at the outset. We're not going to continue to provide just guidance on tower units, specifically, but focus on the revenue growth we're seeing in special access. We saw nice growth, 2010 versus 2009. Tony talked about that. We saw a 3% growth on our own last year, and much of that came from just our organic footprint, where I think Q-Comm can really help as it had a great strategy in finding opportunities to win wireless backhaul business outside the footprint and aggressively building to deploy infrastructure in those markets and win share. And we're focused on continuing that effort and like to see those growth rates continue with that clip."

That shows up in our results but the reality is we've got a much higher penetration of DISH customers today in our market as a result of that success.

Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger and integration expense less cash interest, cash taxes and capital expenditures and cash pension contributions as presented on an actual basis to reflect all acquisitions from the date on which we acquired those businesses.
Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website where we’ve posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures. 
During the fourth quarter, Windstream completed the acquisitions of Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions. To assist investors, we revised our pro-forma results from current businesses to include the results of both companies for all periods shown. These results also include D&E, Lexcom, NuVox and Iowa and exclude our former Supply business for all periods. We will make references to these pro-forma results from current businesses, including the year-over-year comparisons, during our call.

Today, I will make a few comments about our accomplishments during the fourth quarter and full year and provide an update on our 2011 initiatives. Brent will then discuss the operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance and 2011 guidance.
Windstream delivered another solid quarter, both operationally and financially, in the fourth quarter, and our team continues to execute very well on all fronts. In addition to the solid performance, we closed the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions transactions in the fourth quarter, and we are very excited to have these businesses as part of the Windstream team. 
Q-Comm provides a highly complementary and robust long-haul fiber network, which more than doubled our existing fiber, providing both network efficiencies and very attractive growth opportunities, particularly with wireless backhaul services. 
Hosted Solutions adds five best-in-class data centers, offering managed services, cloud computing and co-location, which will further broaden our business portfolio. Both companies are a great strategic fit and bring a very experienced, talented team to the Windstream organization.
Looking back, 2010 was an incredible year for Windstream, and I am very pleased with all that we accomplished. Our transformation is not complete, but we are well on our way. Strategically, we completed four targeted acquisitions, which added well-running businesses to our portfolio and better positioned Windstream for the future. 
With the acquisitions, we now operate in 29 states with an annual revenue and adjusted OIBDA of $4.1 billion and $2.1 billion respectively. Collectively, these deals improve our strategic position by further shifting our revenue mix to business in broadband, expanding our business portfolio of services and generating over $90 million in synergies. 
Prior to the transactions we completed in 2010, our revenue and OIBDA declines were in the mid- to low-single digits. The acquisitions, combined with our strategic focus and solid execution, are transforming the underlying growth characteristics of our business, as evidenced by our 2010 pro-forma performance.
Operationally, our team did a fantastic job executing on our organic business plan, while also completing several integrations, resulting in industry-leading performance. We continue to make great strides in our business channel, which is reflected in business service revenues growing year-over-year. Additionally, our solid execution, innovative pricing plans and expanded distribution are driving improved results in the consumer channel.
Financially, we continued to improve our top line trends and did a great job managing overall expenses. We achieved our revenue, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow goals that we set forth earlier in 2010. During 2010, on a GAAP basis, we generated $818 million in adjusted free cash flow, and our payout ratio was 57%.
Turning to the regulatory front. The FCC is moving forward with plans to modernize and streamline its inter-carrier compensation and universal service policies. Windstream has long supported reform and is pleased that the commission recognizes the importance of adopting forward-looking reforms with sensible transitions and reasonable opportunities to recover revenues. 
Further, we are pleased by the FCC's intent to better target universal service funds so that existing networks continue to receive the necessary support while new broadband facilities can be deployed in areas that otherwise would be uneconomic to serve. Windstream continues to be less reliant on federal subsidies, with just 2.5% of our total revenues coming from federal USF, while Switched Access is down to 7% of total revenues.
As a result of the broadband stimulus funding, Windstream will invest approximately $240 million over a couple of years in our broadband network, enabling us to expand broadband availability to roughly 93% of our customers, upgrade our network and enhance broadband speeds in underserved areas, which should result in attractive growth opportunities, given the pent-up demands in these areas. 
We have finalized the RUS [Rural Utilities Service] agreements and began working on these projects as we entered 2011. We are very pleased that the RUS and Windstream share a common goal, to build this new broadband capacity in rural America as quickly as possible.
In 2011, we will focus on completing the integrations of Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions. We plan to invest capital for growth to very promising success-based initiatives, such as wireless backhaul and data center expansion. Also, with the stimulus awards I just mentioned, we will expand and enhance our broadband capabilities. These investments, along with our recent acquisitions and improving legacy performance, will further improve the long-term financial characteristics of our business and create a path to realize revenue growth in the future. No one would've predicted this, that we would have this opportunity back in 2006, but that has always been our goal in both of our management team and our board. 
Going forward, we will be mindful of strategic opportunities with a continued bias towards well-run companies that advance our strategy to grow revenue and free cash flow. Any strategic opportunities will also be assessed against our plan to reduce total leverage from current levels of 3.55x to our historic range of 3.2x to 3.4x. 
I'm very proud of the transformation Windstream has made, and I'm confident in the strategic path we have pursued, one that is focused both on improving the revenue trajectory and optimizing the cost structure. This strategy has positioned Windstream to grow into the future to improve the long-term sustainability of our cash flows and, most importantly, to create shareholder value. 
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results."

From a residential perspective, we continue to see growth in broadband units and complementary broadband features. This, combined with our innovative pricing strategy and expanded distribution, is stabilizing the consumer channel, which is an important component of our strategy to improve our top line trends.
Turning to our fourth quarter pro-forma results, in total, we added over 12,000 new broadband customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.3 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 43% of total voice lines. We ended the year with approximately 434,000 video customers, representing 8% growth over last year and 23% penetration of our primary residential customers. 
Total access lines declined by approximately 36,000 during the quarter, resulting in a decline in total access lines of 3.6% year-over-year. In the business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew by 4% year-over-year. Advanced data and integrated solutions increased 6% year-over-year, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data services, Ethernet Internet access and managed services. Special access circuits increased 5% year-over-year, due to increased wireless backhaul demand. And we remain focused on providing outstanding service to the wireless carriers and positioning ourselves to capture share as needs expand. 
In total, business access lines declined 1.9% year-over-year, an improvement of 70 basis points sequentially. We managed the business channel by focusing on revenue and profitability, and importantly, business revenues grew 2% during the fourth quarter. We have made significant improvements in the business channel. And with our recent acquisitions, investments in our network and increased organizational focus, we are in a much stronger competitive position today.
In the consumer channel, residential high-speed Internet customers grew 7% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 61% of primary residential lines. Despite a slowdown in subscriber growth due to our higher penetration, consumer broadband revenues grew 10% year-over-year due to the focus and related success we are having selling complementary broadband features, such as a security suite, tech help and online backup. 
This quarter, video customers were essentially flat, driven in part by very strong DISH gross adds during our third quarter related to the Price For Life promotion and the fewer migrations of existing DISH customers to the Windstream bundle given our higher video penetration.
Consumer access lines declined 4.5% year-over-year, an increase of 50 basis points sequentially. While losses in primary residential lines improved, less profitable products, including Greenstreak and higher secondary line loss, resulted in greater total consumer losses. Importantly, consumer revenues were only down 3%, a result of the success we are seeing with our pricing strategy and increased sales of broadband features.
From an integration perspective, we completed the integrations of D&E, Lexcom, NuVox and Iowa Telecom, and the businesses are performing in line with our expectations and tracking toward the free cash flow synergies targeted when we announced each deal. We closed the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions transactions in December and are well underway on our integration plans and remain excited about the opportunities these businesses will bring to Windstream. Our team is focused on the integration of both companies, which should be straightforward, given the nature of the businesses and limited conversion efforts.
Looking forward, our key operational focus will remain on improving the top line trends. In the business channel, we will leverage our expanded service capabilities, including IT services, managed services, data center co-location and fiber transport across a broader footprint to increase sales opportunities, and we'll continue to grow our alternative distribution channels. In addition, we plan to invest for further growth in certain key areas, such as success-based fiber initiatives, data center expansion and business market expansion.
From a residential perspective, we plan to maintain the Price For Life pricing strategy and have modestly increased pricing for certain plans, such as Greenstreak and secondary lines, which will likely impact units, but importantly, should be positive from a revenue perspective. Additionally, with the help of the stimulus grants, we are investing a significant amount to expand both the reach and the speeds of our broadband network, which should provide incremental revenue opportunities, given that we are likely going to be the only wire provider in the areas and we’ll have the ability to reach tens of thousands of new customers.
In summary, I'd like to thank the Windstream team for all that we accomplished in 2010. I'm optimistic about our plans for 2011 and believe we're well positioned for future success. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who's going to discuss our financial results."

For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $981 million, operating income of $259 million and $0.15 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $16 million in",1375,"Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $981 million, operating income of $259 million and $0.15 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $16 million in after-tax merger and integration costs and $4 million in after-tax restructuring charges, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.04 and affect the year-over-year comparisons.
Turning to our pro-forma results for the fourth quarter, Windstream delivered total revenues of $1.03 billion, a decrease of 2.2% year-over-year. Specifically, consumer service revenue declined $11 million or 3% year-over-year, driven by fewer Voice customers, offset partially by growth in Price for Life bundles, broadband features and Long Distance packages. Business service revenue increased $9 million or 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in integrated solutions, special access, next-generation IP data and data center services, which outpaced pressures from Voice and Long Distance revenues. These improved revenue trends validate our strategies to position the business to focus on the growth areas of our industry. Wholesale service revenue declined $22 million or 12% year-over-year, primarily the result of fewer access lines. Total product sales were flat year-over-year. 
Specifically, by category, Voice and Long Distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining à la carte feature packages. Data and integrated solutions increased $24 million or 8%, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data offerings and advanced data services to business customers, combined with growth in consumer Internet and broadband features. 
Special access revenues increased $4 million or 3% due to circuit growth resulting primarily from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switch access and USF revenues declined $19 million year-over-year or 12%, largely a result of fewer minutes of use, a margin-neutral least-cost routing initiative and unfavorable year-over-year comparisons due to a positive non-recurring item recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both miscellaneous revenues and product sales were flat year-over-year.
Sequentially, total service revenue was roughly flat due to growth in data and integrated solutions and special access, which offset lower voice and Switched Access revenues. Product sales decreased by $3 million sequentially to $24 million. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $24 million or 4% year-over-year. Excluding the non-cash pension costs, expenses were lower by $16 million or 3% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $13 million due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to our least-cost routing initiatives and reduced pension and benefits expense. Cost of products sold decreased by $2 million year-over-year due to fewer product sales. 
Within SG&A, expenses decreased $15 million or 10% year-over-year due to deal synergies and a lower advertising expense. Restructuring charges were up $5 million due to a voluntary workforce reduction during the fourth quarter of 2010, which we expect to result in annual pretax savings of roughly $10 million.
Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $10 million due to seasonal declines in over time, a decrease in advertising spend, incremental acquisition synergies and lower product expenses resulting from lower sequential sales. For the quarter, OIBDA was $496 million, which was flat year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $523 million, a decrease of less than 1% year-over-year and our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 83 basis points year-over-year to 50.8%. Operating income was $288 million, up 4% to year-over-year.
Let me turn to our pro-forma results for the full year. Windstream generated revenue of $4.1 billion, a decrease of 2.2% year-over-year. This is a significant improvement from our heritage 2009 results, where we saw declines of roughly 5% and reflects the success of our strategy to expand our focus on growth areas of the business while stabilizing the consumer channel. Adjusted OIBDA totaled $2.1 billion, which was flat year-over-year as a result of the improving revenue trends, the realization of roughly $55 million in deal synergies and solid cost management efforts throughout our entire organization. 
Finally, for the year, capital expenditures totaled $490 million. On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $818 million for the year, a decrease of less than 1% year-over-year, even with a $41 million cash contribution to our pension plan, and our dividend payout ratio for the year was 57%.
I'm very pleased to report that we met the guidance ranges for revenue, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow, and we are slightly above the CapEx range based on success-based fiber investments we made in the fourth quarter.
From a balance sheet perspective during the fourth quarter, we increased the revolver capacity from $500 million to $750 million to provide additional borrowing capacity and flexibility. Furthermore, we extended all remaining revolver commitments, such that all $750 million now matures in 2013. 
In early December, we funded the Hosted Solutions and Q-Comm transactions with cash on hand, revolver borrowings and proceeds with a $500 million note offering we completed in October. We ended the year with $42 million in cash and an outstanding revolver balance of $150 million. Our pro-forma leverage was 3.55x. 
2010 was a pivotal year for Windstream, and the strategic path we are following has positioned the business to improve revenue trends and sustain cash flows well into the future. With the recent transactions, the overall leverage has increased slightly and we plan to deleverage the business back to our historical levels of 3.2x to 3.4x. 
As of January 1, our pension plan assets was approximately $870 million, and we expect to make a $60 million contribution to our pension plan in February in the form of company stock to manage net leverage. In January, we completed a $200 million note offering with the proceeds being used to retire the $400 million of Valor notes that mature in 2015. We also plan to use revolver borrowings to complete the redemptions of the Valor notes.
Let me turn to our views for 2011, which continue to show improvement in both the top line and adjusted OIBDA trends compared to prior year. First, we continue to expect declines in Voice and Switched Access revenues but expect some improvement due to higher bundle penetration and mature competitive environment. These revenue declines should be mostly offset by continued growth in advanced data and integrated solutions and special access revenues.
Turning to expenses, we expect a decrease in non-cash pension expense from $62 million to $41 million. And we expect total cost to decline year-over-year due to additional deal synergies and continued aggressive cost management. Like in 2010, we expect to show improved year-over-year performance in the back half of the year once we have completed our integration efforts, realized additional synergies and received some of the expected benefits from our success-based capital investments.
Based on those assumptions, we expect 2011 revenue to be within a range of $4.015 billion to $4.14 billion, which is a decline of 3% to flat compared to our 2010 pro-forma results. We expect adjusted OIBDA to be within a range of $2.045 billion to $2.105 billion, which is a decline of 1% to an increase of 2%. We expect OIBDA, which includes the non-cash pension and non-cash compensation expense, to be within a range of $1.985 billion to $2.045 billion, which is flat to an increase of 4%. We expect to spend between $520 million to $580 million on capital expenditures. This range includes roughly $40 million in Windstream matching funds for stimulus projects that we expect to complete in 2011. It excludes capital expenditures funded by the RUS grants. Our CapEx guidance also includes investments to success-based fiber and data center initiatives. Our guidance assumes net cash interest of $552 million and cash taxes of $50 million to $60 million, which reflects the benefit of 100% of accelerated depreciation for its capital investments. With all of these variables, we expect to generate $863 million to $973 million in free cash flow, resulting in an expected dividend payout ratio of 52% to 59%. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results from both the fourth quarter and the full year 2010 and are looking forward to the opportunities 2011 will bring. With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Operator, will you please review the instructions and open the call to questions? Thank you."

It sounds like there's some integration stuff in the first half and then an acceleration in margins and revenues in the back half of the year, given that you're looking for kind of potentially as much as flattish revenue growth for the full year net of all these forces. So are we kind of expecting then we're exiting 2011 with growth in revenues and EBITDA, which would be kind of rare for business like this?

So that's really our baseline capital for 2010. And we've guided to $520 million to $580 million in 2011. But you really need to think about that excluding the broadband stimulus funding, which we expect to be $40 million in 2011. So if you think about this guidance range excluding broadband stimulus, you're $480 million to $540 million. So you can really see how prior-year capital really still even sits within that range. And ultimately, the success-based capital investments we're looking at have long-term contracts associated with them as well as very positive returns. That's what we're looking when we make these capital investments on the fiber side as well as in the data center space. And in terms of capital distribution to shareholders, obviously, we continue to provide the dollar dividend in 2010 and expect to do that in 2011 again, which is obviously a significant return of capital to our shareholders. We show that to be $509 million in 2011. In 2011, as I indicated, we're going to be focused on bringing leverage back to our historical levels. That's 3.2x to 3.4x. I think because of that, any increase to the dividend or a share repurchase program is unlikely in 2011, but as we always do, we’ll reassess at the beginning of next year."

I'm wondering in the Hosted Solutions acquisition, where are you in terms of integrating their platform and service offerings into your existing data centers? And with the secular shift we're starting to see towards cloud computing and managed services, how meaningful can those assets be to your business? And then in terms of the Q-Comm, you more than doubled your existing fiber footprint, and with the significant increase we're seeing in wireless data usage, what type of opportunities do you see from those assets and how many towers do you plan to reach with the incremental capital you're deploying towards fiber-to-the-cell projects?"

Number one, Hosted was much larger in the data center services side than we were. So what we are asking that team to do as we integrate that business, and their former COO's a direct report of mine, is to take over ownership of the assets we already had in place. And really our biggest area of focus, and we're working on that in terms of integration in Q1, is trying to determine where across the Windstream footprint should our sales team that exists today, which is pretty significant, focus on selling those products and services. You mentioned in terms of cloud, I mean, Hosted had a cloud platform they're continuing to invest in. We think that's got future growth opportunity, specifically as it pertains to our business customer base and the small-business side, whereas, Hosted might not have been able to execute that on their own, we feel pretty good about the relationships we've got with our small-business customers and really rolling out some cloud service offerings to that base later in 2011. But it's not a big component in terms of revenue expectations in 2011. It's something we'll be working to build and be focused on in 2012 certainly. In terms of Q-Comm, they've seen nice growth in 2010 versus 2009, had a lot of success on winning some tower businesses in the range of around 500-or-so at the outset. We're not going to continue to provide just guidance on tower units, specifically, but focus on the revenue growth we're seeing in special access. We saw nice growth, 2010 versus 2009. Tony talked about that. We saw 3% growth on our own last year, and much of that came from just our organic footprint, where I think Q-Comm can really help is they had a great strategy in finding opportunities to win wireless backhaul business outside the footprint and aggressively building to deploy infrastructure in those markets and win share. And we're focused on continuing that effort and like to see those growth rates continue at that clip."

I know there's some comments in the prepared remarks, but how much of that is really incremental synergies coming on predominantly from the Q-Comm versus opportunity to continue to drive costs out of the business and where those costs may be coming out? And then I hate to keep beating a dead horse on the tax side, but if I take the $100 million you guys talked about coming from bonus depreciation, about $25 million from the NOLs, still looking -- after adjusting for that at being kind on the mid- to high-20% payout or cash tax rate, which seems lower to me than what the effective tax rate would be.

And certainly, if you look at our results versus the industry, I think we look pretty darn good there. So we're focused on the top line. Again, a lot of that on the consumer side centered around our execution on broadband customer base, specifically. So that's really where we see that shaping up. As you look at video, there's no question, we've done, I think, over the past, a phenomenal job selling DISH into our base. It's been a key area of focus for us in terms of the core product for us for years. That shows up in our results, but the reality is we've got a much higher penetration of DISH customers today in our market as a result of that success. So we expect to see fewer net adds on a year-over-year basis simply because of our penetration, not because of a change in focus. We've just got a tremendous amount. Today, it's right at 23% primary residential lines. We can see that growing, maybe 25%, 26%, somewhere in that range, but nothing that I’d call significant over the time."

Today, I will make a few comments about our first quarter accomplishments and provide an update on our progress towards completing our key initiatives for 2011. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our solid start to 2011. We delivered strong operating metrics on all fronts and, importantly, continued to show improvement in year-over-year revenue trends. For the quarter, business in broadband revenues comprised over 60% of our total revenues and collectively grew at 3.6% year-over-year, an improvement of 40 basis points over the comparable fourth quarter growth rate. In total, on a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 1.8% and adjusted OIBDA declined 1%, both in line with our expectations.
As we mentioned on our previous call, we expect the year-over-year financial performance to improve throughout 2011 as a result of the continued improvement within our business sales organization, the investments we are making this year to drive revenue growth and the additional synergies we expect to realize from last year's transactions. We are off to a great start on our key initiatives for 2011, which include completing our integration activities, investing capital for future growth and deleveraging the balance sheet.
During the quarter, we completed the Iowa billing system conversion and have fully integrated that business into Windstream. The Iowa operation is performing extremely well. Our team is now focusing on integrating Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions, which are progressing in line with our expectations.
This quarter, we made investments to improve our Internet speed and capacity, expand our fiber-to-the-tower initiatives and to grow our data center operations. In fact, we have had tremendous success at winning wireless backhaul contracts and have seen very solid demand in data center services. And as a result, we are planning to make more investments in these areas than originally expected given the attractive growth prospects and return on investment opportunities. We are confident that this success-based capital investments will further improve our financial performance going forward.
During the quarter, we made significant balance sheet improvements as well, leading to greater financial flexibility, a much better debt maturity profile and the ability to meaningfully lower cash interest expense going forward. In fact, with our refinancing activities to date, coupled with our refinancing and deleveraging plans later this year, we could see cash interest savings of more than $90 million in 2012 and beyond as compared to the expected spend this year.
I am very pleased with our start to 2011. Our team is executing well on all fronts and continuing to deliver industry-leading operating and financial performance. It is clear that Windstream is on a different strategic path as we have built a company focused on improving top line trends to sustain and grow cash flows over the long term. We have positioned our capital structure so that we can invest in significant success-based opportunities such as fiber-to-the-tower, data center services and our broadband network, all of which have very attractive rates of return and at the same time manage our leverage to our historical range of 3.2x ask to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA. Additionally, we will continue to explore strategic opportunities that further advance our strategy, while at the same time be mindful of leverage. We have positioned this company for long-term success while delivering industry-leading shareholder returns since our spin-off nearly 5 years ago, and I'm very optimistic about the potential for us to continue trading value growing forward.

As Jeff mentioned, we delivered very strong operating results this quarter on all fronts. Specifically, we added roughly 29,000 new broadband customers, bringing our total Internet customers to 1.3 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 44% of total clients. We ended the quarter with approximately 440,000 video customers representing 6% growth year-over-year and 23% penetration of our primary residential customers. Total Access lines declined by approximately 23,000 during the quarter, resulting in a decline in total Access lines of 3.6% year-over-year and our lowest absolute decline in units in our company's history.
In the business channel, High Speed Internet customers grew by 4% year-over-year. Advanced data and integrated solutions increased 2.5% year-over-year, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data services, Ethernet Internet access and managed services. Special access circuits increased 7% year-over-year due to increased wireless backhaul demand. In total, business access lines declined 1.9% year-over-year.
Importantly, business revenues grew 2.3% during the first quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points over the fourth quarter year-over-year growth rate and a result of strong sales in our strategic business products. In the consumer channel, we added over 27,000 residential High Speed Internet customers growing total customers by 6% year-over-year, as a result of new advertising campaign targeting cable switchers. Our consumer broadband penetration is now approximately 63% of primary residential lines. Consumer broadband revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by growth in subscribers and in broadband features.
This quarter, video customers increased by 7,000, bringing our total video customer base to 440,000 or 23% penetration of primary consumer lines. Consumer access lines declined 4.5% year-over-year, which was flat sequentially. But importantly, consumer revenues were only down 3.5%, a result of the success we are seeing with our pricing strategy and increased sales of broadband services and related features.
We've been focused on improving our distribution mainly within the multidwelling units and door-to-door channels. In this quarter, we closed on several larger empty opportunities and our door-to-door channel outperformed our expectations.
From an integration perspective, our team is well underway with the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions integration efforts. The business integration is complete for both companies and the system integrations are underway and should be complete by the end of the year. The integrations of all other acquisitions are complete, and these businesses are performing in line with our expectations. 
We continue to be excited about the capabilities and new product offerings the acquisitions bring to Windstream, which collectively position us very well to provide a complete suite of business services while improving the cost structure and positioning us for future growth.
I'm very pleased with the progress we are making with our operational. We continue to enhance our business capabilities, and with Business Services representing approximately 50% of total revenues, the growth in this channel has had a significant influence in terms of improving our top line trends. Additionally, our solid execution, pricing strategy and expanded distribution are driving improving results in our consumer channel. 
2011 is another difficult year for Windstream offer the opportunity to make success-based capital investments that will better position the business for future success. In the first quarter, we made investments in our fiber-to-the-fill initiatives and are very encouraged with the number of contract that we have one, which greatly exceeded our expectations. We also expanded our data center operations in Charlotte, given the robust growth and success we've experienced in that market. And we made investments in a new Little Rock data center, which should be operational later this year. In addition, we made investments to increase our broadband capacity and speed that will allow us to deliver 10 to 12 Internet speeds over 40% of our footprint and 24 Meg speeds in our most competitive markets. 
Lastly, although very early, we have started work on several other broadband stimulus projects, which will expand and enhance our broadband capabilities in unserved rural markets. These investments are all exciting opportunities, which should yield attractive returns and provide opportunities to grow in the near future. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results."

Our GAAP results include $64 million in after-tax loss of extinguishment of debt and $6 million after-tax merger and integration costs, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.14. And thus, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the first quarter. Windstream delivered total revenues of $1.02 billion, a decrease of 1.8% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenue increased $11 million or 2.3%, driven by growth in advanced data in integrated solutions, special access and data center services, all of which outpaced pressures from voice and long distance. Consumer revenue declined $13 million or 3.5% year-over-year, driven by fewer voice customers offset partially by growth in price bundles, broadband features and long-distance packages.
Wholesale services revenue declined $20 million or 12% year-over-year, primarily the result of the decline in Switched Access revenues. Total product sales were up $4 million or 16%. Specifically, by category, voice and long-distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice line and declining feature packages. Data in integrated solutions increased $22 million or 7%, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data offerings and advanced data services to business customers combined with solid growth in consumer Internet and broadband features. 
Special access revenues increased $8 million or 6% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access declined $17 million year-over-year due to fewer minutes used in the lease cost routing initiative implemented last year. USF revenues were flat year-over-year. Product sales increased by $4 million related to better contractor and residential sales.
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $18 million or 20% year-over-year. Excluding noncash pension costs, expenses were lower by $13 million or 2% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $8 million, due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to the lease cost routing initiative mentioned previously and lower pension benefits expense. Cost of products sold increased by $1 million year-over-year due to higher product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $11 million or 7% year-over-year due to incremental deal synergies, which were partially offset by increase in advertising expense related to our new advertising campaign and an increase in commissions driven by strong business and consumer sales.
Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $8 million, due primarily to lower restructuring charges. Cost of services decreased by $7 million, driven by seasonal declines in over time and a decrease in bad debt expense. Cost of products increased by $2 million due to higher product sales. SG&A increased by roughly $4 million, due to new advertising campaign costs and higher commissions from strong sale in the first quarter. Going forward, we expect SG&A to decline sequentially throughout 2011 due to deal synergies and other cost management initiatives.
For the quarter, OIBDA was $497 million, which was flat year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $512 million, a decrease of roughly 1% year-over-year, and our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 50.1%. 
On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $169 million for the quarter, a decrease of roughly $39 million year-over-year due to higher capital spending and higher cash interest costs related to our refinancing activities, which include the early payment of accrued interest.
This quarter, we made significant improvements to the balance sheet. Specifically, we refinanced over $1.5 billion of debt and improved our debt maturity profile by moving over $1.2 billion to 2020 and beyond at very attractive long-term rates. We also increased our revolver capacity from $750 million to $1.25 billion and extended the maturity of these commitments to December 2015, which will provide additional borrowing capacity and flexibility, particularly as it relates to future refinancings. 
As a result of our refinancing efforts, we realized $101 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which was principally the tender premium costs. Importantly, we have better position to the balance sheet and maturity profile going forward. Furthermore, wit the increased revolver capacity, we have an opportunity to refinance the remaining 2016 notes at significantly lower interest rate. Following the August call date and as Jeff mentioned, we are in a position to realize cash interest savings of more than $90 million in 2012 and beyond as compared to the expected spend in 2011.
During the quarter, we completed a $60 million stock contribution to our pension. This resulted in the issuance of 4.9 million shares, which were contributed directly to the pension plan, bringing the funded level to above 80%. This quarter, we spent $160 million on capital expenditures. As Brent mentioned, we have  won significantly more fiber-to-the-cell business than we expected. In fact, we are likely going to more than double our expected fiber-to-the-cell project this year. In addition we've experienced very nice growth in our data center operations and have accelerated expansion plans in several key markets. We are also investing in our Internet speeds and capacity to drive future growth.
Given the attractive returns and long-term recurring revenues associated with these initiatives, we are eager to make these investments. As a result of the growth in these success-based capital projects, we are increasing our CapEx guidance for the year by $50 million to a range of $570 million to $630 million. At the same time, we are lowering our cash tax guidance by roughly $55 million to $1 billion for 2011. The reduction in cash taxes is a result of the early debt extinguishment fees and higher CapEx spend, which will benefit from 100% loans depreciation. 
Lastly, because of our refinancing activities and the timing of interest payments, we are raising our cash interest likely to $569 million for the year, which excluded the loss on debt extinguishment.
Collectively, we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be $845 million to $965 million, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 53% to 60%, a slight increase from our previous view of 52% to 59%. The success-based capital investments we're making today combined with our refinancing activity will improve our revenue and cash flow in 2012 and beyond. In fact, going forward, even with an expected increase in cash taxes, we have positioned the business to grow free cash flow to revenue adjusted OIBDA growth. More than $90 million of cash interest savings and after 2012 lower levels of CapEx intensity. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sahid, please review the instructions and open the call for questions."

A couple, I guess if I could. It's been a while since we heard companies get so excited about spending money, especially companies that have really attracted an investor base that's concentrated on the dividend yield and values that income stream pretty highly. When you guys have done M&A transactions in the past, you've always kind of attached a synergy number to it and then we'd be able to kind of get our arms around the rationale for what you've done in terms of these deals. But as the CapEx kind of ratchets up and you talk about the long term and maybe the CapEx will come down some day, there doesn't seem to be a lot of quantification around, what am I getting as an investor who likes dividends today for all this money that you're spending now because it looks like that money could become in the form of dividend instead, and I might like that better. Can you help walk me through why I should be as excited as you guys are about the CapEx going up? And if I could, just the second question was I think you talked about $90 million of interest savings in '12 coming from refinancing the debt. But how much more taxes are you going to pay in '12 versus '11 when the bonus depreciation steps back down?"

I think that's a great question, David, and really, what I think investors should be excited is we've got some real investment opportunities, much of it's centered around fiber-to-the-cell side. That's going to be a phenomenon that will take between 2011 and 2012. So when investors get a slightly higher capital intensity but long-term contracts with good returns that over the long run make them feel better about the cash flow, improve our ability to generate cash flow over the long term and better position us for the dividend. We said in our remarks that we really have a capital structure that allows us to make these success-based capital investments. And in fact, the reason we did the KDL deal, the Hosted Solutions deal was that we saw these success-based opportunities. We thought we were there -- we had a good chance to be aggressive they are, and we won. As Tony and Brent both mentioned, we've been very successful on the fiber-to-the-tower initiatives. So in our view, investors should be thrilled that we have this chance to further improve. You're already looking at a company that's showing improving revenue trends sequentially. That's the plan for the balance of the year, and these will only accelerate that. And as far as capital intensity, we didn't mean to leave it unclear. What I think Tony said very specifically is that 2012 will be another year where there's a lot of fiber-to-the-tower business to be won. We want to win as much as that as we can because we believe that offers great returns to our investors. After that, our capital intensity returns to the levels that our investors are useful -- used to. So from my perspective, the reason we're so excited about it is because it makes Windstream a stronger company in the long run with better growth characteristics. Today, you're looking at a company that has one of the highest dividend yields on the S&P 500, but we are also driving some of the best year-over-year revenue comparisons in the industry, and I think that should give investors comfort not concern."

But there are a lot of moving parts when it actually comes to cash taxes. And historically, when we've had 50% bonus depreciation, which is what we'll have in 2012, we've had a cash tax rate in the mid-20% range. But there's a lot of moving parts in that analysis. But as I kind of wrap it up, cash interest is going down. We're trying to grow and will grow our OIBDA and revenue in the future. All those things should give investors confidence that our payout ratio and has the dividend over long period of time."

In terms of Hosted Solutions, really I talked about this last time. But what we're trying to do is leverage not only their existing data centers and maxing out the capacity from a sales standpoint. A modest improvement in terms of the footprint of data centers on an annual basis, and we're doing that. We talked about that in terms of Little Rock, expansion at Charlotte as well, both of which were we believe have good exciting growth prospects associated with that, coupled with what I'd say continuing to monetize real estate across the Windstream footprint in terms of co-location revenues. The combination of all those things we believe is going to allow us to see revenue growth rates in the 20% range. Frankly, we think we're achieving that by the fourth quarter. it's still a smaller part of our overall revenue picture.

We move it around the network to ensure that we get the maximum number of businesses and number of broadband network elements fiber connected. So none of those elements are even contemplating in our fiber-to-tower pricing but it's something we work aggressively to accomplish as we deploy fiber throughout our network.

Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.
Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization, and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes non-cash pension expense, stock compensation expense, restructuring charges and merger integration expense. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA minus cash interest, cash taxes and CapEx and is presented on an actual basis to reflect all acquisitions from the date on which we acquired the businesses.  Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website where we’ve posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.
To assist investors, we have provided pro forma results from current businesses, which include all acquisitions we have made today for all periods shown, and we will make references to these pro forma results from current businesses including the year-over-year comparisons during our call. Additionally, as a result of the Iowa billing conversion, we reclassified certain categories, and those minor adjustments have an updated on our historical pro forma results.

Today, I will make a few comments about our first quarter accomplishments and provide an update on our progress towards completing our key initiatives for 2011. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our solid start to 2011. We delivered strong operating metrics on all fronts and, importantly, continued to show improvement in year-over-year revenue trends. For the quarter, business in broadband revenues comprised over 60% of our total revenues and collectively grew at 3.6% year-over-year, an improvement of 40 basis points over the comparable fourth quarter growth rate. In total, on a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 1.8% and adjusted OIBDA declined 1%, both in line with our expectations.
As we mentioned on our previous call, we expect the year-over-year financial performance to improve throughout 2011 as a result of the continued improvement within our business sales organization, the investments we are making this year to drive revenue growth and the additional synergies we expect to realize from last year's transactions. We are off to a great start on our key initiatives for 2011, which include completing our integration activities, investing capital for future growth and deleveraging the balance sheet.
During the quarter, we completed the Iowa billing system conversion and have fully integrated that business into Windstream. The Iowa operation is performing extremely well. Our team is now focusing on integrating Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions, which are progressing in line with our expectations.
This quarter, we made investments to improve our Internet speed and capacity, expand our fiber-to-the-tower initiatives and to grow our data center operations. In fact, we have had tremendous success at winning wireless backhaul contracts and have seen very solid demand in data center services. And as a result, we are planning to make more investments in these areas than originally expected given the attractive growth prospects and return on investment opportunities. We are confident that these success-based capital investments will further improve our financial performance going forward.
During the quarter, we made significant balance sheet improvements as well, leading to greater financial flexibility, a much better debt maturity profile and the ability to meaningfully lower cash interest expense going forward. In fact, with our refinancing activities to date, coupled with our refinancing and deleveraging plans later this year, we could see cash interest savings of more than $90 million in 2012 and beyond as compared to the expected spend this year.
I am very pleased with our start to 2011. Our team is executing well on all fronts and continuing to deliver industry-leading operating and financial performance. It is clear that Windstream is on a different strategic path as we have built a company focused on improving top line trends to sustain and grow cash flows over the long term. We have positioned our capital structure so that we can invest in significant success-based opportunities such as fiber-to-the-tower, data center services and our broadband network, all of which have very attractive rates of return and at the same time manage our leverage to our historical range of 3.2x to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA. Additionally, we will continue to explore strategic opportunities that further advance our strategy, while at the same time being mindful of leverage. We have positioned this company for long-term success while delivering industry-leading shareholder returns since our spin-off nearly 5 years ago, and I'm very optimistic about the potential for us to continue creating value growing forward. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."

As Jeff mentioned, we delivered very strong operating results this quarter on all fronts. Specifically, we added roughly 29,000 new broadband customers, bringing our total Internet customers to 1.3 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 44% of total voice lines. We ended the quarter with approximately 440,000 video customers, representing 6% growth year-over-year and 23% penetration of our primary residential customers. Total Access lines declined by approximately 23,000 during the quarter, resulting in a decline in Total Access lines of 3.6% year-over-year and our lowest absolute decline in units in our company's history.
In the business channel, High Speed Internet customers grew by 4% year-over-year. Advanced data and integrated solutions increased 2.5% year-over-year, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data services, Ethernet Internet access and managed services. Special access circuits increased 7% year-over-year due to increased wireless backhaul demand. In total, business access lines declined 1.9% year-over-year.  Importantly, business revenues grew 2.3% during the first quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points over the fourth quarter year-over-year growth rate and a result of strong sales in our strategic business products. 
In the consumer channel, we added over 27,000 residential High Speed Internet customers growing total customers by 6% year-over-year, as a result of new advertising campaign targeting cable switchers. Our consumer broadband penetration is now approximately 63% of primary residential lines. Consumer broadband revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by growth in subscribers and in broadband features.
This quarter, video customers increased by 7,000, bringing our total video customer base to 440,000 or 23% penetration of primary consumer lines. Consumer access lines declined 4.5% year-over-year, which was flat sequentially. But importantly, consumer revenues were only down 3.5%, a result of the success we are seeing with our pricing strategy and increased sales of broadband services and related features.
We've been focused on improving our distribution mainly within the multidwelling units and door-to-door channels. In this quarter, we closed on several larger NDU opportunities and our door-to-door channel outperformed our expectations.
From an integration perspective, our team is well underway with the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions integration efforts. The business integration is complete for both companies and the system integrations are underway and should be complete by the end of the year. The integrations of all other acquisitions are complete, and these businesses are performing in line with our expectations. 
We continue to be excited about the capabilities and new product offerings the acquisitions bring to Windstream, which collectively position us very well to provide a complete suite of business services while improving the cost structure and positioning us for future growth.
I'm very pleased with the progress we are making with our operational goals. We continue to enhance our business capabilities, and with Business Services representing approximately 50% of total revenues, the growth in this channel has a significant influence in terms of improving our top line trends. Additionally, our solid execution, pricing strategy and expanded distribution are driving improving results in our consumer channel. 
2011 is another fiscal year for Windstream, offering the opportunity to make success-based capital investments that will better position the business for future success. In the first quarter, we made investments in our fiber-to-the-cell initiatives and are very encouraged with the number of contracts that we have won, which greatly exceeded our expectations. We also expanded our data center operations in Charlotte, given the robust growth and success we've experienced in that market. And we made investments in a new Little Rock data center, which should be operational later this year. In addition, we made investments to increase our broadband capacity and speeds that will allow us to deliver 10 to 12 Meg Internet speeds over 40% of our footprint and 24 Meg speeds in our most competitive markets. 
Lastly, although very early, we have started work on several other broadband stimulus projects, which will expand and enhance our broadband capabilities in unserved rural markets. These investments are all exciting opportunities, which should yield attractive returns and provide opportunities to grow in the near future. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results."
25090458,129549985,122444,"Windstream Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Brent, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.02 billion, operating income of $282 million and $0.05 of diluted earnings per share.

For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.02 billion, operating income of $282 million and $0.05 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $64 million in after-tax loss on extinguishment of debt and $6 million after-tax merger and integration costs, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.14. And thus, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the first quarter. Windstream delivered total revenues of $1.02 billion, a decrease of 1.8% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenue increased $11 million or 2.3%, driven by growth in advanced data in integrated solutions, special access and data center services, all of which outpaced pressures from voice and long distance. Consumer revenue declined $13 million or 3.5% year-over-year, driven by fewer voice customers offset partially by growth in Price For Life bundles, broadband features and long-distance packages.
Wholesale service revenue declined $20 million or 12% year-over-year, primarily the result of declining Switched Access revenues. Total product sales were up $4 million or 16%. Specifically, by category, voice and long-distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. Data in integrated solutions increased $22 million or 7%, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data offerings and advanced data services to business customers combined with solid growth in consumer Internet and broadband features. 
Special access revenues increased $8 million or 6% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access declined $17 million year-over-year due to fewer minutes used in the lease cost routing initiatives implemented last year. USF revenues were flat year-over-year. Product sales increased by $4 million related to better contractor and residential sales.
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $18 million or 3% year-over-year. Excluding noncash pension costs, expenses were lower by $13 million or 2% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $8 million, due primarily to lower Internet connection expense related to the lease cost routing initiative mentioned previously and lower pension benefits expense. Cost of products sold increased by $1 million year-over-year due to higher product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $11 million or 7% year-over-year due to incremental deal synergies, which were partially offset by increase in advertising expense related to our new advertising campaign and an increase in commissions driven by strong business and consumer sales.
Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $8 million, due primarily to lower restructuring charges. Cost of services decreased by $7 million, driven by seasonal declines in overtime and a decrease in bad debt expense. Cost of products increased by $2 million due to higher product sales. SG&A increased by roughly $4 million, due to new advertising campaign costs and higher commissions from strong sales in the first quarter. Going forward, we expect SG&A to decline sequentially throughout 2011 due to deal synergies and other cost management initiatives.
For the quarter, OIBDA was $497 million, which was flat year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $512 million, a decrease of roughly 1% year-over-year, and our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 50.1%. 
On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $169 million for the quarter, a decrease of roughly $39 million year-over-year due to higher capital spending and higher cash interest costs related to our refinancing activities, which include the early payment of accrued interest.
This quarter, we made significant improvements to the balance sheet. Specifically, we refinanced over $1.5 billion of debt and improved our debt maturity profile by moving over $1.2 billion to 2020 and beyond at very attractive long-term rates. We also increased our revolver capacity from $750 million to $1.25 billion and extended the maturity of these commitments to December 2015, which will provide additional borrowing capacity and flexibility, particularly as it relates to future refinancings. 
As a result of our refinancing efforts, we realized $101 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, which was principally the tender premium costs. Importantly, we have a better position to balance sheet and maturity profile going forward. Furthermore, with the increased revolver capacity, we have an opportunity to refinance the remaining 2016 notes at significantly lower interest rate. Following the August call date, and as Jeff mentioned, we are in a position to realize cash interest savings of more than $90 million in 2012 and beyond as compared to the expected spend in 2011.
During the quarter, we completed a $60 million stock contribution to our pension. This resulted in the issuance of 4.9 million shares, which were contributed directly to the pension plan, bringing the funded level to above 80%. This quarter, we spent $160 million on capital expenditures. As Brent mentioned, we have won significantly more fiber-to-the-cell business than we expected. In fact, we are likely going to more than double our expected fiber-to-the-cell project this year. In addition, we've experienced very nice growth in our data center operations and have accelerated expansion plans in several key markets. We are also investing in our Internet speeds and capacity to drive future growth.
Given the attractive returns and long-term recurring revenues associated with these initiatives, we are eager to make these investments. As a result of the growth in these success-based capital projects, we are increasing our CapEx guidance for the year by $50 million to a range of $570 million to $630 million. At the same time, we are lowering our cash tax guidance by roughly $55 million to $1 million for 2011. The reduction in cash taxes is a result of the early debt extinguishment fees and higher CapEx spend, which will benefit from 100% bonus depreciation.  Lastly, because of our refinancing activities and the timing of interest payments, we are raising our cash interest slightly to $569 million for the year, which excluded the loss on debt extinguishment.
Collectively, we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be $845 million to $965 million, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 53% to 60%, a slight increase from our previous view of 52% to 59%. The success-based capital investments we are making today combined with our refinancing activity will improve our revenue and cash flow in 2012 and beyond. In fact, going forward, even with an expected increase in cash taxes, we have positioned the business to grow free cash flow through revenue adjusted OIBDA growth. More than $90 million of cash interest savings at after 2012 lower levels of CapEx intensity. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sahid, please review the instructions and open the call to questions."

It's been a while since we heard companies get so excited about spending money, especially companies that have really attracted an investor base that's concentrated on the dividend yield and values that income stream pretty highly. When you guys have done M&A transactions in the past, you've always kind of attached a synergy number to it and we'd be able to kind of get our arms around the rationale for what you've done in terms of these deals. But as the CapEx kind of ratchets up and you talk about the long term and maybe the CapEx will come down some day, there doesn't seem to be a lot of quantification around, ""What am I getting as an investor who likes dividends today for all this money that you're spending now because it looks like that money could be coming to me in the form of a dividend instead, and I might like that better."" Can you help walk me through why I should be as excited as you guys are about the CapEx going up? And if I could, just the second question was I think you talked about $90 million of interest savings in '12 coming from refinancing the debt. But how much more taxes are you going to pay in '12 versus '11 when the bonus depreciation steps back down?"

And really, why I think investors should be excited is we've got some real investment opportunities, much of it's centered around fiber-to-the-cell side. That's going to be a phenomenon that will take place between 2011 and 2012. So when investors get a slightly higher capital intensity, but long-term contracts with good returns that over the long run make them feel better about the cash flow, improve our ability to generate cash flow over the long term and better position us for the dividend. We said in our remarks that we really have a capital structure that allows us to make these success-based capital investments. And in fact, the reason we did the KDL deal, the Hosted Solutions deal was that we saw these success-based opportunities. We thought we were there -- we had a good chance to be aggressive there, and we won. As Tony and Brent both mentioned, we've been very successful on the fiber-to-the-tower initiatives. So in our view, investors should be thrilled that we have this chance to further improve. You're already looking at a company that's showing improving revenue trends sequentially. That's the plan for the balance of the year, and these will only accelerate that. And as far as capital intensity, we didn't mean to leave it unclear. What I think Tony said very specifically is that 2012 will be another year where there's a lot of fiber-to-the-tower business to be won. We want to win as much as that as we can because we believe that offers great returns to our investors. After that, our capital intensity returns to the levels that our investors are used to. So from my perspective, the reason we're so excited about it is because it makes Windstream a stronger company in the long run with better growth characteristics. Today, you're looking at a company that has one of the highest dividend yields on the S&P 500, but we are also driving some of the best year-over-year revenue comparisons in the industry, and I think that should give investors comfort not concern."

But there are a lot of moving parts when it actually comes to cash taxes. And historically, when we've had 50% bonus depreciation, which is what we'll have in 2012, we've had a cash tax rate in the mid-20% range. But there's a lot of moving parts in that analysis. But as I kind of wrapped it up, cash interest is going down. We're trying to grow and will grow our OIBDA and revenue in the future. All those things should give investors the confidence in our payout ratio and hence the dividend over a long period of time."

But given the starting point of just 1.8% decline in the first quarter and strong commentary for the sales, I'd like to hear why you would still want to keep the low end of your guidance range in there for a 3% decline. Do you think that we will see some lumpiness in the revenues? Or why isn't this an opportunity to tighten that range? And also second question on if you could maybe give a sense on what you're seeing from cable competition in the SME sector."

But still feel excited about where that's headed. It's just taking a little longer, which isn't that surprising. In terms of Hosted Solutions, really I talked a little bit about this last time. But what we're trying to do is leverage not only their existing data centers and max them out from a capacity from the sales standpoint. A modest improvement in terms of the footprint of data centers on an annual basis, and we're doing that. We talked about that in terms of Little Rock, expansion of Charlotte as well, both of which where we believe have good exciting growth prospects associated with that, coupled with what I'd say continuing to monetize real estate across the Windstream footprint in terms of co-location revenues. The combination of all those things we believe are going to allow us to see revenue growth rates in the 20% range. Frankly, we think we're achieving that by the fourth quarter. It's still a smaller part of our overall revenue picture. But in terms of balancing what it takes to get top line stability back to where we wanted, a big key part."

Thank you for joining our call to discuss Windstream's first quarter results. Today's conference call was preceded by our first quarter 2011 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.
Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization, and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes non-cash pension expense, stock compensation expense, restructuring charges and merger integration expense. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA minus cash interest, cash taxes and CapEx and is presented on an actual basis to reflect all acquisitions from the date on which we acquired the businesses. Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website where we’ve posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measure.
To assist investors, we have provided pro forma results from current businesses, which include all acquisitions we have made to date for all periods shown, and we will make references to these pro forma results from current businesses including the year-over-year comparisons during our call. Additionally, as a result of the Iowa billing conversion, we reclassified certain categories, and those minor adjustments have been updated in our historical pro forma results. 
Participating in our call this afternoon are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Windstream Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer. At the end of the call, we will take a few questions. 
With that, here is Jeff Gardner."

Today, I will make a few comments about our first quarter accomplishments and provide an update on our progress towards completing our key initiatives for 2011. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our solid start to 2011. We delivered strong operating metrics on all fronts and, importantly, continued to show improvement in year-over-year revenue trends. For the quarter, business in broadband revenues comprised over 60% of our total revenues and collectively grew at 3.6% year-over-year, an improvement of 40 basis points over the comparable fourth quarter growth rate. In total, on a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 1.8% and adjusted OIBDA declined 1%, both in line with our expectations.
As we mentioned on our previous call, we expect the year-over-year financial performance to improve throughout 2011 as a result of the continued improvement within our business sales organization, the investments we are making this year to drive revenue growth and the additional synergies we expect to realize from last year's transactions. We are off to a great start on our key initiatives for 2011, which include completing our integration activities, investing capital for future growth and deleveraging the balance sheet.
During the quarter, we completed the Iowa billing system conversion and have fully integrated that business into Windstream. The Iowa operation is performing extremely well. Our team is now focusing on integrating Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions, which are progressing in line with our expectations.
This quarter, we made investments to improve our Internet speed and capacity, expand our fiber-to-the-tower initiatives and to grow our data center operations. In fact, we have had tremendous success at winning wireless backhaul contracts and have seen very solid demand in data center services. And as a result, we are planning to make more investments in these areas than originally expected given the attractive growth prospects and return on investment opportunities. We are confident that these success-based capital investments will further improve our financial performance going forward.
During the quarter, we made significant balance sheet improvements as well, leading to greater financial flexibility, a much better debt maturity profile and the ability to meaningfully lower cash interest expense going forward. In fact, with our refinancing activities to date, coupled with our refinancing and deleveraging plans later this year, we could see cash interest savings of more than $90 million in 2012 and beyond as compared to the expected spend this year.
I am very pleased with our start to 2011. Our team is executing well on all fronts and continuing to deliver industry-leading operating and financial performance. It is clear that Windstream is on a different strategic path as we have built the company focused on improving top line trends to sustain and grow cash flows over the long term. We have positioned our capital structure so that we can invest in significant success-based opportunities such as fiber-to-the-tower, data center services and our broadband network, all of which have very attractive rates of return and at the same time manage our leverage to our historical range of 3.2x to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA. Additionally, we will continue to explore strategic opportunities that further advance our strategy, while at the same time being mindful of leverage. We have positioned this company for long-term success while delivering industry-leading shareholder returns since our spin-off nearly 5 years ago, and I'm very optimistic about the potential for us to continue creating value growing forward. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."

As Jeff mentioned, we delivered very strong operating results this quarter on all fronts. Specifically, we added roughly 29,000 new broadband customers, bringing our total Internet customers to 1.3 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 44% of total voice lines. We ended the quarter with approximately 440,000 video customers, representing 6% growth year-over-year and 23% penetration of our primary residential customers. Total Access lines declined by approximately 23,000 during the quarter, resulting in a decline in Total Access lines of 3.6% year-over-year and our lowest absolute decline in units in our company's history.
In the Business channel, High Speed Internet customers grew by 4% year-over-year. Advanced data and integrated solutions increased 2.5% year-over-year, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data services, Ethernet Internet access and managed services. Special access circuits increased 7% year-over-year due to increased wireless backhaul demand. In total, Business access lines declined 1.9% year-over-year. Importantly, Business revenues grew 2.3% during the first quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points over the fourth quarter year-over-year growth rate and a result of strong sales in our strategic Business products. 
In the Consumer channel, we added over 27,000 residential High Speed Internet customers growing total customers by 6% year-over-year, largely the result of a new advertising campaign targeting cable switchers. Our Consumer broadband penetration is now approximately 63% of primary residential lines. Consumer broadband revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by growth in subscribers and in broadband features.
This quarter, video customers increased by 7,000, bringing our total video customer base to 440,000 or 23% penetration of primary consumer lines. Consumer access lines declined 4.5% year-over-year, which was flat sequentially. But importantly, consumer revenues were only down 3.5%, a result of the success we are seeing with our pricing strategy and increased sales of broadband services and related features.
We've been focused on improving our distribution mainly within the multi-dwelling units and door-to-door channels. In this quarter, we closed on several larger MDU opportunities and our door-to-door channel outperformed our expectations.
From an integration perspective, our team is well underway with the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions integration efforts. The business integration is complete for both companies and the system integrations are underway and should be complete by the end of the year. The integrations of all other acquisitions are complete, and these businesses are performing in line with our expectations. 
We continue to be excited about the capabilities and new product offerings the acquisitions bring to Windstream, which collectively position us very well to provide a complete suite of business services while improving the cost structure and positioning us for future growth.
I'm very pleased with the progress we are making with our operational goals. We continue to enhance our business capabilities, and with Business Services representing approximately 50% of total revenues, the growth in this channel has a significant influence in terms of improving our top line trends. Additionally, our solid execution, pricing strategy and expanded distribution are driving improving results in our Consumer channel. 
2011 is another pivotal year for Windstream, offering the opportunity to make success-based capital investments that will better position the business for future success. In the first quarter, we made investments in our fiber-to-the-cell initiatives and are very encouraged with the number of contracts that we have won, which greatly exceeded our expectations. We also expanded our data center operations in Charlotte, given the robust growth and success we've experienced in that market. And we made investments in a new Little Rock data center, which should be operational later this year. In addition, we made investments to increase our broadband capacity and speeds that will allow us to deliver 10 to 12 meg Internet speeds over 40% of our footprint and 24 meg speeds in our most competitive markets. 
Lastly, although very early, we have started work on several other broadband stimulus projects, which will expand and enhance our broadband capabilities in unserved rural markets. These investments are all exciting opportunities, which should yield attractive returns and provide opportunities to grow in the near future. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results."
25090458,129549985,122455,"Windstream Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 04, 2011",2011-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Brent, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.02 billion, operating income of $282 million and $0.05 of diluted earnings per share.

For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.02 billion, operating income of $282 million and $0.05 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $64 million in after-tax loss on extinguishment of debt and $6 million after-tax merger and integration costs, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.14. And thus, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the first quarter. Windstream delivered total revenues of $1.02 billion, a decrease of 1.8% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenue increased $11 million or 2.3%, driven by growth in advanced data in integrated solutions, special access and data center services, all of which outpaced pressures from voice and long distance. Consumer revenue declined $13 million or 3.5% year-over-year, driven by fewer voice customers offset partially by growth in Price For Life bundles, broadband features and long-distance packages.
Wholesale service revenue declined $20 million or 12% year-over-year, primarily the result of declining Switched Access revenues. Total product sales were up $4 million or 16%. Specifically, by category, voice and long-distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. Data in integrated solutions increased $22 million or 7%, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data offerings and advanced data services to business customers combined with solid growth in consumer Internet and broadband features. 
Special access revenues increased $8 million or 6% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access declined $17 million year-over-year due to fewer minutes of use and the least cost routing initiative implemented last year. USF revenues were flat year-over-year. Product sales increased by $4 million related to better contractor and residential sales.
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $18 million or 3% year-over-year. Excluding noncash pension costs, expenses were lower by $13 million or 2% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $8 million, due primarily to lower Internet connection expense related to the least cost routing initiative mentioned previously and lower pension benefits expense. Cost of products sold increased by $1 million year-over-year due to higher product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $11 million or 7% year-over-year due to incremental deal synergies, which were partially offset by increase in advertising expense related to our new advertising campaign and an increase in commissions driven by strong Business and Consumer sales.
Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $8 million, due primarily to lower restructuring charges. Cost of services decreased by $7 million, driven by seasonal declines in overtime and a decrease in bad debt expense. Cost of products increased by $2 million due to higher product sales. SG&A increased by roughly $4 million, due to new advertising campaign costs and higher commissions from strong sales in the first quarter. Going forward, we expect SG&A to decline sequentially throughout 2011 due to deal synergies and other cost management initiatives.
For the quarter, OIBDA was $497 million, which was flat year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $512 million, a decrease of roughly 1% year-over-year, and our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 50.1%. 
On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $169 million for the quarter, a decrease of roughly $39 million year-over-year due to higher capital spending and higher cash interest costs related to our refinancing activities, which include the early payment of accrued interest.
This quarter, we made significant improvements to the balance sheet. Specifically, we refinanced over $1.5 billion of debt and improved our debt maturity profile by moving over $1.2 billion to 2020 and beyond at very attractive long-term rates. We also increased our revolver capacity from $750 million to $1.25 billion and extended the maturity of these commitments to December 2015, which will provide additional borrowing capacity and flexibility, particularly as it relates to future refinancings. 
As a result of our refinancing efforts, we realized $101 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, which was principally the tender premium costs. Importantly, we have better positioned the balance sheet and maturity profile going forward. Furthermore, with the increased revolver capacity, we have an opportunity to refinance the remaining 2016 notes at significantly lower interest rate. Following the August call date, and as Jeff mentioned, we are in a position to realize cash interest savings of more than $90 million in 2012 and beyond as compared to the expected spend in 2011.
During the quarter, we completed a $60 million stock contribution to our pension. This resulted in the issuance of 4.9 million shares, which were contributed directly to the pension plan, bringing the funded level to above 80%. This quarter, we spent $160 million on capital expenditures. As Brent mentioned, we have won significantly more fiber-to-the-cell business than we expected. In fact, we are likely going to more than double our expected fiber-to-the-cell project this year. In addition, we've experienced very nice growth in our data center operations and have accelerated expansion plans in several key markets. We are also investing in our Internet speeds and capacity to drive future growth.
Given the attractive returns and long-term recurring revenues associated with these initiatives, we are eager to make these investments. As a result of the growth in these success-based capital projects, we are increasing our CapEx guidance for the year by $50 million to a range of $570 million to $630 million. At the same time, we are lowering our cash tax guidance by roughly $55 million to $1 million for 2011. The reduction in cash taxes is a result of the early debt extinguishment fees and higher CapEx spend, which will benefit from 100% bonus depreciation. Lastly, because of our refinancing activities and the timing of interest payments, we are raising our cash interest slightly to $569 million for the year, which excludes the loss on debt extinguishment.
Collectively, we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be $845 million to $965 million, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 53% to 60%, a slight increase from our previous view of 52% to 59%. The success-based capital investments we are making today combined with our refinancing activity will improve our revenue and cash flow in 2012 and beyond. In fact, going forward, even with an expected increase in cash taxes, we have positioned the business to grow free cash flow through revenue adjusted OIBDA growth, more than $90 million of cash interest savings and, after 2012, lower levels of CapEx intensity. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sahid, please review the instructions and open the call to questions."

It's been a while since we heard companies get so excited about spending money, especially companies that have really attracted an investor base that's concentrated on the dividend yield and values that income stream pretty highly. When you guys have done M&A transactions in the past, you've always kind of attached a synergy number to it and we'd be able to kind of get our arms around the rationale for what you've done in terms of these deals. But as the CapEx kind of ratchets up and you talk about the long term and maybe the CapEx will come down some day, there doesn't seem to be a lot of quantification around, ""What am I getting as an investor who likes dividends today for all this money that you're spending now because it looks like that money could be coming to me in the form of a dividend instead, and I might like that better."" Can you help walk me through why I should be as excited as you guys are about the CapEx going up? And if I could, just the second question was I think you talked about $90 million of interest savings in '12 coming from refinancing the debt. But how much more taxes are you going to pay in '12 versus '11 when the bonus depreciation steps back down?"

And really, why I think investors should be excited is we've got some real investment opportunities, much of it's centered around fiber-to-the-cell side. That's going to be a phenomenon that will take place between 2011 and 2012. So when investors get a slightly higher capital intensity, but long-term contracts with good returns that over the long run make them feel better about the cash flow, improve our ability to generate cash flow over a long term and better position us for the dividend. We said in our remarks that we really have a capital structure that allows us to make these success-based capital investments. And in fact, the reason we did the KDL deal, the Hosted Solutions deal was that we saw these success-based opportunities. We thought we were there -- we had a good chance to be aggressive there, and we won. As Tony and Brent both mentioned, we've been very successful on the fiber-to-the-tower initiative. So in our view, investors should be thrilled that we have this chance to further improve. You're already looking at a company that's showing improving revenue trends sequentially. That's the plan for the balance of the year, and these will only accelerate that. And as far as capital intensity, we didn't mean to leave it unclear. What I think Tony said very specifically is that 2012 will be another year where there's a lot of fiber-to-the-tower business to be won. We want to win as much of that as we can because we believe that offers great returns to our investors. After that, our capital intensity returns to the levels that our investors are used to. So from my perspective, the reason we're so excited about it is because it makes Windstream a stronger company in the long run with better growth characteristics. Today, you're looking at a company that has one of the highest dividend yields on the S&P 500, but we are also driving some of the best year-over-year revenue comparisons in the industry, and I think that should give investors comfort not concern."

But there are a lot of moving parts when it actually comes to cash taxes. And historically, when we've had 50% bonus depreciation, which is what we'll have in 2012, we've had a cash tax rate in the mid-20% range. But there's a lot of moving parts in that analysis. But as I kind of wrapped it up, cash interest is going down, we're trying to grow and will grow our OIBDA and revenue in the future. All those things should give investors the confidence in our payout ratio and hence the dividend over a long period of time."

But what we're trying to do is leverage not only their existing data centers and max them out from a capacity from a sales standpoint. A modest improvement in terms of the footprint of data centers on an annual basis, and we're doing that. We talked about that in terms of Little Rock, expansion of Charlotte as well, both of which we believe have good exciting growth prospects associated with that, coupled with what I'd say continuing to monetize real estate across the Windstream footprint in terms of co-location revenues. The combination of all those things we believe are going to allow us to see revenue growth rates in the 20% range. Frankly, we think we're achieving that by the fourth quarter.

So we'll invest more CapEx fiber-to-the-tower in 2012, and then it will start to significantly ramp down in 2013 and probably be entirely extinguished by 2014. And as we think about it, you're looking at a revenue stream, and you've seen it in our special access results. You saw it again this quarter mid-single digit growth.

So thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate the continued interest. I'm very pleased that at Windstream, we continue to perform at a very high level in our core business. We've spent a lot of time on this call talking about success-based opportunities. I think it validates some of our recent acquisitions and also validates our strategy of focusing more on broadband and business. We're so pleased with the substantial restructuring of our debt. We talked about the resulting approximately $90 million in savings on an annual basis. And the capital structure that we have in this company is really allowing us to invest in these major opportunities, fiber-to-the-tower and data centers. We're going to manage our leverage down this year as well. And at the end of the day, we improved the long-run financial performance of this company in terms of top line and bottom line.

Today, I will make a few comments about our second quarter accomplishments and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with our performance during the second quarter. And particularly, with the fact that we achieved consolidated revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth year-over-year, driven by increased strategic revenue and continued stabilization in the consumer channel. Specifically, business and broadband revenues which now represents 61% of total revenues grew 4.7% year-over-year. 
Additionally, consumer revenues grew sequentially during the second quarter for the first time in over two years. These results demonstrate that Windstream is successfully executing our strategic initiatives and turning a pivotal corner towards organic growth. 
From a strategic standpoint, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of PAETEC which will accelerate our revenue and cash flow growth profile by expanding our focus on business and broadband services and generating significant cost synergies. Following this transaction, roughly 70% of our revenues will come from business and broadband services which are the growth drivers of our business. The combined company will have a robust nationwide network, with a deep fiber footprint of 100,000 fiber route miles which will improve the cost structure and enhance our capabilities to serve our customers in strategic growth areas, including IP-based services, data centers, cloud computing and managed services. 
In addition, we expect to create approximately $110 million in annual operating and capital synergies and provide meaningful tax benefits. The transaction is accretive in year one and is slightly deleveraging, including synergies. 
Now let me update you on the key initiatives we are working on for 2011 which include our integration activity, investing capital for future growth and deleveraging the balance sheet. 
First, our team has done a fantastic job integrating the businesses that we acquired last year. And frankly, our efforts are largely complete. I am extremely confident in our ability to successfully integrate PAETEC, given our extensive experience and our current readiness. 
Second, we have made great progress on investing in growth initiatives, including fiber deployment to support the growing wireless demand expanding our data center facilities and improving our Internet speed and capacity. As we have stated before, these capital investments offer attractive long-term returns that will improve our financial performance going forward. 
Finally, we have made progress deleveraging the balance sheet and expect to attain our historical range of 3.2x to 3.4x leverage within the next 12 months. 
Turning to the regulatory front. The SEC is working on plans to modernize and streamline its intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. Windstream has long supported reform and has actively worked with the commission and within the industry to shape the reform process. In fact, Windstream, along with a diverse coalition of telecom providers follow a comprehensive reform proposal with the SEC last week. This proposal represent significant changes to the federal universal service program and the intercarrier compensation system, that together will reset the nation's regulatory framework for the future. 
The proposals core reform objectives include transitioning USF subsidies to a broadband focus fund that explicitly supports high cost areas across America. 
Additionally, the plan recommends rationalizing access rates while providing reasonable revenue replacement opportunities and manageable transition periods. We believe this proposal is consistent with the vision of the national broadband plan and is good for consumers and the providers that serve them by addressing the shortfalls of both USF and intercarrier compensation concurrently, the SEC can ensure stability and certainty within the industry and for both promote meaningful expansion of robust broadband services. 
Having just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as a public company, it is gratifying to report that we grew revenue and improve the company's profitability year-over-year in the second quarter. The Windstream team has successfully transformed this business from one largely focus on residential voice to a next-generation communications provider on the cusp of sustained revenue growth. Our acquisition strategy combined with the improvement in our core business has positioned Windstream for long-term success and I am more confident than ever in the future of this business. 
I am particularly proud that we have accomplished this transformation while maintaining our dividend and delivering industry-leading returns. The PAETEC acquisition significantly advances our strategy by accelerating our revenue and cash flow growth profile and create a new Fortune 500 company that offers investors a unique combination of growth with a very attractive and sustainable dividend yield. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent who will discuss our operating results."

We have made great progress on our operational initiatives during the first half of 2011 which combined with solid execution have produced improving revenue trends, in both the business and consumer channels. In",647,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. We have made great progress on our operational initiatives during the first half of 2011 which combined with solid execution have produced improving revenue trends, in both the business and consumer channels. 
In the business channel, our sales team is doing a terrific job leveraging our expanded portfolio of business services across our base and driving business ARPU growth of almost 5% year-over-year. 
During the second quarter, total business revenues grew by about 3.6% year-over-year, an improvement of 150 basis points over the first quarter year-over-year growth rate, driven by solid growth in our strategic business revenues. 
Specifically, advanced data and integrated solutions revenue increased $11 million year-over-year or 6% due to growth in our integrated VoIP offering, advanced data and data center services. Special access revenues increased $11 million year-over-year or 9% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. 
In the consumer channel, we added approximately 3,500 residential high-speed Internet customers growing our total subscribers by 5% year-over-year and increasing our consumer broadband penetration to 64% of primary residential lines. Importantly, consumer broadband revenue grew 10% year-over-year due to the increase in subscribers combined with the success our team is having selling broadband-related features. 
Video customers increased by 3,000 units, bringing our total video customer base to 444,000, an increase of 5% year-over-year and our penetration is now roughly 24% of primary residential lines. 
Consumer access lines declined 4.6% year-over-year and Total Access lines declined 3.6% year-over-year. Consumer revenues were down 3% year-over-year. But importantly, we are up slightly sequentially for the first time in two years, a result of the success we are seeing with our 5-team strategy and growth in broadband services and the related features. 
As Jeff mentioned, we are largely complete with all of our integration activities. We have successfully combined the Hosted Solutions business and in the Windstream sales organization and are capitalizing on the data center and managed services opportunities across our footprint. We are completing the remaining activities for Q-Comm which we expect to wrap up in the first quarter of 2012. Overall, we are very pleased with the acquired businesses which are performing in line with our expectations and we are tracking towards the $45 million in incremental synergies target in this year. 
We have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives, including increasing broadband capacity and capabilities to enable 12 meg service to over 40% of our footprint and 24 meg service in our most competitive markets. 
We completed the data center expansion in Boston, nearly doubling the size of that facility to 25,000 square feet and making it one of the most advanced managed services facilities in the Boston area. 
Given the strong demand for data center services, we opened a third facility in Charlotte again expansion plans on our Reilly data center and started work on a new data center right here in Little Rock. 
Additionally, we invested in many fiber to the tower target projects and remain encouraged by the contracts we are winning, both in our ILEC footprint, as well as by extending our footprint leveraging the KDL fiber network. 
Within our ILEC territories, it's very important that we continue to make the fiber investments to solidify our competitive position and grow these revenue streams. In the non-ILEC territories which represent roughly half of the fiber projects, the revenue is entirely incremental. Importantly, all of the fiber to the tower initiatives have long-term contracts in place, prior to beginning construction and generating attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital. 
Finally, work is underway on several of the broadband stimulus projects. These investments all offer exciting opportunities to earn attractive returns and better position the business for future success, allowing us to continue creating shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony who is going to discuss our financial results."

For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.03 billion, operating income of $293 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $3 million",745,"Thank you, Brent, and good morning everyone. For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.03 billion, operating income of $293 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $3 million after-tax merger and integration costs and $2 million tax affected loss on early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would've been $0.19.
Turning to our pro forma results for the second quarter, Windstream delivered total revenues of $1.03 billion which was up slightly year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenue increased $14 million or 3%, driven by growth in advanced data and Integrated Solutions and Special Access, which outpaced pressures from voice revenues. Customer service revenue declined $9 million or 3% year-over-year driven by fewer voice customers, offset partially by growth in broadband revenues.
Wholesale service revenue declined $11 million or 7% year-over-year due to declining Switched Access in USF revenues. Total product sales were up $8 million or 41%. 
Specifically, by category, voice and long-distance revenues declined by $30 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. Data and Integrated Solutions increased $22 million or 7%, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data offerings and advanced data services to business customers combined with 10% growth in consumer broadband service revenue.
Special Access revenues increased $11 million or 9% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access declined $5 million year-over-year related to fewer minutes of use which were offset somewhat by a settlement during the quarter. 
USF revenues were down $5 million year-over-year, including $1 million of pass-through end user surcharges. Product sales increased by $8 million related to better business and contractor sales.
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $5 million or 1% year-over-year. Excluding pension cost, expenses were lower by $1 million or flat year-over-year. 
Specifically by category, on a year-over-year basis, the cost of services was up $2 million and cost of products sold increased by $5 million due to higher product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $11 million or 8% year-over-year due to incremental deals synergies and lower consumer advertising which was partially offset by an increase in commissions driven by strong business sales.
Sequentially, total revenues increased $7 million or approximately 1%, with both the business and consumer channel generating growth over the first quarter, a result of solid demand in data and Integrated Solutions, Special Access, broadband and product sales. 
Sequentially, cost of services increased by $9 million due largely to higher weather-related cost and an increase in bad debt expense. Cost of products sold increased by $4 million due to higher product sales and SG&A decreased by roughly $3 million related to deals synergies and lower advertising costs.
For the quarter, OIBDA was $495 million, an increase of 1%. Adjusted OIBDA was $513 million, an increase of 0.6% year-over-year and was negatively affected by the items I mentioned earlier. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 49.8%. Adjusted free cash flow was $227 million for the quarter, an increase of $29 million year-over-year or 15%. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $33 million of our 2016 note, supporting our plan to deleverage and lower cash interest expense going forward. 
This quarter, we spent $172 million on capital expenditures which was largely related to our growth initiatives including fiber to the tower projects, data center expansion and enhancing the capabilities of our broadband network. 
This year, we are deploying capital expeditiously to complete as many success-based projects as possible to benefit from the 100% bonus depreciation rules and accelerate revenue realization. Thus, we expect similar levels of capital expenditures in the third quarter with a significant decline in the fourth quarter. 
Windstream has had a strong first half of the year, demonstrating solid execution and improving financial performance. For the back half of the year, we expect to see some sequential improvement. And most of our improvement will occur in the fourth quarter as we begin to receive some of the expected benefits from our capital investments and realize additional synergies. 
Our strategic initiatives combined with focus on our Organic business are resulting in improving financial trends. And importantly, we expect to be growing this business, as we exit 2011. With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Stephanie, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

Churn was actually flat with where it was even a year ago. With his churn now on a larger base, it takes more in terms of sales now to outrun that on the gross sales point and then with a change in our promotion during the quarter, focusing on a little bit more of a -- a little bit over the top video solution. That was a little harder at a higher cost at a point of sale for our reps and didn't generate as much momentum as we go.

We've got a proposal that I think provides a very thoughtful framework to transition in a manner that assures industry participants, including Windstream and then all of us are financially sound. That was fundamentally one of the things that was challenging when we thought about universal service and ICC reform previously. And I think importantly the key elements of this plan that I think should be noticed and give investors comfort because they give all of us comfort as one. The reform there's a number of things that are really helpful. First of all, it focuses USF on high-cost areas. This has been a very big problem and I've talked about this a lot in Washington about the fact that if you were a customer in a rural area of Windstream versus a customer in a rural area of a small carrier, your subsea would much be higher. And we would get very little USF for that going forward. In this proposal, USF is really targeted to its high-cost areas so we kind of deal with this issue that we refer to as of the rural rules divide. All rural customers are going to have the opportunity to get broadband out to them under this plan. This plan effectively eliminates the arbitrage that is going on so frequently in the industry today with some very specific reform around phantom traffic. It gives clarity on IP compensation. It provides what's very important for financial stability of everyone, a gradual step down in access rates over a long period of time. a recovery mechanism. And finally, it does include some modest -- very modest increases to the end users. So at the end of the day, I don't think it's all disrupted as we look at our long-term model, it's not disruptive. It's important that the SEC deal with both USF have reform and your carrier reform come currently, but I think this framework provides a nice starting point. There's much work to be done here, but we worked very hard on this and I think we are sufficiently focused on those areas that investors have been historically worried about."

You both have to spend the money and install the equipment in a given year to achieve the tax benefit. So we are very focused a -- a very much focused on receiving those cash tax savings.

There's great organic opportunities to grow there because we've made these acquisitions in the cyberspace, in the data center space. And the same is true with PAETEC. On the enterprise side, it just makes us a much more effective competitor and it was a very important part of our strategic plan. This was a fairly large transaction. We're focused on closing on integrating PAETEC. In the future, we'll be again using the same criteria. We do expect to manage our leverage down there.

I mean, we're consistently committed to our dividend.

You're looking sales modeling and you know the pipeline is bright. And so the goal is to usually fill that up within a short period of time, defined from our perspective as within two to three-year kind of time horizon, somewhere in that window.  As it pertains to transport, like a lot of folks in the industry, we definitely seen increases in network traffic and really due to video consumption. No question Netflix and other related type services are driving some of that demand. We continue to invest in broadband transport like we have in years past. And the good thing with a lot of things that we've been doing from just a network perspective like rolling out as I mentioned before, VDSL technology in larger markets.  That's really all about fiber to deployment which help solve some of those transport issues. So we feel like we've been in good shape there but it certainly from very focused on operationally so our broadband customers don't see a degradation in the quality of their experience."

We remain incredibly focused on the dividend at Windstream and understand how important this is to our shareholders. We have a set of assets that are generating strong cash flows to not only pay the dividend well into the future, but also offer us the ability to grow. 
Windstream has never been better positioned. 2011 was a year full of execution and incredibly important for us.

Today's conference call was preceded by our second quarter 2011 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.
Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization; and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes pension expense, stock compensation expense, restructuring charges and M&I expense. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA minus cash interest, cash taxes and capital expenditures, and is presented on an actual basis to reflect all acquisitions from the date on which we acquired the businesses.

Today, I will make a few comments about our second quarter accomplishments and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with our performance during the second quarter and particularly, with the fact that we achieved consolidated revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth year-over-year, driven by increased strategic revenues and continued stabilization in the consumer channel. Specifically, business and broadband revenues, which now represents 61% of total revenues, grew 4.7% year-over-year. 
Additionally, consumer revenues grew sequentially during the second quarter for the first time in over 2 years. These results demonstrate that Windstream is successfully executing our strategic initiatives and turning a pivotal corner towards organic growth. 
From a strategic standpoint, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of PAETEC, which will accelerate our revenue and cash flow growth profile by expanding our focus on business and broadband services and generating significant cost synergies. Following this transaction, roughly 70% of our revenues will come from business and broadband services, which are the growth drivers of our business. The combined company will have a robust nationwide network, with a deep fiber footprint of 100,000 fiber route miles, which will improve the cost structure and enhance our capabilities to serve our customers in strategic growth areas, including IP-based services, data centers, cloud computing and managed services. 
In addition, we expect to create approximately $110 million in annual operating and capital synergies and provide meaningful tax benefits. The transaction is accretive in year one and is slightly deleveraging, including synergies. 
Now let me update you on the key initiatives we're working on for 2011, which include our integration activities, investing capital for future growth and deleveraging the balance sheet. 
First, our team has done a fantastic job integrating the businesses that we acquired last year. And frankly, our efforts are largely complete. I am extremely confident in our ability to successfully integrate PAETEC, given our extensive experience and our current readiness. 
Second, we have made great progress on investing in growth initiatives, including fiber deployments to support the growing wireless demand, expanding our data center facilities and improving our Internet speeds and capacity. As we have stated before, these capital investments offer attractive long-term returns that will improve our financial performance going forward. 
Finally, we have made progress deleveraging the balance sheet and expect to attain our historical range of 3.2x to 3.4x leverage within the next 12 months. 
Turning to the regulatory front. The SEC is working on plans to modernize and streamline its intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. Windstream has long supported reform and has actively worked with the commission and within the industry to shape the reform process. In fact, Windstream, along with a diverse coalition of telecom providers, filed a comprehensive reform proposal with the SEC last week. This proposal recommends significant changes to the federal universal service program and the intercarrier compensation system, that together will reset the nation's regulatory framework for the future. 
The proposals core reform objectives include transitioning USF subsidies to a broadband focus fund that explicitly supports high cost areas across America. 
Additionally, the plan recommends rationalizing access rates while providing reasonable revenue replacement opportunities and manageable transition periods. We believe this proposal is consistent with the vision of the National Broadband Plan and is good for consumers and the providers that serve them. By addressing the shortfalls of both USF and intercarrier compensation concurrently, the SEC can ensure stability and certainty within the industry and for promote meaningful expansion of robust broadband services. 
Having just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as a public company, it is gratifying to report that we grew revenue and improve the company's profitability year-over-year in the second quarter. The Windstream team has successfully transformed this business from one largely focused on residential voice to a next generation's communications provider on the cusp of sustained revenue growth. Our acquisition strategy, combined with the improvement in our core business, has positioned Windstream for long-term success, and I am more confident than ever in the future of this business. 
I'm particularly proud that we have accomplished this transformation while maintaining our dividend and delivering industry-leading returns. The PAETEC acquisition significantly advances our strategy by accelerating our revenue and cash flow growth profile and creates a new Fortune 500 company that offers investors a unique combination of growth with a very attractive and sustainable dividend yield. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."

I",635,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We have made great progress on our operational initiatives during the first half of 2011 which, combined with solid execution, have produced improving revenue trends in both the business and consumer channels. 
In the business channel, our sales team is doing a terrific job leveraging our expanded portfolio of business services across our base and driving business ARPU growth of almost 5% year-over-year. 
During the second quarter, total business revenues grew by 3.6% year-over-year, an improvement of 150 basis points over the first quarter year-over-year growth rate, driven by solid growth in our strategic business revenues. 
Specifically, advanced data and integrated solutions revenue increased $11 million year-over-year or 6% due to growth in our integrated VoIP offering, advanced data and data center services. Special access revenues increased $11 million year-over-year or 9% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. 
In the consumer channel, we added approximately 3,500 residential high-speed Internet customers growing our total subscribers by 5% year-over-year and increasing our consumer broadband penetration to 64% of primary residential lines. Importantly, consumer broadband revenue grew 10% year-over-year due to the increase in subscribers combined with the success our team is having selling broadband-related features. 
Video customers increased by 3,000 units, bringing our total video customer base to 444,000, an increase of 5% year-over-year and our penetration is now roughly 24% of primary residential lines. 
Consumer access lines declined 4.6% year-over-year and total access lines declined 3.6% year-over-year. Consumer revenues were down 3% year-over-year. But importantly, we're up slightly sequentially for the first time in 2 years, a result of the success we are seeing with our pricing strategy and growth in broadband services and the related features. 
As Jeff mentioned, we are largely complete with all of our integration activities. We have successfully combined the Hosted Solutions business into the Windstream sales organization and are capitalizing on the data center and managed services opportunities across our footprint. We are completing the remaining activities for Q-Comm, which we expect to wrap up in the first quarter 2012. Overall, we are very pleased with the acquired businesses which are performing in line with our expectations, and we are tracking towards the $45 million in incremental synergies target in this year. 
We have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives, including increasing broadband capacity and capabilities to enable 12 meg service to over 40% of our footprint and 24 meg service in our most competitive markets. 
We completed the data center expansion in Boston, nearly doubling the size of that facility to 25,000 square feet and making it one of the most advanced managed services facilities in the Boston area. 
Given the strong demand for data center services, we opened a third facility in Charlotte, began expansion plans on our Raleigh data center and started work on a new data center right here in Little Rock. 
Additionally, we invested in many fiber-to-the-tower projects and remain encouraged by the contracts we are winning both in our ILEC footprint, as well as by extending our footprint leveraging the KDL fiber network.
Within our ILEC territories, it's very important that we continue to make the fiber investments to solidify our competitive position and grow these revenue streams. In the non-ILEC territories, which represent roughly half of the fiber projects, the revenue is entirely incremental. Importantly, all of the fiber-to-the-tower initiatives have long-term contracts in place, prior to beginning construction and generate attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital. 
Finally, work is underway on several of the broadband stimulus projects. These investments all offer exciting opportunities to earn attractive returns and better position the business for future success, allowing us to continue creating shareholder value. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who's going to discuss our financial results."

For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.03 billion, operating income of $293 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $3 million",742,"Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.03 billion, operating income of $293 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $3 million after-tax merger and integration costs and $2 million tax-effected loss on early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19.
Turning to our pro forma results for the second quarter, Windstream delivered total revenues of $1.03 billion, which was up slightly year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenue increased $14 million or 3%, driven by growth in advanced data and integrated solutions and special access, which outpaced pressures from voice revenues. Customer service revenue declined $9 million or 3% year-over-year driven by fewer voice customers, offset partially by growth in broadband revenues.
Wholesale service revenue declined $11 million or 7% year-over-year due to declining Switched Access in USF revenues. Total product sales were up $8 million or 41%. 
Specifically by category, Voice and Long Distance revenues declined by $30 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. Data and integrated solutions increased $22 million or 7%, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data offerings and advanced data services to business customers combined with 10% growth in consumer broadband service revenue.
Special access revenues increased $11 million or 9% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access declined $5 million year-over-year related to fewer minutes of use which were offset somewhat by a settlement during the quarter. 
USF revenues were down $5 million year-over-year, including $1 million of pass-through end-user surcharges. Product sales increased by $8 million related to better business and contractor sales.
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $5 million or 1% year-over-year. Excluding pension costs, expenses were lowered by $1 million or flat year-over-year. 
Specifically by category, on a year-over-year basis, the cost of services was up $2 million and cost of products sold increased by $5 million due to higher product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $11 million or 8% year-over-year due to incremental deal synergies and lower consumer advertising, which was partially offset by an increase in commissions driven by strong business sales.
Sequentially, total revenues increased $7 million or approximately 1%, with both the business and consumer channels generating growth over the first quarter, a result of solid demand in data and integrated solutions, special access, broadband and product sales. 
Sequentially, cost of services increased by $9 million due largely to higher weather-related costs and an increase in bad debt expense. Cost of products sold increased by $4 million due to higher product sales and SG&A decreased by roughly $3 million related to deal synergies and lower advertising costs.
For the quarter, OIBDA was $495 million, an increase of 1%. Adjusted OIBDA was $513 million, an increase of 0.6% year-over-year and was negatively affected by the items I mentioned earlier. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 49.8%. Adjusted free cash flow was $227 million for the quarter, an increase of $29 million year-over-year or 15%. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $33 million of our 2016 notes, supporting our plan to deleverage and lower cash interest expense going forward. 
This quarter, we spent $172 million on capital expenditures, which was largely related to our growth initiatives including fiber-to-the-tower projects, data center expansion and enhancing the capabilities of our broadband network. 
This year, we are deploying capital expeditiously to complete as many success-based projects as possible to benefit from the 100% bonus depreciation rules and accelerate revenue realization. Thus, we expect similar levels of capital expenditures in the third quarter with a significant decline in the fourth quarter. 
Windstream has had a strong first half of the year, demonstrating solid execution and improving financial performance. For the back half of the year, we expect to see some sequential improvement. However, most of the improvement will occur in the fourth quarter as we begin to receive some of the expected benefits from our capital investments and realize additional synergies. 
Our strategic initiatives combined with focus on our Organic Business are resulting in improving financial trends. And importantly, we expect to be growing this business, as we exit 2011. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Stephanie, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

Churn was actually flat with where it was even a year ago. But it's churn now on a larger base, so it takes more in terms of sales to outrun that from a gross standpoint. And then we did change our promotion during the quarter, focusing on a little bit more of a -- a little bit over the top video solution. That was a little harder and higher cost at the point of sale for our reps and didn't generate as much momentum as we hoped. We actually moved back beginning in mid-July to the Quitter Campaign, we rolled out in the first quarter. And that's been a real winner for us. But it's -- for a while for now really, it's not just about the net, it's about the revenue growth.

On the consumer side, I think access lines have been fairly steady. It's really on the broadband side which is a function of our penetration, and we've got a very dominant market share which we've had for sometime just because of our strength and bundling products and focus on this product specifically going back for many years. So it's really all about the revenue and ARPU growth there."

And I think, Michael, importantly, we do think about the business in terms of revenue. And as Brent said, we expect to continue to focus on that. We're very pleased with -- if you just look at the underlying trends across our businesses, they were very strong in the quarter. With regard to the USF and FCC reform, I think this is quite an accomplishment. We've got a proposal that I think provides a very thoughtful framework to transition in a manner that assures industry participants, including Windstream, that all of us are financially sound. That was fundamentally one of the things that was challenging when we thought about universal service and ICC reform previously. And I think importantly, the key elements of this plan that I think should be noticed and give investors comfort because they give all of us comfort is, one, the reform does a number of things that are really helpful. First of all, it focuses USF on high-cost areas. This has been a very big problem, and I've talked about this a lot in Washington about the fact that if you were a customer in a rural area of Windstream versus a customer in a rural area of a small carrier, your subsidy would much be higher, and we would get very little USF for that going forward. In this proposal, USF has really targeted towards those high-cost areas, so we kind of deal with this issue that we refer to as the rural divide. All rural customers are going to have the opportunity to get broadband out to them under this plan. This plan effectively eliminates the arbitrage that is going on so frequently in the industry today with some very specific reform around phantom traffic. It gives clarity on IP compensation. It provides what's very important for the financial stability of everyone, a gradual step-down in access rates over a long period of time, a recovery mechanism. And finally, it does include some modest -- very modest increases to the end users. So at the end of the day, I don't think it's at all disrupted as we look in our long-term model.

And as we look at the push and the success we've had in fiber-to-the-tower data centers, enhancing our Internet capacity, we do think we'll be at the high end of our capital guidance. And as I mentioned, there's a couple of reasons we're accelerating the spend. I think that was kind of another element of your question in the first half. That's twofold. One, bonus depreciation. You have to both spend the money and install the equipment in a given year to achieve the tax benefit. So we're very focused -- very much focused on ensuring we receive those cash tax savings. And of course, you get the incremental benefit of as soon as you complete those projects, you begin to realize the revenue. But these are -- we remained very excited about these investment opportunities. They improve the long-term profile of the company. And importantly, on fiber-to-the-tower, we have yet to receive any revenue benefit from those -- that CapEx spend. As we mentioned before, those are long-term capital projects, 6 to 12 months, and you'll see us continue to spend money aggressively in the third quarter and then you'll see it ramped down in the fourth quarter.

And in terms of your strategic question, David, all of our acquisitions have been really focused on value creation as you might expect. I think probably everyone says that. We really do mean it. And I think that the acquisitions that we've done really with an eye towards accelerating this transformation, so that we could drive very good shareholder returns. We have in the first 5 years, I think, PAETEC is a deal that really sets WIN up to grow in the business space and is a great strategic fit, and it gives us outstanding organic opportunities. Remember a lot of these acquisitions -- the same is true of Hosted and KDL. There's great organic opportunities to grow there because we've made these acquisitions in the fiber space, in the data center space, and the same is true with PAETEC. On the enterprise side, it just makes us a much more effective competitor and it was a very important part of our strategic plan. This was a fairly large transaction. We're focused on closing in integrating PAETEC. In the future, we'll be again using the same criteria. We do expect to manage our leverage down there. And in terms of how we think about the future in terms of shareholder returns, it will depend on many things, including what our opportunities are out there. But I hear what you're saying. I mean, we're consistently committed to our dividend. We like operating in that 3.2 to 3.4 range. And I think we're well positioned now even without future acquisitions to grow this business organically, plus we have the right balance. We've got the right focus on the enterprise side that I think presents a better long-term picture for our investors in terms of sustaining the dividend and owning a company that's actually going to grow revenue and pay a very healthy dividend."

When you look at cost of service, as I mentioned, going from the first quarter of 2011 into the second quarter, we did have some higher costs associated with the severe weather and flooding that occurred in both our South and Midwest market and that put some incremental pressure on our cost of service in the second quarter. But importantly, as we look forward, the cost that are most important to maintaining the margins in this business for us are our interconnection costs because you need to be very diligent in managing those. And those costs were down sequentially $1 million and were really flat to about $500,000 down year-over-year. And that's important to us because this management team has shown the ability to manage its costs aggressively, and we're very confident in our ability to do that. The Achilles' heel of the ILEC wireline business is not in the management of costs, it's in growing the top line. And if we get the top line, we're very confident that we'll be able to achieve the margins that we desire in this business. And I think we have a history of being able to take costs out of this business in a way that doesn't harm the customer and improves the -- and maintains our margin. And that's what we're going to be focused on.  And in terms of just giving you some additional color, I do -- there is seasonably a higher level of cost of service in second quarter and first quarter and there's typically even higher levels of cost of service in 3Q, and that's simply seasonal and it dips down significantly in the fourth quarter."

Starting with your housekeeping item, we had -- that Switched Access settlement was a couple of million dollars, so fairly modest, but would just impacting the trends. In terms of how PAETEC influences our overall margins, we think over the long run, it's going to enhance it. Specifically, we're targeting over $110 million of synergies, and we also have this combined 100,000 route miles of fiber. And one of the costs you're really trying to manage on your broadband, as well as your business network is your transport costs. It's the cost of pushing data across the country, and that combined network means we'll be able to carry much more of that traffic on our own network.

But you have be comfortable with the upfront capital and be patient recognizing those are 6- to 12-month investment time horizons.

You're looking at your sales funnel and you know the pipeline is bright. And so the goal is to usually fill that up within a short period of time, defined from our perspective as within 2- to 3-year kind of time horizon, somewhere in that window.  As it pertains to transport, like a lot of folks in the industry, we've definitely seen increases in network traffic really due to video consumption. No question Netflix and other related type services are driving some of that demand. We continue to invest in broadband transport like we have in years past. And the good thing with a lot of things we've been doing from just a network perspective like rolling out as I mentioned before, VDSL technology in larger markets. That's really all about fiber deployment which help solve some of those transport issues. So we feel like we've been in good shape there, but it's certainly something we've been very focused on operationally so our broadband customers don't see a degradation in the quality of their experience."

Today, I will make a few comments about our second quarter accomplishments and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with our performance during the second quarter and particularly, with the fact that we achieved consolidated revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth year-over-year, driven by increased strategic revenues and continued stabilization in the consumer channel. Specifically, business and broadband revenues, which now represent 61% of total revenues, grew 4.7% year-over-year. 
Additionally, consumer revenues grew sequentially during the second quarter for the first time in over 2 years. These results demonstrate that Windstream is successfully executing our strategic initiatives and turning a pivotal corner towards organic growth. 
From a strategic standpoint, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of PAETEC, which will accelerate our revenue and cash flow growth profile by expanding our focus on business and broadband services and generating significant cost synergies. Following this transaction, roughly 70% of our revenues will come from business and broadband services, which are the growth drivers of our business. The combined company will have a robust nationwide network, with a deep fiber footprint of 100,000 fiber route miles, which will improve the cost structure and enhance our capabilities to serve our customers in strategic growth areas, including IP-based services, data centers, cloud computing and managed services. 
In addition, we expect to create approximately $110 million in annual operating and capital synergies and provide meaningful tax benefits. The transaction is accretive in year one and is slightly deleveraging, including synergies. 
Now let me update you on the key initiatives we're working on for 2011, which include our integration activities, investing capital for future growth and deleveraging the balance sheet. 
First, our team has done a fantastic job integrating the businesses that we acquired last year. And frankly, our efforts are largely complete. I am extremely confident in our ability to successfully integrate PAETEC, given our extensive experience and our current readiness. 
Second, we have made great progress on investing in growth initiatives, including fiber deployments to support the growing wireless demand, expanding our data center facilities and improving our Internet speeds and capacity. As we have stated before, these capital investments offer attractive long-term returns that will improve our financial performance going forward. 
Finally, we have made progress deleveraging the balance sheet and expect to attain our historical range of 3.2x to 3.4x leverage within the next 12 months. 
Turning to the regulatory front. The FCC is working on plans to modernize and streamline its intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. Windstream has long supported reform and has actively worked with the commission and within the industry to shape the reform process. In fact, Windstream, along with a diverse coalition of telecom providers, filed a comprehensive reform proposal with the FCC last week. This proposal recommends significant changes to the federal universal service program and the intercarrier compensation system that together will reset the nation's regulatory framework for the future. 
The proposal's core reform objectives include transitioning USF subsidies to a broadband focus fund that explicitly supports high cost areas across America. 
Additionally, the plan recommends rationalizing access rates while providing reasonable revenue replacement opportunities and manageable transition periods. We believe this proposal is consistent with the vision of the National Broadband Plan and is good for consumers and the providers that serve them. By addressing the shortfalls at both USF and intercarrier compensation concurrently, the FCC can ensure stability and certainty within the industry and promote meaningful expansion of robust broadband services. 
Having just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as a public company, it is gratifying to report that we grew revenue and improved the company's profitability year-over-year in the second quarter. The Windstream team has successfully transformed this business from one largely focused on residential voice to a next-generations communications provider on the cusp of sustained revenue growth. Our acquisition strategy, combined with the improvement in our core business, has positioned Windstream for long-term success, and I am more confident than ever in the future of this business. 
I'm particularly proud that we have accomplished this transformation while maintaining our dividend and delivering industry-leading returns. The PAETEC acquisition significantly advances our strategy by accelerating our revenue and cash flow growth profile and creates a new Fortune 500 company that offers investors a unique combination of growth with a very attractive and sustainable dividend yield. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."

I",634,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We have made great progress on our operational initiatives during the first half of 2011 which, combined with solid execution, have produced improving revenue trends in both the business and consumer channels. 
In the business channel, our sales team is doing a terrific job leveraging our expanded portfolio of business services across our base and driving business ARPU growth of almost 5% year-over-year. 
During the second quarter, total business revenues grew by 3.6% year-over-year, an improvement of 150 basis points over the first quarter year-over-year growth rate, driven by solid growth in our strategic business revenues. 
Specifically, advanced data and integrated solutions revenue increased $11 million year-over-year or 6% due to growth in our integrated VoIP offering, advanced data and data center services. Special access revenues increased $11 million year-over-year or 9% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. 
In the consumer channel, we added approximately 3,500 residential high-speed Internet customers, growing our total subscribers by 5% year-over-year and increasing our consumer broadband penetration to 64% of primary residential lines. Importantly, consumer broadband revenue grew 10% year-over-year due to the increase in subscribers combined with the success our team is having selling broadband-related features. 
Video customers increased by 3,000 units, bringing our total video customer base to 444,000, an increase of 5% year-over-year, and our penetration is now roughly 24% of primary residential lines. 
Consumer access lines declined 4.6% year-over-year and total access lines declined 3.6% year-over-year. Consumer revenues were down 3% year-over-year, but importantly, were up slightly sequentially for the first time in 2 years, a result of the success we are seeing with our pricing strategy and growth in broadband services and in related features. 
As Jeff mentioned, we are largely complete with all of our integration activities. We have successfully combined the Hosted Solutions business into the Windstream sales organization and are capitalizing on the data center and managed services opportunities across our footprint. We are completing the remaining activities for Q-Comm, which we expect to wrap up in the first quarter 2012. Overall, we are very pleased with the acquired businesses which are performing in line with our expectations, and we are tracking towards the $45 million in incremental synergies targeted this year. 
We have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives, including increasing broadband capacity and capabilities to enable 12 meg service to over 40% of our footprint and 24 meg service in our most competitive markets. 
We completed the data center expansion in Boston, nearly doubling the size of that facility to 25,000 square feet and making it one of the most advanced managed services facilities in the Boston area. 
Given the strong demand for data center services, we opened a third facility in Charlotte, began expansion plans on our Raleigh data center and started work on a new data center right here in Little Rock. 
Additionally, we invested in many fiber-to-the-tower projects and remain encouraged by the contracts we are winning both in our ILEC footprint, as well as by extending our footprint leveraging the KDL fiber network.
Within our ILEC territories, it's very important that we continue to make the fiber investments to solidify our competitive position and grow these revenue streams. In the non-ILEC territories, which represent roughly half of the fiber projects, the revenue is entirely incremental. Importantly, all of the fiber-to-the-tower initiatives have long-term contracts in place prior to beginning construction and generate attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital. 
Finally, work is underway on several of the broadband stimulus projects. These investments all offer exciting opportunities to earn attractive returns and better position the business for future success, allowing us to continue creating shareholder value. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who's going to discuss our financial results."

For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.03 billion, operating income of $293 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share.

For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.03 billion, operating income of $293 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $3 million after-tax merger and integration costs and $2 million tax-effective loss on an early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19.
Turning to our pro forma results for the second quarter, Windstream delivered total revenues of $1.03 billion, which was up slightly year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenue increased $14 million or 3%, driven by growth in advanced data and integrated solutions and special access, which outpaced pressures from voice revenues. Customer service revenue declined $9 million or 3% year-over-year driven by fewer voice customers, offset partially by growth in broadband revenues.
Wholesale service revenue declined $11 million or 7% year-over-year due to declining Switched Access in USF revenues. Total product sales were up $8 million or 41%. 
Specifically by category, Voice and Long Distance revenues declined by $30 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. Data and integrated solutions increased $22 million or 7%, driven by growth in integrated VoIP and data offerings and advanced data services to business customers combined with 10% growth in consumer broadband service revenue.
Special access revenues increased $11 million or 9% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access declined $5 million year-over-year related to fewer minutes of use which were offset somewhat by a settlement during the quarter. 
USF revenues were down $5 million year-over-year, including $1 million of pass-through end-user surcharges. Product sales increased by $8 million related to better business and contractor sales.
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $5 million or 1% to year-over-year. Excluding pension costs, expenses were lower by $1 million or flat year-over-year. 
Specifically by category, on a year-over-year basis, the cost of services was up $2 million and cost of products sold increased by $5 million due to higher product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $11 million or 8% year-over-year due to incremental deal synergies and lower consumer advertising, which was partially offset by an increase in commissions driven by strong business sales.
Sequentially, total revenues increased $7 million or approximately 1%, with both the business and consumer channels generating growth over the first quarter, a result of solid demand in data and integrated solutions, special access, broadband and product sales. 
Sequentially, cost of services increased by $9 million due largely to higher weather-related costs and an increase in bad debt expense. Cost of products sold increased by $4 million due to higher product sales and SG&A decreased by roughly $3 million related to deal synergies and lower advertising costs.
For the quarter, OIBDA was $495 million, an increase of 1%. Adjusted OIBDA was $513 million, an increase of 0.6% year-over-year and was negatively affected by the items I mentioned earlier. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 49.8%. Adjusted free cash flow was $227 million for the quarter, an increase of $29 million year-over-year or 15%. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $33 million of our 2016 notes, supporting our plan to deleverage and lower cash interest expense going forward. 
This quarter, we spent $172 million on capital expenditures, which was largely related to our growth initiatives including fiber-to-the-tower projects, data center expansion and enhancing the capabilities of our broadband network. 
This year, we are deploying capital expeditiously to complete as many success-based projects as possible to benefit from the 100% bonus depreciation rules and accelerate revenue realization. Thus, we expect similar levels of capital expenditures in the third quarter with a significant decline in the fourth quarter. 
Windstream has had a strong first half of the year, demonstrating solid execution and improving financial performance. For the back half of the year, we expect to see some sequential improvement. However, most of the improvement will occur in the fourth quarter as we begin to receive some of the expected benefits from our capital investments and realize additional synergies. 
Our strategic initiatives combined with focus on our organic business are resulting in improving financial trends. And importantly, we expect to be growing this business as we exit 2011. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Stephanie, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

Churn was actually flat with where it was even a year ago. But it's churn now on a larger base, so it takes more in terms of sales to outrun that from a gross standpoint. And then we did change our promotion during the quarter, focusing on a little bit more of a over-the-top video solution that was a little harder and higher cost at the point of sale for our reps and didn't generate as much momentum as we hoped. We actually moved back beginning of mid-July to the Quitter Campaign, we rolled out in the first quarter. And that's been a real winner for us. But it's -- for a while for now really, it's not just about the net; it's about the revenue growth.

And I think, Michael, importantly, we do think about the business in terms of revenue. And as Brent said, we expect to continue to focus on that. We're very pleased with -- if you just look at the underlying trends across our businesses, they were very strong in the quarter. With regard to the USF and FCC reform, I think this is quite an accomplishment. We've got a proposal that I think provides a very thoughtful framework to transition in a manner that assures industry participants, including Windstream, that all of us are financially sound. That was fundamentally one of the things that was challenging when we thought about universal service and ICC reform previously. And I think importantly, the key elements of this plan that I think should be noticed and give investors comfort because they give all of us comfort is, one, the reform does a number of things that are really helpful. First of all, it focuses USF on high-cost areas. This has been a very big problem, and I've talked about this a lot in Washington about the fact that if you were a customer in a rural area of Windstream versus a customer in a rural area of a small carrier, your subsidy would much be higher, and we would get very little USF for that going forward. In this proposal, USF is really targeted towards those high-cost areas, so we kind of deal with this issue that we refer to as ""the rural-rural divide."" All rural customers are going to have the opportunity to get broadband out to them under this plan. This plan effectively eliminates the arbitrage that is going on so frequently in the industry today with some very specific reform around phantom traffic. It gives clarity on IP compensation. It provides what's very important for the financial stability of everyone: a gradual step-down in access rates over a long period of time, a recovery mechanism and finally, it does include some modest -- very modest increases to the end users. So at the end of the day, I don't think it's at all disruptive as we look at our long-term model. It's not disruptive. It is important that the FCC deal with both USF reform and intercarrier reform concurrently. But I think this framework provides a nice starting point. There's much work to be done here. But we worked very hard on this, and I think we're sufficiently focused on those areas that investors have been historically worried about."

As Brent mentioned in his discussion earlier in the call, obviously, we have a lot of capital projects underway. And as we look at the push and the success we've had in fiber-to-the-tower data centers enhancing our Internet capacity, we do think we'll be at the high end of our capital guidance. And as I mentioned, there's a couple reasons we're accelerating the spend. I think that was kind of another element of your question in the first half. That's twofold. One, bonus depreciation. You have to both spend the money and install the equipment in a given year to achieve the tax benefit. So we're very focused -- very much focused on ensuring we receive those cash tax savings. And of course, you get the incremental benefit of as soon as you complete those projects, you begin to realize the revenue. But these are -- we remain very excited about these investment opportunities. They improve the long-term profile of the company. And importantly, on fiber-to-the-tower, we have yet to receive any revenue benefit from those -- that CapEx spend. As we mentioned before, those are long-term capital projects, 6 to 12 months, and you'll see us continue to spend money aggressively in the third quarter and then you'll see it ramp down in the fourth quarter.

And in terms of your strategic question, David, all of our acquisitions have been really focused on value creation as you might expect. I think probably everyone says that. We really do mean it. And I think that the acquisitions that we've done really with an eye towards accelerating this transformation, so that we could drive very good shareholder returns. We have in the first 5 years, I think, PAETEC is a deal that really sets WIN up to grow in the business space and is a great strategic fit, and it gives us outstanding organic opportunities. Remember, a lot of these acquisitions -- the same is true of Hosted and KDL. There's great organic opportunities to grow there because we've made these acquisitions in the fiber space, in the data center space, and the same is true with PAETEC. On the enterprise side, it just makes us a much more effective competitor and it was a very important part of our strategic plan. This is a fairly large transaction. We're focused on closing and integrating PAETEC. In the future, we'll be again using the same criteria. We do expect to manage our leverage down there. And in terms of how we think about the future in terms of shareholder returns, it will depend on many things, including what our opportunities are out there. But I hear what you're saying. I mean, we're consistently committed to our dividend. We like operating in that 3.2 to 3.4 range. And I think we're well positioned now even without future acquisitions to grow this business organically, plus we have the right balance. We've got the right focus on the enterprise side that I think presents a better long-term picture for investors in terms of sustaining the dividend and owning a company that's actually going to grow revenue and pay a very healthy dividend."

When you look at cost of service, as I mentioned, going from the first quarter of 2011 into the second quarter, we did have some higher costs associated with the severe weather and flooding that occurred in both our South and Midwest markets, and that put some incremental pressure on our cost of service in the second quarter. But importantly, as we look forward, the costs that are most important to maintaining the margins in this business for us are our interconnection costs because you need to be very diligent in managing those. And those costs were down sequentially $1 million and were really flat to about $500,000 down year-over-year. And that's important to us because this management team has shown the ability to manage its costs aggressively, and we're very confident in our ability to do that. The Achilles' heel of the RLEC wireline business is not in the management of costs, it's in growing the top line. And if we get the top line, we're very confident that we'll be able to achieve the margins that we desire in this business. And I think we have a history of being able to take costs out of this business in a way that doesn't harm the customer and improves the -- and maintains our margin. And that's what we're going to be focused on.  And in terms of just giving you some additional color, I do -- there is seasonably a higher level of cost of service in second quarter than first quarter and there's typically even higher levels of cost of service in 3Q, and that's simply seasonal and it dips down significantly in the fourth quarter."

Starting with your housekeeping item, we had -- that Switched Access settlement was a couple million dollars, so fairly modest, but it was just impacting the trends. In terms of how PAETEC influences our overall margins, we think over the long run, it's going to enhance it. Specifically, we're targeting over $110 million of synergies, and we also have this combined 100,000 route miles of fiber. And one of the costs you're really trying to manage on your broadband, as well as your business network, is your transport costs. It's the cost of pushing data across the country, and that combined network means we'll be able to carry much more of that traffic on our own network. And if you can do that, you're going to be enhancing your margins and we've aggressively rolled out fiber on our own.

But you have be comfortable with the upfront capital and be patient at recognizing those are 6- to 12-month investment time horizons.

You're looking at your sales funnel and you know the pipeline is bright. And so the goal is to usually fill that up within a short period of time, defined from our perspective as within 2- to 3-year kind of time horizon, somewhere in that window.  As it pertains to transport, like a lot of folks in the industry, we've definitely seen increases in network traffic really due to video consumption. No question Netflix and other related type services are driving some of that demand. We continue to invest in broadband transport like we have in years past. And the good thing with a lot of things we've been doing from just a network perspective like rolling out as I mentioned before, VDSL technology in our larger markets. That's really all about fiber deployment, which helps solve some of those transport issues. So we feel like we've been in good shape there, but it's certainly something we've been very focused on operationally so our broadband customers don't see a degradation in the quality of their experience."

Today, I will make a few comments about our results and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance.
First, I am very pleased with the top-line improvements we have accomplished this year. Our goal over the past few years was to transform our business to achieve revenue and cash flow growth. 
Given our shifting revenue mix, success-based capital investments and expected deal synergies, we are on the verge of showing growth in both of these areas. 
Our activity level is high and we have made progress on a number of fronts, including business sales momentum, data center expansion, fiber-to-the-tower builds and integration. Importantly, we are seeing the benefits of this transformation and have created the unique opportunity to provide our investors with a combination of both growth and yield. 
In the quarter, our business and consumer service revenue trends were in line with our expectations. On the cost side, our expenses are running slightly higher than normal, given all the activities in anticipation of the PAETEC integration, as well as increased activity around capital projects. I'm very confident that we will achieve or exceed our targeted synergies which will result in nice improvement in adjusted OIBDA trend next year. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives. In early August, we announced a transaction to acquire PAETEC. This is a great strategic combination for us and advances our strategy to expand our business and broadband services which drive top-line growth. In fact, following the PAETEC deal, roughly 70% of our revenues will come from business and broadband. The combined company will have a nationwide network, with a deep fiber footprint of 100,000 fiber route miles, which will expand our capabilities in strategic growth areas and allow us to improve our cost structure by moving more traffic onto our own network. 
In addition, this transaction offers attractive financial benefit, including approximately $110 million in annual operating and capital synergies and provides meaningful tax benefits. We have received Hart-Scott-Rodino approval and the PAETEC shareholders voted to approve the deal last week. At this point, we are awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission and several state Public Service Commission and expect the transaction to close before the end of this year. 
Since this announcement, we've been encouraged with the opportunities we see ahead for our combined company which reinforces our beliefs that PAETEC will create significant value for our shareholders and make Windstream a force in the enterprise space on a national level. 
Turning to our other key initiatives for 2011 which include completing our integration activities, deleveraging the balance sheet and investing capital for future growth. 
First, as I mentioned last quarter, we are largely complete with the integration activities for deals that closed in 2010. In fact, our efforts over the past couple of months have centered around planning for the upcoming PAETEC transaction and I am pleased with where we are at in this process. 
Second, we've improved our capital structure this year to yield significant cash interest savings going forward and we are committed to reducing our leverage to our historical range of 3.2x to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA. 
Finally, we are making great progress with our success-based capital investments, including expanding our data center operations and deploying fiber to the tower to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities. 
As Brent will discuss shortly, our wireless partners are aggressively building their 4G wireless networks and accelerating their deployment plan, resulting in significantly more tower projects than we initially planned. And as we have said before, these are absolute investments that we are eager to make. It is important that we take advantage of this rare and time-sensitive opportunity to achieve highly attractive returns from growth in the wireless industry. 
Turning to the regulatory front. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a plan to modernize its intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. We have long supported the need for these reforms and have worked extensively within the industry to achieve a rational result. 
The detailed order has not been released yet, but based on what the SEC has announced so far, the intercarrier compensation transitions, outlined by the commission appear to provide a manageable path to the future bill and keep environment, with reasonable opportunities to recover a majority of the revenue losses, resulting from the elimination of access charges over time. Additionally, IP traffic will be compensable and phantom traffic should be eliminated. 
With regards to universal service funding, we have supported moving future funding to an efficient, forward-looking model and repositioning USF to drive broadband expansion in high-cost areas. The FCC has also said it will make additional funding available to us in the first year of their plan to further expand broadband service availability in high-cost rural areas that remain uneconomic to serve. 
While the plan outlined, this differs from the ABC plan that we submitted, along with others in our industry, we believe the results will be manageable. And importantly, are encouraged that this reform will provide meaningful certainty to our business model going forward. We will continue working with the FCC and the industry as the commission works to finalize the reforms of the universal service fund. Going forward, we will remain, we will be mindful of strategic opportunities, particularly those that advance our strategy around top-line growth. In the near term however, we will be very focused on completing the PAETEC integration, achieving our targeted synergies and making more improvement in our core business that lead to better top line and cash flow trends. Simply stated, over the next several months, we are squarely focused on execution and integration. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent who will discuss our operating results."

In the business chan",776,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter operational results were in line with our expectations and we continue to see nice growth in our business channel, accompanied with very steady performance in our business. 
In the business channel, revenues increased by 2.3% year-over-year, driven by a variety of factors, including growth in our strategic services and improved focus on servicing our business customers. Organizationally, we have made great strides and have added resources in sales and service delivery to improve our focus and execution in the business channel. We are seeing very nice productivity gains in all of the sales channels that support our business customers, and we have been successful selling higher ARPU services. 
In addition, we have developed a more robust product suite, tailored around IP services to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise space. For example, we've seen great success selling MPLS services, virtual LAN services and dedicated Internet access and we are seeing nice growth in our data center services. We continue to see service growth from wireless backhaul demand which has led to consistent growth in special access revenues. 
In the consumer channel, we added approximately 8,500 high-speed Internet customers, growing our total subscribers by 4.4% year-over-year and increasing our penetration to 65% of primary residential lines. Consumer broadband revenue grew 7% year-over-year, driven by customer growth and sales of broadband features.
Video customers increased by 5,500 units, bringing our total video customer base to 449,000, an increase of 4% year-over-year. 
Consumer access lines declined 4.6% year-over-year which was flat sequentially. Total Access lines declined 3.9% year-over-year which was up 30 basis points sequentially. But importantly, this increase relates entirely to one wholesale customer and have very little financial impact.
Turning to our integration efforts. As a reminder, we have largely completed the activities related to our previous transactions. At this time, we are focused on preparing to close the PAETEC acquisition. And our integration teams are in place and working through project plans, alongside PAETEC who has been very helpful throughout this process. Our team has a great deal of integration experience and I'm confident that we will successfully integrate PAETEC and achieve the targeted synergies. 
As we have learned in past deals, we have many opportunities to extract the best practices from each organization and leverage those across the entire platform and PAETEC has done many things well and we look forward to them being the part of the Windstream family.
As Jeff mentioned, we have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives this year. Given the demand for wireless backhaul and Windstream's successful track record of delivering these services, our opportunities to make fiber-to-the-tower investments are funded, and we believe that these are important investments for the future. 
Where we started this year, given the role major of many of our markets, we expect to deploy fiber to less than 50% of the towers within our ILEC footprint over the course of 2011 and 2012. Today however, given the growing bandwidth needs being fueled by explosive data growth, wireless carriers have aggressively accelerated their fiber deployment plans and significantly increased the number of towers targeted for fiber. As a result, we now expect to roll out fiber to nearly 90% of the towers within our ILEC footprint by the end of 2012. 
We are also having a high level of success winning sides outside of our ILEC territory. Importantly, all of these investments are success-based and secured with 5-to-7-year contracts that drive attractive returns, in excess of our cost of capital. 
Furthermore, although we have not yet realized much revenue from these investments, given the average 12-month investment cycle, on a few sites that we have turned on, we are encouraged by the demand for incremental capacity we are already seeing. As a reminder, we priced these services on a per meg basis and as additional capacity drive additional revenues at very attractive margins, with little to no capital requirements. 
Additionally, during the third quarter, we increased broadband speeds to residential and business customers that can now offer 12 meg service to over 40% of our footprint and 24 mega service in our most competitive markets. We expanded our Raleigh data center to increase the floor space by 10,000 square feet to keep up with the rapidly growing customer base and demand for cloud-based services. Finally, work is underway on several of our broadband stimulus projects. These investments all offer exciting opportunities to continue growing our strategic areas of focus and better position the business for future success. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony who's going to discuss our financial results."

For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.023 billion, operating income of $267 million and $0.14 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $13 million in after-tax merger and integration costs and $13 million tax-effected loss on early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the third quarter, on a year-over-year basis, Windstream achieved total revenues of $1.023 billion, a decline of 1%. Specifically, business service revenues increased $11 million or 2% while consumer service revenues declined by $11 million or 3%. Our wholesale revenues declined $17 million or 10% due in part to challenging year-over-year comparisons. Total product sales were up $2 million. 
Let me discuss the revenue trends by category. data and Integrated Solutions increased $21 million or 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in IP NexGen data and data center services. Special access revenues increased $7 million or 5% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. This quarter, our special access revenues reflect credits for incremental volume discounts. Some of which is not recurring. As we look forward, we expect special access growth rates to accelerate from this level, as we begin to realize revenues associated with our fiber-to-the-tower investments. 
Voice and long distance revenues declined by $27 million or 7% year-over-year, due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. Switched access and USF revenues declined $14 million year-over-year or 9%, primarily related to fewer they and unfavorable cost of this quarter and higher USF state revenues recorded in the third quarter 2010. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $11 million or 2% year-over-year and we're down $7 million, excluding pension cost. 
Specifically by category, on a year-over-year basis, cost of services were down $8 million due largely to lower benefit costs, lower bad debt expense and incremental synergies, offset somewhat by higher interconnect charges related to circuit growth, higher fuel expenses and storm-related cost. Cost of products sold increased $2 million due to slightly higher product sales. 
Within SG&A, expenses decreased to $5 million or 4% year-over-year due largely to lower benefit costs and incremental deals synergies. Sequentially, total revenues declined $7 million due largely to the wholesale revenue decline I mentioned earlier and our cash cost declined by $3 million. 
For the quarter, OIBDA was $490 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year and adjusted OIBDA was $508 million, a decline of 1% year-over-year as well. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 49.6%. 
This quarter, we spent $178 million on capital expenditures which was largely related to our growth initiatives, including fiber-to-the-tower projects, data center expansions and enhancing the capabilities of our broadband network. 
Given our success we are more fiber-to-the-tower contracts, combined with our wireless partner desire to accelerate deployments of these projects, it is likely that we will modestly exceed the high end of our guidance range in capital spend this year although weather will be a significant factor in our fourth quarter capital spend. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we refinanced $350 million on our 2016 nodes with revolver proceeds which will help lower our interest costs going forward. We also contributed 5.9 million shares to our pension plan to address the remaining small contribution required in October of this year, as well as our projected contributions required in 2012. 
Looking to 2012, we are very pleased with how we have positioned our company. We have made great strides expanding our focus on the growth drivers in our business. Which combined with our success base capital investment should result in further improvements in our revenue trends. Additionally, with the synergies from the PAETEC transaction, we expect accelerated growth in adjusted OIBDA. 
This year, our capital spend has been higher than normal due largely to our fiber-to-the-tower investments which will total between $100 million and $125 million. Given the significant increase in the number of tower projects we now expect to complete, we will likely spend $75 million to $125 million more on fiber investments next year as compared to 2011. We also plan to spend $50 million capital next year related to the stimulus projects that we were awarded. Recall, that Windstream's total out-of-pocket capital related to these projects will total $60 million. We expect our capital investments to return to more normalized levels in 2013 and beyond, given that the fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus investments should be substantially complete. Importantly, our cash flows will benefit from the significant reductions to Windstream's legacy cash interest by roughly $80 million in 2012 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to receive a slight refund in cash taxes in 2012 due to the 50% bonus depreciation rules and other tax initiatives. Thus, we are in a great position to finance these success-based investment opportunities.
As discussed for us, we will provide specific guidance details in February 2012, and we expect our guidance to improve PAETEC, given the deal should close by year-end. 
In summary, while we have several moving parts, the steps we are taking to continue transforming this business will derive higher revenue in adjusted OIBDA and provide security towards the most attractive dividend yield in the S&P 500. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sam, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

I'll start with your first question with regard to one-time items. You're correct, we do have a couple one-time items in the revenue outlined this quarter, specifically in the wholesale revenue streams in the USF. We had $2 million to $3 million of unfavorable cost and true ups and other adjustments. And in special access as I talked about that which for the business services, we had an unfavorable adjustment of roughly $2 million this quarter which is nonrecurring. So when you think about that, that was really a customer ultimately you landed in a higher tier or received a higher discount. So from base line, we are still seeing that great demand that Brent spoke to on the special access side and it just resulted in a one-time hit up here in the third quarter. Turning to capital, we are as we look at our capital for 2012, we think this is a unique opportunity for us to make the success-based capital investments that we spoke to on fiber-to-the-tower. Combined with the stimulus spend, we were going to make in the 2012. We do believe capital will go up in 2012 as to how I think you're summarizing what you talk about the increase of fiber-to-the-tower of roughly $75 million to $125 million and the increase in stimulus of $60 million. But importantly, as you look forward, we expect the CapEx to decline in 2013 as the success-based capital investments are largely complete. And importantly, we make these investments because they change the trajectory of our business. They continue to drive revenue higher and also adjusted OIBDA higher. And importantly in 2012, the other commentary I gave was in regards to cash interest and cash taxes. It's very fortuitous for us that we're making these capital investments in a time when our cash taxes will in fact be very low in 2012 when in fact we'll be in the refund position. And we've been very busy on the balance sheet this year and we expect to achieve $80 million in cash, interest savings year-over-year. So we look at these investments. And coupled with the other offset in cash interest to cash taxes, we're very comfortable with how the company is positioned in 2012 and we expect that 2013 for CapEx to come back down to more normalized levels."

Secondly, because the KDL transaction, we picked up fiber all over the place. But to the extent we can leverage fiber and towers close to that fiber, we wanted to win that business as well and it's literally just been a function of more success than we counted on as yield on those results. But Tony kind of indicated in his numbers, what a perfect time to spend the capital because the reasons he shared and we know that in terms of the revenue growth we've seen year-to-date on special access has been 7% year-over-year if you look and year-to-date through the third quarter and we want to see that continuing to future."

Our capital structure affords us the flexibility to continue returning a significant portion of our cash flows to our shareholders and invest adequately in our business to capitalize on these opportunities which will further improve our financial performance going forward. 
I'm very proud that we have made this transformation while continuing to deliver industry-leading operating and financial metrics, and importantly, shareholder returns. With that, thank you again for your interest in Windstream."

Today, I will make a few comments about our results and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance.
First, I am very pleased with the top line improvements we have accomplished this year. Our goal over the past few years was to transform our business to achieve revenue and cash flow growth. 
Given our shifting revenue mix, success-based capital investments and expected deal synergies, we are on the verge of showing growth in both of these areas. 
Our activity level is high, and we have made progress on a number of fronts, including business sales momentum, data center expansion, fiber-to-the-tower builds and integration. Importantly, we are seeing the benefits of this transformation and have created the unique opportunity to provide our investors with a combination of both growth and yield. 
In the quarter, our business and consumer service revenue trends were in line with our expectations. On the cost side, our expenses are running slightly higher than normal, given all the activities in anticipation of the PAETEC integration, as well as increased activity around capital projects. I'm very confident that we will achieve or exceed our targeted synergies, which will result in nice improvement in adjusted OIBDA trend next year. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives. In early August, we announced a transaction to acquire PAETEC. This is a great strategic combination for us and advances our strategy to expand our business and broadband services which drive top line growth. In fact, following the PAETEC deal, roughly 70% of our revenues will come from business and broadband. The combined company will have a nationwide network, with a deep fiber footprint of 100,000 fiber route miles, which will expand our capabilities in strategic growth areas and allow us to improve our cost structure by moving more traffic onto our own network. 
In addition, this transaction offers attractive financial benefit, including approximately $110 million in annual operating and capital synergies and provides meaningful tax benefits. We have received Hart-Scott-Rodino approval, and the PAETEC shareholders voted to approve the deal last week. At this point, we are awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission and several state public service commissions and expect the transaction to close before the end of this year. 
Since this announcement, we've been encouraged with the opportunities we see ahead for our combined company, which reinforces our belief that PAETEC will create significant value for our shareholders and make Windstream a force in the enterprise space on a national level. 
Turning to our other key initiatives for 2011, which include completing our integration activity, deleveraging the balance sheet and investing capital for future growth. 
First, as I mentioned last quarter, we are largely complete with the integration activities for deals that closed in 2010. In fact, our efforts over the past couple of months have centered around planning for the upcoming PAETEC transaction, and I am pleased with where we are at in this process. 
Second, we've improved our capital structure this year to yield significant cash interest savings going forward, and we are committed to reducing our leverage to our historical range of 3.2x to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA. 
Finally, we are making great progress with our success-based capital investments, including expanding our data center operations and deploying fiber to the tower to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities. 
As Brent will discuss shortly, our wireless partners are aggressively building their 4G wireless networks and accelerating their deployment plan, resulting in significantly more tower projects than we initially planned. And as we have said before, these are absolutely investments that we are eager to make. It is important that we take advantage of this rare and time-sensitive opportunity to achieve highly attractive returns from growth in the wireless industry. 
Turning to the regulatory front. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a plan to modernize its intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. We have long supported the need for these reforms and have worked extensively within the industry to achieve a rational result. 
The detailed order has not been released yet, but based on what the FCC has announced so far, the intercarrier compensation transitions outlined by the commission appear to provide a manageable path to the future bill-and-keep environment, with reasonable opportunities to recover a majority of the revenue losses resulting from the elimination of access charges over time. Additionally, IP traffic will be compensable and phantom traffic should be eliminated. 
With regards to universal service funding, we have supported moving future funding to an efficient, forward-looking model and repositioning USF to drive broadband expansion in high-cost areas. The FCC has also said it will make additional funding available to us in the first year of their plan to further expand broadband service availability in high-cost rural areas that remain uneconomic to serve. 
While the plan outlined differs from the ABC plan that we submitted, along with others in our industry, we believe the results will be manageable and, importantly, are encouraged that this reform will provide meaningful certainty to our business model going forward. We will continue working with the FCC and the industry as the commission works to finalize the reforms of the universal service fund. Going forward, we will remain -- we will be mindful of strategic opportunities, particularly those that advance our strategy around top-line growth. In the near term however, we will be very focused on completing the PAETEC integration, achieving our targeted synergies and making more improvement in our core business that lead to better top line and cash flow trends. Simply stated, over the next several months, we are squarely focused on execution and integration. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."

Our third quarter operational results were in line with our expectations, and we continue to see nice growth in our business channel, accompanied with very steady performance in our consumer business. In the bus",778,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter operational results were in line with our expectations, and we continue to see nice growth in our business channel, accompanied with very steady performance in our consumer business. 
In the business channel, revenues increased by 2.3% year-over-year, driven by a variety of factors, including growth in our strategic services and improved focus on servicing our business customers. Organizationally, we have made great strides and have added resources in sales and service delivery to improve our focus and execution in the business channel. We are seeing very nice productivity gains in all of the sales channels that support our business customers, and we have been successful selling higher ARPU services. 
In addition, we have developed a more robust product suite, tailored around IP services to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise space. For example, we've seen great success selling MPLS services, virtual LAN services and dedicated Internet access, and we are seeing nice growth in our data center services. We continue to see circuit growth from wireless backhaul demand, which has led to consistent growth in special access revenues. 
In the consumer channel, we added approximately 8,500 high-speed Internet customers, growing our total subscribers by 4.4% year-over-year and increasing our penetration to 65% of primary residential lines. Consumer broadband revenue grew 7% year-over-year, driven by customer growth and sales of broadband features.
Video customers increased by 5,500 units, bringing our total video customer base to 449,000, an increase of 4% year-over-year. 
Consumer access lines declined 4.6% year-over-year, which was flat sequentially. Total access lines declined 3.9% year-over-year, which was up 30 basis points sequentially, but importantly, this increase relates entirely to one wholesale customer and will have very little financial impact.
Turning to our integration efforts. As a reminder, we have largely completed the activities related to our previous transactions. At this time, we are focused on preparing to close the PAETEC acquisition, and our integration teams are in place and working through project plans alongside PAETEC, who has been very helpful throughout this process. Our team has a great deal of integration experience, and I'm confident that we will successfully integrate PAETEC and achieve the targeted synergies. 
As we have learned in past deals, we have many opportunities to extract the best practices from each organization and leverage those across the entire platform, and PAETEC has done many things well, and we look forward to them being the part of the Windstream family.
As Jeff mentioned, we have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives this year. Given the demand for wireless backhaul and Windstream's successful track record of delivering these services, our opportunities to make fiber-to-the-tower investments are abundant, and we believe that these are important investments for the future. 
When we started this year, given the rural nature of many of our markets, we expect to deploy fiber to less than 50% of the towers within our ILEC footprint over the course of 2011 and 2012. Today, however, given the growing bandwidth needs being fueled by explosive data growth, wireless carriers have aggressively accelerated their fiber deployment plans and significantly increased the number of towers targeted for fiber. As a result, we now expect to roll out fiber to nearly 90% of the towers within our ILEC footprint by the end of 2012. 
We are also having a high level of success winning sites outside of our ILEC territory. Importantly, all of these investments are success-based and secure with 5-to-7-year contracts that drive attractive returns in excess of our cost of capital. 
Furthermore, although we have not yet realized much revenue from these investments given the average 12-month investment cycle, on the few sites that we have turned on, we are encouraged by the demand for incremental capacity we are already seeing. As a reminder, we price these services on a per meg basis and thus, additional capacity drives incremental revenues at very attractive margins with little to no capital requirements. 
Additionally, during the third quarter, we increased broadband speeds to residential and business customers that can now offer 12 meg service to over 40% of our footprint and 24 meg service in our most competitive markets. We expanded our Raleigh data center to increase the floor space by 10,000 square feet to keep up with the rapidly growing customer base and demand for cloud-based services. 
Finally, work is underway on several of our broadband stimulus projects. These investments all offer exciting opportunities to continue growing our strategic areas of focus and better position the business for future success. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who's going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,141455287,185127,"Windstream Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.023 billion, operating income of $267 million and $0.14 of diluted earnings per share.

For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.023 billion, operating income of $267 million and $0.14 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $13 million in after-tax merger and integration costs and $13 million tax-effected loss on early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Windstream achieved total revenues of $1.023 billion, a decline of 1%. Specifically, business service revenues increased $11 million or 2%, while consumer service revenues declined by $11 million or 3%. Our wholesale revenues declined $17 million or 10% due in part to challenging year-over-year comparisons. Total product sales were up $2 million. 
Let me discuss the revenue trends by category. Data and integrated solutions increased $21 million or 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in IP, nex-gen data and data center services. Special access revenues increased $7 million or 5% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. This quarter, our special access revenues reflect credits for incremental volume discounts, some of which is not recurring. As we look forward, we expect special access growth rates to accelerate from this level, as we begin to realize revenues associated with our fiber-to-the-tower investments. 
Voice and long distance revenues declined by $27 million or 7% year-over-year due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. Switched access and USF revenues declined $14 million year-over-year or 9%, primarily related to fewer minutes of use, an unfavorable cost study true up this quarter and higher USF state revenues recorded in the third quarter of 2010. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $11 million or 2% year-over-year and were down $7 million, excluding pension costs. 
Specifically by category, on a year-over-year basis, cost of services was down $8 million due largely to lower benefit costs, lower bad debt expense and incremental synergies, offset somewhat by higher interconnect charges related to circuit growth, higher fuel expenses and storm-related costs. Cost of products sold increased by $2 million due to slightly higher product sales. 
Within SG&A, expenses decreased $5 million or 4% year-over-year due largely to lower benefit costs and incremental deal synergies. Sequentially, total revenues declined $7 million due largely to the wholesale revenue declines I mentioned earlier, and our cash cost declined by $3 million. 
For the quarter, OIBDA was $490 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year and adjusted OIBDA was $508 million, a decline of 1% year-over-year as well. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 49.6%. 
This quarter, we spent $178 million on capital expenditures, which was largely related to our growth initiatives, including fiber-to-the-tower projects, data center expansions and enhancing the capabilities of our broadband network. 
Given our success winning more fiber-to-the-tower contracts, combined with our wireless partners' desire to accelerate deployments of these projects, it is likely that we will modestly exceed the high end of our guidance range in capital spend this year, although weather will be a significant factor in our fourth quarter capital spend. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we refinanced $350 million on our 2016 notes with revolver proceeds, which will help lower our interest costs going forward. We also contributed 5.9 million shares to our pension plan to address the remaining small contribution required in October of this year, as well as our projected contributions required in 2012. 
Looking to 2012, we are very pleased with how we have positioned our company. We have made great strides expanding our focus on the growth drivers in our business, which, combined with our success-based capital investments, should result in further improvements in our revenue trends. Additionally, with the synergies from the PAETEC transaction, we expect accelerated growth in adjusted OIBDA. 
This year, our capital spend has been higher than normal due largely to our fiber-to-the-tower investments, which will total between $100 million and $125 million. Given the significant increase in the number of tower projects we now expect to complete, we will likely spend $75 million to $125 million more on fiber investments next year as compared to 2011. We also plan to spend $50 million in capital next year related to the stimulus projects that we were awarded. Recall that Windstream's total out-of-pocket capital related to these projects will total $60 million. We expect our capital investments to return to more normalized levels in 2013 and beyond, given that the fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus investments should be substantially complete. Importantly, our cash flows will benefit from the significant reductions to Windstream's legacy cash interest of roughly $80 million in 2012 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to receive a slight refund in cash taxes in 2012 due to the 50% bonus depreciation rules and other tax-saving initiatives. Thus, we are in a great position to finance these success-based investment opportunities.
As is customary for us, we will provide specific guidance details in February 2012, and we expect our guidance to include PAETEC, given the deal should close by year end. 
In summary, while we have several moving parts, the steps we are taking to continue transforming this business will derive higher revenue and adjusted OIBDA and provide security to one of the most attractive dividend yields in the S&P 500. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sam, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

And then the second thing is are you basically implying with the CapEx commentary that if you take the incremental stimulus and you take the amount incrementally on fiber to the cell that CapEx just from a base-case perspective could be up between $115 million to $165 million next year, or are there other offsets to the CapEx that would bring that down?"

I'll start with your first question in regard to one-time items. You're correct. We do have a couple one-time items in the revenue outlined this quarter, specifically in the wholesale revenue streams in USF. We had $2 million to $3 million of unfavorable cost study true ups and other adjustments. And in special access, as I talked about that, which goes to business services, we had an unfavorable adjustment of roughly $2 million this quarter, which is nonrecurring. So when you think about that, that was really a customer ultimately you landed in a higher tier or received a higher discount. So from base line, we're still seeing that great demand that Brent spoke to on the special access side, and it just resulted in a hiccup here in the third quarter. Turning to capital, we are -- as we look at our capital for 2012, we think this is a unique opportunity for us to make success-based capital investments that we spoke to on fiber to the tower. Combined with the stimulus spend, we were going to make in the 2012, we do believe capital will go up in 2012 similar to how I think you were surmising, which I talked about, as the increase of fiber-to-the-tower of roughly $75 million to $125 million and the increase in stimulus of $60 million. But importantly, as you look forward, we expect the CapEx to decline in 2013 as the success-based capital investments are largely complete. And importantly, we make these investments because they change the trajectory of our business. They continue to drive revenue higher and also, adjusted OIBDA higher. And importantly in 2012, the other commentary I gave was in regards to cash interest and cash taxes. It's very fortuitous for us that we're making these capital investments in a time when our cash taxes will in fact be very low in 2012. Well, in fact, we'll be in a refund position. And we've been very busy on the balance sheet this year, and we expect to achieve $80 million in cash, interest savings year-over-year. So we look at these investments and, coupled with the other offset in cash interest to cash taxes, we're very comfortable with how the company is positioned in 2012, and we expect at 2013 for CapEx to come back down to more normalized levels."

That's what they're using the broadband for is the video, and the focus is around what you can do with that video in a broadband connection at a price point that's valued by the customer in terms of an entertainment package. And that's really how we're continuing to increase our penetration. In terms of high speed, we have, for a while, made high-speed sales a big part of our sales effort. However, customers still don't want to pay, we see often, incrementally for higher speed services. We try to position Windstream as all the speed you need, which is really trying to help make sure customers understand our parity with cable as it pertains to speeds because some of the perceptions around traditional ADSL services, they've used against us, and that's working for us. But again, customers really just, we find, don't want to spend a lot more for incremental speeds. We see that as revenue upside in the future, but not seeing a great deal of demand there right now."

Not surprisingly, given so much of our effort is focused on rolling out ethernet fiber services to those carriers. They've added a great deal of capacity on the TDM side earlier this year just in preparation for what was coming. That slowed because we are nearing the point in Q4 and certainly heading into 2012 where we'll begin to turn on a significant number of those towers. In terms of advanced data and integration, just overall customer account there is really more a function of declines in older and mature services.

Our return expectations have stayed steady. It's really a function of a couple of things. Number one, an effort by us to really lock up our franchise and territory. We had great relationships in terms of service with those carriers for a number of years, and the last thing we wanted as part of this effort was to see a lot more competition in our ILEC franchise. So we worked to lock up of that base and have done so with, what I'll say, market prices that have stayed stable this year. Secondly, the carriers have been, as we kind of indicated, much more aggressive about rolling out fiber to the tower this year, even in rural areas. And that's a function of the competition in the wireless space, and we're seeing that show up as you -- as I kind of talked to earlier, actually, a lot of circuit growth early in the year, and they need more capacity. And we're working to deliver that right now. The second element of that really for us has been in areas outside of our footprint, trying to win business in markets that also offer CLEC expansion opportunities, yet the business case pays for itself alone with just the fiber to the tower. And secondly, because of the KDL transaction, we picked up fiber all over the place. But to the extent we can leverage fiber and towers close to that fiber, we wanted to win that business as well, and it's literally just been a function of more success than we counted on that yielded those results. But as Tony kind of indicated in his numbers, I mean, what a perfect time to spend the capital because of the reasons he shared. And we know that in terms of the revenue growth we've seen year-to-date on special access has been 7% year-over-year if you look year-to-date through the third quarter, and we want to see that continue in the future."

We don't see a mass migration in the short-term because of the capacity reasons we shared from those TDM services. There will be a gradual turn down of that. But at the same time, the way we've priced these contracts, they're on a per meg basis. And as you begin to turn that down, the revenue accelerates, helping offset that, because you're charging for that on a bandwidth usage basis. So it's a very different model than historically, which was more tied toward just circuits."

Today, I will make a few comments about our results and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance.
First, I am very pleased with the top line improvements we have accomplished this year. Our goal over the past few years was to transform our business to achieve revenue and cash flow growth. 
Given our shifting revenue mix, success-based capital investments and expected deal synergies, we are on the verge of showing growth in both of these areas. 
Our activity level is high, and we have made progress on a number of fronts, including business sales momentum, data center expansion, fiber-to-the-tower builds and integration. Importantly, we are seeing the benefits of this transformation and have created the unique opportunity to provide our investors with a combination of both growth and yield. 
In the quarter, our business and consumer service revenue trends were in line with our expectations. On the cost side, our expenses are running slightly higher than normal, given all the activities in anticipation of the PAETEC integration, as well as increased activity around capital projects. I'm very confident that we will achieve or exceed our targeted synergies, which will result in nice improvement in adjusted OIBDA trend next year. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives. In early August, we announced a transaction to acquire PAETEC. This is a great strategic combination for us and advances our strategy to expand our business and broadband services which drive top line growth. In fact, following the PAETEC deal, roughly 70% of our revenues will come from business and broadband. The combined company will have a nationwide network, with a deep fiber footprint of 100,000 fiber route miles, which will expand our capabilities in strategic growth areas and allow us to improve our cost structure by moving more traffic onto our own network. 
In addition, this transaction offers attractive financial benefit, including approximately $110 million in annual operating and capital synergies and provides meaningful tax benefits. We have received Hart-Scott-Rodino approval, and the PAETEC shareholders voted to approve the deal last week. At this point, we are awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission and several state public service commissions and expect the transaction to close before the end of this year. 
Since this announcement, we've been encouraged with the opportunities we see ahead for our combined company, which reinforces our belief that PAETEC will create significant value for our shareholders and make Windstream a force in the enterprise space on a national level. 
Turning to our other key initiatives for 2011, which include completing our integration activities deleveraging the balance sheet and investing capital for future growth. 
First, as I mentioned last quarter, we are largely complete with the integration activities for deals that closed in 2010. In fact, our efforts over the past couple of months have centered around planning for the upcoming PAETEC transaction, and I am pleased with where we are at in this process. 
Second, we've improved our capital structure this year to yield significant cash interest savings going forward, and we are committed to reducing our leverage to our historical range of 3.2x to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA. 
Finally, we are making great progress with our success-based capital investments, including expanding our data center operations and deploying fiber to the tower to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities. 
As Brent will discuss shortly, our wireless partners are aggressively building their 4G wireless networks and accelerating their deployment plan, resulting in significantly more tower projects than we initially planned. And as we have said before, these are absolutely investments that we are eager to make. It is important that we take advantage of this rare and time-sensitive opportunity to achieve highly attractive returns from growth in the wireless industry. 
Turning to the regulatory front. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a plan to modernize its intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. We have long supported the need for these reforms and have worked extensively within the industry to achieve a rational result. 
The detailed order has not been released yet, but based on what the FCC has announced so far, the intercarrier compensation transitions outlined by the commission appear to provide a manageable path to the future bill-and-keep environment, with reasonable opportunities to recover a majority of the revenue losses resulting from the elimination of access charges over time. Additionally, IP traffic will be compensable and phantom traffic should be eliminated. 
With regards to universal service funding, we have supported moving future funding to an efficient, forward-looking model and repositioning USF to drive broadband expansion in high-cost areas. The FCC has also said it will make additional funding available to us in the first year of their plan to further expand broadband service availability in high-cost rural areas that remain uneconomic to serve. 
While the plan outlined differs from the ABC plan that we submitted, along with others in our industry, we believe the results will be manageable and, importantly, are encouraged that this reform will provide meaningful certainty to our business model going forward. We will continue working with the FCC and the industry as the commission works to finalize the reforms of the universal service fund. Going forward, we will remain -- we will be mindful of strategic opportunities, particularly those that advance our strategy around top-line growth. In the near term however, we will be very focused on completing the PAETEC integration, achieving our targeted synergies and making more improvement in our core business that lead to better top line and cash flow trends. Simply stated, over the next several months, we are squarely focused on execution and integration. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."

Our third quarter operational results were in line with our expectations, and we continue to see nice growth in our business channel, accompanied with very steady performance in our consumer business. In the bus",778,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter operational results were in line with our expectations, and we continue to see nice growth in our business channel, accompanied with very steady performance in our consumer business. 
In the business channel, revenues increased by 2.3% year-over-year, driven by a variety of factors, including growth in our strategic services and improved focus on servicing our business customers. Organizationally, we have made great strides and have added resources in sales and service delivery to improve our focus and execution in the business channel. We are seeing very nice productivity gains in all of the sales channels that support our business customers, and we have been successful selling higher ARPU services. 
In addition, we have developed a more robust product suite, tailored around IP services to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise space. For example, we've seen great success selling MPLS services, virtual LAN services and dedicated Internet access, and we are seeing nice growth in our data center services. We continue to see circuit growth from wireless backhaul demand, which has led to consistent growth in special access revenues. 
In the consumer channel, we added approximately 8,500 high-speed Internet customers, growing our total subscribers by 4.4% year-over-year and increasing our penetration to 65% of primary residential lines. Consumer broadband revenue grew 7% year-over-year, driven by customer growth and sales of broadband features.
Video customers increased by 5,500 units, bringing our total video customer base to 449,000, an increase of 4% year-over-year. 
Consumer access lines declined 4.6% year-over-year, which was flat sequentially. Total access lines declined 3.9% year-over-year, which was up 30 basis points sequentially, but importantly, this increase relates entirely to one wholesale customer and will have very little financial impact.
Turning to our integration efforts. As a reminder, we have largely completed the activities related to our previous transactions. At this time, we are focused on preparing to close the PAETEC acquisition, and our integration teams are in place and working through project plans alongside PAETEC, who has been very helpful throughout this process. Our team has a great deal of integration experience, and I'm confident that we will successfully integrate PAETEC and achieve the targeted synergies. 
As we have learned in past deals, we have many opportunities to extract the best practices from each organization and leverage those across the entire platform, and PAETEC has done many things well, and we look forward to them being the part of the Windstream family.
As Jeff mentioned, we have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives this year. Given the demand for wireless backhaul and Windstream's successful track record of delivering these services, our opportunities to make fiber-to-the-tower investments are abundant, and we believe that these are important investments for the future. 
When we started this year, given the rural nature of many of our markets, we expect to deploy fiber to less than 50% of the towers within our ILEC footprint over the course of 2011 and 2012. Today, however, given the growing bandwidth needs being fueled by explosive data growth, wireless carriers have aggressively accelerated their fiber deployment plans and significantly increased the number of towers targeted for fiber. As a result, we now expect to roll out fiber to nearly 90% of the towers within our ILEC footprint by the end of 2012. 
We are also having a high level of success winning sites outside of our ILEC territory. Importantly, all of these investments are success-based and secure with 5-to-7-year contracts that drive attractive returns in excess of our cost of capital. 
Furthermore, although we have not yet realized much revenue from these investments given the average 12-month investment cycle, on the few sites that we have turned on, we are encouraged by the demand for incremental capacity we are already seeing. As a reminder, we price these services on a per meg basis and thus, additional capacity drives incremental revenues at very attractive margins with little to no capital requirements. 
Additionally, during the third quarter, we increased broadband speeds to residential and business customers that can now offer 12 meg service to over 40% of our footprint and 24 meg service in our most competitive markets. We expanded our Raleigh data center to increase the floor space by 10,000 square feet to keep up with the rapidly growing customer base and demand for cloud-based services. 
Finally, work is underway on several of our broadband stimulus projects. These investments all offer exciting opportunities to continue growing our strategic areas of focus and better position the business for future success. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who's going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,141455287,185559,"Windstream Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.023 billion, operating income of $267 million and $0.14 of diluted earnings per share.

For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.023 billion, operating income of $267 million and $0.14 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $13 million in after-tax merger and integration costs and $13 million tax-effected loss on early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Windstream achieved total revenues of $1.023 billion, a decline of 1%. Specifically, business service revenues increased $11 million or 2%, while consumer service revenues declined by $11 million or 3%. Our wholesale revenues declined $17 million or 10% due in part to challenging year-over-year comparisons. Total product sales were up $2 million. 
Let me discuss the revenue trends by category. Data and integrated solutions increased $21 million or 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in IP, nex-gen data and data center services. Special access revenues increased $7 million or 5% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. This quarter, our special access revenues reflect credits for incremental volume discounts, some of which is not recurring. As we look forward, we expect special access growth rates to accelerate from this level, as we begin to realize revenues associated with our fiber-to-the-tower investments. 
Voice and long distance revenues declined by $27 million or 7% year-over-year due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. Switched access and USF revenues declined $14 million year-over-year or 9%, primarily related to fewer minutes of use, an unfavorable cost study true up this quarter and higher USF state revenues recorded in the third quarter of 2010. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $11 million or 2% year-over-year and were down $7 million, excluding pension costs. 
Specifically by category, on a year-over-year basis, cost of services was down $8 million due largely to lower benefit costs, lower bad debt expense and incremental synergies, offset somewhat by higher interconnect charges related to circuit growth, higher fuel expenses and storm-related costs. Cost of products sold increased by $2 million due to slightly higher product sales. 
Within SG&A, expenses decreased $5 million or 4% year-over-year due largely to lower benefit costs and incremental deal synergies. Sequentially, total revenues declined $7 million due largely to the wholesale revenue declines I mentioned earlier, and our cash cost declined by $3 million. 
For the quarter, OIBDA was $490 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year and adjusted OIBDA was $508 million, a decline of 1% year-over-year as well. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 49.6%. 
This quarter, we spent $178 million on capital expenditures, which was largely related to our growth initiatives, including fiber-to-the-tower projects, data center expansions and enhancing the capabilities of our broadband network. 
Given our success winning more fiber-to-the-tower contracts, combined with our wireless partners' desire to accelerate deployments of these projects, it is likely that we will modestly exceed the high end of our guidance range in capital spend this year, although weather will be a significant factor in our fourth quarter capital spend. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we refinanced $350 million on our 2016 notes with revolver proceeds, which will help lower our interest costs going forward. We also contributed 5.9 million shares to our pension plan to address the remaining small contribution required in October of this year, as well as our projected contributions required in 2012. 
Looking to 2012, we are very pleased with how we have positioned our company. We have made great strides expanding our focus on the growth drivers in our business, which, combined with our success-based capital investments, should result in further improvements in our revenue trends. Additionally, with the synergies from the PAETEC transaction, we expect accelerated growth in adjusted OIBDA. 
This year, our capital spend has been higher than normal due largely to our fiber-to-the-tower investments, which will total between $100 million and $125 million. Given the significant increase in the number of tower projects we now expect to complete, we will likely spend $75 million to $125 million more on fiber investments next year as compared to 2011. We also plan to spend $50 million in capital next year related to the stimulus projects that we were awarded. Recall that Windstream's total out-of-pocket capital related to these projects will total $60 million. We expect our capital investments to return to more normalized levels in 2013 and beyond, given that the fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus investments should be substantially complete. Importantly, our cash flows will benefit from the significant reductions to Windstream's legacy cash interest of roughly $80 million in 2012 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to receive a slight refund in cash taxes in 2012 due to the 50% bonus depreciation rules and other tax-saving initiatives. Thus, we are in a great position to finance these success-based investment opportunities.
As is customary for us, we will provide specific guidance details in February 2012, and we expect our guidance to include PAETEC, given the deal should close by year end. 
In summary, while we have several moving parts, the steps we are taking to continue transforming this business will derive higher revenue and adjusted OIBDA and provide security to one of the most attractive dividend yields in the S&P 500. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sam, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

I'll start with your first question in regard to one-time items. You're correct. We do have a couple one-time items in the revenue outlined this quarter, specifically in the wholesale revenue streams in USF. We had $2 million to $3 million of unfavorable cost study true ups and other adjustments. And in special access, as I talked about that, which goes to business services, we had an unfavorable adjustment of roughly $2 million this quarter, which is nonrecurring. So when you think about that, that was really a customer ultimately you landed in a higher tier or received a higher discount. So from base line, we're still seeing that great demand that Brent spoke to on the special access side, and it just resulted in a hiccup here in the third quarter. Turning to capital, we are -- as we look at our capital for 2012, we think this is a unique opportunity for us to make success-based capital investments that we spoke to on fiber to the tower. Combined with the stimulus spend, we were going to make in the 2012, we do believe capital will go up in 2012 similar to how I think you were surmising, which I talked about, as the increase of fiber-to-the-tower of roughly $75 million to $125 million and the increase in stimulus of $60 million. But importantly, as you look-forward, we expect the CapEx to decline in 2013 as the success-based capital investments are largely complete. And importantly, we make these investments because they change the trajectory of our business. They continue to drive revenue higher and also, adjusted OIBDA higher. And importantly in 2012, the other commentary I gave was in regards to cash interest and cash taxes. It's very fortuitous for us that we're making these capital investments in a time when our cash taxes will in fact be very low in 2012. Well, in fact, we'll be in a refund position. And we've been very busy on the balance sheet this year, and we expect to achieve $80 million in cash, interest savings year-over-year. So we look at these investments and, coupled with the other offset in cash interest to cash taxes, we're very comfortable with how the company is positioned in 2012, and we expect at 2013 for CapEx to come back down to more normalized levels."

But again, customers really just, we find, don't want to spend a lot more for incremental speeds. We see that as revenue upside in the future, but not seeing a great deal of demand there right now."

Not surprisingly, given so much of our effort is focused on rolling out ethernet fiber services to those carriers. They've added a great deal of capacity on the TDM side earlier this year just in preparation for what was coming. That slowed because we are nearing the point in Q4 and certainly heading into 2012 where we'll begin to turn on a significant number of those towers. In terms of advanced data and integration, just overall customer account there is really more a function of declines in older and mature services.

Our return expectations have stayed steady. It's really a function of a couple of things. Number one, an effort by us to really lock up our franchise and territory. We had great relationships in terms of service with those carriers for a number of years, and the last thing we wanted as part of this effort was to see a lot more competition in our ILEC franchise. So we worked to lock up of that base and have done so with, what I'll say, market prices that have stayed stable this year. Secondly, the carriers have been, as we kind of indicated, much more aggressive about rolling out fiber to the tower this year, even in rural areas. And that's a function of the competition in the wireless space, and we're seeing that show up as you -- as I kind of talked to earlier, actually, a lot of circuit growth early in the year, and they need more capacity. And we're working to deliver that right now. The second element of that really for us has been in areas outside of our footprint, trying to win business in markets that also offer CLEC expansion opportunities, yet the business case pays for itself alone with just the fiber to the tower. And secondly, because of the KDL transaction, we picked up fiber all over the place. But to the extent we can leverage fiber and towers close to that fiber, we wanted to win that business as well, and it's literally just been a function of more success than we counted on that yielded those results. But as Tony kind of indicated in his numbers, I mean, what a perfect time to spend the capital because of the reasons he shared. And we know that in terms of the revenue growth we've seen year-to-date on special access has been 7% year-over-year if you look year-to-date through the third quarter, and we want to see that continue in the future."

We don't see a mass migration in the short-term because of the capacity reasons we shared from those TDM services. There will be a gradual turn down of that. But at the same time, the way we've priced these contracts, they're on a per meg basis. And as you begin to turn that down, the revenue accelerates, helping offset that, because you're charging for that on a bandwidth usage basis. So it's a very different model than historically, which was more tied toward just circuits."

Today, I will make a few comments about our results and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance.
First, I am very pleased with the top line improvements we have accomplished this year. Our goal over the past few years was to transform our business to achieve revenue and cash flow growth. 
Given our shifting revenue mix, success-based capital investments and expected deal synergies, we are on the verge of showing growth in both of these areas. 
Our activity level is high, and we have made progress on a number of fronts, including business sales momentum, data center expansion, fiber-to-the-tower builds and integration. Importantly, we are seeing the benefits of this transformation and have created the unique opportunity to provide our investors with a combination of both growth and yield. 
In the quarter, our business and consumer service revenue trends were in line with our expectations. On the cost side, our expenses are running slightly higher than normal, given all the activities in anticipation of the PAETEC integration, as well as increased activity around capital projects. I'm very confident that we will achieve or exceed our targeted synergies, which will result in nice improvement in adjusted OIBDA trend next year. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives. In early August, we announced a transaction to acquire PAETEC. This is a great strategic combination for us and advances our strategy to expand our business and broadband services which drive top line growth. In fact, following the PAETEC deal, roughly 70% of our revenues will come from business and broadband. The combined company will have a nationwide network, with a deep fiber footprint of 100,000 fiber route miles, which will expand our capabilities in strategic growth areas and allow us to improve our cost structure by moving more traffic onto our own network. 
In addition, this transaction offers attractive financial benefit, including approximately $110 million in annual operating and capital synergies and provides meaningful tax benefits. We have received Hart-Scott-Rodino approval, and the PAETEC shareholders voted to approve the deal last week. At this point, we are awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission and several state public service commissions and expect the transaction to close before the end of this year. 
Since this announcement, we've been encouraged with the opportunities we see ahead for our combined company, which reinforces our belief that PAETEC will create significant value for our shareholders and make Windstream a force in the enterprise space on a national level. 
Turning to our other key initiatives for 2011, which include completing our integration activity, deleveraging the balance sheet and investing capital for future growth. 
First, as I mentioned last quarter, we are largely complete with the integration activities for deals that closed in 2010. In fact, our efforts over the past couple of months have centered around planning for the upcoming PAETEC transaction, and I am pleased with where we are at in this process. 
Second, we've improved our capital structure this year to yield significant cash interest savings going forward, and we are committed to reducing our leverage to our historical range of 3.2x to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA. 
Finally, we are making great progress with our success-based capital investments, including expanding our data center operations and deploying fiber to the tower to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities. 
As Brent will discuss shortly, our wireless partners are aggressively building their 4G wireless networks and accelerating their deployment plan, resulting in significantly more tower projects than we initially planned. And as we have said before, these are absolutely investments that we are eager to make. It is important that we take advantage of this rare and time-sensitive opportunity to achieve highly attractive returns from growth in the wireless industry. 
Turning to the regulatory front. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a plan to modernize its intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. We have long supported the need for these reforms and have worked extensively within the industry to achieve a rational result. 
The detailed order has not been released yet, but based on what the FCC has announced so far, the intercarrier compensation transitions outlined by the commission appear to provide a manageable path to the future bill-and-keep environment, with reasonable opportunities to recover a majority of the revenue losses resulting from the elimination of access charges over time. Additionally, IP traffic will be compensable and phantom traffic should be eliminated. 
With regards to universal service funding, we have supported moving future funding to an efficient, forward-looking model and repositioning USF to drive broadband expansion in high-cost areas. The FCC has also said it will make additional funding available to us in the first year of their plan to further expand broadband service availability in high-cost rural areas that remain uneconomic to serve. 
While the plan outlined differs from the ABC plan that we submitted, along with others in our industry, we believe the results will be manageable and, importantly, are encouraged that this reform will provide meaningful certainty to our business model going forward. We will continue working with the FCC and the industry as the commission works to finalize the reforms of the universal service fund. Going forward, we will remain -- we will be mindful of strategic opportunities, particularly those that advance our strategy around top-line growth. In the near term however, we will be very focused on completing the PAETEC integration, achieving our targeted synergies and making more improvement in our core business that lead to better top line and cash flow trends. Simply stated, over the next several months, we are squarely focused on execution and integration. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."

Our third quarter operational results were in line with our expectations, and we continue to see nice growth in our business channel, accompanied with very steady performance in our consumer business. In the bus",778,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter operational results were in line with our expectations, and we continue to see nice growth in our business channel, accompanied with very steady performance in our consumer business. 
In the business channel, revenues increased by 2.3% year-over-year, driven by a variety of factors, including growth in our strategic services and improved focus on servicing our business customers. Organizationally, we have made great strides and have added resources in sales and service delivery to improve our focus and execution in the business channel. We are seeing very nice productivity gains in all of the sales channels that support our business customers, and we have been successful selling higher ARPU services. 
In addition, we have developed a more robust product suite, tailored around IP services to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise space. For example, we've seen great success selling MPLS services, virtual LAN services and dedicated Internet access, and we are seeing nice growth in our data center services. We continue to see circuit growth from wireless backhaul demand, which has led to consistent growth in special access revenues. 
In the consumer channel, we added approximately 8,500 high-speed Internet customers, growing our total subscribers by 4.4% year-over-year and increasing our penetration to 65% of primary residential lines. Consumer broadband revenue grew 7% year-over-year, driven by customer growth and sales of broadband features.
Video customers increased by 5,500 units, bringing our total video customer base to 449,000, an increase of 4% year-over-year. 
Consumer access lines declined 4.6% year-over-year, which was flat sequentially. Total access lines declined 3.9% year-over-year, which was up 30 basis points sequentially, but importantly, this increase relates entirely to one wholesale customer and will have very little financial impact.
Turning to our integration efforts. As a reminder, we have largely completed the activities related to our previous transactions. At this time, we are focused on preparing to close the PAETEC acquisition, and our integration teams are in place and working through project plans alongside PAETEC, who has been very helpful throughout this process. Our team has a great deal of integration experience, and I'm confident that we will successfully integrate PAETEC and achieve the targeted synergies. 
As we have learned in past deals, we have many opportunities to extract the best practices from each organization and leverage those across the entire platform, and PAETEC has done many things well, and we look forward to them being the part of the Windstream family.
As Jeff mentioned, we have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives this year. Given the demand for wireless backhaul and Windstream's successful track record of delivering these services, our opportunities to make fiber-to-the-tower investments are abundant, and we believe that these are important investments for the future. 
When we started this year, given the rural nature of many of our markets, we expect to deploy fiber to less than 50% of the towers within our ILEC footprint over the course of 2011 and 2012. Today, however, given the growing bandwidth needs being fueled by explosive data growth, wireless carriers have aggressively accelerated their fiber deployment plans and significantly increased the number of towers targeted for fiber. As a result, we now expect to roll out fiber to nearly 90% of the towers within our ILEC footprint by the end of 2012. 
We are also having a high level of success winning sites outside of our ILEC territory. Importantly, all of these investments are success-based and secure with 5-to-7-year contracts that drive attractive returns in excess of our cost of capital. 
Furthermore, although we have not yet realized much revenue from these investments given the average 12-month investment cycle, on the few sites that we have turned on, we are encouraged by the demand for incremental capacity we are already seeing. As a reminder, we price these services on a per meg basis and thus, additional capacity drives incremental revenues at very attractive margins with little to no capital requirements. 
Additionally, during the third quarter, we increased broadband speeds to residential and business customers that can now offer 12 meg service to over 40% of our footprint and 24 meg service in our most competitive markets. We expanded our Raleigh data center to increase the floor space by 10,000 square feet to keep up with the rapidly growing customer base and demand for cloud-based services. 
Finally, work is underway on several of our broadband stimulus projects. These investments all offer exciting opportunities to continue growing our strategic areas of focus and better position the business for future success. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who's going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,141455287,186471,"Windstream Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.023 billion, operating income of $267 million and $0.14 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $13 millio",919,"Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.023 billion, operating income of $267 million and $0.14 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $13 million in after-tax merger and integration costs and $13 million tax-effected loss on early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Windstream achieved total revenues of $1.023 billion, a decline of 1%. Specifically, business service revenues increased $11 million or 2%, while consumer service revenues declined by $11 million or 3%. Our wholesale revenues declined $17 million or 10% due in part to challenging year-over-year comparisons. Total product sales were up $2 million. 
Let me discuss the revenue trends by category. Data and integrated solutions increased $21 million or 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in IP, nex-gen data and data center services. Special access revenues increased $7 million or 5% due to circuit growth from increased demand for wireless backhaul. This quarter, our special access revenues reflect credits for incremental volume discounts, some of which is not recurring. As we look forward, we expect special access growth rates to accelerate from this level, as we begin to realize revenues associated with our fiber-to-the-tower investments. 
Voice and long distance revenues declined by $27 million or 7% year-over-year due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. Switched access and USF revenues declined $14 million year-over-year or 9%, primarily related to fewer minutes of use, an unfavorable cost study true up this quarter and higher USF state revenues recorded in the third quarter of 2010. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $11 million or 2% year-over-year and were down $7 million, excluding pension costs. 
Specifically by category, on a year-over-year basis, cost of services was down $8 million due largely to lower benefit costs, lower bad debt expense and incremental synergies, offset somewhat by higher interconnect charges related to circuit growth, higher fuel expenses and storm-related costs. Cost of products sold increased by $2 million due to slightly higher product sales. 
Within SG&A, expenses decreased $5 million or 4% year-over-year due largely to lower benefit costs and incremental deal synergies. Sequentially, total revenues declined $7 million due largely to the wholesale revenue declines I mentioned earlier, and our cash cost declined by $3 million. 
For the quarter, OIBDA was $490 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year and adjusted OIBDA was $508 million, a decline of 1% year-over-year as well. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 49.6%. 
This quarter, we spent $178 million on capital expenditures, which was largely related to our growth initiatives, including fiber-to-the-tower projects, data center expansions and enhancing the capabilities of our broadband network. 
Given our success winning more fiber-to-the-tower contracts, combined with our wireless partners' desire to accelerate deployments of these projects, it is likely that we will modestly exceed the high end of our guidance range in capital spend this year, although weather will be a significant factor in our fourth quarter capital spend. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we refinanced $350 million on our 2016 notes with revolver proceeds, which will help lower our interest costs going forward. We also contributed 5.9 million shares to our pension plan to address the remaining small contribution required in October of this year, as well as our projected contributions required in 2012. 
Looking to 2012, we are very pleased with how we have positioned our company. We have made great strides expanding our focus on the growth drivers in our business, which, combined with our success-based capital investments, should result in further improvements in our revenue trends. Additionally, with the synergies from the PAETEC transaction, we expect accelerated growth in adjusted OIBDA. 
This year, our capital spend has been higher than normal due largely to our fiber-to-the-tower investments, which will total between $100 million and $125 million. Given the significant increase in the number of tower projects we now expect to complete, we will likely spend $75 million to $125 million more on fiber investments next year as compared to 2011. We also plan to spend $50 million in capital next year related to the stimulus projects that we were awarded. Recall that Windstream's total out-of-pocket capital related to these projects will total $60 million. We expect our capital investments to return to more normalized levels in 2013 and beyond, given that the fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus investments should be substantially complete. Importantly, our cash flows will benefit from the significant reductions to Windstream's legacy cash interest of roughly $80 million in 2012 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to receive a slight refund in cash taxes in 2012 due to the 50% bonus depreciation rules and other tax-saving initiatives. Thus, we are in a great position to finance these success-based investment opportunities.
As is customary for us, we will provide specific guidance details in February 2012, and we expect our guidance to include PAETEC, given the deal should close by year end. 
In summary, while we have several moving parts, the steps we are taking to continue transforming this business will derive higher revenue and adjusted OIBDA and provide security to one of the most attractive dividend yields in the S&P 500. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sam, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

And then the second thing is are you basically implying with the CapEx commentary that if you take the incremental stimulus and you take the amount incrementally on fiber to the cell that CapEx just from a base-case perspective could be up between $115 million to $165 million next year, or are there other offsets to the CapEx that would bring that down?"

I'll start with your first question in regard to one-time items. You're correct. We do have a couple one-time items in the revenue outlined this quarter, specifically in the wholesale revenue streams in USF. We had $2 million to $3 million of unfavorable cost study true ups and other adjustments. And in special access, as I talked about that, which goes to business services, we had an unfavorable adjustment of roughly $2 million this quarter, which is nonrecurring. So when you think about that, that was really a customer ultimately you landed in a higher tier or received a higher discount. So from base line, we're still seeing that great demand that Brent spoke to on the special access side, and it just resulted in a hiccup here in the third quarter. Turning to capital, we are -- as we look at our capital for 2012, we think this is a unique opportunity for us to make success-based capital investments that we spoke to on fiber to the tower. Combined with the stimulus spend, we were going to make in the 2012, we do believe capital will go up in 2012 similar to how I think you were surmising, which I talked about, as the increase of fiber-to-the-tower of roughly $75 million to $125 million and the increase in stimulus of $60 million. But importantly, as you look forward,  we expect the CapEx to decline in 2013 as the success-based capital investments are largely complete. And importantly, we make these investments because they change the trajectory of our business. They continue to drive revenue higher and also, adjusted OIBDA higher. And importantly in 2012, the other commentary I gave was in regards to cash interest and cash taxes. It's very fortuitous for us that we're making these capital investments in a time when our cash taxes will in fact be very low in 2012. Well, in fact, we'll be in a refund position. And we've been very busy on the balance sheet this year, and we expect to achieve $80 million in cash, interest savings year-over-year. So we look at these investments and, coupled with the other offset in cash interest to cash taxes, we're very comfortable with how the company is positioned in 2012, and we expect at 2013 for CapEx to come back down to more normalized levels."

But as you think about kind of our broadband business, as I kind of mentioned, 2 key things to think about: one, we've got 65% penetration; and two, a dominant market share because of our success over these years.

In terms of business net adds on maybe the special access circuits that you're mentioning, we did see a slowdown in what I call traditional TDM circuit adds during the quarter. Not surprisingly, given so much of our effort is focused on rolling out ethernet fiber services to those carriers. They've added a great deal of capacity on the TDM side earlier this year just in preparation for what was coming. That slowed because we are nearing the point in Q4 and certainly heading into 2012 where we'll begin to turn on a significant number of those towers. In terms of advanced data and integration, just overall customer account there is really more a function of declines in older and mature services. We continue to see very nice momentum in terms of our data and integrated product sales, and you see that showing up in the revenue line item there as well.

Our return expectations have stayed steady. It's really a function of a couple of things. Number one, an effort by us to really lock up our franchise and territory. We had great relationships in terms of service with those carriers for a number of years, and the last thing we wanted as part of this effort was to see a lot more competition in our ILEC franchise. So we worked to lock up of that base and have done so with, what I'll say, market prices that have stayed stable this year. Secondly, the carriers have been, as we kind of indicated, much more aggressive about rolling out fiber to the tower this year, even in rural areas. And that's a function of the competition in the wireless space, and we're seeing that show up as you -- as I kind of talked to earlier, actually, a lot of circuit growth early in the year, and they need more capacity. And we're working to deliver that right now. The second element of that really for us has been in areas outside of our footprint, trying to win business in markets that also offer CLEC expansion opportunities, yet the business case pays for itself alone with just the fiber to the tower. And secondly, because of the KDL transaction, we picked up fiber all over the place. But to the extent we can leverage fiber and towers close to that fiber, we wanted to win that business as well, and it's literally just been a function of more success than we counted on that yielded those results. But as Tony kind of indicated in his numbers, I mean, what a perfect time to spend the capital because of the reasons he shared. And we know that in terms of the revenue growth we've seen year-to-date on special access has been 7% year-over-year if you look year-to-date through the third quarter, and we want to see that continue in the future."

We don't see a mass migration in the short-term because of the capacity reasons we shared from those TDM services. There will be a gradual turn down of that. But at the same time, the way we've priced these contracts, they're on a per meg basis. And as you begin to turn that down, the revenue accelerates, helping offset that, because you're charging for that on a bandwidth usage basis. So it's a very different model than historically, which was more tied toward just circuits."
